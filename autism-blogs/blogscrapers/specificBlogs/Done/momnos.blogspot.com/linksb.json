It was peaceful, and just as it should have been - though, of course, it was not at all as it should have been. \n \nHis mom, Gretchen, posted the news with this beautiful graphic: \n \n \n \n \nHer grace continues to astound me. \n \nI have spent the past two weeks thinking of that small, quiet room - being grateful for it. As Gretchen has since explained, Henry's family has been grieving for a year, since his tumor was diagnosed. They have been through all of Kubler-Ross's stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and, now, acceptance. \n \nFor me, half a country away, even with regular updates from Gretchen, it was easy to stay in denial. Even when I knew there was nothing else to be done, I continued to think that  something  would happen to change the inevitable outcome. \n \nIt didn't, of course, and so I have made the leap from denial into anger. \n \nI keep going back to  this post from 2008 . Our friend Vicki had just lost her son, Evan, and our blogging community was reeling. I realized for the first time how much these people who lived in my computer meant to me, and how emotionally vulnerable it made me. I wrote, Gretchen commented, we all grieved. But, of course, we had no idea that we would find ourselves here eight years later. \n \nBack in 2008, as I reflected on our friendships and interdependence in the aftermath of Evan's loss, I wrote,  \" Now, suddenly, coexisting with the vulnerability, there is strength; with the fear, there is assurance; with the grief, there is joy.\" \u00a0I'm struggling to find that balance now that we've lost Henry. I know they must be there somewhere - the strength, the assurance, the joy. But I'm just not able to be philosophical yet. For now, it just feels completely unfair. For now, I am just really, really angry.\u00a0 And anger is a vast, echoing cavern. \n \n The only thing that is\u00a0tempering that anger right now is love - love for Henry, love for Gretchen and the rest of her family, and love for my blogging friends as we continue to hold each other up through our darkest times. I am grateful for you, friends, and thankful to have a community that will gather in support, whether in vast caverns or quiet rooms. \n \n And Gretchen, I hope you know how much you are loved, and how much Henry is missed. We will be always be here for you, and we will always remember, and celebrate, him. \n \n (The quote that appears in the graphic is from Cheryl Strayed.) \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3kvhxRqizl0/Vzd1KZJXJAI/AAAAAAAABDo/Jfm5JsAOOcEjiJ2K6E-x82nD0qT8eHJvgCK4B/s1600/13103332_10153921547476321_2930317028372485820_n.jpg"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2016/05/anger-acceptance-and-space-between.html", "title": "\nAnger, acceptance, and the space between\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 03, 2016", "body": "\nBud asked if I would share something with you. \n \nHe wanted you to know that he's made a new version of the PowerPoint I described in my last post - the one in which he created a live action version of Curious George, The Movie. In honesty, the current version is similar to the former - it remains true to the original storyline and Bud continues to act in the role of Ted Shackleford, The Man With The Yellow Hat. The big change - and, I suspect, the one Bud wants you to know about - is that the role of Ted's love interest Maggie has been recast. Geena Davis will no longer be appearing in the film. Now, performing opposite Bud is the lovely Susan Sarandon. \n \nI told Bud that you might not know the plot of Curious George, The Movie, and I asked him to write something out to explain it to you. He sat down and produced the narrative that I've pasted below. As I've said, the storyline is true to the original, but the rest - the wording, the punctuation, the sequencing, the cause and effect, the ability to tell a linear story, the naming of emotion, the identification of a character's motivation - the whole dang rest of it - is entirely Bud's own. \n \nLadies and gentlemen, I give you Curious George, The Movie: Live Action, starring Bud as Ted Shackleford, The Man With The Yellow Hat, Susan Sarandon as his love interest Maggie Dunlop, and Curious George as Himself. \n \n \nIt all started in the African Jungle. George was looking for\nsomeone to play with. \n \nHe wondered if he put a crocodile egg in a bird\u2019s nest he\nwondered if a chameleon can change too many colors and he wondered if he used\npomegranate juice to paint his baby animal friends. \n \nI was going to be Ted. \n \nAnd Susan Sarandon was going to be my love struck Maggie. \n \nI gave Maggie and her class a tour at the Bloomsberry\nMuseum. \n \nMr. Bloomsberry wanted to find Zagawa but he forgotten \u00a0  something he\u2019s very old. \n \nI found George \u00a0  I said\nthis was fun but I got to go. \n \nGeorge decided to tag along. \n \nAnd he found crates of fresh fruits like bananas. \n \nAnd then he was lost in the city. \n \nI put George inside my bathroom so he wouldn\u2019t get caught by\nIvan the \u00a0  Doorman. \n \nAlthough I was not allowed to have pets in my apartment. \n \nSo I took George to the Bloomsberry Museum. \n \nBut George found a dinosaur skeleton and he broke the bones\nof it. \n \nSo I decided to call the Animal Control Receptionist. \n \nThen I took George to the Park. \n \nThe Next morning I took George to the zoo where I met Maggie\nand her class. \n \nShe said So how long have you had a monkey? \n \nMaggie\u2019s class said Mr. Ted what\u2019s your monkey\u2019s name? \n \nI said he doesn\u2019t have a name. \n \nAnd then I said well then call him George. \n \nAnd George found a bunch of balloons and he was floating\naway. \n \nAnd I have to save him! \n \nAnd then I was at Clovis\u2019 office he told me he had a big\nidea he invented a robotic dog named Sparky and a robotic baby elephant named\nSoaky and he invented some food called Boomcorn he said it\u2019s for really big\nsleepovers for kids. \n \nAnd I decided to borrow a truck and George pulled a lever\nand he was really-really big he was scaring all the people in the city And I\nwas seeing multiple violations rules of the road. \n \nI took George to the Bloomsberry Museum again. \n \nBut I thought it was closed forever. \n \nTwo Monkey catchers came and took George back to Africa. \n \nAnd I really missed him. \n \nBut I found a man in a monkey suit. \n \nMaggie said to me Ted I\u2019ve been looking for you. \n \nI\u2019m off to save George. \n \nI went back to Africa to find George and then find Zagawa\nidol. \n \nI came back to the Bloomsberry Museum and opened a\nchildren\u2019s play area for kids and I had Maggie opening the gate and her class\nwent to play in their very own Bloomsberry Children\u2019s Museum. \n \nMy Next adventure was in a rocket to outer space. \n \nBut George wanted to steer the rocket too he thinks it\u2019s\nfun. \n \nBut not for me I will get dizzy. \nWhew! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2016/07/curious-george-redux.html", "title": "\nCurious George, Redux\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, May 26, 2016", "body": "\nAs you may know, these days, before I post about Bud, I get his permission. There is a downside to this. Sometimes, as was the case with this particular post, Bud readily agrees to the idea - and then, he expects me to produce. I mentioned this post to him more than a week ago, and he has asked me daily if it's written yet. To his credit, he's trying not to badger, so for the past few days I've been getting a lot of, \"So, Mom, how's that blogspot coming along?\" \n \nSo, okay. Here it is, Bud. \n \nI have written before about Bud's PowerPoints and other computer-based projects. When I\u00a0 talked about them back in October , I wrote,\u00a0 \" Now, when Bud works with his treasured programs, he researches. He investigates. He catalogs. He transcribes. He narrates. He documents.\" Seven months later, he still does all of those things. But recently, his repertoire has expanded.\u00a0 \n Actually, it has exploded. \n Now, in addition to being a historian and archivist, Bud has become a creative artist. \n In his latest\u00a0 project, Bud has been creating new soundtracks and video montages for the movie Stuart Little 2. He is using music by Jack Johnson that originally appeared on the soundtrack to Curious George. In this project, Bud seeks out scenes and images from Stuart Little that he believes are a good fit for the particular song he's working with. In a carefully orchestrated production, he streams his selected music through Spotify, plays the DVD on his laptop, and films the new sequence with his iPod touch. \n He is very, very proud of these brand new, never-before-seen, never-before-IMAGINED creative works. He would like me to show them to you, and I would love to do so, if it wouldn't violate about ten different copyright laws. \n Bud has also created a series of PowerPoints in which he has sketched out new soundtracks for other movies as well. He has, for example, reimagined Little Women as a musical, and has created a soundtrack using the songs from Bedknobs and Broomsticks. (Now THAT takes imagination!) \n His creativity and imagination have spurred on project after project. Bud has created storyboards in PowerPoint for \"deleted scenes\" from favorite movies - scenes that were not actually in the movie, but that he believes should have been. Sometimes they incorporate dialogue or\u00a0storylines from other favorite movies, as seen through the lens of the new movie's\u00a0 characters. \n Bud has also used his imagination to recast movies with actors he'd like to see in favorite roles, creating \"live action\" versions of animated movies. In his live action version of Curious George, he has cast himself in the role of Ted, The Man With the Yellow Hat, and has cast Geena Davis (a particular favorite) in the role of his love interest, Maggie Dunlop. (Bud would like me to add that he kept Dick Van Dyke - another favorite - in the live-action role of Mr. Bloomsberry, \"the kind and beloved elderly museum owner,\" the character he voiced in the animated film.) \n It's exciting to see Bud's enthusiasm as he thinks of new ideas and envisions new creations - as he steps away from the safety of the known and the familiar and discovers the thrill of the new and\u00a0the different. \n In Bud's IEP this year, we wrote that we \"would like to help him expand his cognitive abilities - to make connections, to think about cause and effect, to ask and answer 'why' questions, to consider ideas, to imagine things, and to move beyond concrete, literal thinking.\" \n I'd have to say that he's well on his way. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2016/05/producer-director-creative-artist.html", "title": "\nProducer, Director, Creative Artist\n"},

I have to admit, I'm not entirely surprised. As I think we've discussed before, Bud typically struggles after the Daylight Saving Time change. I'm not sure if it's because his body is adjusting to meds at a new time, or because he's having sleep disturbances related to the time shift, or because he's feeling dissonance from being asked to do one thing when his biological clock is telling him that it's time to do another. I suspect it's probably a combination of all of that. \n \n \n \nWhatever the reason, whether we gain an hour or lose an hour, it's inevitably dysregulating for Bud.

{"date": "Saturday, April 02, 2016", "body": "\n It's April 2, the day that the United Nations has designated World Autism Awareness Day. My social media feeds are buzzing with blue lights and puzzle pieces. I've chosen to avoid these particular icons, because I believe they have more to do with brand awareness than with autism awareness, and the corporate-aligned brand they represent is one that runs counter to many of the things I believe strongly. \n \n I'm all in with the UN, however. Their theme for World Autism Awareness Day 2016 is \"Autism and the 2030 Agenda: Inclusion and Neurodiversity.\"  Their website  reads: \n \n Autism and other forms of disability are part of the human experience that contributes to human diversity. As such, the United Nations has emphasized the need to mainstream disability in the Organization\u2019s development agenda. Mainstreaming disability requires an integral approach in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres, so that inequality is not perpetuated. \n \n It also features a quote from UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon:\u00a0 \"On this World Autism Awareness Day, I call for advancing the rights of individuals with autism and ensuring their full participation and inclusion as valued members of our diverse human family who can contribute to a future of dignity and opportunity for all.\" \n \n Now, that's the kind of autism awareness I can get behind. In fact, it is much more in keeping with the philosophy of the Autistic Self\u00a0Advocacy Network's\u00a0 Autism Acceptance Month \u00a0movement, whose website has a \"f ocus on sharing positive, respectful, and accurate information about autism and autistic people,\" \u00a0than with that of Autism Speaks, which has both a much larger platform and an Awareness Day website full of pathologizing words like \"diagnosis,\" \"symptoms,\" \"treatment,\" and \"prevalence.\" \n \n Around here, we are on the Acceptance bandwagon, and we try to implement ASAN's Autism Acceptance Month slogan, \"Acceptance is an action.\" \n \n Acceptance starts with awareness, of course. Just this week, we had an\u00a0experience that quite literally brought the idea home, and highlighted the importance of all of it: awareness, acceptance, advocacy, and action. \n \n Monday afternoon I was at work, and my phone rang. It was Bud. He had just gotten home from school and he was sad. Not dysregulated. Sad. He was thoughtful and articulate and he was calling because there was something that he wanted to talk about. \n \n \"I didn't have a very good day at school,\" he said. \n \n I asked what happened, and he explained that this week is Winter Carnival Week. \"But I didn't KNOW it was Winter Carnival Week,\" he said, a hint of anxiety creeping into his voice. I understood what was unspoken in his words -  \"fun\" days at school are rarely fun for Bud , especially if he doesn't see them coming. \n \n He said that he got in trouble for running away from the talent show assembly in the auditorium, and said that his teacher was \"very cross\" with him. Running away - bolting from his classroom and, sometimes, from the school itself when his \"fight or flight\" defenses are triggered - has been an ongoing safety concern. \n \n \"But I didn't try to run away,\" he explained. \"I tried to get back to Gateway.\" \"Gateway\" is Bud's home base - his safe haven - his shelter from the storm at the high school. \n \n I asked what bothered him at the talent show, and he explained that it was \"all the noises.\" I asked what happened next and he said he burst into tears. \n \n My heart broke. From his version of the story, the scenario was clear to me. The auditorium, on this first day of Winter Carnival, was a sensory nightmare for Bud. His brain sent the \"danger\" signal to his body. He was overwhelmed. He had to get out. \n \n I asked who was with him in the auditorium and he named one of the paraeducators. I asked if he told her that all the noises were bothering him. He answered, \"Yes, but she said, 'you're going to love it.' She didn't answer me.\" \n \n My heart broke again. He did what we've been telling him to do. He advocated for himself. He told someone what he needed. And it didn't work. \n \n Bud knew - as I knew - that staying in the noisy auditorium was not an option for him. Had he stayed, the issues would have escalated. He needed to leave, so he left and he headed to the place he's been told is his safe space. On the way, he encountered another teacher who did not have the context for the current situation, but was aware of the ongoing issues involving \"running away.\" \n \n Bud told me that he got in trouble, and he worried about what his teacher thought. \"I don't think she'll be very happy to see me tomorrow,\" he said, scripting, but nailing his emotions in the words. \"Maybe if I apologize,\" he said. \n \n I told him that if he said or did anything rude or mean, then an apology was important. But, I said, if he was doing his best, and doing what he had been told to do, then it was more important to talk about that - to find out what he could have done differently to not \"get in trouble.\" I asked him if he'd like me to email his teacher to explain what he told me and ask her if she would talk to him about it the next day so that they could come up with a plan. \n \n The relief in his voice on the other end of the phone was palpable. \"That would be perfect,\" he said. \n \n I sat down and wrote to Bud's teacher, recounting Bud's version of the day in much the same way that I've recounted it here. I asked if there was an alternate version of what had gone on, and I explained that, from my perspective, Bud was sincerely confused by what had happened. He genuinely wanted to talk about the fact that he'd wanted to do the right thing, but that it ended up being the wrong thing, and in the end it had ruined his day. \n \n I told her that, to me, the issues at the core of this situation were sensory overload, recognizing his own reactions to outside stimulus, and self-advocating appropriately for what he needs. \"I think,\" I wrote, \"that he truly wants to know what the right response would have been, given that staying at the talent show was simply not an option for him.\" \n \n Bud's teacher replied to me the next day, after she'd spoken to Bud. The incident, she said, was \"all staff error.\" She apologized, and acknowledged that though we all try to do our best, we sometimes miss the mark. In this case, Bud was not offered the support he needed, when he'd clearly expressed that need.\u00a0 Her conversation to process the incident with Bud had been a good one, she said, and they'd developed a plan together. \n \n The rest of Winter Carnival week went off without a hitch. Bud knew what to expect and he made his choices accordingly. On America day, he decided to wear orange instead of red, white, and blue, \"because I like orange.\" (And what, I ask you, is a better way to celebrate the American spirit than to exercise our individual rights?) He was back in a crowded environment on Friday for obstacle course relay races, which he thoroughly enjoyed. (He was invited to participate, but declined. He preferred the role of spectator.) \n \n So, there it was, all in one week: awareness, acceptance, advocacy, action. \n \n It started with the awareness that\u00a0because he is autistic, highly stimulating environments filled with multi-sensory input -\u00a0especially those he does not anticipate - can be overwhelming to Bud. \n \n That awareness was followed by acceptance - the understanding that this sensory reaction is not wrong, not bad, not something that must be corrected. It is simply something that is a part of Bud - something that needs support and accommodation. \n \n And advocacy - Bud was a CHAMPION of self-advocacy this week. Right there, in the moment on Monday, in the midst of sensory integration issues, Bud advocated for himself. When his needs went unmet, he assessed his options, and made a choice. When it didn't work out the way he'd anticipated, he didn't simply accept that he had done something wrong. He furthered the conversation. He explained his rationale. He asked for clarification. He articulated his needs - and it worked. \n \n And then the action. That's the key, right? Acceptance is an action. Bud took action. I took action. The staff at school took action. We all learned something, and most importantly, Bud was empowered and his perspective was respected and reinforced. We listened to him, and we worked with him, and he got to experience the rest of Winter Carnival independently and in a\u00a0self-directed way, with the supports he needed to make it happen. \n \nAnd one other piece of action. Before I started writing this post, I asked Bud about it - as I do now every time I want to write about him. I told him that I'd like to tell this story on my blog. I told him I hoped that it would remind people to listen when autistic people tell them what they need - to listen, and then to act, and help them get those things. I told him that I wanted to check with him to make sure it was okay for me to write about it. And then I asked him what he thought. \n \nHe answered without hesitation: \"I think that would be great.\" \n \nAwareness. Acceptance. Advocacy. Action. \n \nLet's make it a good April. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.un.org/en/events/autismday/", "http://www.autismacceptancemonth.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2016/04/awareness-acceptance-advocacy-action.html", "title": "\nAwareness, acceptance, advocacy, action\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 07, 2016", "body": "\nI started writing this blog in 2005, the year Bud started Kindergarten. In the early years, I wrote a lot about his experience at school. Our school district uses an inclusion model, and so throughout elementary school, Bud was the only autistic child in his classes. Though inclusion is not the right model for every child, it was wonderful for Bud - and, as I wrote frequently in those years, it was also wonderful for his non-autistic classmates. \n \nThroughout his elementary school years, I often wrote about those classmates - always using pseudonyms and removing identifying information. Some of them made reappearances from year to year. But one of them stood out from all the others and appeared on the pages of this blog again and again and again: Kelly. \n \nKelly and Bud met in  first grade , when  my anxiety  about sending Bud off into the hands of strangers for a full day was at an all-time high. They\u00a0 bonded immediately . I cringe now when I read my posts from that year and see how flippant I was about the bond they were building. I considered it  puppy love , failing to recognize that these two, even at six years old, were already savvy enough to be doing the work they needed to do to build the solid foundation for a lasting friendship. \n \nThe summer after first grade, when, unbeknownst to Kelly, Bud's world was being rocked by his father and me separating and then divorcing, Kelly reached out to Bud - a friend,  touching base and connecting . \n \nIn second grade, it was  an interaction with Kelly  that made Bud concerned that his friend was upset with him, until he learned that it was not  as serious as he'd believed . It was Kelly who sought him out on a class field trip, and Kelly who  prompted me to write ,  \"Inclusive education recognizes that it takes a village to raise a child.\n It recognizes that Kelly and Tom and the other children in the class \nare an important part of the village that is raising Bud. And - more to \nthe point - it recognizes that Bud is an important part of the village \nthat is raising Kelly and Tom and the other children in the class. They \nneed each other, and they know it.\" \n \nKelly sent Bud off for the summer before third grade with  another letter , and while she didn't appear much on the blog that year (as there were not many blog posts written that year), she reemerged with a vengeance in fourth grade, when she was part of the magical class that started the year helping Bud  celebrate his tenth birthday  (with Kelly writing a note that said \"You are one of my best friends\") and ended the year so committed to understanding Bud that they prompted  the Hairdryer Kid series . \n \nAfter that series, aware that Bud's peers knew about my blog and knew it was about him, I wrote sparingly about school, but despite her absence from the blog, Kelly continued to be a major player in Bud's world. As they transitioned to middle school - a much larger school, with a greater number of children - Bud and Kelly saw each other less frequently. We still looked for Kelly and her family, though, at every orientation session and every open house - the friendly faces in the crowd, the ones always quick to greet us and always happy to see us. Several years into middle school, Kelly's mom contacted me. Kelly had witnessed an interaction between Bud and another person at school that hadn't seemed right to her, and they wanted to pass the information on to me. It didn't seem right to me either, and thanks to Kelly, I was able to intervene before the problem got any worse. \n \nAt the end of eighth grade, when Kelly and the rest of Bud's peers prepared to transition to high school, we made the decision to have Bud spend a year doing some  sideways growth  (another story for another time, since it's worthy of its own blog post). Bud did spend some time at the high school that year, though, and virtually every time he did, among the questions asked (by me) and answered (by him) were, \"Did you see any kids you know? Did you see Kelly?\" \n \nThis past summer, as Bud prepared to transition to the high school full time, and as I kick-started the blog again, Kelly sent me an email, congratulating me on my marriage and letting me know that she missed seeing Bud. She wanted me to know how much of an impact he'd had on her and on how she sees the world. She wrote, \"I've learned so much from him without him even knowing.\" \n \nA short time later, Kelly transferred to a different school, so even though they would have been in different grades anyway, they no longer had the opportunity to even run into each other in the hallway. And then, a few weeks ago, I got an email from Kelly's mom. Kelly's sixteenth birthday was coming up, and she wondered if we could come. \n \nBud is typically not much of a party guy, so I didn't want to answer on his behalf. Later that day, I asked him about, and without hesitation, without missing a beat, he answered, \"Oh, sure! I would love to!\" \n \nSo, last week, Bud and I headed out one evening to Kelly's house for her birthday party. I thought we'd probably be there briefly, but, as is so often the case, my assumption was wrong. Bud was delighted to be there. And Kelly was delighted to have us there. Her mom decided to surprise her and didn't tell her we were coming, and when she opened the door and saw us, she said, \"I think I'm going to cry!\" \n \nIt was a wonderful evening. Bud made comfortable conversation with Kelly and her other guests. He met her pet rabbit. We ate dinner and snacks and took pictures, and marveled at the beautiful cakes, cookies, and cupcakes that Kelly's mom had made - with hand-detailed images of Kelly's favorite characters from Japanese animation. And after we'd been there for a bit, I listened to the music playing in the background and realized that at some point, with no fanfare or announcement made, Kelly had changed the soundtrack from her own favorite music, Nirvana, to Bud's favorite music, Dierks Bentley. \n \nLater, as we drove home from the party, I thought about how far these two have come. For ten years, from six to sixteen, they have stood by each other, each allowing the other to become exactly who they are, free from judgment, free from expectation, and brimming with appreciation and support. That is exactly what friendship is supposed to be. \n \nMay the next ten years be filled with more of the same for both of them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://Inclusive education recognizes that it takes a village to raise a child.

It has been a long hard ten months, and Henry is very tired. So today, though I want you to continue to send him thoughts and prayers and a universe of good wishes, I don't want to talk to you about cancer. \n \nI just want to tell you about Henry. \n \nHenry and I have never been in a room together - we have never actually met - but I  know  him.\n I know him on a heart level, which in my world is the only level that \nreally matters. I love this boy more than I can possibly express. \n \nI was introduced to Henry when he and Bud were six years old. His mom Gretchen and I had both recently started blogging about our sons and their autism, and when I started reading about Henry, I felt like I'd found our tribe. \n \nBecause here's the thing: of all the children I have ever known, autistic or neurotypical, Henry is the one who always, consistently, beautifully, mindbogglingly reminds me most of Bud. Before I knew Henry, I'd encountered other kids on the spectrum, and though I saw glimmers of similarity and recognized areas of overlap, I'd never found anyone who was quite like Bud. Until\u00a0Henry. \n \nBy looking at Henry and seeing Bud, I was able to recognize that many of the things I'd written off as quirks unique to Bud were actually things that were related to his autism. I began to see that many of the things I might otherwise have labeled as issues or problems were, in reality, essential elements of who these boys were and of how they were wired. For the first time, I was able to recognize, by comparison, that my son was on a very typical path of development for his particular atypical brain. \n \nI met Gretchen and Henry in 2005, at a time when autism was just making \nits way into the popular press, mostly through dark stories weaving tales of misery and hopelessness and despair. In those days, if you were new to both autism and the just-emerging world of social media, it was easy to get distracted by misguided people trying to peddle \"cures\" or convince you that you needed to save your child through full-time models of compliance training and dangerous interventions like chelation. \n \nBut luckily, I found Gretchen and Henry, and as we compared notes, I felt empowered to reject the scare tactics and recognize that, really, at their core, our boys were just plain cool. And, before long, before we'd ever heard the word \"neurodiversity,\" we discovered a whole new paradigm for looking at autism. We discovered that it held gifts. And joy. And connection. \n \nAs I watched Bud and Henry progress in parallel, I was able to recognize milestones I might otherwise have missed, and I was able to see beauty in the smallest of movements. Because of Henry, I was able to view Bud, and Bud's autism, in a totally different way. \n \nFrom their earliest days, Henry helped me to see that both Bud's pronoun reversal - his \"you don't want to go to the playground\" when he didn't want to go to the playground - and his use of scripts from his most beloved tv shows and movies were important stepping stones on the path to language acquisition. \n \nHe helped me to understand that hands are important communication tools, and helped me to see that sometimes when people put their hands on their ears, it's not because they're trying to escape; it's because it helps them to engage. \n \nHenry helped me learn that there is power in choosing whether to frame something as an \"obsession\" or as a \"passion,\" and that respecting an individual means respecting his passion. (He also helped me to understand that DVD cases and the papers they contain are as important - and sometimes more important - than the material that's on the DVD itself.) \n \nHe helped me to learn to respect that to a  collector , there really IS a difference between the DVD you already have at home and the DVD of the same name that is begging to be checked out of the library. \n \nHe helped me to learn that challenging behavior is not a sign of a lack of progress, and that sometimes we need to take a step backward before we can move ahead. He helped me to learn the value of having space to regroup and time to develop. \n \n \n \nHenry has helped me learn and learn and learn.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIn the ten years that I've known him, Henry has made me laugh, made me cry, and made my heart soar. I am a better parent - a better person - because I know him. \n \nSo, here's what I need you to know. If I have ever written anything that has made you think about autism differently, offered a different perspective, or sparked a new idea, then Henry has had an impact on your life, too. My understanding of autism and my understanding of Bud are inextricably linked to Henry. Though he doesn't know it, Henry has given me a gift beyond compare. \n \nSo can you do me a favor and help me celebrate Henry right now? It doesn't matter how you do it - post a comment here, give a \"like\" or a \"love\" or a \"wow\" on Facebook, share this, write a post of your own, watch a Disney movie (Henry's favorite), or shout to the sky to give thanks for this boy. Just celebrate him powerfully - celebrate him long and loud and hard, until the earth starts shaking from the joy of it. \n \n \nI love you, Henry, and I always, always will. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2016/03/for-henry.html", "title": "\nFor Henry\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2016", "body": "\nBack in October, I published a post called \" From Raffi to the Wiggles: The power of sideways growth .\" In it, I referred to a piece written by autistic writer, speaker, and advocate Lydia Wayman. By describing her own developmental trajectory as \"growing sideways,\" Lydia not only provided a valuable lens through which I could view Bud's development, but she also gave me language that helped me explain it to others.  \n \nUnfortunately, the link in my post is no longer working, and the site that hosted Lydia's original essay is not currently operational. Lydia has graciously allowed me to post a revised and updated version of it here. (Thank you, Lydia!) It appears in its entirety below. \n \n \n Growing\nSideways \n \n \n \n As a\nyoung adult on the autism spectrum, I\u2019m a living paradox. \u00a0  I may have a master\u2019s degree and national\nrecognition for my autism advocacy, but, given the chance, I would choose any\nDisney movie over boring, typical adult movies, and discussions of home\ndecorating and husbands and fancy dinners hold my interest for\u2026 not long enough\nto even finish that sentence! While there may be other typical young adults out\nthere like me, I become a little more unique in that I love Hello Kitty, stickers,\ncoloring, and I refuse to carry a purse or wear make-up or high heels. I\u2019m used\nto the shock and \u201cI thought you were in high school!\u201d when someone finds out I\ngraduated over ten years ago. \u00a0\n Developmental delay is a common term for children, but I don\u2019t see a lot\nout there about our timeline as adults. The difference is evident in skills and\nindependence and many other ways, but one issue gets to me the most. Autistic\npeople of all ages sometimes have interests that normally appeal to people much\nyounger than our chronological age, and the idea of \u201cage-appropriate\u201d is almost\nenforced on us. I want to tell you that our interests may be different, but\nthat\u2019s not a bad thing! \n \n Typical\npeople follow a certain developmental trajectory. \u00a0  At six months, babies like pacifiers and\nblankies. \u00a0  At six years, kids like dolls\nand princesses. \u00a0  At sixteen, teens are\nall about boys and cars, and at thirty-six, women are focused on husbands and\nbabies. \u00a0  So it shall be, they say. Says\nwho, I ask? \n \n Autistic\npeople are not made to follow the same developmental trajectory as our typical\npeers. \u00a0  It\u2019s not that we follow a delayed\nversion of it\u2014we\u2019re not sucking on binkies when we\u2019re sixteen or having babies\nwhen we\u2019re sixty-six. \u00a0  Instead, our\ndevelopment follows an altogether different path. \u00a0  \n \n I\nremember middle school, when my friends became interested in boys and clothes\nand pop stars. \u00a0  I\u2019m very literal and\nstraightforward, so I was lost in the cattiness and drama, and yet, I\nconstantly remarked on the \u201cimmaturity\u201d of my peers. I thought that maybe the\nissue was not their lack of growing-up but rather mine. \u00a0  Now, I realize that they were growing up,\nyes, but I was growing sideways, onto an altogether different path\u2014an autistic\none. \u00a0  The older I got, the further my\npath veered from the one everyone else seemed to be traveling. \n \n By\nsixteen, I had simply had it with the ways of high school hallways and decided\nto graduate a year early and move on to college. \u00a0  But, when I got there, I didn\u2019t fit in\nsocially and couldn\u2019t manage my responsibilities. \u00a0  My executive functioning skills had not\ncaught up with my academic ability. \u00a0  My\nsocial skills made for upsets with professors and other students, and that\nupset me because I didn\u2019t understand what was wrong. \u00a0  I tended to miss events and leave partway\nthrough classes with total sensory overload, and when that happens, my\ncommunication pretty much halts. \n \n I did\ngraduate at 21 with a major in Elementary Education and emphasis in\nSpanish. \u00a0  Following graduation, I had\nservices through the Adult Autism Waiver to help me with community inclusion,\ncooking, cleaning, and organization. I felt constantly held up to a measuring\nstick in which \u201cnormal\u201d was at the top and I was always compared. \u00a0  It\u2019s not fair to hold the autistic\n22-year-old up to the neurotypical measuring stick for the same age. \u00a0  I have some gifts that far surpass what most\ncan do at my chronological age, but for some services and professionals, it\nwill always by my deficits that receive the focus. \u00a0  I will never, ever measure up. \n \n I would\nlike to ask the state how they feel when I hold up their young-adult-selves to\nwhat I\u2019ve experienced and accomplished in 26 years and ask them how they feel\nwhen they come up far short. \u00a0  I would\ndiagnose them as totally and utterly unexceptional. \n \n There\nhave been times when my interests \u201cgrew down.\u201d \u00a0\n I like to stich, so for a while I liked to hand-stitch clothing for my\ndolls. I never did play with them typically, even as a child, but what if I had\u2026\nat whatever age?  \u00a0 I have adult friends\nwho play with their childhood toys as a way of working out situations and\nunderstanding them better. A few of us like to have a figurine stashed in a\npurse or pocket for something familiar on hand in case something unexpected\nhappens. I don\u2019t understand why some people want to take away a harmless means of\nexperiencing and expanding our lives. It\u2019s sad to think of autistic kids who\nare told over and over that they have to hide their happy because someone else\nmight think it\u2019s weird. \n \n On a\nvery snowy, blustery day, I went to see Frozen with my mom. \u00a0  On the outside, I was an adult in a theater\nplaying a children\u2019s movie. Did I look like I was putting up with it? That\u2019s\nwhat adults are supposed to do, right? \u00a0\n But on the inside, I almost wanted to leave the theater, not because I\nwas bored but because some parts were playing out and putting words to things I\nknew so deeply but didn\u2019t know how to say. They were making other\nmovie-watchers feel for that character the way I felt all the time.  \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  It's funny how some\ndistance, \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  makes everything seem small. \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And the fears that once controlled\nme, can't get to me at all \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  It's time to see what I can do, \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  to test the limits and break\nthrough. \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  No right, no wrong, no rules for me. \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I'm free! \n \n I felt\nintense empathy (hint, hint) for the princess who felt like a monster who must\nisolate herself from her loved ones so as not to hurt them, but the song also\narticulated the amazing freedom and power I feel over the fact that these\nfeelings are now buried in my past. \u00a0  The\npower of the music and the stunning visual effects created a surge of emotion\nwithin me. \u00a0  My mom could have said she\ndidn\u2019t want to sit through a kid movie, and I probably wouldn\u2019t have seen it at\nall. But we both saw it, so I knew she followed the story and had the structure\nin her mind to understand my experience. We typed back and forth about it,\nwhich is always the best way for me to communicate, and I found words to help\nher understand what I had felt in the years before I typed, and she was able to\ngive me advice and support about those things I\u2019d been carrying most of my\nlife. I thought she didn\u2019t care when things felt awful\u2026 I hadn\u2019t realized she\ndidn\u2019t even know.  \n \n It\u2019s\nbeen two years now, and I still send an email to my mom with my writing when I\nrealize she probably doesn\u2019t know something\u2026why I would put the cat on her when\nshe was sick (they made me feel better, and she likes cats too), why I hate\ncash registers (don\u2019t like beeping!), why I don\u2019t like a certain department\nstore (the lights are too bright and make the floor shiny and hard to walk on\nit)\u2026 sometimes it\u2019s more serious, though. I was a verbal kid, but my mom has\nsaid that my writing has felt like getting to know a different person.  \n \n But\nwhat if I hadn\u2019t seen Frozen? \u00a0  What if it\nhad been deemed inappropriate for my age? \u00a0\n What if my mom hadn\u2019t come and watched it with me? \u00a0  One of the most fundamental things in an\nautistic life is that people misjudge you all the time\u2026 your abilities,\nintentions, communication\u2026  \n \n When\nyou tell an autistic adult that an interest is too childlike, that they need to\nget back on the path where everyone else there age is walking\u2026 you take them\noff the path of their history and their future, and you take away the chance\nfor that interest to help them process it all\u2014to grow. Maybe I don\u2019t grow up in\nthe same way, but I do a lot of growing sideways, and that\u2019s how I learn to\ncope and heal and find purpose. \n \n Please\nallow us the freedom to pursue our own developmental trajectories. \u00a0  The amazing ability and powerful insights\nthat come from this freedom might surprise you after all. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Lydia Wayman is a young adult autistic writer, speaker, and\nadvocate.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 20, 2015", "body": "\nWhen Bud was four years old, he was a huge fan of Raffi. Okay, he's still a fan of Raffi - but now, he's a fan of Raffi in addition to a hundred other things. Back then, Raffi was part of an exclusive circle. As a result, we spent a lot of time in those days listening to Raffi's music and watching Raffi's concert videos on VHS. So, when we learned that Raffi was doing a show in Boston, a mere two hours away, we scooped up tickets to take our preschool boy. \n \nThe trip to the show was an event in itself - we little country mice packing up for a trek to the big city, with a boy who still required us to pack for a three-hour event as though we were going away for a weekend. But we did it. We braved the Boston traffic, magically found parking, and then walked our boy through the sights and sounds of the city until we got to the concert venue. \n \nIt wasn't until we were in our seats that it all started to fall apart. \n \nI couldn't tell you the details if I wanted to. One of the lovely things about being me is that I simply don't retain the specifics of the bad stuff. I remember it in a global way, but I just don't hang on to the moment-by-moment hard times. \n \nSo, I know this. By the time Raffi took the stage, Bud and I were sitting in a quiet corner of the lobby, where I was trying, mostly unsuccessfully, to calm his anxiety and sooth his fear. We made a couple of attempts at re-entry, but ultimately, we ended up making the trek back through the city streets, back to the car, and back on the long ride home, without having heard a single note of Baby Beluga - or anything else. \n \nI thought of our Raffi experience earlier this year when, once again, Bud and I ventured out to see another musical favorite, Laurie Berkner. \n \nThis time, the experience was completely different. \n \nThough Laurie's audience was as raucous as Raffi's had been all those years ago, Bud hardly seemed to notice the chaos. He was unfazed by the preschoolers shrieking and dancing all around him. When beach balls started bouncing through the audience, he reached for them to swat them away. When Laurie asked a question, he gleefully shouted an answer. And when Laurie asked him to sing along, he joyfully belted it out. And, throughout the performance, he kept notes - or, more accurately, he instructed me on the notes that I should keep, recording each song in order so that he would be able to use the information later. \n \nWe had a wonderful time. \n \nA few months later, we learned that the Kratt Brothers were coming to town. (Do you know the Kratts? They are currently the stars of the PBS series Wild Kratts, but they always be \"the Zoboomafoo guys\" to Bud and me. We've been fans for a long, long time.)\u00a0 Bolstered by our success with Laurie Berkner, I purchased tickets to both the show and the meet-and-greet that followed it. \n \nBud had as much fun at the Wild Kratts show as he'd had at Laurie Berkner, but the meet-and-greet was the real draw of the day. We waited in a long line full of very little kids, and when it was his turn, Bud had solid one-on-one time with each of the Kratt Brothers. First, he met Chris. \n \n\"What's your favorite animal?\" Chris asked him. \n \n\"I like dogs,\" replied Bud. (And, not for nothing, does anyone remember  THIS ?) \n \n\"Oh, do you have a dog at home?\" Chris asked. \n \n\"Nope!\" said Bud. \n \n\"You just like them?\" \n \n\"I sure do!\" \n \nChris signed a picture for him, and then noticed that Bud had brought a book from their first, pre-Zoboomafoo show, Kratt's Creatures. \n \n\"Do you want me to sign your book, too?\" he asked. \n \n\"Sure!\" Bud beamed. \n \nAnd then we were on to Martin. He started chatting with Bud, then noticed the book Bud was carrying. \n \n\"Hey! That was our very first book!\" he said. \n \n\"Yeah!\" Bud said, and handed Martin the book so that he could sign it, too. \n \n\"Do you have any questions for me?\" Martin asked while he signed. \n \n\"Yes,\" said Bud. \"Is blue your favorite color?\" \n \n\"Yes it is!\" said Martin. \"That's why I always wear a blue shirt!\" Then he looked at Bud, and said, \"You're wearing a purple shirt. Is purple your favorite color?\" \n \n\"YES!\" said Bud, delighted that he'd guessed right. (And it was only then that I wondered if Bud has planned his outfit, knowing that the Kratts would be wearing their favorite colors, too.) \n \nThey chatted about Bud's favorite Wild Kratts episode, and then we headed out. Bud was over the moon. \n \nIn the car on the way home, Bud informed me that The Wiggles would be coming to town in a few months. On his birthday. \n \nI booked the tickets the following week. \n \nLast month, on Bud's sixteenth birthday, we headed back to the theater for the Wiggles show. We had our notebook in hand to capture the set list, which would be used to make future PowerPoints. I had my camera at the ready. We were good to go. \n \nOn the way to the show, Bud said casually, \"I can't wait to meet The Wiggles.\" \n \nI could feel my panic start to rise. \"No, Bud,\" I said. \"The Wiggles aren't having a meet and greet. It's just a show.\" \n \n\"Okay,\" he said. \"We'll see.\" \n \n\"No, Bud,\" I said, more firmly. \"Seriously. We're just going to sit in our seats and watch the show. We're not going to meet them. No one is going to meet them. I don't want you to be disappointed.\" \n \n\"Okay,\" he said. \n \n\"I need to make sure you understand, Bud,\" I said. \"We're not going to meet them. Do you understand?\" \n \n\"I understand,\" he said. And then he looked out the window and added quietly, \"But we'll see.\" \n \nWe made it to the theater and I recognized instantly that Wiggles fans, as a whole, are even younger than the fans of Laurie Berkner or The Kratt Brothers. For the most part, they seemed to be under five. If Bud noticed, he didn't mention it, and it certainly didn't seem to bother him. \n \nAs we made our way through the lobby, a familiar-sounding shriek drew my attention. I looked over and saw a mother with her preschool son. He was upset. Profoundly, inconsolably upset. I don't know them and I don't know their story, but the tableau looked very familiar. \n \nWe lost sight of them as the crowd buoyed us along, and soon we were in our seats and the show was starting and we were singing and shouting along with the other fans in the crowd. \n \nIf I'd done any research at all, I'd have learned that The Wiggles have some predictable shtick built into their show, and I would have come to the show more prepared. For example, many of the kids in the audience were holding roses - real roses, plastic roses, paper roses, whatever. As it turned out, there was a point during the show when the Wiggles left stage and wandered through the audience collecting flowers for Dorothy the Dinosaur. \n \nAs it happened, the family sitting next to us had come prepared. Wiggle Lachy made his way over to get their flowers and, since Bud was sitting on the aisle, Lachy had to lean over us to talk to the little girl, ask her name, and thank her. Then he stood up right next to Bud, and started to scan the audience for more flowers. \n \nBud saw his opening. \"Hi, Lachy,\" he said. \"My name is Bud.\" \n \nLachy looked down, and if he was surprised to see a sixteen-year-old fan looking back at him, he didn't show it. Instead, he tucked the flowers he was carrying under his arm and he held out his hand. \n \n\"Hello, Bud,\" he said, with a handshake and a smile. \"Are you enjoying the show?\" \n \n\"Yes, I am,\" Bud answered, with a firm handshake back. \n \n\"Good!\" Lachy said. \"It's very nice to meet you.\" \n \n\"It's nice to meet you, too,\" Bud replied. And then, Lachy was off. Bud turned to me with a smile and said, \"I met Lachy, Mom!\" \n \nMy mind flashed back to our car ride and Bud's hopeful \"we'll see...\" \n \nThen it flashed to the family we'd seen in the lobby when we arrived. The family with the child who was frightened, or overwhelmed, or just simply could not handle it. \n \nThen it flashed to us, twelve years earlier, at a similar venue, sitting in the lobby during a Raffi show. \n \nI wanted to run out of the theater and into the lobby to look for the family huddled in a quiet corner, trying to make it all okay. \n \nI wanted to tell them not to worry, and that if they just gave it time, it would all work out. \n \nI wondered, though, if when Bud was four years old, I would have been able to view him spending his sixteenth birthday at a Wiggles show as a mark of success. I'm afraid that, from that vantage point, I wouldn't have been able to recognize the tremendous growth and development that had led us to that day. \n \nLast year, I read  this post  by Lydia, a young adult with autism, who introduced me to the concept of \"growing sideways,\" along a unique developmental trajectory that might not always be clear to others. Her words resonated with me deeply. \n \nBud still loves all of the things that he loved in preschool. His passion now is the same as it was then. But now, he uses the things he loves in entirely different - and extraordinarily evolved - ways. \n \nWhen he was a preschooler, Bud loved the Teletubbies and Mister Rogers and countless other preschool shows. Back then, he watched videos, and listened to music, and played with toys. \n \nThese days, Bud still loves the Teletubbies and Mister Rogers and countless other preschool shows. But now, he uses them as the paradigm through which he expands his horizons and hones his skills. Now, when Bud works with his treasured programs, he researches. He investigates. He catalogs. He transcribes. He narrates. He documents. \n \nBud is a master of Google and YouTube. He is expert at Word and PowerPoint. He is an extraordinary speller. He can pull out main points to create titles and captions. He uses punctuation appropriately. He types with incredible accuracy and speed. He can freeze frame and cut and paste and size images. He looks for patterns and themes and relationships.\u00a0  \n \nBud uses the things he loves as jumping-off point. He researched the Teletubbies and learned about Ragdoll Productions, and the co-creators of the program, Anne Wood and Andy Davenport. He learned how the episodes were constructed. He learned about the actors involved with the programs. And then, he sought them out in other arenas - learning about their other projects, expanding the realm of his interest, and becoming a bit of an Anglophile in the process. \n \nBud's interest now is in what happens behind the scenes of his favorite programs. His heroes are the voice actors who give life to the animated characters he sees on the screen. He's practicing his own skills as a voice actor, and he does a great X the Owl and an even better Tigger. He can mimic dialects with the best of them. \n \nBud borrows DVDs from the library to create PowerPoints that catalog them in a variety of ways - the scenes, the actors, the artists, the composers. Right now, he's delving into the works of Julie Andrews and the Sherman Brothers - both sparked by his new-found love of Disney's Mary Poppins (the stage production of which we'll be seeing later this year). \n \nBud may be the only sixteen-year-old I've ever met who never utters the words, \"I'm bored.\" There is always more he wants to investigate. More he wants to dissect. More he wants to compile. \n \nBut Bud's sideways growth has not only been in the areas of British children's programming and the voice actors in classic Disney movies. He is also expanding his social repertoire. Last Saturday, during a visit to the local library, he bonded with our \nlibrarian Bill over a conversation about Sterling Holloway, Bud's favorite voice actor, who provided the voice \nof Kaa in the Jungle Book, Mister Stork in Dumbo, the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland, \nand the beloved Winnie the Pooh. Bill told Bud about his son, who is currently enrolled in a degree program in animation and who hopes to work in the field. \n \nAnd, of course, there is Bud's interaction with Lachy at the Wiggles show. In order to make that happen, Bud had to: \n1. Set a goal, then \n2. Read the hectic, multi-sensory environment to \n3. Identify the exact \"right\" moment of opportunity, then \n4. Communicate at the right moment using \n5. The right words, \n6. The right tone, and \n7. The right body language. \nHe had to: \n8. Initiate \n9. Listen, and \n10. Respond appropriately, \nwhich meant he had to coordinate his \n11. Speech and \n12. Movement. \nAnd then, he had to \n13. End the interaction gracefully, and \n14. Celebrate the achievement of his goal. \n \nAnd he handled it like a pro. \n \nThat's the moment I want to capture and share with the family in the lobby who's wondering if it will ever be okay.

Bud has had a stupendous first semester of high school, and there are many stories just itching to be told. \n \nAlas, they will have to wait, as 'tis the season and there are other, more pressing things that need my attention - the wrapping, the baking, the last minute how-could-I-have-forgottens, and, of course, the sending of the Christmas cards. \n \nIt's that last bit that made me step away from all the other pressing to-dos to tell you a story that's about a year old, but whose time has come. \n \nYou see, last year, many of my friends did not receive a holiday card from me. Instead, they got an e-mail - and this is what it said: \n \n \n Hi friends, If this were a blog post, it would be titled Why You Are Not Getting A Holiday Card From Me This Year. As always, it\u2019s a long story. Though the task kept getting shuffled to the bottom of the to-do list, I actually did order cards this year. This was a big year, after all, and it\u2019s the first year that I planned to send a card from my new family \u2013 Bud and me, and Brian and his son Buster. I\u2019d hoped to get a picture of the two boys together in front of the tree, but that Christmas miracle never happened (as Buster continues to be 3 and Bud continues to avoid 3-year-olds), so we had to settle for separate, but happy, pictures of the boys. Anyway, we only had one weekend while the tree was up and Buster was here, so I scrambled to get the picture taken, the card designed, and the order placed, remembering to order a bunch of the Happy Holidays version in addition to a handful of Merry Christmases. The key word in that last sentence, of course, is \"scrambled.\" Honestly. I scrambled. The cards arrived, giving me about 48 hours to get them in the mail and have them get to their destinations in time for Christmas. I was feeling undeservedly smug, and I proudly showed the fruits of my labor to Brian, as I awaited the adulation I was sure would follow. Instead, he took one look at the card and said, \u201cOh no. Did they do that or did we?\u201d And then I looked again, more carefully, and discovered that I\u2019d transposed the vowels in my beloved fiance\u2019s name, and while he is certainly an intelligent man, he was not fond of the idea of having our cards go out from Mary and Brain and the kids. So, the handful of Merry Christmas cards that arrived free of typos have gone out to the aunties and uncles and Christmas card purists, and this heartfelt, but paper-free wish for a happy holiday goes to the rest of you \u2013 those I know will understand; those who love me despite \u2013 perhaps because of \u2013 my unflagging propensity for human foible. Happy holidays, my friends. Happy Chanukah, Merry Christmas, Bright Solstice, and truly, all good things in the year ahead. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.

{"date": "Wednesday, August 19, 2015", "body": "\nBud and I haven't been to a movie theater in years. \u00a0When he was younger, we tried seeing movies a number of times, but we had mixed success. Movie theaters can be sensory nightmares - surround sound that's too loud, audience members sitting too close, aisles too dark, a screen too bright. There were times we left during the previews, and times we left in the middle of the show. There were often tears. \u00a0So, after a while, it seemed ridiculous to continue to make tearful efforts in the name of entertainment, and we stopped trying to see movies. \n \nBut Bud is a lot older now. He's much better able to advocate for himself and tell me what he needs. A good friend had recommended the movie Inside Out, and I really wanted to see it. I thought that maybe the time was right to try again, and, I reasoned, even if the attempt ended in tears, maybe a movie about emotions would give us a new framework through which we could discuss the way we were feeling about the experience. So I pitched the idea. \n \nBud thought about it, but didn't respond. I took that as a good sign. Usually, the suggestion that we watch a full-length movie is met with, \"I don't think so, Mom.\" \n \nI suggested he watch the trailer, and he did. Twice. \n \nI told him we could get popcorn. \n \nHe watched the trailer again. And then he agreed - not even reluctantly. \n \nWe went to the show in the early afternoon and from the time we left the house to the time we entered the theater, I waited for his hesitation, his second thoughts, his panic - but they didn't come. \n \nBud and I shared a bucket of popcorn and he munched happily through the previews and through what turned out to be a very lengthy animated short. \n \nThen the movie started. Then the popcorn was gone, and I wondered if that would be that.\u00a0 But it wasn't. Bud was engaged. He said \"awww\" when the baby was born, and he laughed out loud at the funny parts. \n \nA couple of times, during some slower segments, he asked me if the movie was almost over, and I told him it was. And then, suddenly, the screen got darker and the music got lower and I could tell that the obligatory Disney \"scary part\" was coming. \n \nI leaned over and whispered, \"Bud, I have to go to the bathroom. Will you come with me?\" \n \nHe whispered back, \"No, I'll stay here and wait for you.\" \n \nI waited a few more minutes until things on the screen got a bit more ominous, then I leaned over and whispered again, \"Why don't you come to the bathroom with me, and then we'll stop at the snack bar on the way back?\" \n \n\"Please, Mom,\" he whispered back, impatiently, \"I'm trying to watch the movie.\" \n \nAnd soon enough, the scary part was over, and I decided that the bathroom could wait. \n \nIt was a beautiful movie. \u00a0It was about emotions - their complexity, their interplay, and their importance. But it was about so much more than that. It was about growing up and dealing with change and letting go and hanging on. It was about childhood and parenthood and empathy and love. \n \nWith themes like that, so universal, and yet so deeply personal, with ideas and images that hit so close to the heart, it was no surprise that there were tears before this movie ended as well. \u00a0But this time, the tears played out differently. \n \nThis time, the tears were met with this: \n \n\"Mom, are you - are you  crying , Mom?\" \n \nAnd then this: \n \n\"Aw, Mom, it's okay. Don't worry. It's only a movie.\" \n \nAnd then this: \n \n\"Mom, don't you think you should blow your nose?\" \n \nAnd then this: \n \n\"Why are you crying and laughing at the same time?\" \n \nIt really was a beautiful movie. \n \nTears and all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2015/08/inside-out.html", "title": "\nInside Out\n"},

Back then, most of my readers were regulars \u2013 the same handful of\npeople who made the rounds of the same blogs I was reading. We had continuing\ninteraction and conversation in a variety of locations on a variety of\nsubjects. At that time, in most cases, it was safe to assume that people\nreading one of my posts had read other posts of mine as well. \n \n \n \nNot so anymore. \n \n \n \nSocial media has changed the nature of blogging. If I want\nanyone to know I have a new post up, I pretty much have to post the link on my\nblog\u2019s Facebook page. (I guess I could tweet it, if I didn\u2019t loathe Twitter so\nmuch.) Once the link has made its way into social media, it takes on a life of\nits own. It gets posted elsewhere, people see that a friend has \u201cliked\u201d it, and they click to see what it is - and suddenly a large number of my readers are reading\na single post in isolation, without any context about me, my writing, or my\nlife. \n \n \n \nThis isn\u2019t a complaint. It\u2019s just an acknowledgement of a\nnew dynamic \u2013 a new reality. \n \n \n \nBack when despite being on the internet, the blog felt more\ninsular, I did a lot of meta-communcation \u2013 writing about writing, blogging\nabout blogging. I did a lot of deconstructing \u2013 reminding people of what I was\nnot writing, and why. I\u2019m guessing that many of my current readers haven\u2019t read\nmost of that writing, and so, here is a bit of a recap, ten years on. \n \n \n \n1. Everything I write is true, but there are many truths\nthat I don\u2019t write about. \n \nEverything you read on the blog has actually happened. If I\nsay that Bud did something, you can count on the fact that he did it. But there are\nmany, many, many things that happen in our lives that do not, and will not ever, make it on to the blog. They\u2019re private. \n \n \n \n2. If you only know Bud from the blog, then you don\u2019t know\nBud. \n \nSee #1. Here on the blog, you are getting a glimpse into a\nportion of who Bud is. He has greater dimension and more complexity and, I\u2019m certain, he is far more\ninteresting in real life than he is on the blog. Please do not make assumptions\nabout his \u201clevel of functioning\u201d (whatever that is) based on what you read here. \n \n \n \n3. I make no attempt to universalize my experience or Bud\u2019s\nexperience. \n \nAs the saying goes, \u201cif you know one person with autism, you\nknow one person with autism.\u201d I can only speak to my own experience,\nand I am not suggesting that your experience (if you have a child with autism)\nwill look anything like it. As is true with every other element of the human\nexperience, your mileage may vary. \n \n \n \n4. If it sounds like I\u2019m telling you what to do, it\u2019s\nbecause I haven\u2019t written it well. \n \nThis blog is not a \u201chow to.\u201d I don\u2019t give parenting advice and I try hard not to be prescriptive. Anything here that sounds like parenting advice is reflective of my inability\nto phrase my story well, and not of my intention to tell you what to do. I don't pretend to have the answers. \n \n \n \n5. I won\u2019t apologize for being positive. \n \nI am not trying to \u201cwhitewash autism\u201d (and I apologize for\nthe use of that phrase, but it\u2019s the one I keep reading in the current press).\nMy blog has a focus on the positive, because that is who I am. My life off-blog\nalso has a focus on the positive, despite the fact that I have experienced some\nreally heartbreaking things. If I were a different sort of person, I could\nwrite a different sort of blog, which would be equally true. (See #1 above.)  \u00a0But I'm glad that I'm not, and that I don't. \n \n \n \nSo, there you have it. Caveat lector.

{"date": "Monday, August 10, 2015", "body": "\nWhen I started blogging, I was hoping to meet other parents of kids with autism. I did, of course, and they have been a great resource. What I didn't know when I started out, though, was that I would also meet a lot of people with autism, and that their insight would be equally valuable to me. \n \nOne of the autistic friends I've made through blogging is  Chloe Rothschild , a young adult who is a writer, speaker, and autism advocate. Like Bud, Chloe is part of a blended family. Through her experience, she has learned to navigate life with younger step-siblings, so it was natural that as we were chatting last year, shortly after Bud and I were sharing a home with Brian and Buster, the topic would come up. \n \nChloe asked me how Bud and Buster were doing together. I told her that the dynamics between them could be challenging at times, because preschoolers are notoriously good button-pushers, and our resident teenager has some very easily-pushed buttons. And sometimes, when his buttons were pushed, his response was not entirely kind. \n \nChloe said that she'd experienced similar things, and said she thought it was important to make sure that Bud had his own space so he could retreat when he needed to. I told her that he often spent time alone in his room, but I worried that he felt like he was being pushed out by this new little person in our life. \n \n\"Schedule Mom and Bud time, too,\" she said. \"That's crucial.\" \n \nAnd then she asked, \"Does Bud have a phone? Does he text? Could he text?\" \n \nThe question intrigued me. He didn't have a phone, I told her, but yes, he could definitely text. \n \nChloe explained to me that a cell phone could be a valuable tool for Bud. She said he could text me from another room if he was upset, or if there was something he wanted to say that he knew might be interpreted as rude. She said he could also use it to ask to speak to me alone when he needed to. \n \nI thought a lot about Chloe's suggestion in the weeks that followed, and a short time later, Bud got his first cell phone. He took to texting immediately, and Chloe was absolutely right - it gave him a new channel of communication and a way to express himself without having the pressure of trying to say things out loud in front of an audience. To my great relief, it also helped me to understand that when Bud retreated to his room on a weekend afternoon, he was doing so happily. He liked having space and the ability to do his own thing, and did not feel at all bad that Brian, Buster and I were playing a game or watching a movie without him. \n \nBy great coincidence, as I was writing this post, I checked Facebook and saw that Chloe had linked to a piece she'd just written for The Mighty called  Four Things I'd Like My Future Step-Siblings to Know About My Autism . I hope you'll click through and read it. I'll be bookmarking it for future reference.

{"date": "Monday, August 17, 2015", "body": "\nLast week, my iPhone fell victim to the blue screen of death. I'll be honest - I didn't even know that could happen. I thought the blue screen of death was a Microsoft phenomenon. But, no - there was my Apple product, glowing a serene, peaceful blue, but doing nothing else. \n \nAfter a couple of hours of Googling and trouble-shooting, I restored the phone to its original factory settings. My photos were backed up, thank goodness, but everything else was gone. Or\u00a0 almost  everything. \n \nI opened my contact list and was startled to find that it wasn't empty. My current contact list had been replaced by the contact list I had when I upgraded to my very first iPhone, and it was a startling reminder of how much my life has changed since then. I felt like a modern-day Ebeneezer Scrooge, visited by the Ghost of iPhone Past. My husband Brian was missing from my contact list, and there, in his virtual place, was Somebody That I Used To Know. It triggered an avalanche of images in my mind - images of what was, what is, and what might have been. And, like Scrooge, I emerged from it grateful for where I am right now. \n \nA few days later, my friend  Alysia  posted to Facebook a question posed by her son Howie:  Would you rather go back in time one time or go into the future one time? You\n could come back to the present time, but you couldn't time travel again. \n \nStrangely, my contact list sprang to mind. \n \nWhen the past was the present, when my old contact list was not old, I was happy - happy with my contact list, and happy with my life. But I know things now, here in 2015, that I didn't know then, and those things make me view that time differently. They cast a different light on the actions I took and the choices I made. They make that time seem less happy, or they make my happiness seem foolish. They make me judge myself unfairly, and too harshly. \n \nBecause here's the thing - as I go through life, I try to do the best I can with the information I have at the time. In many cases, I get new information later - information that suggests that I should have made my decisions differently. But it's simply not fair for the information-rich current-me to judge the informationless past-me for not using the information I didn't have. \n \nAnd here's another thing about the past. We have all shaped our memories in particular ways for particular reasons. Perhaps sometimes our memories are inaccurate and self-serving, but they are ours, and they play an important role for us as we move forward. If we were to travel back to the past to view or experience that time with our right-now knowledge, we would see that time differently and, I fear, our dearest memories might suddenly seem less dear. \n \nThere were some sweet responses to Alysia's post. One person said she'd like to visit the past so she could go fishing with her grandpa one more time. And that is incredibly sweet. But I still wouldn't do it. Because 40-something me would see Grandpa differently - would understand him differently - than 7-year-old me did, and 7-year-old me's perspective matters. It's whole and it's real and it's meaningful, and it's an important part of who I am now. \n \nI wouldn't want to visit the future either.\u00a0 If, some years ago in my pre-iPhone existence, I had been given a glimpse of my current contact list, I think I would have panicked because of who was missing from it. And despite being told that it all worked out, that I found Brian and Buster, and that  different  turned out to be  fabulous , I think that past-me would have spent those intervening years distracted with worry about how it would all play out. And, in in my distraction, I probably would have missed a lot of the good stuff. \n \nWe're all in the midst of an unfolding narrative, and it has to unfold in its own time. I'm glad that no one told me in my youth what would happen in my life up to now. I don't think that back then I could have appreciated that loss and grief would make me more kind, that making poor choices would help me learn to make better ones, or that a diagnosis that seemed terrifying at first would later reveal itself to hold a million different gifts. \u00a0I'm afraid I would have lived my life with a sense of fear, or dread, or foreboding. Instead, having let the narrative unfold, and having taken the time to process it as it did, I can appreciate the richness of my experience and the joy of the space I'm in now. (I don't peek ahead at the endings of books either. I just don't want to know until I'm ready to know.) \n \nSo, my reply to Alysia, which probably seemed off-the-cuff but was actually the result of considerable phone-inspired pondering, was this:    \"I'll stay right where I am - blissfully ignorant of the future and happily ensconced in my revisionist history of the past.\" \n \n But I've learned an important lesson from my recent brush with the past. In the future, I will back up my iPhone.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://trydefyinggravity.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-ghost-of-iphone-past.html", "title": "\nThe ghost of iPhone past\n"},

We'd planned a very casual ceremony and reception, so there was plenty of room for improvisation.

There were really no wrong answers. \n \nBud listened to his options, but didn't offer many thoughts as to what he'd like to do at the wedding, except for one: he wanted to wear a tuxedo. I explained to him that it wasn't really that kind of wedding, that Brian and I would not be wearing fancy clothes, and that it might be a hot day and a tuxedo might not be very comfortable in the backyard. \n \nDespite that, he was insistent - he wanted to wear a tuxedo.\u00a0 We compromised on a short sleeve dress shirt with a tuxedo vest and bow tie.

That was all Bud wanted to make the day perfect: just one little appearance from these two big stars. \n \nI explained that this was something we really couldn't pull off - that Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Redman were very famous musicians with very busy schedules, and since we didn't actually know them, they would not be available to come to our wedding. \n \nWe spent the rest of the day talking about Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Redman. Bud seemed sure that there must be a way to make it happen. They had both appeared on Arthur, after all. Why not our wedding? \n \nAs nighttime neared and Bud's determination seemed unlikely to wane, I reminded Bud that Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Redman appeared on Arthur as animated characters, which meant that their appearance was really pretend. I also reminded him that we could pretend, too, and that in our imaginations, anyone could come to the wedding - Yo-Yo Ma, Joshua Redman, ANYONE. \n \nBud was delighted. ANYONE? \n \nHe immediately set about making a guest list. As it turned out, the people who would be coming to our wedding were all people who had also appeared as animated characters on Arthur. People like:  \nMichelle Kwan \nMister Rogers \nAlex Trebek \nMarc Brown \nJeremy O'Neill \nArt Garfunkel \n \nAnd, of course, Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Redman. \n \nBud spent a lot of time talking about the guest list and making guest-list-related PowerPoint slides. \n \nOf all the guests on his list, though, it was Mister Rogers who really captured his imagination - because in our imagination, in our world of pretend, Mister Rogers could come to our wedding, even though we knew that in real life, Mister Rogers had died. \n \nBud and I have spent a lot of time over the past year talking about Mister Rogers' death. In early 2014, we lost my father, Bud's Papa and  best friend in the world , who passed away after a  difficult struggle with Alzheimer's . \u00a0We've spent a lot of time talking about Papa too, of course, but I think it has been easier for Bud to process his loss from one step removed, by talking about the loss of Mister Rogers. And certainly, as we gathered for our wedding with the same people and in the same location where we'd gathered to grieve my father's death, it was understandable that Papa was as present to Bud as he was to the rest of us, and that the related emotion was almost too much for him to bear. \n \nEnter Mister Rogers. \n \nAs Bud worked on his guest list, he suggested that we might hold the wedding \"in loving memory of Fred Rogers.\" I told him I thought that was a wonderful idea. He went to bed with his guest list complete, excited for the day ahead. \n \nThe next day, a few hours before our guests started to arrive, Bud told me that he'd like to make a speech at the wedding. I told him he could absolutely make a speech and started asking questions to try to find out what he had in mind. Bud's answers were definitive; he had a clear vision of how he wanted this to play. \n \nYes, he wanted to give a speech at the ceremony. No, not the reception. \n \nYes, he wanted to use the microphone. \n \nYes, he wanted his speech to start the ceremony. \n \nYes, he'd like to write it out ahead of time so he could read from a paper.  \n \nIn fact, he said, he knew exactly which speech he'd like to give. He wanted to give Mister Rogers' acceptance speech from the ceremony at which he received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award. \n \nBud got right to work. He pulled up the acceptance speech footage on YouTube, donned his headphones, and started transcribing. Once he had the speech typed up, we emailed it to our friends across the street so they could print it for us. We tucked it into a lucite frame, so it would have some stability in the breeze, and we were good to go. \n \nBefore we headed across the street for the ceremony, I did a final check with Bud to make sure he had everything he needed. His tuxedo vest, bow tie, and top hat were on straight and his framed speech was tucked under his arm. He stopped as we were about to head out the door. \n \n\"Mom?\" he asked, \"Can I take Papa's cane with me?\" \n \nMy heart nearly melted on the spot. \n \n\"Of course you can, Bud,\" I said. \"Papa would  love  that.\" \n \nHe ran back to the closet where Papa's cane had been hanging for more than a year, and hooked it over his arm.\u00a0 NOW we were ready. \n \nWe made our way across the street, where our friends were gathering. Brian had already gone over and was busy greeting people, and before we knew it, the yard was full and it was time to begin. \n \nBrian and I stepped forward, and our friend, who was performing the ceremony, introduced Bud. \n \nBud walked up to the microphone. \n \n\"Oh,\" he said, \"it's a beautiful night in THIS neighborhood!\" \n \nAnd then he started his speech. \n \nSo many people have helped me come to this night. Some of you are here. Some are far away. Some are even in heaven. All of us have special ones who have loved us into being. Would you just take along with me ten seconds to think of the people who have helped you become who you are? Those who have cared about you and wanted what was best for you and your life. Ten seconds of silence. I'll watch the time. \nBud paused and looked intently at his wrist, where a watch would be if he were wearing a watch, and we all waited in silence for what Brian tells me was a remarkably accurate ten seconds.\u00a0 Then Bud lifted his head and continued. \n \nWhoever you have been thinking about, how pleased they must be to know the difference you feel that they've made. You know, they're the kind of people television does well to offer our world. Special thanks to my family and friends and to my coworkers in public broadcasting, Family Communications, and this academy, for encouraging me and allowing me all these years to be your neighbor. May God be with you. \nBud stopped speaking and stepped away from the microphone. The moment took my breath away, and as I wiped the tears from my eyes, I saw my soon-to-be-husband and our family and friends gathered in a semi-circle around us, smiling and crying and totally\u00a0 getting  it. \n \nIt was a beautiful day in the neighborhood. Even better than a performance by Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Redman. \n \nAnd my father, Bud's Papa. How pleased he must have been to know the difference that he made.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-mclaughlin/coping-with-alzheimers-_b_4405798.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2015/08/a-beautiful-day-in-neighborhood.html", "title": "\nA beautiful day in the neighborhood\n"},

{"date": "Monday, July 27, 2015", "body": "\nWhen I started blogging, I was part of a little group of like-minded bloggers who made the rounds of each others' \u00a0blogs every couple of days to catch up and have conversation. Once our corner of the blogosphere exploded, many of us started to rely on RSS feeds to tell us when our favorite bloggers had new posts. \n \nIt seems that things have changed since then, and to a great degree, Facebook has become the primary source for information and updates. My blog stats tells me that the vast majority of people who read my last two posts came to me via Facebook. \n \nAnother interesting change since I was last blogging on a regular basis: people seem to be a lot more comfortable commenting on the Facebook link, instead of on the post itself. That makes sense. If you're a Facebook user, chances are good that you're already in the habit of \"liking\" and commenting there. And the Blogger interface can be cumbersome at best. In fact, several people have told me that they have not been able to get their comments to post there at all. \n \nSo it  seems  like Facebook is a great platform.\u00a0 But it's trickier than it seems. \n \nLet's look at RSS feeds. RSS feeds work this way: I tell RSS that I like a blogger. That blogger posts something. RSS tells me a new post is up. \n \nSimple. Clean. Reliable. \n \nIn contrast, if I understand it correctly, this is the way Facebook works: I tell Facebook that I like a blogger. Facebook files away that information for future reference (their own). That blogger posts a link to a new blog entry. \n \nFacebook smiles. \n \nFacebook adds the blogger's link to the news feeds of a small number of their followers. I may be one of those people, but there's a good chance that I will never see the link in my news feed. \n \nFacebook tells the blogger that they would be happy to share the link with more people who would like to see it. \n \nFor a fee. \n \nRight. As a blogger, if I want people who have \"liked\" my page to see the things I have posted there, I need to give Facebook a kickback. Only, my blog doesn't generate income. I don't have ads. I don't get paid. So I'm certainly not going to start paying to get readers.  \n \nFrom what I hear from people who know more about this sort of thing than I do, Facebook also uses some complicated algorithm to increase or limit traffic based on the popularity of a post.\u00a0 So, if Facebook shares my link with 200 people, and many of those 200 people like it or comment on it, Facebook will plop it into the news feed of more people who have \"liked\" my page. If, however, those initial 200 people just kind of yawn, my link will die a quick death. (Which seems counter-intuitive to me, but, then, what do I know?) \n \nSo, anyway, what is my point here? \n \n1) If you're on Facebook and you haven't \"liked\" my page yet, you may want to, because, as I've said before, one of the best parts of blogging is what happens in the comments, and a huge portion of the commentary is happening on Facebook. You can  find the page here . \n \n2) Even if you \"like\" my page, Facebook may never let you know when I've posted to it. I'm sorry about that. I don't have any idea what to do about it.  \n \n3) If you know a clever work-around to get Facebook to show you the stuff you really want to see, or if you have any greater understanding of The Ways of the Facebook (What, for instance, is the difference between \"liking\" and \"following\"? And why would anyone want to \"like\" me, but \"hide all posts\" from me? Can't they just avoid all posts by  not  \"liking\" me?), please share your wisdom with the rest of us.  \n \nAnd if you're reading this post because Facebook plopped it into your news feed, you can rest assured that I did not pay them to put it there.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/MOM-Not-Otherwise-Specified/194673183927449"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2015/07/face-facebook.html", "title": "\nFace the Face(book)\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 29, 2015", "body": "\nAnother incredible thing happened to me last month, actually on the same day that I married Brian: I became the step-parent of an extraordinary four-year-old boy, Buster. \n \nOf course, Buster has been in my life for some time now, but even so, my marriage to his father has made me stop and think even more deeply about the role I play - and will play - in Buster's life. \n \nBuster lives with us part-time, and we have been sharing a home for almost a year. When we made the move from play dates to real life, I found myself almost immediately confronting a bias that I didn't even know I'd been carrying around with me. \u00a0See, I knew that raising a child who doesn't have autism would be  different  from raising a child who does, but - and here's where the unfair bias comes in - I'd assumed it would also be\u00a0 easier . \n \nIt's not - or, at least, it's not for me. It makes sense, I guess. Bud is the only child I've ever lived with. Bud and I have been doing our thing together for fifteen years, and everything I know about parenting has grown up around him. \n \nIt's like you spend fifteen years raising puppies. You focus all your energy on learning about puppies, observing and interacting with puppies, taking puppy classes, talking to puppy-raising friends, until you finally get to place where you hit a puppy groove and find your puppy mojo. \n \nAnd then one day, somebody drops off a baby kangaroo at your door. \n \nNow, don't get me wrong. Baby kangaroos are AWESOME. They're fun and cute and they make you laugh and they make your heart swell, but I'll tell you what: baby kangaroos have no interest in playing with your squeaky toys and they are not motivated by your milk bone dog biscuits. \n \nIt is, very much, like starting all over again. \n \nThere is a whole lot that I have to say - and even more, I'm sure, that I will want to say in the years to come. I'm certain that the wisdom of the blogosphere would prove invaluable to me. \n \nBut here's the thing: you won't be reading much about my life with Buster here on the pages of the blog. Because, in addition to learning about the care and feeding of a kangaroo, I am simultaneously learning how to be a step-parent. \n \nHere's what I know so far: \n \n1. Being a step-parent is inherently different from being a parent, and \n \n2. It is not as simple, nor as straightforward, as The Brady Bunch made it look. \n \nAs I think about how to negotiate my place in Buster's life, especially in these early years, as he's making sense of who Bud and I are and how we have come to land in the middle of his life, I'm finding that as a step-parent, I need to err more on the side of step and less on the side of parent. \n \nBecause here's something I know from being Bud's mother: the mom role is singular. Buster has a mom, and I am not her. I can be a friend, a mentor, and a role model. I can love him, celebrate him, console him, encourage him, redirect him, support him, and challenge him. But I can never try to be his mom. He already has all the mom he needs. \n \nI also need to remember the place I hold as a non-decision-maker in his life. His parents need to collaborate on the big-picture decisions about what he needs and how to provide it. If I have opinions, I can share them with Brian, but only if I understand that, ultimately, I don't get a vote. And I'm okay with that. It's part of the package deal that I signed on to, and, frankly, I got a really good deal. \n \nSo, I'll write sparingly about Buster here, but it won't be because he's a minor player in my life. On the contrary, he is central to it. But if I have concerns about overstepping my rights in sharing Bud's story (and you know that I do), I have twice the concern about doing so with Buster. And if Buster's mom ever stumbles on to my writing, I hope that all she will see in it is respect, both for him and for her. \n \nNow if you'll excuse me, I have to run. I have a kangaroo to chase.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2015/07/step-by-step.html", "title": "\nStep by step\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 26, 2014", "body": "\nHey, you guys? \n \nI just want you to know, I get it. I get how hard it is at this time of year when your Facebook feed is full of the shining, happy faces of your friends' kids on the first day of school. I know how much it stings. \u00a0I know the pain, and then the guilt you feel that someone else's joy should cause you pain, and then the loneliness you feel because, it seems, nobody else really seems to get that this is a really hard time of year for you. Because it should be happy, right? Look! Shiny, happy faces everywhere! This is a Very Happy Time. \n \nBut it's okay to feel the way you do. It's normal to look at pictures of shiny faces and feel sad for your child, whose anxiety about a new transition kept him up for most of the night. It's okay to look at pictures of crisp new outfits and feel the pang of hurt for your child who was so bothered by the texture of the treasured new outfit she'd chosen that she cried and cried all morning until you convinced her that it really was okay to wear her old, soft t-shirt on the first day. I understand how hard it is to see the photo of the happy kindergarten student as he boards the bus for the very first time, as you prepare to drive your high schooler across town to school, because he just isn't ready to ride the bus on his own yet. \n \nI get it. It's really, really hard. \n \nBut you know what? I posted a happy picture of Bud on Facebook this morning, too. It was a real, genuine, happy moment and he had a good first day of school. But I haven't exhaled yet. I won't exhale for weeks - if I exhale at all. \n \nI keep thinking about something Jess from  Diary of a Mom  posted last December, as the holidays approached. \u00a0I think it's a good thing to remember now, too. \n \n \n \n \nSo, really.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 22, 2015", "body": "\n Back in April, two days shy of her 61st birthday, Anne Lamott wrote  a kickass Facebook post  that patched together her accumulated wisdom from the past six decades. The whole piece is fantastic, but one paragraph climbed inside my brain and has been roosting there for the past three months. She wrote, \n \n Writing: shitty first drafts. Butt in chair. Just do it. You own everything that happened to you. You are going to feel like hell if you never write the stuff that is tugging on the sleeves in your heart--your stories, visions, memories, songs: your truth, your version of things, in your voice. That is really all you have to offer us, and it's why you were born. \n This morning, I woke up to an email from someone called \"morning dew\" (Hello, morning dew. Thanks for the email.) She wrote, \"Hi! I was hoping you could fill me in, or link me to, what you're currently writing. Your blog, though currently an archive, has meant a lot to me.\"\u00a0 \n \n She went on to say lovely things, but I got stuck back there on those three words - \"currently an archive.\" \n \n Yikes. \n \n She's not wrong, of course. I've written just one post in the past year. That's hardly prolific. But still. Archive. \n \n It's not that I don't have anything to say. I have composed full posts in my head that I've never put in writing. I've put posts in writing, but let them linger in draft form. I've written and deleted more than I would have thought possible. \n \n The thing is, I can't reconcile my inside voice with Anne Lamott's shared wisdom: \"You own everything that ever happened to you.\" \n \n Except that I don't feel like I do. \n \n I'm not just talking about Bud's privacy here. \u00a0Every parent who blogs has grappled with the line between the appropriate sharing of a parent's story and the violation of a child's right to privacy. I started writing about that line\u00a0 when Bud was seven , and I feel like I've developed really good instincts since then. If I've ever felt a hint of \"I wonder if that crosses the line,\" I've edited it out. As Bud gets older and the issues become more complex, the area on the privacy side of the line has gotten a whole lot wider than the area on the sharing side of the line, but still, the line remains clear to me. \n \n But Bud is not the only person who has been in my life. Anne Lamott tells me that I own everything that happened to me. But virtually all of those things that happened to me involved things that happened to other people, too.\u00a0 \n \n Things were a whole lot easier when I started blogging back in 2005 and was completely pseudonymous. Nobody who knew me in real life even knew I had a blog. Slowly, over time, I started to tell people about it, but even then, I had some control over who knew about the blog and who didn't. Then, in 2010, a number of things happened in rapid succession -  the Hairdryer Kid series  took on a life of its own, I got a bit of recognition, and suddenly, I was out there on the internet as a real person with a real name. Google the blog and you find me. Google me and you find the blog. \n \n At first, it wasn't really a problem. I'd written carefully, so there wasn't much on the blog that I was reluctant to share with the general population. The few things that made me go hmm got deleted. But I quickly found that writing new pieces became a lot more challenging, and the more complicated the things I experienced (and believe me, the past five years have been nothing if not complicated), the more difficult it was to find a comfortable way to write about them. So the posts became less frequent until they finally petered out completely. \n \n And yet, that Anne Lamott paragraph has been haunting me since April. I own everything that ever happened to me. I am going to feel like hell if I never write the stuff that is tugging on the sleeves in my heart - my stories, visions, memories, songs: my truth, my version of things, in my voice. But writing it and tucking it away in a drawer - that just doesn't do it for me. I have never been a diary-keeper. What kept me writing when I was writing was the dynamic element of blogging - the sharing of stories, the comparing of perspectives, the crowdsourcing and the collective creative problem-solving. Without someone to write  to , it hardly seems worth the energy to write at all. \n \n I'm getting to that point in the post that I've gotten to many times over the past year - the point at which I've said what I've come to say and it's time to publish (and go public) or perish (and hit delete). Here I am at the end of the post, and I'm still not sure which I'll do. \n \n But I'll feel like hell if I never write the stuff that is tugging on the sleeves in my heart. I'll feel like hell if here, smack in the center of midlife, I decide to be an archive. \n \n Here goes nothing. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/AnneLamott/posts/662177577245222"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2015/07/you-own-everything-that-happened-to-you.html", "title": "\nYou own everything that happened to you\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 24, 2015", "body": "\nMe again. \n \nHow about that? In two days, I've matched my output for all of 2014. Not a bad re-start, eh? \n \nFirst, thank you so much for the warm welcome back. It's been staggering, actually. I didn't expect to be met with where-the-hell-have-you-been hostility or anything, but - well, I'm not really sure what I expected. Crickets, I guess. But your messages and your \"likes\" and your kindness have meant so much to me. \n \nOkay, I'll stop before I go all Sally Field on you. (\"You like me! You really like me!\") \n \nI've decided that I'm not going to try to recap everything that's happened in my life over the past whatever months and years. I'll just let the narrative unfold from here, and when there's some back-story that's critical to understanding the big picture, I'll give it to you. The rest of the story can remain in the shadows, comfortably gathering dust. \n \nThere is one piece of information that I want to give you up front, though, because it's big and it's awesome and it's actually still new enough that it gives me chills every time I say it out loud. \n \nI got married last month. \n \nI know, right? \n \nHUGE. \n \nLast night, I was talking to my husband (my HUSBAND!) about this tentative foray back into writing, and I told him I'd need to come up with a blog name for him. \n \n\"Uh,\" he said, tentatively, \"how about Brian?\" \n \nBrian. Which is interesting, since \"Brian\" is, you know, his actual name. \n \nI hadn't really considered using his actual name. I was coming up with names like Terrapin and Wonderdude, but \"Brian\"?\u00a0 Never occurred to me. \n \nEven when my own real name became linked to the blog, I continued to refer to Bud as \"Bud,\" with the hope that in the future, it would be difficult for people to Google him and land here. My reasoning was that it would give grown-up Bud the option to disavow all connection to blogger me in the future, if he chose to do so. (Though, frankly, if Bud ever has concerns of that magnitude, this blog will be gone before you can say \"toaster brain.\") \n \nSo, for Brian to opt to be Brian here in blogland?\u00a0 Well, suffice it to say that I take it as a good sign that my husband is not reserving the right to disavow all connection to me at some point in the future. \n \nAnyway, back to the point of the story: Brian and I got married in June. I'll skip the back-story of our relationship, except to say this: with him, I have exhaled for the first time in a very, very long time. \n \nOur wedding was perfect - a small gathering in the backyard of our good friends. During the ceremony, Brian's brother did a reading that we'd chosen because it resonated so completely for both of us. It's called \"A Marriage\" and it was written by Michael Blumenthal.\u00a0 It goes like this: \n \nYou are holding up a ceiling \nwith both arms. It is very heavy, \nbut you must hold it up, or else \nit will fall down on you. Your arms \nare tired, terribly tired, \nand, as the day goes on, it feels \nas if either your arms or the ceiling \nwill soon collapse. \n \nBut then, \nunexpectedly, \nsomething wonderful happens: \nSomeone, \na man or a woman, \nwalks into the room \nand holds their arms up \nto the ceiling beside you. \n \nSo you finally get \nto take down your arms. \nYou feel the relief of respite, \nthe blood flowing back \nto your fingers and arms. \nAnd when your partner's arms tire, \nyou hold up your own \nto relieve him again. \n \nAnd it can go on like this \nfor many years \nwithout the house falling. \nMy eyes are filling up right now just typing the words on the screen. The ceiling had gotten really heavy, friends. And my arms had gotten tired and were starting to feel weak. \n \nAnd then I met Brian.  \n \nI keep replaying a moment in my mind - Bud and me dancing on the lawn during the wedding reception, singing along with the Pharrell Williams song, \"Happy\" -  \"Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof...\" \n \nOur lives are still as challenging now as they were before we were together. Things are still messy and complicated and hard to negotiate. The ceiling is still there and it still needs to stay up, but it's no longer pushing us down.

Breathing \u2013 yes.\u00a0 Eating \u2013 yes. Sleeping- maybe.\u00a0 Working- most definitely - 24/7.\u00a0 This is autism. \u00a0 Life is lived moment-to-moment.\u00a0 In anticipation of the child\u2019s next move.\u00a0 In despair.\u00a0 In fear of the future. \u00a0 This is autism.\" \u00a0 - Autism Speaks \"A Call For Action,\" 11/11/13 \n \nAs you might\u00a0imagine, this fear-inducing, desperation-drenched approach to \"autism awareness\" has been received with anger and offense from a large portion of the autism community, who believe that, in fact, they really  are  living - and quite well, thank you. \u00a0 \n \nIn response, the  \"This is Autism\" flashblog  was born - a single day on which bloggers from all areas of the autism blogosphere, autistic and neurotypical alike, would write about what autism is to them. \n \nThere is plenty I could say I could say about my life as the parent of a child with autism. \u00a0It is hard, exhausting, beautiful, inspiring, challenging, exciting, messy, ugly, rewarding, confusing, and wonderful. \u00a0In other words,  as Emily Willingham says , it is just plain PARENTING. \n \nBut instead of waxing on about my own experience, I decided to call on the resident expert in my household - the one who experiences autism from the inside out - to talk a little about what it really is to him. \u00a0Here's what I got: \n \nThis is Autism \nBy Bud \n \nIt\u2019s good for your brain. \n \nAutism is good at thinking. \n \nI\u2019m good at thinking about things way back when. \n \nI\u2019m also good at eating sandwiches. \n \nIsn\u2019t it great? \n \nAnd you know what? \n \nMy autism is good at things like:  \n \nI\u2019m good at eating bananas. \n \nAnd I like making PowerPoints, I do. \n \nAnd I love music. \n \nAnd I like watching Fetch on PBS Kids. \n \nAnd you know what? \n \nI\u2019ve got a computer I can play on. \n \nI can read. \n \nAnd write. \n \nI like watching Teletubbies. It begins with a capital T. \n \nI like dancing. \n \nAutism is, like, your brain. \n \nAnd there you have it. \u00a0Suzanne Wright had it partially correct: \u00a0We are breathing - yes. Eating - sandwiches. Sleeping - when we're not dancing. And working - on PowerPoints. \n \nThis is our autism. \n \nAnd our autism is, like, good for your brain. \n \n \n For some compelling responses to Suzanne Wright's statement - and for an explanation of why we'll be retiring our blue light for the awareness campaign sponsored by Autism Speaks and channeling our donations elsewhere, please read any of the following: \n \n I Resign My Role at Autism Speaks  by John Elder Robison \n \n Why Autism Speaks Doesn't Speak For Me  by Emily Willingham \n ASAN - AAC Statement on Autism Speaks' DC \"Policy Summit\" \n \n No More - A Letter To Suzanne Wright  by Jess Wilson \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismspeaks.org/news/news-item/autism-speaks-washington-call-action", "http://thisisautismflashblog.blogspot.ca/", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2013/11/13/why-autism-speaks-doesnt-speak-for-me/", "http://jerobison.blogspot.com/2013/11/i-resign-my-roles-at-autism-speaks.html", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2013/11/13/why-autism-speaks-doesnt-speak-for-me/", "http://autisticadvocacy.org/2013/11/asan-aac-statement-on-autism-speaks-dc-policy-summit/", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2013/11/12/no-more-a-letter-to-suzanne-wright/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2013/11/this-is-autism.html", "title": "\nThis is autism\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, September 08, 2013", "body": "\nTo be opened in April, 2014 \n \nDear MOM-NOS, \n \nHi. \u00a0Hope 2014 is off to a great start. \u00a0Thanks for coming back and reading this. \u00a0(Siri reminded you, right? \u00a0She lives for this kind of stuff.) \u00a0Anyway, I need to remind you of a few things, because - well, I know how you get. \u00a0Don't get me wrong. \u00a0I love your rose-colored-glasses, focus on the positive, glass-half-full approach to life. \u00a0I don't know what I'd do without it. \u00a0But right now, as you're starting to prepare for the transitions ahead, I need you to stop thinking about how great Bud is doing over there in April - about how far he has come - about all the advances he's made. \u00a0Those things are important, of course. \u00a0But as you launch into summer, I need you to remember - REALLY remember something: \n \nI need you to remember how stinking hard life is in early September. \n \nThis is not new. \u00a0You and I could have written this post virtually every September since \u00a0Bud started school. \u00a0And yet, somehow, the power and resolve we have in September to do things differently next year fades by the time we get to April. \n \nYou can't let that happen this time. \u00a0But don't worry - you don't have to come up with a plan on your own. \u00a0I'm here to help you - because from where I sit, over here in September, 2013, the answers are crystal clear. \n \nI know you understand the perfect storm that is the late summer. \u00a0It's the time when Bud makes the enormous and exhaustive transition to a new school year. \u00a0Inevitably, he finds himself struggling to acculturate in an environment that is increasingly unfamiliar to him - an environment in which the developmental divide between himself and his same-age peers is even wider than it was when they parted ways just a few months ago. \u00a0As luck would have it, it is also the time when your workload at the college quadruples - when you are pulled simultaneously in multiple directions - when you are juggling metaphoric plates and extinguishing metaphoric fires and working around the clock. \u00a0It is the time when Bud's need for routine and structure and predictability is greatest, and it is the time when your ability to provide routine and structure and predictability is lowest. \n \nIt rarely goes well. \n \nSo I'm writing from here - where, as you know, things are not going well - to remind you that this is coming and to remind you that there are choices you can make differently. \u00a0Because I know you. \u00a0In the coming months, when you start to make plans, you will not recognize that you have choices. \u00a0You will try to do it all. \u00a0You will say \"I am so lucky that Bud is doing so well that I don't have to worry that...\"  \n \nDon't. \n \nYou do have choices. \u00a0Make them carefully. \n \nHe is doing well. \u00a0But a transition is looming and in the face of transition, he will backslide. \u00a0It is not your failing or his failing or the school system's failing. \u00a0It is because he has autism and transitions are hard. \u00a0He will get through it, but he will need your focus and your attention, and if you are busy channeling your focus and your attention elsewhere, he will flail even more than he has to. \n \nSo, right now, as you start to plan out the coming months - as you start to construct a complicated calendar of summer school and childcare and vacation time and workload - \u00a0I want you to start making choices. \n \nAugust and September will be busy at work. \u00a0You can't avoid it. \u00a0But you have to - HAVE TO - sort out the \"musts\" from the \"shoulds.\" \u00a0The musts are the pieces of your position that can't be done by anyone else. \u00a0They have to be your priority. \u00a0They have to be done well. \u00a0Structure your work time and your life so that they get done. \n \nThe shoulds are the things you think you should do to prevent someone else from feeling disappointed in you, or feeling unsupported by you, or feeling like you just don't care. \u00a0I'm telling you right now: \u00a0in late August and early September, there is no room for the shoulds. \u00a0You can only do the musts. \u00a0Accept it and stop feeling guilty about it. \u00a0(Or, as your old friend from grad school used to say, \"Stop shoulding on yourself.\") \u00a0Eyes on the prize here, sister. \u00a0Your boy needs you - not the exhausted, cranky version of you that emerges when you try to do it all, but YOU - rested, focused, and happy to see him. \u00a0You can't be that you when you try to do the shoulds. \n \nI also recognize that in June and July, when you're planning your schedule for August and September. you will not be able to tell the musts from the shoulds. \u00a0But, believe me, I know the difference and I've made you some lists. \u00a0Please check your hard drive and then plan accordingly. \n \nA few specifics that I'd like emphasize for you: \n \n- \u00a0You may not work nights during Bud's first week at school. \u00a0No sitters, no making him stay at the office with you until 7:00, no working at the kitchen table before he goes to bed. \u00a0None. \u00a0I don't care what you'll miss or who will be left picking up the slack. \u00a0No matter who it is, I guarantee you that their coping skills and support systems are broader and stronger than Bud's. \u00a0No nights. \u00a0Period. \n \n- \u00a0Plan ahead so that you can pick him up from school on the first day. \u00a0It will be his first day at the high school. \u00a0It will be the only first day of high school that he has in his life, and whether it's a great day or a terrible day, you need to be there at the end of it to process it with him. \n \n- If this year is like every other year, Bud will go back to school for a few days and then have a four day weekend. \u00a0You will panic when you see this schedule, because you will believe that there is no way in the world that you can take any of that time off from work. \u00a0You will start planning to hire sitters to be with him for eight or more hours at a time, adding more transition and change into his life. \u00a0Don't. \u00a0Take the time off from work. \u00a0I'm serious. \u00a0It's April. \u00a0You have four months to plan for this. \u00a0You can do it. \u00a0So do it. \n \n- Despite all your best planning - despite your focus, your resolve, and your four day weekend - the call will come. \u00a0Someone will tell you that Bud is struggling. \u00a0Someone will ask you to help problem-solve and strategize. \u00a0Bud will have a rough patch. \u00a0This is not a judgment on your parenting. \u00a0It is not a sign of incompetence from the team at school. \u00a0It is not because Bud is a bad kid. \n \nBehavior is communication. \u00a0Listen to what Bud's behavior is telling you. \u00a0It will be telling you that change and transition are hard and there are things that he needs that he doesn't have. \u00a0Help him to get them, without blaming him, or yourself, or anyone else. \u00a0This should not be a surprise. \u00a0We should all have seen this coming. \n \nWhich brings me to why I'm making you open this way back in April and not later in the summer as you're really making hands-on plans for August and September: \u00a0I'm writing in April because I want you to talk about this at Bud's IEP meeting. \u00a0Remind people that the first weeks of the semester are going to be hard. \u00a0Remind them that his behavior might be extreme. \u00a0Remind them that no matter how solid his summer program is, he will not start the new school year where he left off last year. \u00a0He will backslide and regress. \u00a0He will also recoup and recover and make strides. \u00a0But if we want to raise the bar of expectation for Bud in the year ahead, we must start with a very low bar in its earliest weeks. \u00a0Success breeds success for this boy. \u00a0We can raise the bar incrementally over days and weeks and months, and I'll bet it will go higher than any of us imagined that it could have - but only if it starts the year very, very low. \n \nTrust me on this. \n \nOkay, that's it. \u00a0Except that, once September rolls around, if you find that this has been helpful, please revise it and send it to us in April, 2015. \u00a0We'll thank us later. \n \nGood luck, MOM-NOS. \u00a0You can do this. \u00a0And Bud and I are counting on you. \n \nAll the best, \n \nMOM-NOS \n \nP.S. \u00a0I see you've lost ten pounds. \u00a0Looking good.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2013/09/an-open-letter-to-future-me.html", "title": "\nAn open letter to the future me\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, April 02, 2011", "body": "\nToday is  World Autism Awareness Day . Homes and buildings and landmarks around the world are shining  blue lights  in its observance. All across Facebook and other social media, links are being shared, videos are being posted, status updates are being written, and avatars are being changed to shining blue lights.  \n \nBut so what?  \n \nDoes it really matter?  \n \nIn a world full of wristbands and ribbons and tinted avatars and status updates that that try to inspire through belittlement \u2013  \u201cMost people won\u2019t have the courage to post this as their status for even one hour...\u201d  \u2013 is the Light It Up Blue campaign just the next phase in our slacktivist culture? Is it simply another version of posting a bra color for breast cancer awareness or a favorite cartoon character to combat child abuse?  \n \nI\u2019ve thought about it a lot. And I\u2019ll tell you the truth: I\u2019m not sure.  \n \nBut I don\u2019t think so.  \n \nI had a great conversation about it\u00a0with my friend Wonderfriend today. Wonderfriend does not have a child on the spectrum, but as a Speech Language Pathologist, she is a fierce advocate for the cause and she works tirelessly with her clients with autism. She\u2019s also smart and media-savvy, and as such, she eyed the flurry of blue light bulbs through a lens of healthy skepticism.  \n \nWe held our conversation in a somewhat public forum \u2013 via our Twitter streams \u2013 and we got good feedback from mutual friends who had seen it. Too often, I think, we folks in the autism community approach controversial issues from one of two postures: offensive or defensive. And all too often, regardless of the outcome of the conversation, we feel exhausted by the battle itself - defeated, sometimes, even in our moral victories. \n \nBut I don\u2019t think it has to be that way. I was so glad to have an opportunity to talk through my perspective with Wonderfriend \u2013 a woman I know to be smart and thoughtful and committed to the cause. I appreciated the gentle challenge and the opportunity to try to give shape to my thoughts \u2013 and, to some extent \u2013 to clarify for myself what it is that I think.  \n \nWith Wonderfriend\u2019s permission, I am posting our exchange here. It is, of course, written in 140-character chunks and, therefore, like most Twitter exchanges, it reads more like haiku than like conversation. And since we weren\u2019t always logged in at the same times, the flow isn\u2019t always there. But the open exchange of ideas is there. The respect is there. The thoughtfulness is there.  \n \nAnd really, isn\u2019t that what any awareness day should be about?  \n \nHere it is:  \n \n wonderfriend  Friends, help me understand...are the blue lightbulbs for autism different than stating your bra color for breast cancer? Trying to get it.  \n 16 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  I keep thinking of @whymommy's essays ( here \u00a0&  here )\u00a0about social media awareness events. I feel uncomfortable.  \n 16 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  Everyone's heard of autism now, where do we go next with awareness/education? Resources, orgs that are doing good research?  \n 16 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I think it's different from bra meme, which was FB only. This is FB promotion of real-life campaign.  \n 13 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend More akin to pink ribbons for breast cancer.  \n 13 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I don't think the awareness is really there yet. In some circles it is, of course. But not as widely as it needs to be...  \n 13 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend ...in terms of it translating into choices at the ballot box. House of Reps here just voted for MAJOR cut in services. Devastating cuts.  \n 13 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I think the outcry would be greater if people truly understood the impact. It starts w/ knowing just how many kids are affected.  \n 13 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend On a more personal level, it felt pretty great when one of my staff members texted me to ask where she could find a blue bulb.  \n 13 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend It gave her a tangible way to say \"I'm with you.\"  \n 13 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos Yes, this makes sense. Good examples of the difference. I feel more comfortable about it. Thank you!!  \n 12 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos Were you at protest rally yesterday? My friend was there with a UU contingent. \n 12 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos I fear these cuts are coming in every state, from what I'm hearing. Social services, education, disability services. Devastating.  \n 12 hours ago   \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos I just think it's so serious that I'm probably overly concerned/sensitive about where our energies are placed right now.  \n 12 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I wasn't at the rally because it was during the work day. SO grateful to those who were. One of the most unsettling aspects...  \n 5 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend ...was the pride House GOP seemed to take in passing their cuts in the face of protests. Almost frightening.  \n 4 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I hear you re: energies. I think of it this way: the best candidate in the world can't accomplish anything unless s/he gets...  \n 4 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend ...elected. So while big money for campaigning seems ill-spent (i.e., why not redirect it to people who really need...  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend ...it), it's actually an investment toward a much bigger goal that will ultimately be more far-reaching in its effect on...  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend ...people's lives. I think the blue light campaign is similar. Blue Empire State building = Springsteen at an Obama rally.  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I did write to my House reps before the vote, & was delighted to see they both voted against the cuts. Will follow w/a thanks.  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos This is the kind of connection that makes sense to me. I wish that in the [few] references I've seen to the blue lights...  \n 4 hours ago   \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos ...there was more of a connection made as to its political or bigger-picture goal. I looked at it and was not sure what ppl want.  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos I don't love Autism Speaks, so raising more $ for them isn't enough for me personally.  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos thanks for having this conversation with me, I didn't intend to challenge anyone's intentions but I think it's so important  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos ...to look carefully at some of the \"post this for one day\", \"share your bra color!\", \"turn your twitter avatar green\", etc...  \n 4 hours ago   \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos ...kind of \"soft activism\" that I am extremely wary of. I'm not a pink ribbon gal, either. I get this better now, appreciate it!  \n 4 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend Absolutely. Pseudo-activism can lead to complacency. Feeling like you're doing something is not the same as doing something.  \n 4 hours ago   \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos That's it. And when I see a large group of ppl putting a lot of energy into sthg that is temporary in nature I get nervous.  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I don't love Autism Speaks either, but the reality is, they have the spotlight. I can either lobby the House reps I have or...  \n 4 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend ...I can sit home and hope for a better outcome in the next election. So far, lobbying has been more effective.  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend Same with Autism Speaks. I try to partner, but shift the conversation (had a  blog post yesterday  aiming to do just that).  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos Lobbying House reps is hugely important. If this blue campaign gives ppl a platform to do that & increases that then I get it.  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos These are the types of things that reach more ppl and are very effective, I believe.  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I think the FB platform can be really helpful. I have FB friends who are not in my everyday life - people from grammar school...  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend ...etc. They don't know my son and they may think they don't know anyone w/autism, so 1 in 110 may not mean much. This helps...  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend ...start the conversation. People tend to be more open-minded w/real-life contact.  \n 4 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos Right. But Devil's Advocate: does posting abt this campaign help more/differently than you posting your amazing blog posts on FB?  \n 3 hours ago \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I think so. Tho I'd like to believe everyone rushes off to read all my posts, I don't think they do. But if 30 of their FB...  \n 3 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend ...friends have a blue light avatar, maybe they will today. Hundredth monkey and all that.  \n 3 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I only have a lot to say abt this bc I come from a similar perspective & have been having this internal dialogue for a while.  \n 3 hours ago   \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos I can't tell you how helpful the conversation is for me!  \n 3 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos I'm only seeing references to it thru you guys, my online friends. Not at all in my client community, and I've missed any...  \n 3 hours ago   \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos ...references to it in local media. I see no blue. I think such a small proportion of parents are taking an activism role.  \n 3 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos But perhaps if it's done year after year more ppl will catch on and take the time to do it.  \n 3 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos I'm sure communities with strong leadership are more active. Here, it's *crickets* abt it so I prob don't have good sense of...  \n 3 hours ago  \n \n wonderfriend  @momnos ...how big it is.  \n 3 hours ago  \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend I think it will.

But I'll work my ass off for autism every damn day!!!! :-)  \n 3 hours ago   \n \n momnos  @wonderfriend Yeah, that'll do. :)  \n 3 hours ago  \n \n \nMy thanks to my good friend Wonderfriend - for her tireless efforts and advocacy for our kids, for a great conversation, and for her gracious permission to re-post it here.  \n \nMy thanks, also, to my district's\u00a0members of\u00a0the state House of Representatives \u2013 one a Democrat and the other a Republican \u2013 who both voted against the devastating budget cuts that won wide approval in the House this week. I\u2019d written to both of them about a month ago, urging them to vote against the cuts, which would significantly diminish support to children and adults with developmental disabilities. I read today that my Representative was one of only twenty Republicans in the state who voted against the cuts. He was quoted in the newspaper saying that his first priority was to the people in his district, his second to the people in the state, and his third to his party.  \n \nI wrote both of my Representatives again today \u2013 World Autism Awareness Day - to thank them for their votes. I also thanked my Republican Representative for his courage, acknowledging that in the current climate, it is a risky act to vote against one\u2019s party.

{"date": "Thursday, October 21, 2010", "body": "\n This post originally appeared at  Hopeful Parents  on September 11, 2010. \n Some weeks ago, when I learned that I\u2019d been assigned to write for Hopeful Parents on the eleventh day of every month, it occurred to me that I would be posting on the eleventh of September. September 11. I wondered how I would write an upbeat, positive post on such a tragic anniversary. To acknowledge the date would be somber; to ignore it, when I have been specifically designated THIS day to post, might seem disrespectful. \n \nAbout a week ago, on a day when the stress of Bud\u2019s transition to a new school year manifested in hard-to-manage behavior at home, it occurred to me that my posting date was fast approaching. I wondered how I would write an upbeat, positive post for Hopeful Parents when I was not feeling like a very hopeful parent. To acknowledge my frustration and self-doubt would be somber; to ignore it would be disrespectful to the mission of this site. \n \nAnd that led me back to thinking about 9/11. \n \nOn that day, when the first plane hit the tower, Bud and I were dancing. We were in a Kindermusik class full of parents and toddlers. We were surrounded by baby laughs and mommy hugs, while hundreds of miles away, inconceivable tragedy was unfolding. \n \nI think about those contrasting images often. \n \nThey are images that, through their contrast, capture my world view. It\u2019s a world view that may have started to develop in  my high school science class , because it seems to have its roots in Newtonian physics: To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. \n \nIn my own mind, it has become this: The universe seeks balance. \n \nIt\u2019s a theme that plays out consistently in my life. \n \nI look at pictures from Bud\u2019s second birthday party, held four days after September 11, 2001. The faces on the adults are ashen, fixed in still-fresh shock and disbelief. And yet, there we were, gathered with joy, gathered in love, gathered because a two-year-old\u2019s birthday mattered, despite the horror we were all still trying to process. We gathered to meet our grief with an equal and opposite reaction. \n \nI think about Bud\u2019s birth itself \u2013 the birth in which  his twin brother was stillborn . I think about the hours and days that followed \u2013 hours and days of profound sadness, made livable - made powerfully joyful - by the healthy baby boy I held in my arms. Equal and opposite. \n \nI think it\u2019s the way that each of us processes the balance \u2013 the way we frame the moments and events in our lives that stand together in juxtaposition \u2013 that really defines our experience. I could, I suppose, reflect on my life and feel cheated - angry that the sorrow of x diminished the joy of y. Instead, I reflect on my life and feel fortunate - grateful that the joy of y sustained me through the sorrow of x. \n \nSo, I cling to my memories of the earliest moments of 9/11 - those moments in which something was stolen from us that we\u2019ll never reclaim - and I remember the dancing. I remember the joy \u2013 and I believe that the people who were dancing, who were laughing, who were kissing, who were living with compassion and kindness at that first terrible moment of impact, created an equal and opposite force that kept us all moving forward, that allowed us to preserve something that can never be stolen. \n \nIt\u2019s the same world view that keeps me moving forward through Bud\u2019s darkest days of anxiety and aggression \u2013 because as challenging as his behavior can be, as powerless as I can feel in the face of it, I know without question that soon we will experience equal and opposite progress \u2013 equal and opposite joy. \n \nThe universe seeks balance. Better days are coming. And there\u2019s nothing more hopeful than that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/2010/09/on-balance.html", "http://www.science20.com/mom_not_otherwise_specified/physics_parenting_autism_spectrum"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/10/on-balance.html", "title": "\nOn balance\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 22, 2010", "body": "\n This post originally appeared at  Hopeful Parents  on October 11, 2010. It may come as a relief to anyone who has ever driven with me to learn that this summer, at long last, I purchased a GPS. If you have never driven with me, then I need to tell you up front that I am not writing with false modesty here. I will acknowledge that I have many talents, many gifts - however, a keen sense of direction is not among them. My problem is worse than just having a poor sense of direction, though. You see, I love road trips. I love driving to places I've never been just to see what's there. And I especially love being in the passenger seat, being in charge of changing the radio station and engaging the driver in conversation to pass the time. But I give the same warning to every driver I accompany on a road trip: \"Here's the thing,\" I say. \"The thing is, I have no sense of direction. None. Zero. But if you ask me which way to go, I will give you an answer. I won't couch my response. I won't say, 'I think it might be this way,' or 'That way kind of looks familiar,\" and I will absolutely, certainly not say 'I don't know.' I will boldly and confidently respond 'Take a right' or 'Take a left' and I will sound so absolutely sure of myself that even though I've told you all this, you will take that right or left. And about 85% of the time, I will be wrong.\" I say this. Truly, I do. I say it that clearly and that directly. And nearly every time, not long into the trip, the driver will pause at an intersection and say, \"Do I turn here?\" and I will say, boldly and confidently, \"No, keep going straight.\" And then we will go anywhere from 50 yards to 50 miles out of our way before the driver decides to turn around and try again. This is fact. So, really, believe me when I tell you that it's in everyone's best interest that I've purchased a GPS. Bud and I broke it in early this summer and we've both become big fans. Thanks to an episode of Curious George, Bud calls it our \"auto navigator\" and he wants it on at all times. At first, he seemed to think that it was kind of like the Wii. As we drove past the lake and the road edged the water, Bud coached from the back seat in the same tone he uses when he watches me try to walk the Wii tightrope: \"You're doing great, Mom! Don't let the car fall in the water!\" But now he seems to get the point of it and enjoys having the auto navigator tell us which way to go. Of course, we don't always listen to the auto navigator. Sometimes it tells us to go one way, when we'd just prefer to go another. And magically, beautifully, instead of fighting us on it, the auto navigator simply just takes a virtual look around, recalibrates, and says, \"Okay, well, now that we're  here , how about if we try going this way?\" We used the GPS for the first time on a Friday in July, as Bud wrapped up his first week in his Extended School Year summer program. As we drove, following the encouraging electronic voice of our new auto-navigating friend as she pointed us in all the right directions, I thought about how nice it would be to have a GPS for parenting. I imagined myself punching in the destination \"outburst managed effectively\" and waiting mere seconds for the instrument to calculate my route to success. How nice it would be to move forward with the assurance that if I made a parenting misstep, a gentle voice would instantly redirect me: \"When possible, make a legal U-turn.\" I reminded myself that I was not alone in that desire - that most parents would love to have this kind of instrument - though perhaps parents of children with special needs would use them more often than most. I thought about how, in the absence of a parenting GPS, we special-needs parents try to find other kinds of road maps. We try to take direction from experienced guides - those who have travelled the roads before us with success and finesse. And then I started to panic. Am I doing the same thing  on my blog  that I do when I'm the passenger in a car? Am I telling my parenting story with unwarranted confidence, leading unsuspecting parents down paths that are 50 yards or 50 miles out of their way? Should I add a flashing neon disclaimer that scrolls across the top of my blog: \"WARNING: I don't actually have any idea where I'm going here\" or, simply, \"Construction Vehicle - Do Not Follow\"? I was somewhat reassured when I reminded myself that when I'm feeling least confident, I tend to go on fewer road trips. In other words, when things with Bud are particularly tough and I  really  don't feel like I know what I'm doing, I don't usually write many blog posts. And such was the case on that Friday as I drove towards home, the GPS seamlessly laying out the route I already knew so well. I considered how little I'd been posting to my blog, how little about our life I felt I could share, and how much I longed for a Magic GPS of Autism Parenting. I thought about how hard it was to know what to do in the face of escalating anxiety and aggression. I thought about how nervous I was that summer was upon us - summer, once my favorite season, now fraught with landmines disguised as long, unstructured, routine-free days. My heart raced as fast as my brain as I thought about the weeks that had led up to the start of Bud's summer program - weeks full of e-mails and conversations that challenged me to take a stronger stand than I ever had before, that made me leave the safe haven of collaboration and step with false confidence into a land of contentiousness, as I tried to ward off a rerun of the previous summer and found myself for the very first time using phrases like \"free appropriate public education,\" \"entitled by law,\" and \"due process hearing.\" As we neared our house, my racing thoughts were interrupted by the calm, even voice of my new GPS auto-navigator, who gently reminded me that the left I was about to take was, indeed, my best alternative. The interruption changed my focus and made me consider how the parenting turns I'd made in recent weeks seemed to be playing out. We had a good summer plan in place. It wasn't ideal - it wasn't identical to my original request - but it was a good, solid plan. It was, in fact, the best Extended School Year plan that Bud had ever had. And Bud had just successfully wrapped up his first week of the Extended School Year. He'd made the transition beautifully. He'd started each school day happily - no arguing, no groaning, no long, tearful goodbyes at the door. He'd had great reports each day when his session had ended. And now, after a full week and a newly-established routine, he sat in the back seat as we headed home, humming along with the radio and talking back to the auto-navigator, happy and content. Just then, we pulled into our driveway, and the calm, even voice of our auto-navigator said one last thing: \"You have arrived.\" Startled, I looked at the screen. And there was the message, bright and glowing: \"You have arrived.\" I almost burst into tears. I had no idea how much I'd needed the validation - how much I needed to hear from a voice outside my own head that the risks I'd taken were paying off, that my judgment had not led my son 50 miles in the wrong direction, that despite my panic, we were moving toward our goal. Certainly, this was one small stop on a very long journey. Clearly, it was not the hardest leg of the trip and we'd not taken the most complicated route. But in that moment, on that day, sitting in that driveway, the words of my new-found electronic friend meant everything to me. We had arrived. The summer program played out well for Bud. I don't think I've burned bridges with the school district. And now, as we look ahead to the next phase of our journey, we seem to be facing new landscapes with what looks to be rocky terrain. I still wish I had a parenting GPS. But I'll tell you this for sure: for the foreseeable future, I'll be using the GPS I do have to chart a lot of journeys home. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/10/11/you-have-arrived.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/10/you-have-arrived.html", "title": "\nYou have arrived\n"},

{"date": "Friday, October 08, 2010", "body": "\nI've been thinking recently about the idea of a \"spectrum\" as it relates to autism. I mean, I know that when we talk about the \"autism spectrum,\" we're talking about a range of degrees to which a person can be affected by the characteristics that define the diagnosis. When we say \"autism spectrum,\" we're generally talking about a spectrum of ability that ranges from \"high functioning\" ( whatever that is ) to \"low functioning\" (whatever that is). But lately I've been thinking about the  other  spectrums that seem to come along with autism. I was talking not long ago to Bud's former teacher, the incomparable  Ms. Walker , who told me that she often thought about working with children with autism by looking at the number line that runs across the wall of her classroom. When she works with a child with, say, dyslexia, she can usually predict that on any given day, that child is going to walk into her room with a level of challenge that falls within a particular range on her imaginary number line - let's say, somewhere between 40 and 60. But, she said, with Bud, she knew that on any given day, he might enter at any point on the number-line of challenge. One day, he might walk in at negative 150. The next, he might be at positive 125. Each day stood as a discrete point on the number line, seemingly unconnected to either the day that came before or the day that would follow. Her strategies for intervention also had to run a spectrum, she learned, because a strategy that was powerfully effective one day, might be woefully inadequate the next. I thought about another kind of \"autism spectrum\" a couple of weeks ago, as we celebrated Bud's eleventh birthday. All day, I walked around with a single line from the Sting song \" All Four Seasons \" running through my head:  \"That's my baby. She can be all four seasons in one day...\" It wasn't until after I put Bud to bed that night that I had time to reflect on the day and on why that particular song kept occurring to me. I thought about the ever-changing seasons of Bud's behavior over the course of the day - a day that he'd been anticipating for months. Those seasons ran a full spectrum, cycling rapidly from sunny and bright, to stormy and imposing, to placid and serene, and back to glorious and sparkling. I thought, also, about the seasons of life - the spectrum of stages we all go through - and the way that most of progress through those seasons in a linear way, embracing the one ahead of us as we let the one behind us fall away. But Bud does not seem to be progressing through the developmental stages in life in quite the same linear way. His development, it seems, is more fragmented, with different aspects of it moving at different paces, making him seem at once so innocent and childlike, so angsty and preteen, and so grown-up and mature. I thought about his multi-stage, full spectrum development as I looked at his birthday presents - each of them treasured in its own way. Among them, I saw: A  Teletubbies  board book, designed for chubby toddler hands; Teletubbies  colorforms, for ages 3 and up; A DVD and a set of stuffed characters from the PBS preschool show  Dinosaur Train; Chapter books from the PBS Kids show  Martha Speaks , geared to children in the early elementary grades; An amazon.com gift card - just right to meet the independent spirit of the 'tween demographic in which he finds himself age-wise (and which he used to by another  Teletubbies  board book and two  Caillou  VHS tapes, which he doesn't watch, but which he needed to complete his collection); A boombox with an iPod dock, probably a big seller with teenagers, which he uses to play his country music - most definitely popular among college students; A set of DVDs from the first season of the National Geographic series  Be the Creature , featuring the Kratt brothers, formerly of the PBS Kids show  Zoboomafoo , and now in a series oriented to teens and adults; A banjo, perfect for plucking out some homespun bluegrass - which, though certainly  appropriate  for all ages, may be most popular with the grandpa set. He loves them all. That's my baby. He can be all four seasons in one day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/All-Four-Seasons/dp/B000W23ABW/ref=sr_1_cc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1286569438&sr=1-1-catcorr"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/10/full-spectrum-boy.html", "title": "\nFull spectrum boy\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 19, 2010", "body": "\nYou know how when you take a new job, you have a meeting with your employer after 90 days to see how things are working out? Well, I've been having some check-in meetings with myself now that I'm three months into my gig as a contributor to  Hopeful Parents . I've stuck to the typical 90-day review agenda - 1) what's going well, 2) what's not going well, and 3) what changes need to be made - and in the process, I've realized a few things. Lots of things are going well. I love Hopeful Parents and I love being a part of such a wonderful community of parents and writers. I like helping to direct new readers there. I like having a deadline that forces me to write something at least once a month. I've been introduced to some great new parents and I've broadened my perspective on raising a child with special needs. Some things are not going as well, though. The main issue is this: If you're a writer, you may understand what I mean when I say that sometimes writing feels like parenting. You start with raw material - a blank page - and you breathe life into it. You shape it, assess it, redirect it, and then marvel as it begins to take on a life of its own. Your essays - your stories - your blog posts - begin to feel like your children. Well, these days, with my Hopeful Parents posting, I feel like I've randomly selected a few of my children and shipped them off to go live with another family. Don't get me wrong - it's a nice family; it's a  lovely  family. But I miss having my kids at home. I've also discovered a fascinating trend in readership - or, in readership as evidenced by comments, at any rate. There's a significant subset of people who often comment here, but don't comment there. They contact me by e-mail instead or they make a comment related to my Hopeful Parents post on an unrelated post here. Some, I think, just don't comment at all. I've been wondering why this is and I've developed two theories: First, there's a lot of coming and going over at Hopeful Parents. A new kid moves in every twelve hours or so. So, you might get introduced to my kid, leave for a while, and then return to continue the conversation, only to find that several new kids are sitting in his place. You could go searching for my kid, but really, time is short, and it's just easier to wait for another opportunity to chat. That dynamic is less true over here, where life is lived at a much slower pace and my kids may linger at the table, helping themselves to one more piece of pie, for days or weeks before anyone else sits down with them. Here, there's a lot more space - physically and psychologically - for chatting. My second theory is this:   As I've said before , I think (and hope) that when people visit this blog, they feel like they're sitting down in a virtual living room with a steaming cup of coffee and a few good friends. I think the living room environment itself invites conversation. But I think, maybe, that commenting over at Hopeful Parents makes people feel like they're dropping in unannounced at my office. They never know if it's a good time and they're afraid they might be interrupting something - so they make their visits brief and they try to be unobtrusive. So, that's the overview of my 90-day review. On balance, things are going well, but I've decided to take my cue from Jess at  A Diary of a Mom  and make one small change. I'll still ship my kids off once a month to the loving family at Hopeful Parents and I'll let them spend some time there on their own. I hope you'll visit them to see how they're doing. And then, after a little time has passed and I start missing them too much, I'll bring them home and reprint them here. They can keep a bag a Hopeful Parents and spend as much time there as they like. But I hope they'll always feel at home here. I hope you will, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2010/10/18/my-holland-reprinted-from-hopeful-parents/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/10/home-is-where-posts-are.html", "title": "\nHome is where the posts are\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 20, 2010", "body": "\n This post originally appeared at  Hopeful Parents  on August 11, 2010. I've been thinking lately about the very first, honest-to-goodness, back-and-forth conversation that I ever had with Bud. I can recount it to you verbatim, because it was such a big moment that I immediately captured it in writing: Me: Let's go get your coat. Bud: Outside? Me: Yes, we're going outside. Bud (getting a ball): Ball. Me: No, we can't play ball outside today. It's too cold. Bud: Slip-ee? Me: Yes, it's slippery, too. We're going bye-bye in the car. Bud: No boots. Me: No, you don't need boots in the car. Bud was just over two-and-a-half, and he wasn't speaking much. There were occasional words and phrases - mostly  echolalia , though I didn't really know it at the time. He was already in early intervention, but he had not yet been screened for autism - though the possibility of it may have begun to creep onto my radar. But then: conversation! I was certain at the time that it was the start of what would become an explosion in language development - a sign that, within months, I would chuckle and wonder why I'd ever been worried. It was the thing that I pointed to - the thing I clung to - as I shaped a world view in which my child did not have a disability.  Yes , I thought,  his speech is delayed. But we have conversation! And we  did  have conversation -  one  conversation - when he was two-and-a-half. The next one might have been a year later; it might have been much later than that. I'm not sure, because that one was  not  captured in his baby book. I've been thinking about how that one conversation shaped my mindset in those early days. It may have held me back from really recognizing what was going on with my son's development - may have kept me longer in denial, may have made me less likely to seek additional support. But I think it played another role, too. I think it kept me focused on Bud's potential. It made me see him not as a child who  couldn't  converse, but simply as a child who  didn't  converse. There's a big difference there. With the former mindset, I think I would have viewed him as a child with limitations; with the latter, I saw him as a child facing obstacles. It helped me to focus on helping Bud master the obstacle course, rather than making it okay for him to sit out the race. And as I think about that, I think about all of the attention paid in the popular press to the \"early signs\" of autism - the behaviors that indicate that your child might have the disability. It occurs to me that we might want to start giving equal attention to a different type of early sign - the behaviors that indicate that your child with autism might have tremendous potential - tremendous ability. Even if you only see those behaviors briefly. Even if you only see them once. Bud and I have frequent conversation these days. They're different from the conversations that I imagine most parents have with their ten-year-olds. But now, as when he was two-and-a-half, our conversations are full of moments - brief illuminations - indications that he is capable of so much more and that he is constantly reaching for his capacity. Early signs. We should talk about them more. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/8/11/early-signs.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/10/early-signs.html", "title": "\nEarly signs\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 29, 2010", "body": "\n 3/31, Updated to add: Smockity has  posted an apology  to anyone who was unintentionally hurt by her original post. It seems that while I have been blissfully posting about  my son\u2019s wonderful classroom , much of the rest of the autism blogosphere has been on fire in response to a post written by a blogger called Smockity, who writes at  Smockity Frocks . First, let me offer this caveat: I know next to nothing about Smockity. I have read just one of her posts. My understanding is that she has no connection to autism and that, in fact, she had no idea that she was writing about an autistic child when she wrote a blog post called \"In Which Smockity Considers Jabbing A Ball Point Pen Into Her Eye,\" which has since been removed from her blog, but is cached  here . In brief: Smockity's post was, I think, intended to be a humorous account of a visit to the library, during which she and her children encountered a grandmother with a child who bounced on her toes, flapped her hands, and used perseverative language. Most of us in the autism community recognized this child - and this grandmother - instantly. Smockity did not. Her post unfolded as a diatribe against the sort of parenting (or grandparenting) that yields rude, self-indulgent, ill-mannered children. Much has been written about the post, the response, and Smockity's response to the response. Both  Squidalicious  and  Liz Ditz  have posted links to responses that reflect outrage, disbelief, and the feeling that I had when I read Smockity's post - a sinking recognition that perhaps all those times when Bud has struggled in public and I've left a place red-faced and anguished, afraid I'd been judged or mocked or disdained by the people around us, I'd been right. As I read, I remembered why I stay home so often, skipping the trips to the places I want or need to go, simply to avoid the potential of having to manage a difficult situation under public scrutiny. But, again, I don't know Smockity. I don't know her motivation for writing the post and I don't know how she feels right now. She has replaced her original post with a  new message , in which she says that she won't respond to attacks on Twitter, e-mail or blogs. Let me be clear - I don't intend to attack Smockity with this response. But I also try to put myself in her shoes. I'm certain that there have been times in my life when I've said something that I  thought  was humorous, but which actually offended someone. There are times when someone has called me out for being thoughtless or insensitive and I have reacted defensively. There have been times when I should have said I was sorry, but - because of my defensiveness, or my pride, or my embarrassment - I didn't. But I would like to believe that, in each of those cases, though I was unable to step up and own my mistakes, I spent countless hours in private reviewing them, imagining do-overs, and preparing myself to act differently in the future. I'd like to believe that Smockity is doing that now. If I were her, even if I said I wasn't going to read the blog posts that were written about me, I know that I wouldn't be able to stay away. I'd read them privately, and I'd seethe, or I'd cry, or I'd scream, or I'd feel really, really bad. So, I'm writing this post in the hope that Smockity, or others who saw themselves in her words, will read it and think. My full-time job is in college student affairs, and there are two things we talk about a lot in my department: utilizing teachable moments and providing opportunities for student learning. We recognize that students may not take advantage of the opportunities we provide, but we provide them all the same. We look for a moment to present itself, then we try to shape the experience or the conversation in that moment to meet a student where she is and to help her to consider a picture that is just a bit bigger. This feels like a teachable moment, and I'd like to provide an opportunity for some learning. You see, I saw myself in the grandmother in Smockity's post, as she stood with her granddaughter, waiting for Smockity's children to finish on the computer. Smockity writes, \"The girl never left her position at the computers and continued bouncing, flapping, and proclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m waiting patiently! It\u2019s almost my turn! I\u2019m being patient, Grandma!\u201d to which Grandma would reply, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Preciousdarling Angelface, You are being very patient. Just one more minute.\u201d This was repeated\u2026 repeatedly. Do you ever get the distinct feeling that, although a speaker is not addressing you directly, the message that is being spoken is intended just for you?\"  Of course, I can't know what the grandmother's intentions were, but had I been in her place, I would have done the same thing. Through my inflection, my repetition, and my use of language that seemed both  intentional  and  unusual , I would have been trying to send a message to Smockity. My message would have been something like this: I know that your children were at the computers first, and I know that I have no right to ask them to step aside and make room for my child, but here's the thing: you have NO IDEA how important this activity is to him, nor how hard he is working at holding it together right now. Your children look delightful and I'm sure they enjoy playing on the computer, but I have a hunch that this might be one of many things that they enjoy. I imagine that your children play with friends, that they enjoy board games, that they have a variety of interests, and that if this computer were not available to them, they would be able to think of ten other things they'd enjoy doing just as much. But, I'm telling you, that is not the case for my child. My child has been talking about THIS game on THIS computer at THIS library all week. And by that, I don't mean once a day all week. I mean from the moment he has woken up until the moment he has fallen asleep, he has talked about nothing but THIS game on THIS computer at THIS library. Our day, our week - it seems, even, our life - has been built around this moment, and I have to tell you: if this computer is not available to him, he will not be able to think of ANY other thing he would like to do, because right now, at this stage in his life, he does not play with friends, he does not enjoy board games, he does not have ANY other interest beyond THIS game on THIS computer at THIS library. And I know that's not your fault or your problem, and I know that your children have every right to keep on playing until they're finished, but I'm BEGGING you, PLEASE - can you help me out here? Can you intervene? Can you suggest that maybe they could finish up in five minutes, ten minutes, SOME predictable time frame so that I'll know how long I have to manage this situation and help this child hold himself together? Please? That would have been my message. But my WORDS would have sounded something like this: \u201cThat\u2019s right, Preciousdarling Angelface, You are being very patient. Just one more minute.\u201d Repeatedly. And the flapping. Let me tell you about the flapping. Bud's flapping provokes two simultaneous, equally strong reactions in me. The first is trepidation, because Bud's flapping in public instantly presents him as \"other\" to the strangers around us, as this child's did with Smockity. But the second is delight, because when Bud flaps, I know that he is experiencing genuine excitement and joy. Bud's flapping is a physiological response to emotion, and he flaps because  his hair-dryer brain  processes excitement and joy differently from our toaster brains. Bud flaps with excitement the same way that people laugh when something is funny - automatically, immediately, and reactively. Bud could no more keep from flapping when he's happy than I could stop my stomach from growling when I'm hungry. That's what I'd say to Smockity, if I had an opportunity to say something to Smockity. But she may not come over here. She may let the opportunity pass. So, here's another idea. This Friday, April 2, is World Autism Awareness Day. Autism mom and blogger Jean \" Stimey \" Winegardner has written a  measured, thoughtful response for The Washington Times , which is directed to people who don't have direct experience with autism. Let's pass it on to the people we know, and ask them to pass it on to the people they know who  don't  know anyone with autism, but who may encounter them in the supermarket, on the playground, or in the library. Let's give people an opportunity to think about their reactions before they are forced to react. World Autism Awareness Day. It's a teachable moment. Let's provide an opportunity for a little learning.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.smockityfrocks.com/2010/03/an-apology.html", "http://www.smockityfrocks.com/", "http://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B5C2Ta2YGCfTYmRhOTliZTUtNjQ5ZC00MmNjLWJmYzItNWU5MjNlYzU4ZTc3&hl=en", "http://www.squidalicious.com/2010/03/susan-senator-interview-smockityfrocks.html", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/a-message-for-smockityfrocks.html", "http://www.smockityfrocks.com/2010/03/1846.html", "http://www.stimeyland.com/", "http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/autism-unexpected/2010/mar/28/when-autistic-behavior-misunderstood/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/03/autism-awareness-and-smockity-flap.html", "title": "\nAutism awareness and the Smockity flap\n"},

But, I'm telling you: IT. WAS. INCREDIBLE. I can't even  begin  to describe how affirming it is to face a circle of children who have opted to stay at their desks for lunch and recess because they want to learn more about your child. This was a completely optional conversation for them, yet almost every child stayed. There were a few boys who chose to hold on to their recess time (and I have a hunch they are boys who NEED their recess time to make it through the rest of the school day), but even there - when they returned to class after recess and found there were still about ten minutes to go, they joined right in, asked questions, and seemed as interested as those who had been there all along. And those who had been there all along? They were AMAZING. I'd prepared myself for some snickering. I'd prepared myself for some walls of coolness and some discomfort with difference. But the classroom today was completely void of attitude. There was plenty of laughter, but it was the laughter of recognition and understanding. There was plenty of laughing  with , without a hint of laughing  at . I'd planned a presentation and I'd hoped for some conversation, but I had no idea how eager these children would be to interact. They were fully engaged, their hands flying in the air, their eyes shining, hoping for the opportunity to let me know how well they knew Bud, what they had seen, what they had wondered, what they already knew and understood. And as they spoke, I realized: they get him. They may not have known  why  he is the way he is, but they understand and they respect  that  he is the way he is. Have I said it enough? I love these children. I want to post more about the presentation itself, so that you can experience it as I did. I can't imagine trying to fit it all into a single post, because there is just too much to say, so I think I'll take it post-by-post, day-by-day. I structured the presentation around  the questions the children had written , so over the next week or so, I will post a different question each day. And as you read, you'll have to imagine a room full of ten-year-olds, their heads bobbing, their hands raising, and their understanding growing.

{"date": "Friday, January 08, 2010", "body": "\nI have this theory that someday I will be looking through a new acquaintance's old vacation photos and I'll see myself in the background of a picture. Think about it: when you're snapping pictures in a touristy area, you always capture images of lots of other people standing beside the people and things you are  really  trying to capture. We're all walking around with photo books full of strangers - except, my theory is, it's likely that some of those strangers we encountered in our past are actually people who will be important in our future; we just don't recognize them at the time. I've got nothing to back this up, of course. I just believe that it happens. It's stuff like this: Shortly after KAL from  Autism Twins  won the  Ice Out '08  competition on my blog, we discovered that we went to college together. We graduated from the same university the same year. We didn't know each other, but I bet we passed each other in the student union and said hello. I bet I dropped my student ID in the dining hall and she picked it up and handed it back to me. I bet we took Intro to Psych in the same massive lecture hall. And I bet the professor even mentioned autism. We were probably sitting next to each other that day. I bet there were all kinds of coincidences. We just didn't know it. And then there's Niksmom from  Maternal Instincts . We discovered about a year ago that we had a mutual Facebook friend. It seems that Pearl, a woman who is like family to me, the mother of my dear friend Kay, worked with Niksmom in the late eighties. Upon discovering the connection, Pearl produced a twenty-year-old photograph of Niksmom sitting in their living room - a living room so familiar to me that it could be my own. For all I know, I arrived at their house as that gathering was breaking up. Perhaps Niksmom and I passed in the driveway. Maybe I sat down in the chair she'd just vacated before the seat was even cold. And now that I think about it, Kay and I are friends from college. Kay was probably KAL's lab partner in some general education science course. I think this stuff happens. All. The. Time. Interestingly enough, I've been thinking about this because I've been thinking about Brad Paisley and my friend Kiki. In late August, 2007, to celebrate our mutual birthdays, my friend Kiki and I traveled two hours to a county fair to see a Brad Paisley concert. On the way, I told her the remarkable story of Bud and Dierks Bentley's hair - a  story that had unfolded  two weeks earlier. A few months later, Kiki and I  went together  to see Dierks Bentley. Then, this past July, I was at home when my cell phone rang. It was Kiki, who was vacationing with her husband and son in Washington, D.C. \"You will never believe where I am,\" she said when I answered. \"I'm at the Lincoln Memorial, standing twenty five feet away from Brad Paisley.\" Brad was there shooting a video. Kiki and her family just happened to be walking by, and they stayed to watch. Then they were invited to join the crowd as the crew started filming some footage. Less than two months later, I was with Kiki when I saw that Brad's video had been released online. The song was Welcome To The Future - a song that, in fact, I'd  blogged about  the previous month. We pulled the video up on my laptop. It prominently featured children - including children with disabilities. Its message was one of hope, of promise, and of potential. Before it was over, I was crying - but not crying so hard that I missed the images of Kiki's family, their hands in the air, singing along with Brad Paisley. Two weeks later, I  stood backstage  at the very same county fairground where Kiki and I had seen Brad two years earlier, almost to the day. I stood with Brad and Dierks and Bud, my boy whose disability had made this meeting possible - my boy, who at that very moment, was so full of hope, of promise, and of potential. As we stood there together, the crew on stage next to us tested equipment and the opening strains of Welcome to the Future filled the air. Despite my preoccupation with keeping Bud regulated, I thought of Kiki and felt like I should somehow acknowledge the bigger picture - the coincidence, the synchronicity - this fairground on this weekend, these lives that have intersected, this child with this disability, this song and this video - this hope, this promise, this potential. But I didn't have the words. And so I let the moment pass. But I'm thinking that Brad Paisley might want to pull out some of his old photo albums and check out the background of pictures from his childhood trips to Disneyworld and the like. Because I have a hunch that he just might see me standing there somewhere, perhaps looking distracted in line for It's A Small World. Or maybe he'll see my friend Kiki. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismtwins.blogspot.com/", "http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/welcome-back-to-future.html", "title": "\nWelcome (back) to the future\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, February 20, 2010", "body": "\n I've been given an incredible opportunity. It's been two weeks since the opportunity was presented to me, and I'm still reeling from the possibilities it holds. I've  already told you  that Bud's teacher, Ms. Walker, and his paraprofessional, Mrs. Nee, are incredible. But I haven't come close to telling you how incredible they really are - because, really, until two weeks ago, I didn't know. We'd been talking about trying to find a time to meet for a regular, non-IEP, non-crisis-management parent-teacher conference, and two weeks ago Ms. Walker and Mrs. Nee found themselves with an open afternoon. They e-mailed me to see if I was free, and I was, so we planned on getting together for a quick meeting. Two hours (and many laughs and a few tears) later, I left the meeting with my head spinning. These women are REMARKABLE. Their teamwork is remarkable. Their classroom is remarkable. Their stories are remarkable. Their understanding of and love for my son is remarkable. And the progress that Bud has made with them is truly remarkable. I spent large portions of our meeting saying things like \"this is incredible\" and \"you need to present this at a national conference\" and \"you guys should write a BOOK!\" They are that good. And in the midst of their reports on Bud's significant progress and on their insights, their strategies, and their incredible year of highs and lows, they presented me with an opportunity. It started as a story: Ms. Walker had been reading a book to the class while Mrs. Nee and Bud were out of the classroom. The book,  Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key , is about a boy with ADHD and is written in the first person, from Joey's point of view. They had gotten to a section of the book in which Joey talks about taking medication. Ms. Walker stopped reading to have a brief discussion about what it means to take medication - explaining that some medications fix things and that other medications just make symptoms more manageable. A child raised her hand. \"But,\" she asked, \"there isn't a medication that can make Bud different, is there?\" Her brave and heartfelt question opened a floodgate from her peers:  Bud has autism, right? But what is autism? Will Bud ever be like the rest of us? Ms. Walker was caught off guard; she hadn't anticipated this turn in the conversation. She didn't feel prepared to answer their questions, but she knew that their questions were important ones and that honoring them could lead to extraordinary understanding. They were questions whose answers could make a difference in everyone's life. So she suggested a solution to the children:  maybe Bud's mom would be willing to come in and answer some of your questions.  The children were enthusiastic about the idea. At that point in the story, Ms. Walker handed me a stack of index cards filled with ten-year-old scrawl. \"I told the kids to write down any questions they had, and I said I would ask you if you'd be willing to come in. I told them they could ask anything at all, and you would decide if anything was too private to share.\" I started flipping through the cards. They blew me away. What is autisim Why does he move in circles Mrs. noos.... Do you know all the Diffrent ways Bud learns? How come nose bother Bud so much Why Dose Bud repet so many lines from TV shows or movies? Why Dose Bud Have to move so much? - What disability does Bud have? - Please explain. - Was he born this way? - How did it happen? - What goes on in Bud's head? - Why does he repeat things? - Why does he run in circles? - How can I help? - How come Bud gets attatched to people and then always wants to be with that person? - Does Bud know he's different? - Why does Bud have Awesome hearing? 1.

I didn't take a moment to think about it. \"Yes,\" I said. \"I would love to come in and talk with the class.\" We decided that we'd find a time when Bud would not be there, and that we'd offer it as an option to the kids - they could opt to eat their lunches in the classroom with me, or skip the presentation and have a regular lunch period in the cafeteria. I told Ms. Walker and Mrs. Nee that even if just one child stayed behind, I would consider it time well spent. Ms. Walker assured me that more than one child would opt to stay. \"These index cards were optional,\" she said. \"They wanted to fill them out.\" I've spent the last two weeks mulling over the children's questions, developing analogies, and thinking of examples that they'll be able to relate to their own lives. I keep thinking about  this comment , which arrived a couple of months ago, and about the way that a well-placed conversation might have made a difference in the life of the commenter and the children he encountered. I keep thinking, especially, about particular questions that Bud's classmates asked: How can I help Bud not worry about things? How can I be a person Bud would like to hang out with? What can I do to be a better friend to Bud? How can I help Bud? How can I help? How can I help? I love these children. I love these teachers.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 24, 2010", "body": "\nThree days ago, KathieC left  a comment  that I can't get out of my mind. \"I wish,\"  she wrote.  \"How much of my son's life have I spent saying those words \"I wish\"... My little man is Bud's age and I often feel, when reading your blog, that I am reading about him. That is, until I get to the posts about his supportive educational environment. Reading this particular post, fresh on the heels of chaperoning my little man's postponed Valentine's dance was too much for me. I spent the hour and a half watching him dance and twirl by himself. Watching the other kids point at him and laugh behind their hands. Watching my sweet, loving boy surrounded by a margin of empty space that no NT child would enter. You and Bud are so incredibly fortunate. I wish ...\"  My heart breaks for KathieC and her son. I want to give advice. I want to be able to say, \"okay, here's how we did it...,\" but, truly, all I can come up with is this: First find a teacher who is flexible, creative, and insightful. It would help if she has had experiences in her life that make her understand your son from the inside out. Then add a paraprofessional who is working on a degree in education and who approaches her work as both teacher and student, as eager to learn from Bud as she is to teach him. Throw in a special ed team who collaborate well and are quick to think outside the box. Let them start working with your child in Kindergarten and continue to work with him as he progresses through each grade. Choose people whose smiles and enthusiasm would suggest that they are neither overworked nor underpaid, even if you suspect that they may be both. Then add a room full of children who have grown up in a positive, affirming school environment. Put them in a school in which, when you walk through the halls and past classrooms, you hear the warm responsiveness of teachers who never seem to raise their voices in anger, even when they don't know you can hear them. I know. I might as well be saying \"click your heels three times and sprinkle a little fairy dust.\" I might as well be saying \"just keep wishing.\" KathieC is right: Bud and I are so incredibly fortunate. It may have been luck that landed us in this school with these people, but still - it's NOT luck that makes these people do what they do. Their actions, their attitudes, and their approaches are intentional. They do what they do for a reason, and it works. Or it doesn't work - and then they recognize it, rethink it, and try something else. I would like to believe that many teachers whose classrooms are not working for our children are  willing  to try a different approach, but don't know where to start. Maybe they just need some great ideas - some things to get them started - a few sure-fire successes that will set their classroom communities in motion and build their confidence to keep on trying. So, what do we have to offer them? If you're a parent, what has worked for your child? If you're a teacher, what has worked in your classroom? If you're just a person who has great ideas, what great ideas do you have? What do you wish more people were doing? Let's try to be concrete here. Let's give people some actual, tangible ideas of things they can pick up and start implementing next week. I'll go first: A couple of months ago, Ms. Walker and Mrs. Nee started a program called \"Bud's Buddies.\" Each week, one child in the class is Bud's \"buddy.\" That child goes to the school door with Mrs. Nee to greet Bud in the morning (since Bud arrives a little late to avoid the big crowds) and also walks out with them at the end of the day (since Bud leaves a little early to avoid the big crowds). The buddy partners with Bud here and there throughout the day and throughout the week - on math, on reading, on whatever activity presents the best opportunity, always under the guidance of Mrs. Nee or Ms. Walker. Through their one-on-one interactions, Bud and his buddies get to know each other better and come to understand each other more. \"Bud's Buddies\" is an optional program. So far, no child has opted out. Okay, folks, it's your turn. You are the wisest people I know. Let's come up with a few great ideas, so that if teachers Google \"best practices in inclusive classrooms\" and land here, or if parents stumble onto this post wishing their child's class could be different, they'll walk away with a plan for trying something new or with a suggestion to offer that might help make their wishes come true.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/02/wish-list.html", "title": "\nWish list\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, February 09, 2010", "body": "\nI wrote  my first blog post  five years ago today. Five years. It's wild. It was a lifetime ago. It was yesterday. Gwuinifer  was the first person to post a comment on the blog and I was  astounded  that somebody was reading what I wrote. I think that for a long time she was one of the  only  people who read what I wrote. In those days, nobody in my real life knew about my blog and most of my posts yielded few, if any, comments. I'd started blogging as a means of sorting out my thoughts, but communicating with Gwuinifer opened my eyes to the possibility that blogging could be more - that it could connect me to other people who were travelling similar paths. But even with that realization, I never really imagined how important those connections would become to me. Gwuinifer and I haven't stayed in touch, though I still pop over to her blog now and then to see if she's posted any new pictures of her beautiful children. And there have been other bloggers (and commenters and non-commenting, e-mailing readers) over the years with whom I've connected, then drifted. But there have been even  more  bloggers and commenters and e-mailing readers who have become an integral part of my life, and upon whose wisdom I have come to depend. At some point in the past five years, I also started sharing my blog with people I knew - tentatively at first, because I was afraid that mentioning my blog to people would make me seem self-indulgent. But people were gracious and encouraging. They began passing the link on to other people. For a long time, I thought I was living safely under a shroud of pseudonymity, until one day, a colleague stopped me at the salad bar at work and said \"I love your blog.\" At first, the thought of being \"known\" was jarring - even panic-inducing. But then I came to realize that the blog helped people to see Bud differently. Reading about our challenges helped people in our lives know how to reach out and offer support. I began to see how, in very tangible ways, the blog was making a difference in our lives. And so, over the past five years, I've loosened my death-grip on anonymity and that freedom has allowed for even more connection and even greater depth. My life outside the blog has changed in the past five years as well. It's changed in some big, huge, tangible ways - like, I was married five years ago, and now I'm not. And it's changed in some smaller, but significant ways as well. Five years ago, I'd never heard of  Dierks Bentley , and if you'd asked me, I probably would have said I wasn't really into country music. Five years ago, I'd never taught a  writing course , and if you'd asked me, I probably would have said I wasn't really a  writer . Five years ago,  I wrote  that I saw Bud's PDD-NOS diagnosis as a \"sweatshirt-that-never-really-fit-right-but-is-the-right-weight-for-this-weather-so-I'll-wear-it-cause-it's-better-than-nothing.\" Now, I see it as his skin. Five years ago, I was preoccupied with concern about causation and cure. Now, I am motivated by ideas about education and support. Of course, the biggest changes I've seen over the past five years have been in Bud himself. When I started writing, he was five years old and in preschool. Today, he participated in his  fourth grade  music class recital, singing \" Trying To Stop Your Leaving \" to his class through the microphone of his karaoke machine. Five years ago, his spontaneous language was limited and making meaning of his echolalia-based speech felt like  sheer Holmesian deduction . Now, though Bud still loves a mitigated script, we are able to have full reciprocal conversation. Five years ago, Bud's whole world revolved around the  Teletubbies . Now, though he still loves \"the guys,\" he says he prefers his  real-life friend . We've been through a lot in five years: a lot of challenge, a lot of upheaval, a lot of triumph. And it's hard to look back on the past five years of blogging without starting to wonder what the next five years will hold. But I remember someone commenting to me during a particularly difficult time in my life that it's a good thing we never know what life has in store for us, because if we knew what was coming, we'd be sure we couldn't handle it. Since then, I've tried not to project myself too far into the future, for fear of creating unreasonable expectations or self-imposed limitations by presupposing what the goals should be or by failing to imagine possibilities. But still. In five years, Bud will be fifteen and I will be the mother of a high schooler. And what about you? Will we all still be here, floating around together in the blogosphere? Or will we have become like Gwuinifer and me - people with fond memories who used to be in touch? One way or another, let's make a plan. Let's plan to meet back here five years from now. I'll write down the password and tuck it away somewhere, so that if I've stopped blogging by then, I'll still know how to log in. We can all gather here in my  virtual living room , pour some coffee, reminisce and catch up. What do you say? Are you in? We may not know what else the next five years will bring, but one thing's for sure: February 9, 2015?  That's  going to be a heck of a time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://littlecarradines.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/02/five-and-time.html", "title": "\nFive and time\n"},

There's a moment that captures their relationship for me and I replay it in my mind all the time. \n \nIt was late summer and my dad had recently arrived at - or perhaps been led to - the difficult decision that it was time for him to stop driving. The truth is that it was long past time, but, anyway, the end had finally come. We had not yet gotten rid of his car, though, so it sat untouched in the driveway for several weeks. \n \nOne afternoon during that time, I was in the backyard mowing the lawn and Bud and my dad were in the front yard, where my dad was puttering in his garden with Bud's eager assistance. A short time later, I looked up from my mowing to see my dad's car slowly creeping down the street past the house - and I mean  truly  creeping - he couldn't have been going more than five miles an hour. \n \nI couldn't believe it:  He's sneaking out! \n \nThen I wondered if he'd left Bud alone in the front yard. As I started to turn off the mower to investigate more closely, my dad's car stopped about 100 yards past the house, swung into a u-turn, then started creeping back up the street and past the house in the other direction. \n \n What is he  doing ?,  I wondered, unable to generate any theory at all. \n \nSure enough, though, once the car was about 100 yards past the house in the other direction, it swung in a slow U and started making it's way back. I walked out to the front of the house just as the car crept past the driveway, and there they were - Butch and Sundance - my dad doing his illicit driving and my son sitting illicitly in the always-verboten front seat next to him. \n \nAs they passed the driveway again, Bud glanced out the window and saw me. His face registered an instant \"oh, crap - we're busted,\" and then he broke into a grin and waved to me. \n \nI waved back, then returned to my mowing and let them have their outlaw moment - especially since their particular brand of outlaw had such an extraordinarily sweet bent to it. \n \nI think that's the last time my dad ever drove his car. \n \nI just hope the memory of that last ride is as precious to him as it will forever be to me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/joy-ride.html", "title": "\nJoy ride\n"},

If you've ever run into Bud and me when we were out and about - at the grocery store, at the doctor's office, at the library, anywhere that might be dysregulating for Bud - in other words, just about  anywhere -  you've probably seen Bud with earphones on his ears and an iPod in his hand. Even if you only know us through the entries on this blog, you may have noticed how often Bud's iPod makes an appearance. There are actually  several   different   posts  devoted to it. In fact, Bud's iPod is such an important tool - so critical to his ability to navigate the world - that when he lost his iPod before Christmas and I had to order a new one, I found myself thinking that the cost should be covered by insurance. It's  that  instrumental. I was not surprised, then, to read Jess'  open letter to Steve Jobs , in which she let him know how important her daughter Kendall's iPod has been for her. But I was surprised by her follow-up post. Jess has teamed up with the Boston-area Autism Alliance of MetroWest to collect working iPods from people who have upgraded to newer models and put them into the hands of children and adults with autism who would otherwise not have them. Please  go here  and read about the project. And if you have an old iPod that you're not using, please pack it up and send it along.

{"date": "Sunday, April 26, 2009", "body": "\nEven though I  know  how difficult change and transition are for Bud, I am continually surprised by how difficult change and transition are for Bud. They're difficult even when they come wrapped in lovely packages. Take yesterday, for example. Yesterday was a delightfully sunny Saturday - a rare treat in April in this part of the world. Bud and I set out early, visiting two libraries and the town dump before noon, as the temperatures climbed and the delightfully sunny day became unseasonably warm, with a jump of about 25 degrees over what we've been experiencing lately. It was a welcome change for me, but, I soon discovered, less welcome for Bud. We stopped at home for a quick lunch before setting out on our next round of adventures, and I changed into shorts and a t-shirt. I brought clothes down for Bud to change into as well - and that's when the trouble began. He wasn't changing, and that was that. He was sticking with the heavyweight jeans, t-shirt, and long-sleeve sweatshirt he'd put on that morning, and no amount of coercion from me was going to change his mind. It was all I could do to keep him from putting on his coat as well. I decided to choose my battles and packed a change of clothes for him, hoping that he'd want to change once he got uncomfortably warm. He didn't. I let it go until the temperature hit 89 degrees and the threat of heat stroke outweighed my fear of battle. I convinced Bud to change by telling him that if it was warm enough for him to wear shorts and a t-shirt, then it would be warm enough for us to stop by the lake so he could put his feet in the water. He donned his shorts and took off his sweatshirt, but he kept complaining at a low rolling boil until he'd had a successful foot-dipping excursion to the lake. Then the real battle began. In retrospect, I see that Bud's perseveration about his clothing had taken over and that a portion of his preoccupation was really out of his control. In the moment, though, it felt like one of those wars Bud was waging simply because he wanted to call the shots. There's been a lot of that lately, as Bud has begun to assert himself in all his almost-ten-year-old glory - the \"I can't possibly eat peanut butter if you say I'm having peanut butter\" moments; the \"what do you mean I'm taking a shower when what I really want is a bath\" moments; the \"we can't go to the pharmacy and then the grocery store - we should go to the grocery store and THEN the pharmacy\" moments. And though, in retrospect, I see that perhaps I should have dropped it and let him wear whatever he wanted to wear, in the moment it simply annoyed me, and I ended up going toe-to-toe with him as the minutes became hours of \"I need my long pants! I need to cover my arms! I'm going to get cold! My knees will get covered in bug bites! Can I have my pants on now? I need to have my pants on. I need a sweatshirt. Will you get me a sweatshirt? I can wear my coat. Where is my coat? I need to have my coat. I know! I can wear your coat. But I can't wear shorts. My knees are sticking out. Here, I'll just put these bags on my arms.\" It was, to say the least, an unpleasant afternoon. After dinner, in hopes of salvaging the rest of the day, we struck a deal. Though it was still in the 80's outside, I agreed that he could wear his winter-weight jeans if he agreed to wear a short-sleeved t-shirt with them, and then we headed out for a walk around the neighborhood as we made peace and enjoyed each other's company. Today, we woke to another beautiful day and I resolved to do whatever it took to keep the day from escalating into another fight to the finish. If he wanted to wear winter clothing, I thought, then we'd just stay in the house, since it seems that our house was built on a glacier and it's typically ten to fifteen degrees cooler inside than it is outside. I decided that I wouldn't even bring up his choice of clothing - I'd just follow his lead. In mid-morning, I told Bud it was time to get dressed, and he wandered off to find his clothes. He reappeared after a few minutes in his underwear, with a pair of lightweight pants in his hand. \"Let's see,\" he said, ostensibly to the air, \"What can I wear today? Shorts or pants?\" I didn't reply. Neither did the air. \"Now let me think,\" he repeated. \"Should I wear pants... or should I wear shorts?\" \"I'm wearing shorts,\" I answered. \"You can wear anything you want.\" \"Okay, shorts,\" he said, and he left the room. He returned a few minutes later, still in his underwear, pants still in hand, and mused \"Hmmm... now, what will I wear today...?\" \"Wear your pants, Bud,\" I said. \"Pants?\" he asked happily. \"Yes, wear your pants,\" I said. \"Okay!\" he chirped. \"I'll wear my shorts later, okay, Mom?\" \"Okay, Bud.\" He dashed out to dress, then came back in his pants and a t-shirt, with a sweatshirt in his hand. \"And I'll wear this too?\" \"You'll be too hot in that, Bud.\" \"I'll get a red face?\" \"Yes, you'll get a red face.\" \"I don't want a red face,\" he said. \"I'll wear it another time.\" \"Good idea,\" I said. And then, though I had earlier resigned myself to staying in the house on this beautiful spring day, Bud asked \"What are we doing today?\" \"I don't know,\" I answered. \"What would you like to do?\" \"Let's go for a hike,\" he said. So we did. We spent the whole afternoon on a long hike in the woods, the sun shining through the branches, the breeze blowing through our hair, and not a bug in sight. And though I wore shorts and Bud wore pants, we were both comfortable and we didn't spend another minute discussing wardrobe. Instead, we hiked and climbed, while Bud listened to Dierks Bentley on his iPod and I listened to Bud sing along. Then we played a game that Bud developed that I like to call \" Every Style a Memory ,\" in which Bud names a Dierks Bentley track and I have to guess whether Dierks originally sang it with long hair or short hair - which may sound tedious, but was actually a welcome relief given the conflict of the day before. We spent the final half mile or so of our hike playing \"What's your favorite?,\" with me asking and Bud answering -  What's your favorite Brad Paisley song? Celebrity; What's your favorite Sugarland song? It Happens; What's your favorite Lady Antebellum song? I Run To You.  That one never gets old. And so, despite the rocky transition, it's a joy to finally welcome spring to this frozen tundra we call home. Which reminds me of one other somewhat-related update. Those of you who were around here last year at this time may recall the  Ice Out 2008  competition, in which readers placed bets on the day when the last traces of snow would disappear from my yard. I couldn't get my blogging act together enough this spring to do a repeat (though there's always 2010), but I thought you might like to know the status anyway. So, you recall that yesterday it was almost 90 degrees outside, right? This is what my yard looked like at the end of the day: Yes, that's snow. But these days, I like to think of it as nature's cooler - a place to put your beverages to keep them cold while you're outside, enjoying the sun and wearing shorts. But, really - is it any wonder that my poor linear thinker is confused by it all? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/04/long-story-shorts.html", "title": "\nLong story shorts\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, August 23, 2009", "body": "\nIt's a funny thing: when I go for long stretches of time without posting much on the blog, it's rarely because there is nothing going on. More often, I'm quiet because there is so much - so much to do that there's no time to blog; so much to say that it's hard to know where to start; so much that's complicated or sensitive that it's hard to know how to choose words and edit well; so much I need to capture without saying too much. This summer has been no exception. The blog may not reflect it, but this summer, there has been so much, so much, so much. It's been happening on all fronts. At work, at a time when things are usually slow enough to take a breath and a little time off, there has been a perfect storm of conditions that has made the summer one of the busiest times of the year. Some of it has been stressful and some of it energizing, some of it the function of conditions beyond my control and some of it entirely self-imposed, but as a whole it has simply been so much to manage - breakneck speed from the start of the day to the finish, full days worked on half-day Fridays, vacation days used to plan the classes I started teaching this week. So much, so much, so much. Home has also been busy, with both of my parents experiencing health issues we had not quite anticipated. My mom's situation has been logistically complicated but, thankfully, not serious. Still, though, there has been so much - so much scheduling, so much childcare shifting, so much wondering and asking and re-asking and confirming, so much phone-calling and doctor-talking and appointment-making - so much, so much, so much. On top of her own health issues, my mom has been managing my dad's issues, which have been so much harder to take. My dad, the man who started aging one day in his eighty-first year, the man who at 79 was so young for his age, is now, at 86, so much older than his years. There is so much overtaking him at once - so much pain, so much sensitivity, so much exhaustion, and yet so much escaping him - so much missing, so much misunderstood, so much, it seems, forever lost. It feels as though there's so much I should do, so much I should say, so much intervention that I should make - and yet, it seems there is still so much I don't know, so much I can't learn, so much that a misstep might put at stake. I fear there is so much risk of pushing him further away, so much chance of increasing his feelings of vulnerability, so much more of him to lose. And so I sit, and I hover, and I wait, and I wonder, so much. So much, so much, so much. Then I watch my son with my father, and am so much in awe of the friendship they've forged. I see between them so much compassion, so much forgiveness, so much unconditional acceptance. I look at them - this man and this boy, the bookends of my life - as they look past the limitations and see in each other only possibility, as each in his own way struggles so much to find the words that escape him and works so much to understand the words spoken to him. I see between them so much unspoken, so much understood. I feel so much gratitude that each has the unwavering certainty of the other, and yet, I can't stop myself from looking ahead - a year, two years, ten years - and thinking,  what then?  So much, so much, so much. For Bud himself, there has also been so much this summer, as so much growth has meant so much change, and so much new to grapple with. This summer, we added a new diagnosis to the list: OCD, the disorder of so much, so much, so much. For Bud, it has meant that so much of his anxiety has had an obsessive focus -  All is not right with my world. But if I can just  have  this thing/ do  this thing/ arrange  this thing, then order will be restored. If I can just dothisthing-dothisthing-dothisthing-dothisthing-dothisthing-somuch-somuch-somuch... until it is done. But then I see that all is still not right in my world... and so I realize that the  real  answer must have been thisotherthing-thisotherthing-thisotherthing-thisotherthing...  So much, so much, so much. Bud's Extended School Year experience imploded on itself, as another perfect storm of so much -medication changes, the sameness-but-differentness of being in a familiar school with unfamiliar people, the inability to establish a predictable routine for himself - became too much for him to manage, and I decided to pull him from the program early, so we could focus on medication adjustment with an eye toward a smooth transition to fourth grade. And now, with that transition just a week away, I worry about how it will go, because I have seen so much in Bud this summer - so much that is frustrating, and yet, perhaps, typical of an almost ten-year-old - so much argument, so much defiance, so much assertion, so much rancor. And then, mixed in and among the unpleasant moments, there is so much that is exciting, so much to celebrate. This summer, Bud has taken on so much in his own head and heart. He has conquered his longtime fear of dogs, now approaching strangers to ask if he can pet their dogs, and spending long hours begging for a dog of his own. He has learned to manage his fear of thunderstorms, drawing on so much courage, so much inner fortitude, as he names his fear and heads for the windowless bathroom with the overhead fan, riding out the storm with his iPod or DVD player, never once needing his anxiety medication. He has embraced swimming lessons, overcoming his trepidation with men and bonding with his swim instructor. He has visited our friend Kiki's farm, allowing her teenage son to help him mount a horse, then sitting calmly in the saddle as Kiki led them on a walk - all while I stood, snapping pictures yards away, my supportive presence entirely superfluous. So much, so much, so much. And so, you see why I have been absent on the blog lately - why there has been so much empty space masking so much activity and movement. But I think of this blogging community often, and I lurk on your blogs to catch up when I can. And even when I am not actively reaching out or chiming in, I am still moving through my life secure in the knowledge that you are all out there, just a few clicks away - that the cavalry will be there when I need them. It's a reassurance that carries me, a certainty that buoys me, even in - especially in - a summer of so much.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/08/summer-of-so-much.html", "title": "\nThe summer of so much\n"},

Actually, it seems that everyone I know has already read  This Lovely Life .  I keep hearing, from person after person, that Vicki's writing is so forcefully engaging that once they started the book, they were unable to put it down.  It is that good. This Lovely Life  has had the opposite effect on me.  Every time I pick it up and start reading, Vicki's writing is so forcefully engaging that it literally takes my breath away, and I need to put it down - sometimes after several pages and sometimes after just a few paragraphs. It is that good. In  This Lovely Life , Vicki writes about giving birth to extremely premature twins, Ellie and Evan, about Ellie's death just days later, and about Evan's life with profound disabilities, which started in the NICU and ended after eight years,  a year ago yesterday .  Vicki's journey and her story are entirely different from mine, but - I realize as I read - there is significant overlap in emotion, in response, in moments etched in time and impossible to reclaim.  My journey to and through parenthood has involved loss and struggle, but I don't write about it much on the pages of this blog - or, frankly, anywhere else.  I have neither the talent nor the courage to give words to those emotions or to that history - to give it shape - to make it real - to offer it up to the world at large and say, \"See?\" But Vicki has both extraordinary talent and unshakable bravery, and  This Lovely Life  is infused with both.  It is remarkable writing from a remarkable woman, and it is not to be missed. I usually wait until I've finished reading a book to endorse it, but  This Lovely Life  is a book that I will be reading for a long time, as I build up the courage to continue, and give myself time and space to be ready to move on.  If you have grieved - especially if you have grieved the loss of a child - you may be startled to find that Vicki describes with extraordinary precision emotions and reactions you thought were uniquely your own and, even, emotions and reactions you weren't aware you had until you found yourself breathless with recognition and needing to put the book down. And if you haven't suffered that kind of loss - and I truly hope you haven't - then go out right now and get  This Lovely Life , and then clear your calendar for a couple of days.

{"date": "Saturday, September 19, 2009", "body": "\nI keep thinking about Barbara Joosse's book  I Love You The Purplest . In it, two brothers ask their mother which one she loves the most. She explains that she loves one of them the reddest and the other the bluest. Together, she loves them the purplest. Why has that been on my mind? Well, today is Bud's tenth birthday. Ten years old. A decade. He understands the significance of this milestone. Last night as we cuddled before bed, he asked me if I'd still cuddle with a ten-year-old. (I assured him I would.) This morning when he woke up, he was surprised to find that he still had his nine-year-old voice. But this story really starts two days ago, when I picked Bud up early from school to take him to a doctor's appointment for medication management. On the agenda: a discussion about altering the timing of his mid-day medication in hopes of easing what has been a bumpy transition to fourth grade. Though the transition this year has not been as difficult as it's been in some other years, it has been marked by Bud's resistance to being in the classroom. It's clear to me that he likes his teacher, Ms. Walker, and the paraprofessional who works with him, Mrs. Nee. He likes the children in his class. He likes being in school. But, I think this is the year when the developmental gap between Bud and his peers has felt daunting to him. Though the atmosphere in his classroom is wonderful, the rest of it - the language, the concepts, the higher-level academic focus - has all been confusing for him. Even during down-time, his peers are all High School Musical, and he's all Clifford the Big Red Dog. It has been easier for him to choose to spend his time in the nest he's created in Special Ed with the team who is familiar, predictable, and comfortable. And so, as Bud left school early on Thursday, Ms. Walker seized the opportunity, scrapped her plan for social studies, and pulled the rest of the class together for a little impromptu planning session. Most of the children in the classroom have known Bud for a long time, though some of them have never been in his class before. Ms. Walker told them that Bud was reaching a milestone this weekend - double digits, the marking of his first decade. She reminded them how hard it can be for Bud to manage things like birthday parties and she asked them how, as a group, they might help him celebrate in a way that would be comfortable for him. They spent the rest of the afternoon putting their plan together. On Friday, Bud arrived at school to find that his classmates, Ms. Walker, Mrs. Nee, and the whole staff in Special Ed were wearing purple, Bud's favorite color, in his honor. A little later, Bud's friends presented him a book they'd made. The book is purple, of course, and it features a two-page spread of each person in his class - each child, his teacher, and his para. The first page has the person's picture and name, to help Bud get to know the people he doesn't know as well. And the second page has a birthday message - in purple ink on purple paper - to Bud from that person. As a class, they had brainstormed a list of things that make Bud special, so there are a lot of reoccurring themes on the pages of the purple book - you bring joy to our class, you always do your best, you are creative. But there are unique messages in there as well:  \"I like being your friend because you are funny, cool, and a good dancer;\" \"the songs you sing are great;\" \"I think you'r specal becase you'r joks are hulareaes.\"  Two of the children, Travis and  Kelly , wrote  \"you are one of my best friends.\" While Bud was engaged in something else, Kelly showed Ms. Walker a CD she'd brought in and together they snuck to the classroom's CD player to cue up a track. They turned the volume up slowly and watched for Bud's reaction as Dierks Bentley's \"Every Mile A Memory\" filled the room. Bud raised his head, smiled, and started singing along: \"Texas stars in a purple night, Not seein' 'em with you, baby, oh they never do look right...\" Bud's classmates from last year smiled in recognition. His new classmates listened to him, then spoke up in appreciation - \"Hey! He really  can  sing!\" Then they sang to him - but knowing that a cacophony of fourth grade voices might be overwhelming for him, this rendition of Happy Birthday was delivered in a loud whisper. And according to Ms. Walker, it was the rockin'-est loud whisper she'd ever heard. And then, finally, it was time to eat the cupcakes Bud had brought in, and he even got to bring the extras down to his friends in Special Ed. The magic didn't end with the celebration, though. It spilled over into the rest of the day. During math, the other children worked on complicated math tables that were beyond Bud's grasp, but Bud sat at a desk with Mrs. Nee and created a different kind of math table. One by one, the children approached Bud's desk, where Bud greeted them by name, and asked \"Which do you like better: cats, dogs, or birds?\" Each child gave a response (and sometimes an explanation), which Bud tallied, as the other child left to tap another friend to join Bud. The children in the class also worked together to help Bud complete a fill-in-the-blanks poem about himself, offering up their suggestions for how to complete each thought. The poem, which Ms. Walker printed out for me in purple ink, goes like this: BUD Who is  fast ,  funny ,  caring , and  cool Who finds happiness in  quiet ,  country music , and  computers Who needs  attention ,  Mom , and  friends Who is afraid of  \"boo,\"   thunderstorms , and  sudden loud noises Who would like to  play guitar ,  hang out with Dierks Bentley , and  go on a hike Who likes to wear  purple crocs ,  his dino vest , and  earplugs BUD The class commemorated the day with a group photo, which Ms. Walker printed and pasted on the last page of the purple book. It's quite an image - a sea of purple, in shades from pale lavender to deep violet; teachers and support staff framing and scaffolding around the back and edges; the middle swarming with beaming children; and, in the center, Bud, his old friend Kelly leaning in by his side, and his new friend Kallyn standing behind him, her hands gently but firmly on his shoulders, making him feel centered, and making him feel safe. If you looked at the picture, you'd be hard-pressed to figure out which child was celebrating a birthday. The smiles are wide from edge to edge - wide despite the fact that Ms. Walker had been frank with the children: this was not to be the standard procedure for celebrating birthdays this year. This time was different - because in this class, in this school, \"\"fairness\" does not equal \"sameness.\" Fairness means making sure that every person gets what she needs to succeed, and so, by definition, to be fair, sometimes we must have different rules for different people. And the children, because they are a product of this educational environment, don't just get it - they celebrate it. They celebrate it because they know that in a school in which helping a classmate get comfortable and feel included is just as important as social studies, they can be certain that every person matters. And if every person matters, then  they  matter. The children in that classroom know that they are loved. Some of them feel loved the reddest. Some of them feel loved the bluest. And when they come together in that classroom, they create the purplest community they could ever hope to find.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/09/purplest.html", "title": "\nThe purplest\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, May 17, 2009", "body": "\nIt's such a tightrope walk - such a delicate balance - so difficult to misstep as I try to tell my story without telling too much of Bud's, as I try to seek input and advice and guidance without imposing on my son's right to privacy - and without compromising any of his dignity. So I hope I am staying on the right side of discretion when I ask this question:  What do you do if your son gets to an age where it becomes less appropriate to take him into the women's restroom, if he is not able to manage the men's room on his own? Obviously, I have a mental list of every \"unisex\" or \"family\" bathroom in a fifty mile radius, and when we can, we head for those.  But sometimes we can't.  Sometimes we're in a place that simply has big, crowded, public restrooms, and one or both of us needs to use them. Right now, we're still getting away with using the women's room, but with the rate at which he's growing and developing, I know that our days are numbered.  Bud will be 10 in September.  Pretty soon it won't be okay. These days when we're in crowded women's rooms, I use the \"running monologue\" approach.  As soon as we enter, I start talking as I steer Bud toward a stall -  \"Okay, buddy, we're okay, let's head for that big stall over there, you're doing a great job, here we go, right in there, that's great.... now let's go to the sink and let's wash hands, make sure you use soap, okay dry them good, good job, buddy, now we're all done and right out the door.\"   My purpose is twofold: 1) it keeps him focused on the task at hand; and, 2) it says without saying to anyone in earshot, \"this is not a typical nine-year-old and we have a valid reason for being in here.\"  So far, it has worked.  But six months from now?  A year?  Two years?  My hope, of course, is that the issue will resolve on its own, and Bud will be able to manage the bathroom experience independently.  But if he's not?  What then?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/05/privacy-matters.html", "title": "\nPrivacy matters\n"},

{"date": "Friday, April 24, 2009", "body": "\nEarlier this month, as Easter was approaching, I found myself thinking about Bud's  stated preference  for the very real Dierks Bentley over the very pretend Teletubbies and how it all related to the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and Santa Claus. I wondered where Bud was on the developmental path of drawing distinctions between fantasy and reality, and what the belief-rate was among his typically-developing peers. I wondered if it would ever occur to Bud to question the veracity of the Bunny/Fairy/Santa legends or if he would simply continue to accept them at face value, as he does with most things in his life. I wondered if I was doing him a disservice by perpetuating the myth and allowing the gap between Bud and his same-age peers to grow, or if I was providing him harmless joy by extending the magic just a little longer. I decided to down-play the Bunny business this year, to not really bring it up one way or another, and to talk about the egg hunt and the basket, but not about where they come from. But the day before Easter, Bud brought it up on his own - the Easter Bunny would hide the eggs, he told me. The Easter Bunny would bring his basket. I neither confirmed nor denied - though, in reality, Bud wasn't looking for confirmation. It seemed he was just stating fact. As we got closer to bedtime, though, Bud's anxiety began to grow, the same way it does at Christmas, when he experiences the push-me/pull-you of simultaneously looking forward to presents and being a little freaked out by the idea of a bearded man creeping through the house at night. \"The Easter Bunny is a man in a bunny suit?\" Bud asked as he settled into his bed. \"Do you think so?\" I asked back. \"Yes,\" he answered. \"Who do you think it is?\" I asked. \"Neighbor Jim?\" he guessed, as I suppressed a snort at the thought of the man across the street, who we pay to plow our driveway in the winter, sneaking through the neighborhood with floppy ears and a basket of eggs. \"I don't think it's Neighbor Jim, \" I said, still wondering if it was time to come clean. \"Do you think the Easter Bunny could be a woman?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"Who do you think it could be?\" I asked. \"I don't know,\" he said. The conversation ended, and I tucked him in and said goodnight. A few minutes later, he called out to me in a frightened voice. I went back in to him, and he said \"The Easter Bunny crawled out from under my dresser!\" I turned on his light and sat down next to him, conflicted about what I should do and concerned by his needless anxiety. \"Bud, that would never happen. The Easter Bunny would never scare you. You don't have to worry. I promise.\" \"You promise?\" he asked. \"I promise,\" I said. \"The Easter Bunny will not come in my room?\" he asked. \"Not if you don't want the Easter Bunny in your room,\" I said. \"How does that make you feel, Bud?\" \"Worried,\" he said. \"Because... I'm just a little... shy.\" I put my hand on his chest and felt his heart racing. \"Bud, what if I did the egg hunt for you instead of the Easter Bunny?\" \"You did it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Instead of the Easter Bunny?\" \"Yes. If it makes you nervous, then I could do the egg hunt for you instead.\" \"You do the egg hunt  with  the Easter Bunny,\" he suggested. \"With the Easter Bunny?\" I asked. \"You want us to do it together?\" \"Yes,\" he yawned, his nighttime medication having kicked in and overtaken his anxiety. \"Sure, Bud,\" I said. \"I can do that.\" When morning came, Bud bounded out of bed and set off excitedly on an egg hunt that led him to a treat-filled Easter basket. He was delighted with it, but made no mention of our conversation from the previous night. I wondered if he remembered it, or if his almost-asleep state had made it fade from his mind completely. Later that morning, as Bud took inventory again of the things he'd found in his basket, he turned to me and said, \"I love my Easter basket things! Thank you, Mom.\" \"You're welcome, honey,\" I said, wondering if he'd elaborate or clarify or give me any indication of how he thought the basket had come to be in the house. But he didn't. Still later, he talked to his dad on the phone. \"The Easter Bunny came, Dad!\" he crowed. \"I had an egg hunt! I got a basket!\" But still, no mention of a Bunny-Mom collaboration; no hint that he wasn't a full-fledged believer. And then, at bedtime, as he gathered up the books he'd gotten in his basket to bring them up to bed with him, he asked, \"You gived these to me, Mom?\" \"I sure did, hon,\" I said, waiting for a reaction. But the only one I got was a heartfelt \"Thank you, Mom.\" And that has been that. There's been no further conversation about the Bunny or the hows and whys of Easter. I don't know how he's made sense of it inside his mind, but he seems perfectly comfortable with whatever explanation he's settled into. And there's a part of me that wants to push - wants to delve - wants to  know  - but there's a bigger part of me that thinks it's important to give him space to sit with this and to continue to work it out on his own. In the meantime, he's got a tooth that's getting wigglier by the day - and when it falls out, I can't wait to see what happens.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/04/some-bunny.html", "title": "\nSome bunny\n"},

Bud and I climbed a nearby mountain today, and we had the trail to ourselves for most of the 3.6 mile round trip - so, for much of the hike, the woods were alive with the sound of singing. Bud chose the music - all Dierks Bentley, all the time. I should tell you that sing-alongs with Bud smack a little bit of totalitarian rule. Bud is a lyrics purist and he has every note of every song he's ever heard committed to memory. (Okay, that's an exaggeration - but not by much.) Anyway, heaven help me if I sing a \"so\" when I should have sung an \"and,\" or if I substitute a \"whoop\" for a \"yep\" - I am stopped, and corrected, and we start the phrase over from the top. I've had theater directors who were less directive. But, for the most part, I'm good with lyrics and I take direction well, so our songfest was bumping happily along. Imagine my delight, though, when Bud launched into the song \"Lot of Leavin' Left To Do\" and got to the lyric that says, Girl, you look like you might be an angel, so I won't lie; I could love you like the devil, if you wanted me to tonight, but the Arbiter Of All Things Lyrical burst forth with  \"Girl, you look like you might be an agent, so I won't lie.\" I loved it! An agent! Coupled with the love-you-like-the-devil bit, it gives the song kind of a James Bond feel, don't you think? And, really, it's good to know that Bud's mind works this way. With all the worries I have about his future, it looks like I can cross both \"tax evasion\" and \"run-ins with the FBI\" off the list.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/06/love-you-like-dishevel.html", "title": "\nLove you like dishevel\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, February 28, 2009", "body": "\nI know I've  said it before , but it bears repeating: Dierks and Cassidy Bentley are the nicest people on the planet. I imagine their lives are a little busy right now.  Baby Evie  is almost five months old. Dierks is promoting  Feel That Fire  - out less than a month and already number one on the country album charts. Our TiVo memory is full of his recent television appearances. He's on the road touring with Brad Paisley. I think they've got a lot going on. And yet, somehow, Bud got a package in the mail last week with a postmark from Nashville, Tennessee. I knew instantly who'd sent it, since I'd gotten an e-mail from Cassidy with a heads-up that it might arrive soon. \"Bud!\" I called. \"You have a package!\" He came running. \"A package for me?\" \"It's from Nashville, Tennessee. Do you know who lives in Nashville?\" \"Who does?\" \"It's a friend of yours who has curly hair.\" \"DIERKS BENTLEY????\" Bud tore into the package, then smiled the kind of smile that starts around the toenails, then radiates out through the top of the head. He pulled out an 8x10 picture of his friend Dierks, taken back when his hair was closely cropped. It used to be the look ( the only look ) that Bud preferred, but Bud's come a long way since then and he now prefers Dierks' current look - the one he calls \"the new curly hair.\" In fact, just last Saturday Bud asked his own hair stylist if she could give him \"curly hair like Dierks Bentley,\" but when she started talking about perms, Bud quickly interrupted her and said \"I'm just joking.\" (He was delighted to find, though, that because he pulled on his winter hat after leaving the salon with damp hair, his hair was sticking out at angles from his head later in the day, making him crow, \"Just like Dierks!\") Bud loved the short-haired picture just the same, especially when we read what Dierks had written across it:  \"Bud, Still waiting on the new pictures w/ my longer hair!!! I'll get you one of those as soon as I get them! - Dierks Bentley\" Then Bud took a second item out of the package - a copy of  Feel That Fire , the album he's been singing nonstop for weeks, with the same familiar scrawl across the front:  \"Bud, Thanks dude! Thanks for being my #1 fan!!! - Dierks Bentley\" And Bud really is his number one fan - though recently, it seems Bud's become a fan of the whole Bentley family. He got the People magazine country music edition for Valentine's Day, and since then he's been carrying it around, opened to the two-page photo spread of Dierks, Cassidy, and Evie. He dines with them, reads stories with them, and makes sure they're settled before he turns in for the night. Bud also insists that the woman who sings backing vocals on  Feel That Fire 's romantic \" I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes \" is Cassidy. (It's not, of course, but I think Bud simply can't entertain the notion that Dierks is two-timing with someone else.) It even appears that, despite his  general unease with babies , Bud has decided that Evie Bentley must be one of the \"good ones.\" He's planning on writing a thank-you note this weekend, and I'm fascinated to see what he'll come up with. As for me, I have not begun to find words to let the Bentleys know how touched I am by their kindness, how moved I am by their efforts to connect with a boy who can find it so hard to connect. Bud struggles with interpersonal interaction. He shies away from social situations. But I will tell you this: when it comes to friendships, Bud sure knows how to pick them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/02/hairoes-and-friends.html", "title": "\nHairoes and friends\n"},

{"date": "Friday, February 13, 2009", "body": "\nI've been thinking lately about the way we parents record and preserve our memories of our children's milestones. I think about the things in Bud's baby book, meticulously recorded through the early weeks, months, and years of his life - the first time he smiled, the first time he laughed, the first time he rolled over, the first time he sat up, the first time he crawled, the first time he walked. As Bud gets older, though, I sometimes find myself reflecting less on the firsts, and more on the lasts. I don't have any record of the lasts - probably because the lasts happened while I wasn't looking. I didn't realize they'd never happen again when I grumbled through them or zipped past them or moved mechanically through their motions. So now I look at my big, heavy nine year old boy and I think about how I used to carry him down the stairs for breakfast every morning and I recognize that I would not be able to carry him down the stairs today if I tried. And I wonder: when was the last time that I carried Bud down the stairs? Why didn't I cherish that moment, breathe in the smell of it, imprint it on my heart? Why didn't I recognize that it was a last? And there are so many other lasts: the last time he nursed, the last time he rode on my shoulders, the last time he sat in a shopping cart seat, the last time I picked him up and twirled him upside down. There must have been a last time for each of them, right? But I have no memory of any of them. And then, of course, I wonder: what are the lasts that I'm missing right now? What has Bud done for the last time this year, this month, this week, this day, that I will only recognize in retrospect is missing, but will not remember having ended? I suppose this is how childhood works - how  life  works. We rush eagerly forward to the next check-point, the next marker, the Next Big Thing. Maybe we're programmed that way for a reason. Maybe our kids need us to push them forward and not hold them back while we linger over the things they'll leave behind. And maybe, for parents, it's in the moving forward, the pushing onward, and the celebration of challenges met - maybe it's in the growth and change, in the hurdles and transitions, in the Look How Far We've Comes - maybe it's in the painstaking preservation of all of those milestone firsts, that we really make childhood last.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/02/lasting-impressions.html", "title": "\nLasting impressions\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, November 09, 2008", "body": "\nI had a conference with Bud's teacher, Mrs. Hanlan, and the special ed team this week. My sense going into the meeting was that the year is going well, that his teacher and he are a good \"fit,\" and that the dysregulation that was a hallmark of his second grade year has faded substantially in third grade - and I was delighted to hear that the team felt the same way. They told me about the progress Bud has made in the past few months - like the  real  conversation he had with a neurotypical peer about a class project on scientists and the stories he's added to his writing journal that are actual accounts of his life and not scripts lifted from Elmo's World (though, I must admit, Bud seems to prefer fiction over nonfiction, as he tends toward revisionist history. One account of a real hike we did together, in which I lost my sunglasses, ended with Bud saving the day and finding the glasses behind a rock. Alas, in real life, it took a trip to the pharmacy to get some new sunglasses on my face.) I also heard about Bud's challenges this year, and while they remain real and significant, there were no surprises and nothing that took my breath away. This, I have learned, is a sign that the school year is starting well. One story, in particular, captured the essence of his third-grade classroom for me. Mrs. Hanlan told me that last week the children were working in their writing journals on pieces about something they do well. Bud was in the back of the classroom, behind a bookshelf and out of view of the class, writing his essay on the classroom computer with his aide, Ms. Brett. He was good, he told Ms. Brett, at singing. And then, to prove his point, he launched into the ABC song. Mrs. Hanlan watched as the other children worked at their desks. At first, Bud sang low and the children paid little attention. As the song progressed, though, so did Bud's confidence, and soon he was singing at full voice. The children stopped what they were doing and started listening, looking up at the teacher to gauge her reaction. She knew that Bud couldn't see his classmates' response, so as soon as he finished, she said quietly to the class, \"Now you sing back to him.\" The children launched into the ABCs in response, and as Bud peered around the corner to watch them, his smile grew and his eyes gleamed. As soon as they finished, Bud, uncertain about how to handle the sudden attention, flushed a bright pink, turned to his aide and said, \"Movement break?\" Ms. Brett stood with him and they made their way into the hallway, then Bud turned back, popped his head into the doorway, and said, \"Thank you, everybody. Bye, now!\" A girl in the class, not sure what to make of the exchange, giggled the kind of nervous giggle that conveys discomfort - the kind of giggle that says,  \"That was not what I'm used to, and so I'm not sure if that was okay.\" Mrs. Hanlan took her cue and addressed the class. \"Bud communicates in a different way,\" she told them, \"And we just had  really  good communication with Bud.\" As she finished recounting the story, she said to me, \"I hope that was okay to say. It felt like an important moment.\" \"It was more than okay,\" I answered, surprised that I was not too choked up to speak. As we were wrapping up our conference, I raised the issue that had been on my mind, but that I'd been afraid to address: homework. I launched in, tripping over my words:  \"Homework is a battle for us. Bud fights it with everything he has. \"Home is NOT school!\" he tells me. It's not possible to do it during the week - he's exhausted after a full day at school, and by the time I get home from work we have just about an hour before it's time to get him ready for bed. So that leaves the weekends - which is  our  time - our  only  time - our Mom and Bud Days - and he resents the imposition of homework on that time - and I dread the battle that I know it will bring - and - and - and -\" Mrs. Hanlan understood completely. Even in the classroom, she said, she saw that she had much greater success when she engaged Bud in an activity without announcing that the activity was about to begin. Proclamations like \"In a few minutes, we will write a story\" prompted argument from Bud; sidling up to him with a laptop prompted cooperation. So we've decided to take an integrated approach to homework. We're focusing on reading - an activity he has always done at home, but has lately been fighting. And they'll keep me updated with the concepts that I can reinforce at home - for instance, they're currently working with him on the value of pennies, nickels and dimes. So, we can count change at home. Or play restaurant. Or buy candy at the store. But I won't have to clear the Sunday papers off the kitchen table and lay out a stack of printed worksheets and prepare for battle. Bud's teacher and team also have great ideas about the direction to take with him in the months to come. Music, they said, is key. They will find more opportunities to build music into the classroom - perhaps call-and-response songs, or singing in a round - or dancing, which might appeal to Bud's musical affinity and also address his need for movement and strong sensory input in a way that includes the other children in the class. And they'll focus on peer interaction - one-on-one opportunities to play simple games, to have \"parallel\" play on the playground when it's not swarming with children, to have back-and-forth engagement and conversation. Bud's ready, they say, and the other children in the class will be eager to participate. We've still got a lot to work on, of course, and Bud still has challenges, both academic and attitudinal. But there are glimmers there as well. I've mentioned before that Bud starts his school day the same way almost every day - by walking into the school lobby and greeting Ms. Brett, whom he adores, by bellowing \"OH NO! IT'S YOU AGAIN!\", before turning to me and pleading with me not to leave. But Friday - coincidentally, the day after my meeting with Bud's team - Bud broke with his routine. We walked through the school doors and Bud approached Ms. Brett and said \"Howdy!\" I didn't want to give him any time to reconsider, so I gave him a very quick kiss and turned to rush out the door, as I heard his chipper voice behind me call out \"Bye, Mom!\" I still don't know what prompted Bud's sudden change of heart and dramatic change in pattern, and I'm certainly not sure that it will last.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 17, 2008", "body": "\nAfter a month of living off the grid, I'm not even sure how to re-emerge into the blogosphere. I've always thought that once a blogger starts beginning posts with phrases like \"Wow, I can't believe how long it's been since I've written,\" it's a sure sign that the blog has  jumped the shark . I gotta admit, I can see the fins circling. It's funny how it happens, though. It starts with \"Oh, this will make a good post. I'll just set that idea aside until I have time to flesh it out,\" then it morphs into \"Maybe I can blend this story with the other one and just have a longer post,\" which soon becomes, \"Okay, I'll just scrap those two and start fresh with this one,\" and suddenly a post-free month passes and I begin to think that maybe I should just pack it all in and go low-tech. But here I am in my Fonzie finest, life jacket in place and fingers flying on the keyboard, in a (perhaps futile) attempt to salvage the ratings. And yet, I'm not quite sure where to begin, and if I  really  try to fill in all the gaps since the last time I wrote, this post will inevitably end up in the dead letter of office of half-written drafts. So I will begin here: I've been thinking a lot about how Bud's language has progressed, and about how sophisticated his use of mitigated echolalia has become (as, I might add,  Barry Prizant predicted  years ago). Bud has an enormous store of phrases and sentences filed in his brain and he's able to retrieve them in an instant, mentally flipping through to find the phrase or quote or snippet of language that most closely fits the real-life situation in which he finds himself. He is so skilled with it, in fact, that unless you  know  he's using scripts, you wouldn't know he's using scripts. Most people have brief conversations with him in passing and simply think his language is a little quirky. A favorite recent example: Bud was sick back in October - nothing serious, but it required a trip to the doctor. At the time, he was geared up to be a doctor for Halloween, so in preparation for his visit he donned his white lab coat, strapped on his head mirror, wrapped his stethoscope around his neck, and pulled a face mask over his mouth. He walked through the medical center with an air of authority and, to a person, the staff and nurses he met treated him with solemn respect: \"Hello, Doctor. We're glad you've come to help us today.\" Bud nodded at them, told them they were welcome, and, through the use of doctor-visit scripts from Elmo and Blues Clues, generally reassured them that he was happy to be on the job. We got into the exam room and Bud climbed up on the table as Nurse Dan walked into the room. \"Hello again, Bud,\" he greeted us. \"I see you you've become a doctor since the last time I saw you!\" \"Well,\" Bud replied matter-of-factly, \"I've gotta make a living somehow, you know.\" \"I hear you, Bud,\" Nurse Dan commiserated. \"Don't we all.\" \"Yeah,\" Bud agreed. \"Don't we all.\" And there you have it. A quick little vignette from my life with Bud to get me started on what I hope will be a roll of more frequent posting. I've gotta start blogging somewhere, you know.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_the_shark"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/12/extra-catch-up.html", "title": "\nExtra catch up\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 14, 2008", "body": "\nThis week, Bud brought home the school's Winter Sports preference sheet, with instructions that the completed form should be returned by the end of the week. I imagine that for most families, this quick turn-around was fairly easy; for us, it was a bit more challenging. \"Winter Sports\" is a program at Bud's school that runs on five consecutive Fridays starting in early January. Students choose from among ten different activities and participate in the same activity each week for the entire program. In November, the school sends home a description of the activities being offered and families send back the students' top three choices. The staff uses the preference sheet to balance enrollment numbers and assign activities. In first and second grade, Bud's Winter Sport activity was snowshoeing. I chose the activity for him based on several factors: it was close to the school and wouldn't require a long bus ride; it was something I thought he could do independently; and, it would likely be low-key and not an activity that would draw a lot of dysregulating screaming and jumping from other children. It played out exactly that way and Bud enjoyed the activity. So, when the form came home this year, I thought about listing snowshoeing again and sending it back without discussion. As I thought about it, though, I realized that I was not being fair to Bud. The other children had options; he should have options too. And perhaps he'd be interested in trying something new. Last year, he was not doing well enough to take risks, but this year he just might be. I approached Bud with the form in hand and showed him the description of his options. He was enthusiastic, and indicated an interest in a lot of things: bowling! wall climbing! gymnastics! SWIMMING! I asked about snowshoeing, but he said he wasn't interested. I read the descriptions of the activities. Bowling involved a long bus ride. Wall climbing was for fourth and fifth grade only. Gymnastics, I knew, would not be what Bud expected (he would expect only trampolines; they would try to get him on parallel bars and balance beams). But swimming... Swimming is a favorite activity of Bud's. He's had lessons and he knows the basics, but he is not yet a strong swimmer. Put him in a life vest, though, and he is king of the swimming pool. I read the activity description and saw that only students who could swim independently were eligible for it. I wondered though, if a life vest would be considered a reasonable accommodation, given the circumstances. I dashed off an e-mail to Bud's special ed coordinator before I said anything else to Bud. As I waited for a response from her, I started playing the Winter Sports swim scenario through in my head. Bud is familiar with the pool, but not with the pool full of forty screaming children. He is confident in the water - but would he be too confident? Was he really ready to be in the water without an adult next to him, in an easily-removed life vest? And what about the whole locker-room issue? Would Bud be able to manage the clothing-off-suit-on process by himself? Would he be in the locker room surrounded by towel-snapping, wedgie-giving boys? The very idea sent my blood pressure soaring. So, I sat down with Bud once more to talk about Winter Sports options, and as we talked I realized quickly that he hadn't really understood the concept of \"listing activities, in order of preference.\" Instead, he told me enthusiastically, \"First I do bowling, then I do swimming, then I do gymnastics!\" I tried to explain \"rank order,\" but fell flat. So, I told Bud, \"Let's just choose one.\" \"Swimming,\" he said. \"Swimming?\" \"Bowling.\" \"Bowling instead?\" \"Yes. Swimming.\" \"Swimming or bowling?\" \"Okay.\" \"We need to choose one, Bud.\" \"Swimming.\" \"Swimming?\" \"Okay. Bowling.\" \"You like swimming AND bowling, don't you, Bud?\" \"Yes.\" \"Let's put bowling on the paper.\" \"Okay.\" So bowling it is. I think it's a good choice: a long but manageable bus ride, an activity he enjoys, and an opportunity for \"parallel play\" with peers. And best of all? No wedgies.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/11/good-sports.html", "title": "\nGood sports\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 14, 2008", "body": "\nAs Bud gets older, I find myself worrying because he is still drawn to toys and videos geared toward the preschool set. I worry that the gap between Bud and his peers is growing, and that before long his interests will inspire teasing - or bullying - from other children. I watch carefully when I bring Bud to school - watch for knowing glances between other children, for rolling eyes, for snickers and elbows in ribs. And so far, I see none of it. Instead, I see children - from his grade and from other grades - go out of their way to say hello to him and give him polite space when he's having a difficult transition to his school day. Everything I see tells me I have no reason to worry. And yet, I do. I was struck, especially, last month when Bud turned nine. His very favorite presents - the ones he cherished above all others - were two Elmo's World DVDs and an  Abby Cadabby  doll. I watched him from across the room as he sweetly cuddled and chatted with his stuffed Muppet and I thought about what the other nine-year-old boys at school got for their birthdays. My hunch is that few of them would be happy with a stuffed Abby Cadabby. As I watched him, I had two strong, simultaneous, opposing reactions - the first, gratitude that such simple things can make Bud so happy, that he is not tearing through childhood at breakneck speed, that sweetness and innocence radiate from him; and the second, fear that someday my son would be a twenty-year-old man, still sweetly innocent, and still cuddling his Abby Cadabby doll and watching Elmo's World. I've been working on holding tight to the gratitude and letting go of the fear, but it's hard. It's hard. The other day, Bud popped in a Teletubbies DVD and giggled as he watched it, as delighted as he was the first time he saw it, many years ago. The fear crept back in, and I wondered if Bud made the same sorts of comparisons with his peers that I do - Did he  know  they liked different things? Was he interested at all in trying them out? \"Hey, Bud,\" I asked, keeping my tone as matter-of-fact as I could, \"you really like the Tubbies, don't you?\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"Do the kids at school like the Tubbies?\" I asked. \"No,\" he answered, definitively. \"Oh!\" I said, feigning surprise. \"What do the kids at school like?\" \"Me,\" he answered. Also definitively. And he's right; they do. So maybe that means there's only one thing for me to do. Maybe, for now, I just need to  kill ouch .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Abby_Cadabby"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/10/whats-not-to-like.html", "title": "\nWhat's not to like?\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 20, 2008", "body": "\nBud had an appointment this week with the medical team he sees for medication management. We started seeing them about a year ago, in the midst of a very difficult time for Bud, and those early visits were incredibly stressful - wild displays of dysregulation filled with heart-pounding public tantrums and meltdowns in the waiting room, the hallway, the office. Flash forward one year and the scene is very different. This time, Bud stood patiently next to me as I waited to check in at the counter. The two receptionists greeted us and Bud responded with a cheerful \"Happy holidays!\" They asked how he was and he said he was doing great. They asked what Santa would bring him this year, and he said he'd just like to be surprised. Then he took out his Dragon Tales toys and sat down to wait for me to finish up. \"Wow!\" one receptionist said to me, softly enough that Bud couldn't hear. \"He  never  talks to us!\" \"I know,\" I said, beaming. \"He's really doing great.\" \"He's like a different child from the one who started coming here,\" she answered. Bud stayed conversational throughout the visit, answering all of the doctor's questions: school was good, he said.  Ms. Brett  was his best friend there.  Kelly  was his best kid friend. Sometimes he still got worried going to school, but just a little worried. He was looking forward to Christmas. The doctor asked about our Christmas tree, and I told her that Bud hung all of the ornaments on it. \"Do you have a favorite ornament?\" she asked him. \"Yes!\" Bud asked enthusiastically. \"Which one is your favorite?\" she asked. \"The heart!\" he chirped, his eyes gleaming. I mentally scanned our tree, trying to remember the heart-shaped ornament he was talking about. Our tree has a wild assortment of ornaments - from cut-glass kangaroos to macaroni angels - but I couldn't think of a single heart. \"Which one is the heart?\" I asked him, puzzled. He turned to me and smiled, \"The heart for  Mom ! With my picture on it!\" And then it clicked. \"Bud, did you make me a heart ornament at school?\" \"YES!\" he squealed. \"Oh, wow!\" I gushed. \"Is it a surprise?\" \"YES!\" he shrieked. \"It's a SURPRISE!\" And yesterday, in Bud's backpack, I found a present wrapped in tissue paper. Bud told me that I shouldn't wait for Christmas, but should open it on the spot. It was heart-shaped ornament, hand-colored, with a picture of Bud in the middle. We rearranged ornaments to hang it right in the center of the tree, and the delight of gift-giving set Bud off in a flurry of preparations for a family Christmas of his own making. Before bed last night, Bud crept around the house gathering up toys and trinkets. He filled up stockings for Nana, Papa, and me - as well as for himself. This morning, I was awoken by his face in mine: \"Mama, I need scissors.\" \"For what, Bud?\" I asked, groggily. \"For the wrapping paper. In the playroom.\" \"What are you wrapping, hon?\" \"A present for Nana.\" When he had everything ready, he woke us all up and one by one we each opened our Bud-filled stockings and marvelled at the treasures inside. Bud got a teddy bear. I got a Fisher Price camera. Nana got a race car. Papa got a set of chattering teeth. By the time we finished opening our presents, Bud was bursting with excitement and pride for orchestrating such a magical morning.

Followed by their kick-off rally on a Saturday afternoon, when most of America was at the beach or the mall or anywhere else but in front of their televisions? What does this mean? I'm inclined to think one of two things: 1) They intended to make the announcement on Friday, but encountered a technological glitch that would have fouled up the text message thing, and the risk of embarrassment about such a high-profile plan was worse than bad timing for the event, or 2) This was calculated timing, designed to allow the press to publicly vet Joe Biden while no one was paying attention, so that what he was saying (and not who he is) was making headlines by the time anyone started listening. Or maybe the Obama folks are just as busy as I am right now - which makes me wonder if I might be under-utilizing my time at 3:17 a.m....\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/08/biden-my-time.html", "title": "\nBiden my time\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 01, 2008", "body": "\nBud's been in third grade for over a month now and he seems to be off to a terrific start despite a few - er -  speed bumps  we encountered early on. Let me back up. It all started sometime in early August, when I got a letter from the school department notifying me that because of a necessary shift in bus routes, Bud's school day would be starting a half hour later than it had in the past. Like most people, I had a knee-jerk reaction to the unanticipated announcement:  \"That won't work. I can't get to work that late.\"  So, before I did a moment of problem-solving, I dashed off an e-mail to the special ed department inquiring about the accommodations that are made for students like Bud who take the bus -  Is there a bus aide? , I wondered.  Is there a \"special ed\" bus?  I wanted to gather as much information as I could as I formulated a plan. I got a quick response from the inclusion coordinator, who said she'd look into it. The weeks passed and I realized that my initial reaction was the kind of panic that's borne of unexpected change, and was not routed in any real need for me to arrive at my office at a particular time. I rearranged my schedule to accommodate a later drop-off for Bud, and promptly forgot about my earlier inquiries. Fast forward to August 26, Bud's first day of school. I was unsure about what to expect from Bud. For the entire second half of second grade - from January till June - Bud cried nearly every day at drop-off - big, soggy, woeful, sad goodbyes that started each day with a broken heart for both of us. I'd seen a turn-around, though, in summer school - four mornings a week that Bud enjoyed and looked forward to. By the end of the summer, most of our drop-offs were tear- free. And besides that, Bud seemed to be looking forward to third grade; he seemed  ready  for it. He was in a cooperative mood as we got ready for school that morning, and I was feeling hopeful about making an easy transition. It was just about that time that I looked out the window and saw it: there was a full-size school bus in front of my driveway. I walked outside tentatively and the bus's big doors opened. As I walked toward the bus, I called to the bus driver, \"Are you here for Bud?\" She said she was. I walked to the door and said, \"There must be a mistake. I didn't know you were coming. Bud's autistic - he can't really manage a bus.\" \"Yes, that's why I'm here. He's the only child on my route.\" I stared at her, blinking, while the sentence registered. Then I stepped up and glanced down the long, vast expanse of empty bus. \"This whole bus is for Bud?\" I said. \"Yes,\" she answered. I looked down the long aisle again. The seats and floor were pristine. I sniffed. The air was full of new bus smell. \"Is this a brand new bus?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"They sent a whole brand new bus just for  Bud ?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" she answered. I stood dumbfounded, struggling to make sense of what was going on. I knew I couldn't plop Bud down on the bus and send him merrily on his way. But, my goodness, they'd sent him his own  bus , for heaven's sake! It felt ungrateful to simply send it away. \"The thing is,\" I said, \"Bud is a kid who needs preparation. He needs to know what to expect. And I didn't know you were coming.\" \"Somebody should have called you,\" she said. \"Right,\" I answered, \"but they didn't. And so I've never even mentioned the  possibility  of a bus to him. We haven't talked about it at  all . I mean, there is just NO WAY that he is getting on this bus today.\" \"Well, maybe he'd like to just come and look at it,\" she suggested. My mind raced. Was that a good idea or a bad one? There was no way to know. \"I'll go get him,\" I said. I went back inside and approached Bud. \"Hey, Bud,\" I said as jovially as I could. \"There's a school bus outside! Do you want to see it?\" \"Okay,\" he said, following me outside. As we hit the driveway he began to suspect that something might be afoot and he added, \"I don't want to ride a bus.\" \"No, not today,\" I said. \"Today we're just looking at it.\" Bud climbed on board and the bus driver introduced herself. He walked down the aisle and looked around. He remained calm. \"Maybe someday you'd like to take a bus,\" I said. \"No,\" he replied. \"Well, not today,\" I said. \"Maybe someday.\" We said goodbye to the bus driver, then piled in the car, now running late on the first day of third grade. As we drove, I could feel Bud's anxiety rising. \"I don't take a bus to school,\" he said. \"I just ride with Mom.\" I assured him that he was right, and I didn't push any further. Despite that, his anxiety was high enough to produce tears at drop-off, so I left his classroom quickly and went off in search of someone from the special ed team. I found Bud's OT in the hallway and gave her the run-down on the bus situation. We quickly brainstormed - Would riding the bus be a good thing for Bud? Was there a way we could make it work? Could we create a social story? Maybe I could ride with him the first time? Or even the first week? The team set to work creating a plan and said they'd contact the bus company. As the morning progressed, my anxiety grew. Questions and fears raced through my mind. Did the bus have seat belts? Would somebody be waiting for Bud when the bus pulled up at the school? What would the bus driver do if Bud started crying, started panicking, started screaming, started throwing himself around the bus? What would happen if there was a  thunderstorm  while he was on the bus? And what about  global warming  for heaven's sake? Could I really justify the use of a whole school bus just for transporting my child to school??? After a few agonizing hours, I called the special ed team back and left a lengthy voice mail message. We didn't need a bus. We didn't want a bus. What we needed was a smooth transition to third grade, and we didn't need to complicate it by throwing Bud a bus-shaped curve ball. I told them to stop the preparations and to call off the bus. The next morning we were into the final stages of getting ready when I looked out the window and saw the bus back at the end of the driveway. I said nothing to Bud, but slipped out the door, gave the driver a hundred apologies, and sent her on her way. She asked what my concerns were and I gave her the run-down, but told her that, ultimately, it was just too big a change for Bud right now. Someday, maybe. But not now. She was terrific, and said she understood completely. She said she'd let the bus company know, and gave me the manager's phone number in case I wanted to call to talk about options for the future - in a month, in January, next year. I thanked her again, tucked the phone number into my bag, and promptly forgot all about it. The next day was bus-free and Bud and I finally started to establish a new third grade drop-off routine. Over the next few weeks, we fell into a regular - though perhaps not yet  easy  - pattern to transition him to his school day. Things finally started to feel predictable. I was more than a little startled, then, when one morning about three weeks later, as Bud climbed into the car to go to school, I opened the garage door to find a mini bus parked at the end of my driveway. \"I don't want to take a bus!\" Bud cautioned. I just shook my head and walked down the driveway, sure that somehow the driver had made a mistake and was at the wrong house. She hadn't, and she wasn't. I told her about our earlier bus confusion, about the concerns I'd had, about the decision we'd made to scrap the bus idea entirely. She knew about my concerns. She said they'd sent a small bus because they knew that a large one was too scary for him. They'd created a three-child route because riding alone was too overwhelming. What else could they do, she wondered, to make this work for us? My friend Kiki would call this \"too helpful by half.\" I thanked her profusely, gushed at their accommodation, and gave her the old \"it's not you, it's me.\" I told her that he just wasn't ready to take another big step, then I sent the bus away and drove behind it all the way to school. Later, the manager of the bus company called me. She apologized and said that she'd intended to call me the previous week to talk about the new plan, but had obviously forgotten. She wanted to know if there was anything else they could do, and then told me she'd make a note in the file that said that  I  would call  them  if I wanted to revisit the transportation issue. That was two weeks ago. Now Bud's back into the new routine - the one in which he greets Ms. Brett, the wonderful paraprofessional who  requested  to stay with him in third grade after working with him through a  very  difficult second grade year, by walking through the school door each morning, seeing her, and groaning in a loud voice \"Oh no! It's YOU again!,\" then tugs at my sleeve and pleads half-heartedly \"No, Mama, wait, Mama, no, no, no,\" until I leave and he cheerfully walks to his classroom with his good friend Ms. Brett, ready to start another great day at school. So, as I said, all things considered, Bud seems to be off to a terrific start in third grade. I can't help myself, though - now that a couple of weeks have passed and we're into October I keep peeking out the window as we get ready to leave in the morning. Call me crazy, but I just feel certain that any day now they'll be sending us a chauffeured limousine.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/10/third-grade-or-bussed.html", "title": "\nThird grade or bussed\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 22, 2008", "body": "\nHey! It's my blog! I remember my blog! Hello, blog friends! Thank you for continuing to check in to see if I'm here. I'm sorry I haven't been. It's been a busy summer. It's been busy for a lot of reasons. We've had some vacation getaway time on a lake and at the ocean. Bud's been taking - and loving - swimming lessons at the college pool. We've been engaged with a fabulous summer school program that Bud actually looks forward to. We've been waging the war on thunder fairly successfully. We have, in other words, been busy with  lots  of things that could make for good blog posts - I've just been too busy  living  them to have any time to write about them. So I send my apologies to those of you who have checked in day after day to find the very same blog post at the top of the page. I'm glad to say that the hiatus has ended, because there's something that I'm really excited to tell you about. But, before I do - did you read the  news out of Children's Hospital in Boston  a couple of weeks ago? Here's the laypersons version of it: Researchers have identified six genes related to the neural connections required for learning that appear to be present and  intact , but  inactive , in some people with autism, suggesting that the key to treating autism lies in reactivating those dormant genes. Separate but related research shows that many of the \"inactive\" genes involved in autism also have a high degree of plasticity, which may make them especially receptive to reactivation. This is very good news, and it has everything to do with the news I need to share, because it's this very theory - a rejection of the \"hard boiled egg\" theory of brain development (i.e., there is a limited window of opportunity for change, because once it's done, it's done) and the belief that  real  progress in autism hinges on creating opportunities for a \"do over\" in development that will create and strengthen the neural pathways that are necessary for learning - that underlies the autism intervention strategy that makes the most sense to me - RDI or  Relationship Development Intervention . And we are currently diving head-first into a structured RDI program. If you're a long-time reader, then you know that I've been a believer in RDI since I attended a  two-day parent workshop in the summer of 2005 . You also know that since that time, I've done a lot of research on my own and jury-rigged a  renegade RDI program  without the aid of a consultant, based only on my own limited understanding of the RDI philosophy. About a year ago, I discovered that I'd gone about as far as I could go on my limited knowledge, and our family life took a detour that required that we focus energy on some other areas of our life, so though I tried to continue to parent through the lens of the RDI philosophy, I stopped actively \"doing\" RDI. All that is changing, though, because - as is our luck, in that all the right people come into our lives at just the right times - Bud's former Kindergarten teacher, known to longtime readers as  the great Mrs. H , has left teaching after thirty years to work full-time in the world of autism and is in the process of becoming certified as an RDI consultant. We are lucky enough to be one of her first families, and it is very, very exciting. We had our first official meeting with Mrs. H last week, and my mom and I spent this week watching online seminars and responding to reflection questions, building up our store of knowledge about RDI and boosting our confidence and competence at using it successfully. As I've watched the e-seminars and listened to Dr. Gutstein talk about forming and strengthening neural pathways and giving the brain the opportunity for a developmental do-over, I've had the recent research from Boston buzzing in my head.  This is it.  We're going to focus on those inactive genes and we're going to figure out what it takes to get them moving, to get them connecting, to get them positively flying. Because here's the the thing - Inactivity? A lack of progress? It's fleeting. A blip on the radar. It can feel pervasive and eternal when you load the same blog page day after day after day after day and see the same tired post you've been reading for weeks, or when you live day after day after day after day with the same Teletubbies video or the same peanut butter sandwiches as the only acceptable lunch food or the same catch phrase from an Ernie and Bert routine repeated incessantly. But it's not eternal. It's not forever. All it takes to make significant change is having the right person sit down at the keyboard and press the right keys in the right order to create a whole new blog post. All it takes to make significant change is having the right person engage with a child and provide the right opportunities for the right challenges in the right order to create a whole new neural pathway. Can you feel it? It's happening. This thing is on.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/07/autism_genes_ho.html", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/07/is-this-thing-on.html", "title": "\nIs this thing on?\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, July 26, 2008", "body": "\nIt has been a very sad week. I got the news on Thursday that  Vicki Forman 's son Evan died very suddenly and unexpectedly, and I have been reeling since the moment I hung up the phone. I recognize the feeling, because it's one I've had before. I am grieving. In many ways, I hesitate to put the word in writing, because as soon as I do I think  \"Who are you to grieve? Vicki and Cliff have lost a son.  They  are grieving. You are an intruder in their grief.\" And yet, I feel it. I carry it: the heavy ache of grief. So I give myself some space for it. I think,  \"Okay, grieve if you must. But grieve quietly. Grieve privately. This is not your story to tell.\" But here I am - writing, because it is what I do, how I make sense, who I am. I've realized something in this grief: I've realized that I loved Evan. I didn't just read about him, know about him, and grow fond of him. Though I never touched his skin, never heard him sing, and never saw him swing his cane, I loved him with a fierceness that shocks me. This realization leads me to another: there are many children -  so  many children - whom, through blogging, I have come to love with this same intensity, this same ferocity, this same wholeness of self. And I am suddenly, painfully, acutely aware of the number of people whom I might not recognize on the street, but who have become woven tightly into my life and into my heart. That awareness frightens me. It's frightening to know so suddenly and with such absolute certainty that I am  this  vulnerable, that there are this many people who could trigger this sort of pain and grief in my heart - that there are so many stranger/friends who have become a part of my family. And then, there's another awareness, another realization, that sidles in to coexist with the fear, as my brain follows these thoughts toward a logical conclusion:  If I feel this way about these children,  I think,  then there must be some stranger/friends out there who feel the very same way about Bud. I never really understood that until now. I knew people were cheering us on. I knew people recognized Bud's charm and wit and engaging personality - but now, as I grieve the loss of Evan, I recognize that for some of you, your connection to Bud - to us - is something entirely different. Now, suddenly, coexisting with the vulnerability, there is strength; with the fear, there is assurance; with the grief, there is joy. I am reminded of  something that Vicki wrote  last year: Many of my friends who have children with special needs will testify to the profound need we sense for that child to be on this planet, teaching us about love. I have felt that with Evan, and I've seen that with others. These children show us how to open our hearts in ways we never knew were possible. Perhaps that makes our hearts stronger, braver, or kinder. Or perhaps our hearts are simply, by virtue of being open, wider and more expansive. But inside this wider space we have discovered that amidst the love there is also the heartache, and within the heartache, the joy. The will to live and the will to love.  And I am reminded of Evan, a little boy with an enormous spirit. A boy I loved. And so I grieve, openly, out loud and in writing. I grieve with love and with heartache, and I struggle to search for the joy hidden within it. And somehow, my stranger/friends - somehow I have a feeling that maybe you do, too. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Contributions in memory of Evan Kamida may be made to: The Pediatric Epilepsy Fund at UCLA Division of Pediatric Neurology Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital at UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA 22-474 MDCC 10833 Le Conte Avenue Los Angeles, CA 90095-1752 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vickiforman.com/", "http://www.literarymama.com/columns/specialneedsmama/archives/2007/02/special_needs_l.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/07/these-strangers-these-friends-this.html", "title": "\nThese strangers, these friends, this family\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 28, 2008", "body": "\nIt takes a village to raise a child. People say it so much that it sounds cliche, but if you have a child, then you know it's true. What you do as a parent is important, but you can never underestimate the power and influence of the other people in your child's life - especially the people who are with him when you are not. You choose some of the people in your child's village; others are assigned to you. You hold your breath, hand over your child to the village elders, and hope for the best. I've been thinking lately about how much courage it takes for parents - any parents, but particularly those whose children have developmental challenges - to trust the village that is the public school system. I've been thinking, especially, about two different public school villages: the village at the regional elementary school that Bud attends and the village at the Morningside Elementary School in Port St. Lucie, Florida, that Alex Barton attended. The villages are a study in contrast, though my hunch is that the boys in question may not be. I don't know Alex Barton, so I don't know what his school year was like. My sense, though, is that this year in Kindergarten, Alex, who is in the process of being tested for Aspergers Syndrome, exhibited some combination of aggressive behaviors, verbal and physical outbursts, emotional dysregulation, anger and defiance.  So did Bud  in his second grade class this year. As I said, I don't know Alex Barton. My only information about him comes from  this mind boggling news story . I'll sum it up for you: It seems that Alex's Kindergarten teacher, at wit's end with Alex, adopted an intervention strategy straight out of the reality television program  Survivor . She gathered together her class of five-year-olds and held a tribal council, in which each child was encouraged to tell Alex exactly what they thought of him and his behavior. Then the children were asked to cast their votes on whether or not to keep him in the classroom. They voted him off the island. The day after Alex's horrifying experience at school, I joined Bud and his classmates for a field trip to a farm museum. As we prepared for the trip, I wondered how it would go - How would Bud manage the dramatic change in routine? Would my presence at a school event be a comfort or an additional source of stress? And I wondered what I would see in the interactions between Bud and his classmates.  Out of necessity , we have kept my presence in Bud's classroom at a minimum this semester - a quick kiss goodbye at the door each morning with no time to linger to watch Bud with his peers as he settles in to his day. So, I wondered how Bud's classmates were reacting to him these days, after a year of witnessing what was probably startling and possibly troubling behavior from him. I was surprised by what I saw. Bud and I had a completely different farm museum experience from the rest of his classmates. While they gathered in small groups to learn about milking cows and raising chickens and churning butter, Bud and I set off on our own, seeking out the places that were quiet, peeking at cows from a distance, making sheep noises to each other, and walking, walking, walking, walking towards  emotional regulation  as we tried to work out the jitters and find a way to settle in. But though Bud and I did not spend the day with a group, we were never outsiders. When we passed children on the grounds, they greeted Bud. They engaged with him when he responded to their greetings, and they gave him space when he didn't. By noontime, we'd found a rhythm and I convinced Bud to join a group from a distance, for just a few minutes. He stayed near (but not with) the group, and then, with a little encouragement from his teacher, worked up the confidence to reach out and stroke the downy feathers of a remarkably docile chicken. Later, we joined the larger group again for ice cream. Bud's friend  Kelly  plopped down on the bench beside him, asking about his ice cream and reporting on her own, and then, when the ice cream was finished, she raced out to the field with some other children to roll down the hill. Without prompting from me, Bud ran out to join them. Then Bud asked his teacher if she'd play hide and seek with him. She readily agreed and ran to hide while Bud closed his eyes and counted. Several children saw what they were doing and asked if they could join in. Tom was one of them. When it was Tom's turn to be \"it,\" he closed his eyes and counted while Bud pulled me over to \"hide\" with him behind a slender birch tree which left all but a tiny bit of us in plain sight. Tom finished counting, looked up, and looked directly at us. Then he turned and walked in the other direction and said, puzzled, \"I wonder where Bud is!\" Tom's words weren't striking - but his  tone  was. He wasn't playing down to Bud. There wasn't a hint of condescension in his voice. He didn't sound like an older boy playing with his baby brother. He sounded like an eight-year-old playing with another eight-year-old. Tom  got  it. And when he \"discovered\" our hiding spot a few minutes later, the thrill of the find was genuine for all three of us. Later that day, when the field trip was over and Bud was at home with Nana, I met with the school team about Bud's IEP for next year. I recounted the story of our day, and especially Bud's interactions with his peers and his game of hide and seek with Tom. They smiled and said they were glad that I got to see what they see every day. Then one of them offered, \"That's what inclusive education is all about.\" And that's it, isn't it? That  is  what inclusive education is about. It's what all education should be about. It's what should be at the heart of the villages that raise our children. All of our children. But it wasn't at the heart of Alex Barton's village. In the midst of a difficult, troubling year, Alex Barton's teacher called his village together and rallied them against him. Bud also had a difficult, troubling year and, interestingly, his teacher  also  called his village together for a tribal meeting. Unlike Alex, Bud was not there for the meeting. And the agenda for Bud's tribe's meeting was distinctly different: one of the special ed team members came in to talk to Bud's class and help them understand Bud a little better - help them understand the things that are difficult for him, the things that are easy for him, and the things they could do to support him through the challenging times. Like Alex's village, Bud's village came together. But Bud was embraced instead of exiled. Because that's what inclusive education is about. Inclusive education recognizes that it takes a village to raise a child. It recognizes that Kelly and Tom and the other children in the class are an important part of the village that is raising Bud. And - more to the point - it recognizes that Bud is an important part of the village that is raising Kelly and Tom and the other children in the class. They need each other, and they know it. Our children's lives should not be played like a game of  Survivor . The real-life stakes are too high to take our cues from a reality game show. Our kids need to know that survival doesn't mean pushing others down and fighting to be the last one standing. They need to know that survival -  real  survival - means that we all emerge, triumphant, standing together at the end. Bud's tribe has spoken. I hope Alex's tribe is next.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/may/24/30gtteacher-lets-students-vote-out-classmate-5/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/05/tribe-has-spoken.html", "title": "\nThe tribe has spoken\n"},

He is naming his feelings, owning them. He is saying what he needs. He is struggling to understand and accept the things he can't control. He is offering solutions and suggestions. He is self-advocating. And in the midst of all this hard work, he is happy. More than that. He is  delightful . He's engaged and he's engaging.

Bud said he wanted to go, so we set off for what I imagined would be a brief outing similar in nature to the  Solstice Party  we attended not long ago. Not so. Bud enjoyed the party. He greeted people. He responded to questions. He hugged the guest of honor. Bud and I were among the last to leave, an hour and a half past Bud's regular bedtime. And the next day? We were off to a Mother's Day brunch in a crowded restaurant, where Bud sat and ate and chatted and had a perfectly wonderful time. Extraordinary.

{"date": "Friday, June 06, 2008", "body": "\nI've been following the online weather forecast closely, loading and reloading the page, willing it to change. But so far, it's not working. Every time I check, it tells me the same thing - that this is what is headed our way today:   This is what's in store for us tomorrow: This is what Sunday will bring: And this is what's coming Monday: If you're a long-time reader, you may recall that two years ago Bud developed an  overwhelming fear of thunderstorms . Last year, it got so terrible, so consuming, so all-encompassing, that it got in the way of Bud's ability to function day-to-day. It made medication a necessity instead of an option. So, though I  complained incessantly  about the record snowfall around here this winter, I was also glad that the winter brought with it respite from thunderstorm season. But it's nearly summer now. And the thunder has returned. I knew it was coming, of course, and we have been preparing for it.  We've been talking  about how sometimes things that scare you when you're younger aren't as scary when you're older. Bud's been talking about thunder with his psychologist, Dr. Susan, who helped us develop an alternative thunderstorm plan that would give us something to look forward to - we decided on a cookie party, as both Bud and I know well the restorative power of toll house. Dr. Susan even created a beautiful Sesame Street book for Bud, in which Telly and his hamster Chuckie Sue confide to Baby Bear their fear of thunderstorms. Baby Bear comforts them and explains in very basic terms what makes thunder happen  (\"Thunderstorms happen when two big clouds have a pushing contest. When they rub their hands together, they make a loud noise.\")  The Count joins them, and explains that counting after a flash of lightning will tell you how far away the storm is. And, finally, Cookie Monster ventures along and announces \"Me going to special thunderstorm cookie party. Me like to eat cookies in storm!\" He invites them all along, explaining \"Everybody eat cookie. Not mind thunder.\" They all go along to the cookie party and Telly and Chuckie Sue discover that they don't really mind the thunderstorm at all. Bud loves Dr. Susan's book, especially because it features some big bright illustrations of all his favorite characters, so it opens the door to conversation about the subject in a mostly nonthreatening way. We've also gotten help from Dr. Donovan, the psychiatrist who manages Bud's medication. He has helped to tweak the dosage and timing of Bud's medications over the past several months to find the right balance for Bud to function at his best. And he also reminded us that though thunder is loud, we are too. He told us that we can make our own storms, and that we can be as loud as - and even  louder  than - the thunder. So, on beautiful sunny days when the forecast calls for nothing but clear skies, we've practiced making our own loud banging noises - rattling an entire roll of aluminum foil, stomping our feet as loud as we can, banging together on drums. And when the thunder finally arrived last weekend, we were as ready as we could be. I knew it was due sometime on Saturday, though I wasn't sure when. I didn't mention it to Bud, but planned on sticking close to home for the day. The morning was overcast, but the rain hadn't started, so I thought it was safe to take a quick shower. I was fully lathered up when the bathroom door flew open and I heard Bud's anxious voice asking, \"Was that you, Mama?\" \"Was what me, Bud?\" I asked, though I was afraid I knew the answer. \"That banging sound, Mama? That was just you? That wasn't thunder?\" I started rinsing as fast as I could. Then I heard it: the big, loud, unmistakable boom of thunder. \"That was just you again, Mama?\" Bud asked. I could hear it in his voice: he  wanted  me to say that it was just me. He knew it was thunder, but he wanted me to assure him that it wasn't. I hesitated for an instant, then wrapped a towel around myself and climbed out, dripping and still a little soapy. \"No, that wasn't me, Bud,\" I said. \"That was a little bit of thunder.\" Bud started to panic. I rushed him into my room, pulled down the shades, pulled on some clothes, and put us both to work. \"We'll show that thunder, Bud,\" I said. \"We'll show him that we can be louder than him!\" We climbed onto my bed and started banging on the wall together. I heard the rumbling outside, but saw that Bud was too busy banging to notice it. I banged louder and shouted \"WE'RE LOUDER THAN YOU, THUNDER! WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF YOU, THUNDER!\" \"Let's be even louder, Bud,\" I said. \"Let's stomp our feet, too.\" Bud was still too distracted to pay attention to what was going on outside, but it occurred to me that a single flash of lightning could redirect his attention and ruin everything. \"Bud!\" I shouted. \"We need lightning! Can you make the lightning?\" I kept up the banging and stomping and shouting while Bud threw open the door to my closet and flicked the light on and off. I listened for the thunder outside. It had stopped. We'd made it. I stopped banging and the sound of the rain - a light tapping when we'd started, but now a full downpour - filled the room. \"Mama, the rain...\" Bud said, anxiety creeping back into his voice. \"Let me show you how to  make a rainstorm , Bud,\" I said. And together, we rubbed our hands, flicked our fingers, tapped our legs, and stomped our feet as we simulated the rise and fall of a downpour. As soon as our rainstorm ended, and before his anxiety returned, I asked \"I forget, Bud. What fun thing did we say we were going to do if there was a storm? What did Telly and Chuckie Sue do?\" \"Have a cookie party!\" Bud answered. I dashed to the kitchen and grabbed some cookies, then we cuddled together in my bed (Cookies in bed??? This  must  be a special occasion!) and celebrated a job well done. \"We scared the thunder, Mama?\" Bud asked. \"We did, honey. We were even louder than the thunder.\" \"We scared the thunder all the way to  Canada , Mama?\" Bud asked. \"All the way to Canada, Bud,\" I said. \"Then all the way to the North Pole, and then right back up to the sky.\" \"The thunder said, 'Eek! I'm afraid of those people noises!'\" Bud said. We'd survived the first storm of the season. Bud seemed to be managing well. All the same, though, for the rest of the day, and through the next day and most of this week, little signs of the old storm perseveration peeked through - jumping at the slightest noises, asking repeatedly about impending weather, and making proclamations and assumptions based on false correlations: \"I'm not wearing my  purple Joe shirt . That makes a storm.\" or \"The storm was Saturday? There will be a storm next Saturday?\" And so I'm braced for the onslaught of foul weather headed our way. I'm hoping that homemade thunderstorms can continue to carry the day for days on end. I'm hoping that the thunder runs screaming to Canada at the very first sound of our people noises. And I'm hoping that no matter how many chocolate chip cookies we eat, they never lose their magic. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bronxriver.org/EDGUIDE/015_CreateARainstorm.pdf", "http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/07/02/blue-gets-a-brother-for-the-10th-season-of-blues-clues/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/06/storms-inside-and-out.html", "title": "\nStorms, inside and out\n"},

She didn't just dump me; she dumped me by form letter. And it wasn't even a letter from her. It was from the owner of The Salon - \"I am writing to inform you that Meg is no longer employed at The Salon. We will miss Meg and wish her the best in all her endeavors. Meg is a very talented hair stylist, however we value your business and hope you feel comfortable continuing to choose The Salon for your beauty needs.\" Like I'm just supposed to pick up and move on or something. Honestly, the letter arrived yesterday and I've barely scratched the surface of the first stage of grief. I'm wallowing in my denial, certain that any minute the phone will ring and it will be Meg, letting me know she's set up a cozy little place where we continue on together as though nothing had happened. I keep waiting for the text message: \"meet me 2moro.\" But it doesn't come. So now, of course, I'm in a worse quandary than ever. I can't get back together with my ex-stylist, Rachel. That bridge has burned; that ship has sailed. Even if I showed up with candy and flowers at this point, it would be obvious to everyone that Rachel was just sloppy seconds. But if I start seeing yet ANOTHER stylist at The Salon? That says to Rachel \"I'd take ANYONE over you.\" I just can't do that to her. As I see it, I have two options: I can do my best investigative work and try to find Meg -  she's out there somewhere; maybe she doesn't know how to contact me  - and risk having her bring me up on stalking charges, or I can stake out on my own and start all over again in a new town with a new stylist at a new salon. Neither prospect is particularly inviting. But, really - I'd just started getting comfortable with my hair again. It's too hard to think about starting over, risking disappointment, suffering a set-back. So I'm setting out to find Meg. I've got three weeks until my next scheduled appointment.

Remember a few months ago when  I told you  that Bud was on a new medication that made him ravenously hungry? I was under strict orders from Bud's doctor to reign in his caloric consumption and I began ridding the house of all of Bud's favorite snack foods: blueberry bagels, ice cream cups, Nutri-Grain bars, frozen pancakes - everything. But Bud was intrepid - and hungry - so every time I left the kitchen he'd go foraging and then try to hide the evidence, stowing Popsicle sticks under the sofa and leaving a tell-tale trail Whole Grain Goldfish crumbs in his wake. He quickly learned to master the art of the dine-and-dash, waiting until he heard my footsteps going up the stairs, then diving headlong into the refrigerator to scarf down whatever he could reach. At day's end, when Bud was fast asleep, I'd open the refrigerator to find thick boy-mouth sized bite marks through a half-pound stack of American cheese or a bag full of stems where a pound of grapes had been that morning. But nothing -  nothing  - compared to last week. Bud and I spent the usual amount of time engaged in food negotiations ( \"But I'm  hungry , Mama\"/\"I'll get you a snack in a few minutes, Bud,\")  but, due to limited shopping opportunity, our house was even more free than usual of anything approximating snack food. Still, I'd hear the refrigerator open when I went upstairs, but then I'd dash back down to find him empty-handed, over and over and over again. It wasn't until week's end when I discovered two things in our mostly-empty refrigerator: 1) a tub of Olivio butter substitute that I thought was unopened, but that was, in fact, filled with the deep track marks of the eight-year-old who was eating the stuff by the fist-full, and 2) a bottle of ketchup that days earlier had been full, but was now completely empty.

So I guess it's no surprise that when it comes time to do an \"autism story,\" the popular press tends to rely heavily on the vaccine theory of autism causation. There are a lot of big name celebrity advocates who support the theory, and their big names get big air time. Even when their theories are not entirely based in fact. The  American Academy of Pediatrics  is hoping to bring some balance - and some factual information - to the forefront in the press coverage of the autism story. They're looking for people - real people with real stories, and not just big names who draw big numbers - to share their own experiences and their own beliefs. An e-mail request from Susan Stevens Martin, Director of the Division of Media Relations for the AAP, is printed here in full: Hello, As part of our ongoing response to media stories regarding autism and vaccines, the AAP communications department is compiling a list of parents who support the AAP and are available for interviews. We are looking for two types of parents who could serve as spokespersons: Parents of children with autism spectrum disorders who support immunization and who do not believe there is any link between their child's vaccines and his or her autism. Parents of children who suffered a vaccine-preventable illness. This could be a parent who declined immunization, whose child became ill before a vaccine was available, or whose child was ineligible for immunization. We are asking for your help identifying parents who would be good spokespersons. They do not need to be expert public speakers. They just need to be open with their story and interested in speaking out on the issue. We will contact candidates in advance to conduct pre-interviews, to offer guidance on talking to reporters and to obtain a signed waiver giving us permission to release their name. If a parent were placed on our list, we would offer their name and contact information to select media. We hope to build a list of parents from a wide range of geographical areas. As the Jenny McCarthy and \"Eli Stone\" stories illustrate, this issue is likely to recur in the national and local media. The AAP is committed to doing all we can to counter such erroneous reports with factual information supported by scientific evidence and AAP recommendations. The anti-vaccine groups often have emotional family stories on their side. The ability to offer a reporter an interview with a similarly compelling parent who is sympathetic to the AAP's goals is a powerful tool for our media relations program. Please contact me if you have any questions or to suggest a parent to interview.

It's because I spend too much time in the check-out lines. Let me give you an example. Kiki and I will make a quick stop at Target, toss a few things into our baskets, and join the line to check out. Kiki will put her things on the conveyer belt. The clerk will say, \"$32.76.\" Kiki will pay her money and collect her bags, and then my goods will make their way down the conveyer belt to the clerk. \"Oh,\" the clerk will say, scanning my first item. \"Tampons. I used to use this kind of tampon.\" \"Really?\" I'll say. \"Yes,\" the clerk will reply, \"Before I had my hysterectomy.\" \"Oh,\" I'll say. \"It was five years ago,\" the clerk will say. \"I'm okay with it now, but at the time...well, I really wanted to have another baby.\" \"That must have been hard,\" I'll say. \"I was so depressed I could barely get out of bed,\" she'll reply. \"Thank God for Paxil, though, you know what I mean?\" And it will escalate from there. I'm not sure what it is about me that brings this out in people, but it's a very real phenomenon. I say \"Good morning,\" and strangers start to disclose. This is how I know that the woman who bagged my groceries took the job temporarily because she'd suddenly become unemployed, that she thought it would only be for the holidays, that she was dismayed to still be bagging in February, and that she has  still  not gotten the hang of opening the plastic bags. It's how I know that the night manager of Dunkin' Donuts really prefers the coffee at Starbucks. It's how I know that the woman at the pizza shop couldn't shake the feeling that something odd was going on that morning at the gas station mini mart when a young woman ran from the store into an idling car and sped away at top speed. It's how I know what kind of birth control the woman at the hair salon uses -  and  what effect it's had on her cycle. It's how I spent 45 minutes in the produce section of the grocery store talking to a woman (and then her husband, whom she'd called over from the bakery) about her grandson, who may be autistic, but whose parents may be in denial. I think I might just have one of those faces - generic enough that I'm vaguely reminiscent of someone you know, making me familiar enough to put you at ease. People I meet often tell me that I am \"just like\" such-and-such person they know, or ask me if I'm related to so-and-so, or wonder if we've met at the blahdy-blah place I've never heard of. As quirks go, though, it's a nice one to have. I enjoy hearing about people's lives and, it seems, they are pleased that someone is willing to listen to them. It does make for extraordinarily long sessions at the check-out counter, though.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 22, 2008", "body": "\nBud is struggling at school. I write about this tentatively, with trepidation, and with the knowledge that I am edging closer than I'd like to the part of Bud's life that might best be  kept private . But you all have too much wisdom, too much understanding, too much to offer to allow me to hold it back. So I  offer it out : Bud is struggling at school. At the core, I think this is separation anxiety. It starts in the evening as we get ready for bed, usually just as a series of points of information:  \"I was upset at school today. I missed you at school today. I don't want to go to school tomorrow. I'll miss you at school.\"  By morning, the points become more insistent:  \"I don't WANT to go to school. I CAN'T go to school. School is scary. I'm sad at school. I'll miss you. We'll miss each other.\" The tears begin as we don our coats. The ride to school is iffy, but we often get a reprieve if I've remembered to bring my  iPod  or if the stars have aligned and \" Free and Easy \" is playing on the radio. Then the anxiety begins again as we pull into the school yard:  \"I'll miss you. We'll miss each other. I don't want to go to school.\"  By the time we get to the classroom, Bud's tears are flowing. Sometimes they last a few minutes. Sometimes, like today, they transform into keening and wailing that builds and builds throughout the morning until he lays his head on the table in exhaustion and falls asleep for forty-five minutes in the middle of the noisy, bustling classroom. Bud's dad and I have talked about it: it doesn't take a PhD in developmental psychology to figure out  what's going on here . From Bud's perspective, his dad disappeared suddenly and he's worried that while he's not looking his mom might slip away as well. We've both tried to send consistent messages:  \"Dad loves you even though he doesn't live with you. You are going to see Dad again. Mom is not going away. You will always live with Mom.\"  And I've tried every approach I can think of to address Bud's fears and tears in the moment: acknowledging his feelings; agreeing that we'll miss each other and assuring him that we'll see each other at the end of the day; focusing on the happy reunion we'll have at supper time; reminding him of the people and things he enjoys at school; working with the teacher to have an important job waiting for him when he arrives at school; using a different doorway to mix up the \"drop-off script\"; arriving a little early; arriving a little late; bribing him with a  snack  in exchange for a tear-free drop-off; and even employing a tough-love approach that left us both worse off than we'd started out. The good news is that we've finally made it to the top of a very long wait list, and Bud has an appointment with a child psychologist next week. My hope is that she will be able to help us help him process what he's experienced, talk about what he's feeling, and work through the things that are getting in his way. I hope I'm not being unrealistic - but, frankly, if I am, please don't tell me. Unrealistic expectation might just be what's getting me through these difficult mornings right now. But there must be a strategy I haven't tried - some magical mix of words and actions that will make all the difference for Bud and help him to feel safe and secure and confident again. But what does it look like? What else can I try? How can I help him manage the fears and the tears and the overwhelming emotion of  I miss you, I miss you, I miss you ? What else is there? What am I missing?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/01/missing.html", "title": "\nMissing\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, January 24, 2008", "body": "\nOh, the drama. Oh, the angst. Oh, the shame of it all. I cheated on my hairdresser. And I got caught. It's not like we had a long-term relationship. I suppose you could argue that we had an \"agreement\" - but, really, it had never been stated explicitly. It just sort of evolved that way. I started seeing her casually, and then it was just easy to book a follow up appointment on my way out the door, and the next thing I knew we had an exclusive thing going. But, honestly, I hadn't been seeing her that long. And in my defense, I was just coming out of a ten-year relationship with my former hairdresser. That, in itself, is a long story - my ex-hairdresser is a lovely woman who was with me through a lot of tough times. I care about her - I will always care about her - but things had just run their course, you know? It had become same old, same old in the haircut department and our schedules were such that we were having trouble finding time for each other. And I just needed a change - I needed something new and exciting - I needed some pampering. So when my colleagues started coming back to the office with fabulous new hairstyles... well, it didn't take much convincing to make me stray. It was some time last summer that I first went to The Salon and met my most recent stylist, Rachel. We were set up on a blind match, and at first it felt like maybe there was something there, but I see now that I was just on the rebound - and perhaps, if I'm being totally honest, I was looking for a trophy stylist. And Rachel certainly fit the bill. She's young - out of her teens, but not by much. And she's stunningly gorgeous, in that casual , natural way that looks effortless. And she's petite and graceful and lovely in spiky high heels that she stands in all day without getting blisters. The reality was, no matter how fabulous I felt walking in the door, after just a few minutes in Rachel's presence I felt like a barn animal. An  old  barn animal. It wasn't her; it was me. Truly. She's just as sweet and as gracious as can be. But she's quiet - an introvert - and so am I. And we didn't have a lot to talk about to start with, so once we got through a few minutes of \"how 'bout this weather,\" we spent most of the rest of the haircut in silence. Not especially  awkward  silence, but silence nonetheless. But it was fine. I didn't have a reason to end it. And the haircuts were good. So I stayed with Rachel for months. Then, sometime in November, I got a call from The Salon telling me that Rachel had taken a very sudden leave of absence because of a family emergency and she wouldn't be able to do my December haircut. They fixed me up with someone else. Meg. Meg is a dream come true. First, she's experienced. She knows what she's doing. Where Rachel is measured and patient and careful, Meg is carefree and loose and creative. And I can  relate  to Meg: She's closer to my age. She's a mom of boys. She has pictures at her station of her newly-remodeled kitchen. We have the same gynecologist, for heaven's sake. It's like it was meant to be. Being with her was just so  easy , you know? But she's a responsible professional. She was fabulous, but she kept her distance. She gave great hair advice, but couched it in \"I'm sure Rachel has mentioned that...\" and \"You could talk to Rachel about...\" She made it clear that she knew I was taken. So, when I stopped at the desk before I left that appointment and had to book my follow-up, I booked it with Rachel. But I couldn't stop thinking about Meg. So three weeks later, I called back and switched. I'm one of many to Rachel , I told myself.  It's been so long, she probably doesn't even remember me. I was too old for her anyway. She'll be relieved. I said it enough that I believed it, which made me able to show up for my appointment with Meg today - well, if not confidently, then at least not sheepishly. Meg came out to meet me in the waiting room, and I thought I caught a look in her eye. But of  what ? Surprise? Confusion? Delight? I couldn't be sure, and it lasted just a second before she fell into that easy, breezy Meg banter that made me sigh and start dreaming of our future together. I was so caught up in it, in fact, that I was startled when, as I was laying backwards with my head dangling into the sink, I felt a tap on my shoulder, and I looked up to see the upside-down but smiling face of Rachel. Sweet, young, beautiful Rachel. She waved, and I stammered: \"HEY! Welcome back! It's so great to see you!\" My words said \"I had  no idea  I could have scheduled with you!\", but I know that my eyes betrayed me, as even upside-down they laid it out bluntly and without apology: \"I'm just not that into you.\" I tried to put it out of my mind. I tried to focus on the engaging chatter that Meg was so bravely offering up. I tried to remember that when Meg was done working her magic, I would look just a little less like  Keith Urban . I tried. But, to my horror, I soon discovered that Rachel's station had moved since the last time I'd seen her, and now - yes, you know where this is going - now it is right in front of Meg's. So I listened to Meg's delightful monologue as I watched Rachel - focused, hardworking, quiet Rachel - silently cut the hair of a woman who I think looked older than me, but who is  probably five years my junior . And as I sat and listened and felt the magic of Meg's clip-swirl-clip, I was overcome with conflicting emotion. I was so happy to be where I was, and yet I felt terrible about feeling so happy. I can only equate it with the feeling one has at the senior prom when one sneaks away from one's prom date to go make out in the hallway with one's ex-boyfriend (er... not that I would  do  that... what kind of person would  do  that?) And then there was the moment - after the final reveal  (ta-da! fabulous hair!)  and before I walked out the door - when Meg walked me to the reception area and said with the political neutrality of Switzerland, \"Brianna can help you if you'd like to schedule another appointment.\" And I did. Schedule, I mean. With Meg. But I feel just awful about it. And what's worse, I feel that I'm without options - that I've made myself a hair salon pariah. Stick with Meg and make her an accomplice to my betrayal, or return to Rachel despite the fact that we both know it would not be because I wanted to, but because I felt I had to. I'm stuck. And angst-ridden. But my hair? It's fabulous.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/01/my-cheatin-hair.html", "title": "\nMy cheatin' hair\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, February 06, 2008", "body": "\nBud lost a tooth last week and the tooth fairy left him three dollars, which he took to Toys R Us to parlay (with a bit of supplemental financing from me) into a DVD. After only a few minutes browsing the video rack, Bud made his choice: Elmo's World. A DVD just like all the others in his collection. A DVD designed to appeal to children five years his junior. I've spent the better part of the week thinking about Bud's choice and why it bothered me. Part of the issue, I have to admit, is that I am just tired, tired, tired of watching Elmo and the Teletubbies. Another part, though, is that as Bud gets older, his entertainment choices pull him further and further away from his neurotypical peers. But, I've countered to myself in this internal debate, perhaps these are the videos that are meeting Bud's developmental needs. Perhaps they are  still  the videos that meet him where he is. And then I remember  Bud's echolalia , and I'm reminded of the tremendous benefit of the mostly polite and appropriate language that comes along with Bud's exclusive draw to preschool programming. I remember what happened when Bud developed  an interest in  101 Dalmatians , and I had to manage scenarios like this: One afternoon, as the result of a childcare glitch, I had to pick up Bud at school and bring him to my office in the afternoon. Bud loves coming to my office, but we are typically there on weekends, when we have the place to ourselves. This particular afternoon, though, the campus was bustling with activity and as we walked across the parking lot, Bud realized that something was different. \"No friends will be in the office, Mom?\" Bud asked. \"Today is a work day, Bud,\" I said. \" All  the friends will be at the office.\" Bud considered his options for a moment, then turned to me earnestly and said, \"I'll pop 'em on the head. You do the skinning.\" So maybe sticking with Elmo is not such a bad thing after all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/02/be-careful-what-you-wish-for.html", "title": "\nBe careful what you wish for\n"},

Really, I have.  We read  Curious George Goes to the Hospital , and I pointed out all of the things that happened to George that will also happen to him.  I told him about waking up with a sore throat.  I told him about losing his voice for a while.  But for Bud, the operation means two things:  presents and snacks. His surgery is not scheduled until 11:00 a.m., which means we'll have a long, breakfast-free morning - particularly problematic in light of his new  medication-induced appetite .  So here's the plan: He can eat solids until midnight.  He's asleep now, but I told him that I'd wake him up at 11:00, and he'll be able to eat whatever he wants.  He's downright giddy about it. He can have clear fluids until 9:00 a.m.  I've explained that on Operation Days, the doctor says that you have to have apple juice, Popsicles, and jello for breakfast.  Bud thinks this is his kind of doctor. Bud told me that after an operation, you get to have presents.  That are wrapped.  That include movies.  And toys.  I have taken careful notes. I told Bud that because of his sore throat he'll need to have Popsicles and jello and ice cream and juice and yogurt and applesauce until he feels better.  He did the pre-surgery grocery shopping with me.  I said \"yes\" a lot.  He can't believe his good fortune. His backpack is packed with his stuffed bear and a stack of Tubbies, George, and Pooh DVDs for the recovery room.  I've promised to download  Dierks Bentley Live from Bonnaroo  to his iPod before we leave, despite the fact that iTunes warns me of explicit lyrics (but, really, how bad can it be?)  Bud is feeling good and is prepared to take the operating room by storm. Of course, I understand that all this may change the moment we enter the hospital tomorrow, or even the moment I remind him that there will be no toast for breakfast.  But I'm rolling with it for now, and keeping my fingers crossed, and hoping that he's not too angry with me when he wakes up tomorrow with a sore throat like no sore throat he's ever had before. But one step at a time.  For now, I'm planning out the menu for our midnight breakfast, and I'm sending out this post to ask all you  thinkers and prayers and senders of energy  to channel a little of that thought and prayer and energy this way tomorrow.

{"date": "Thursday, December 13, 2007", "body": "\nBud is so good at having surgery, he could do it professionally. I had a lot of images about how the day might go.  I was in \"prepare for the worst/hope for the best\" mode.  But I never even entertained the possibility that Bud's surgery would be such a spectacular non-event. Having stuffed himself silly at our midnight breakfast, Bud was perfectly content with grazing on  Popsicles  and jello until we left for the hospital.  We arrived early, and I prepared to manage his mounting anxiety as we approached the same-day surgery unit, where he'd had a meltdown of epic proportions less than two weeks earlier, when we tried to visit for a \"sneak peak\" tour.  But the anxiety never came.  Bud was calm and pleasant as we sat together in the waiting room.  He seemed especially  huggy  and affectionate, but not in a needy, clingy way, just in a \"have I told you lately that I love you\" way. When we moved into the surgical unit, Bud stayed his focused, happy self, chatting with the nurses, answering questions as they were asked, and settling in with a portable DVD player and a stash of movies from the hospital's library.  Shortly after he was in his room, they gave him a liquid sedative, which - though I wouldn't have thought there was any room for improvement - made him even more delightful.  A steady stream of nurses, anaesthesiologists, doctors, and other staff arrived at his bedside, and Bud announced each new arrival with \"I'd like you to meet my friends!\" The whole day followed the same pattern.  We had a difficult, tearful ten minutes in the final  pre -op moments, when a neighbor of Bud's reacted with some unpleasant noises as he woke from his anaesthesia, frightening Bud as we wheeled him to the OR.  But I stayed with him until he was asleep, and in less than an hour the surgeon came to find me to tell me that it had all gone well.  I was back in with Bud before he woke up. And when he did wake up he was all smiles, and gave me a clear, loud \"Hi, Mom,\" without even the hint of a hoarse voice.  Bud announced that he was ready to leave in less than an hour, but hospitals have their rules, so we had to sit around and wait for a couple more hours before they sent us home. Bud's been eating and drinking just fine.  He's taking his (foul tasting) medicine without complaint.  He had a great night's sleep.  He's up and about and playing and talking and acting not at all like a child who has just had a body part removed (in fact, my sister suggested that I check him out thoroughly, in case they mistakenly removed the wrong thing). So I'm forced to draw two conclusions in the aftermath of this waltz through major surgery: 1.  It is likely that Bud will continue to surprise me all the time for the rest of my life, and 2.  When you folks send out prayers, thoughts, and energy to the universe, you do not mess around. Thanks for being with us through it all.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 02, 2008", "body": "\nMere months ago,  I told you  that Bud and I have the same taste in music. Since then, Bud has been branching out. We still have a lot of musical tastes in common - there is still a lot of overlap - but the more we listen to the radio, the more we check out videos on Yahoo, the more we sample clips from iTunes, the more I'm discovering that Bud has a musical sensibility that's all his own. Increasingly, he approaches me with iPod in hand and asks me to download a song for him - a song that I didn't know he liked; a song that doesn't particularly grab me. They tend to be testosterone-laden  country songs  with lyrics like  \"All my friends say I started shootin' doubles when you walked in...\"  And, then, on the flip side, there are other songs -  lovely  songs by artists he enjoys - that he rejects outright. He despises Keith Urban's \" Everybody \" so much that he made me cross out the song title on the CD case and on the disc itself before he'd listen to any of the other songs. (I asked him why he didn't like it. His reply: \"It makes me strain.\") I'm afraid this all might serve as irrefutable evidence that my sweet little boy is turning into a GUY, but that's a post for another time. It's actually exciting to me that Bud is forging his own musical identity, and I want to help him follow his passions and explore the best of what the musical world has to offer. But lately, in addition to his good-old-boy country rocking, he's been tuning in to a genre that I know absolutely nothing about: Bluegrass. I first noticed that Bud was spending a lot of time listening to the Dierks Bentley  album tracks  that are heavily influenced by bluegrass. Then one day we were surfing iTunes together and he discovered the album  Pickin' on   Dierks Bentley: A Bluegrass Tribute . We listened to the 30-second clips and I told Bud he could choose a couple to download, but he was insistent: he needed to have them all. He loves them. Yesterday, when he talked me into downloading Brooks and Dunn's \"Play Something Country\" for him, he caught a glimpse of the  Pickin' on Brooks and Dunn  tribute that's available on iTunes. I surfed away quickly enough to distract him, but I know it's only a matter of time before he discovers the whole (seemingly infinite)  Pickin' On  series. Now, I don't want to be critical of the folks behind the  Pickin' On  empire, but they credit themselves only as \"Various Artists.\" As I've said, I'm no bluegrass expert, but my hunch is that  Pickin' On  is not the very best that bluegrass has to offer. I just don't know what is. I put out the call to Bud's dad, who tends to know a lot about a lot of different kinds of music, and I'm casting a wide net out here to the blogosphere. Perhaps one of my regular readers is also a bluegrass aficionado. Or perhaps if I use the word \"bluegrass\" enough in this post - in phrases like \"you just HAVE to hear this great bluegrass artist\" or \"this is the greatest bluegrass musician of all time,\" my Google hit will be high enough that some bluegrass junkies will surf on in and give me some tips. So, bluegrass fans, tell me, please: My son and I are looking for the best in bluegrass. Where do we begin?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/All-My-Friends-Say/dp/B000WXOAEC/ref=sr_f2_2?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1199494266&sr=102-2", "http://www.amazon.com/Everybody/dp/B000TDYQR6/ref=sr_f2_1?ie=UTF8&s=dmusic&qid=1199494213&sr=102-1", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SXITQ6/ref=dm_mu_dp_trk11?ie=UTF8&qid=1199494092&sr=1-1"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/01/grass-is-always-bluer.html", "title": "\nThe grass is always bluer\n"},
{"date": "Monday, December 31, 2007", "body": "\nAt this time of year, newspapers and magazines are full of \"Best of 2007\" lists. I used to compile a list of top ten albums of the year every year at this time, but frankly (and I know this will make me sound old), these days I'm lucky if I could name ten albums that were released this year. Nonetheless, I love making \"best of\" lists and I love sharing a great find with my blogosphere friends. So here are ten gems that got me through 2007: 10. Contour pillows: 2007 was the year I discovered chiropractic care. I was having serious shoulder pain in the spring and early summer (probably due to ergonomic miscalculations with my laptop), and since chiropractors are covered by my insurance I decided to give it a try. I've become a chiropractic addict. There are few things more satisfying than the pop-pop-pop of my rapidly aging spine. Anyway, one of the side benefits of seeing a chiropractor was my discovery of contour pillows. The chiropractor actually suggested that I sleep with a rolled towel under my neck, but I just couldn't get comfortable, so I got me a brand new pillow. As I think I've mentioned before, I have always slept well, but now - well, it's a little slice of heaven. 9. Kashi TLC Original 7-Grain crackers: Sometimes I think I could live on nothing but TLC crackers and coffee. Okay, let's be honest - some days I  do  live on nothing but TLC crackers and coffee. And I have no regrets. 8. SmartWool socks: I live in a cold climate. I mean really cold. We have a few days every year when the temperature is twenty below before you factor in the wind chill. So dressing warmly is really the key to survival around here, and for keeping feet toasty warm there is nothing like the SmartWool sock. Okay, they are expensive (as socks go), so I only have one pair, but I'm telling you, for one day every week, my toes are positively giddy. 7. The Presby Environmental Enviro-Septic System:   After several years of living with a failing, and then failed, septic system, we invested a small fortune into having the Enviro-Septic system installed this summer. It's like the Prius of septic systems, I think. Best of all, it works, and, take my word for it, you should never underestimate the value of that. 6. Clash of the Choirs: I'm not even kidding. This was some throw-away little reality something-something that NBC tossed on the week before Christmas to fill time during the writer's strike. Five musical artists - Patti LaBelle, Michael Bolton, Nick Lachey, Kelly Rowland, and Blake Shelton - each put together choirs made up of everyday people from their own hometowns and had three weeks to rehearse for a four-night competition. It was completely feel-good without a hint of Simon Cowellishness - drippy sicky sweet, uber-Patriotic, and let the angels sing. I loved every second of it. My only disappointment was when the choirs backed up their celebrity directors on one of their own hits: I'd really, really hoped that Blake Shelton would have his choir belting out \"The more I drink, the more I drink...,\" but, sadly, it was not to be. 5. Scrabulous: Much to the chagrin of college students around the world, boring old people have begun invading Facebook. This year, my worlds collided on Facebook when I suddenly found that my Facebook friend list included current and former students, colleagues, supervisors and supervisees; high school, college, and grad school friends; most of my siblings and a sister-in-law; assorted blogging friends; and even my thirteen-year-old nephew. But the very  best  part of Facebook is Scrabulous - an online game of Scrabble that is played asynchronously, so that players don't have to be logged in at the same time. At any given moment, I have about six different Scrabulous games in play. And, okay, I spend  most  of my time getting my Scrabulass kicked, but I'm having a blast doing it. 4. Dexter: I don't subscribe to Showtime, so I was unfamiliar with this series until my uncle lent us the first season on DVD. For the uninitiated: Dexter works in forensics and is a blood-spatter expert. He is also a serial killer with a strong code of ethics. This is a show that's not to be missed. 3. Avon Moisture Therapy Hand Cream: I live in a cold climate (see number 8 above), and winters typically do a number on my hands. In past years, by early November my hands have been dry and cracked and painful and a nasty shade of red. I've tried every fancy hand cream and prescription medication I could find, all with little effect. And then this fall my mom picked up a tube of this miracle cream at some buy-in-bulk table at a flea market and all of my winter hand problems have been solved. I use it faithfully every night at bedtime (because it is so thick and slick that if I used it during the day I'd have to give up hope of holding anything in my hands), I wear gloves every time I leave the house, and I've successfully tricked my hands into believing that it's May. 2. The Highway 16 Traffic Report: This year, the XM satellite radio in my car has spent most of its time docked at channel 16, or \"Highway 16: America's Route to Today's New Country.\" Thanks to the magic of the Internet, I've also been able to listen at home and at work. In fact, I started all of my writing classes by streaming Highway 16 as the students stumbled into class and struggled to wake up (because, while 9:30 might feel like mid-morning to people over 30, it is the crack of dawn to many a college student). The music drew a lot of compliments - though that may have been the result of the mistaken assumption that an expression of approval of my musical tastes might reflect favorably on the assignment of grades (needless to say, I am not so easily bought). Anyway, one of the treats-of-the-week for me in 2007 was the Highway 16 Traffic Report, a commercial-free countdown of the 50 most-requested songs of the week, which airs on Wednesday afternoons (good background as I plug away at my desk) and is replayed on Saturday afternoons (a crowdpleaser when Bud and I are cruising in the car). 1. The Keurig Single-Cup Coffee Brewer: The beauty of not having a Christmas wish-list is that often other people's improvisations are far superior to anything you might have come up with on your own. Such was the case for me when my mom presented me with this beauty on Christmas morning. I'd seen them before in businesses and grocery stores, but I'd always been too intimidated to try them out and risk the public humiliation of spewing steaming hot coffee all over my fellow paying customers. But I needn't have worried: as it turns out, the Keurig brewer is simple to use and produces a steaming hot cup of perfectly brewed coffee every single time. Sigh. Isn't it gorgeous? So, there you have it - my own personal \"best of\" for 2007, without an ounce of corporate sponsorship or PAC money behind it. I'm still not able to endorse a candidate for President, of course, (which, interestingly enough, is  the way I started the year ), but, then, you're probably more likely to heed my advice on matters of coffee than on matters of international importance anyway. Thanks for sticking with me this year, blogosphere. A very happy 2008 to you - and stay tuned for more strategic product placement right here in the new year.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 04, 2007", "body": "\nOkay, troops, it's rallying time. Bud has been on a new medication for about a month.  It has made a world of difference for him, helping him to manage anxiety, perseverate less, avoid aggressive outbursts, and, of course,  sleep .  After many difficult and challenging months, Bud is finally settling back into himself. There's just one catch to the new medication:  it makes him RAVENOUSLY hungry.  As soon as he finishes breakfast, he's asking for a snack.  He's sneaking food out of the refrigerator.  He is grazing his way through his days.  I've removed most junk food from the house and eliminated things like white flour products from his diet, but honestly, even fruit and whole grains will pack on the pounds if you eat them by the truckload. Bud had a follow-up visit with his doctor today.  He's gained five pounds in the past month.  He hasn't grown enough to account for it.   It's the marathon eating.  Bud's doctor advised me to seek out foods that are filling and low in calories - things like popcorn and vitamin water.  Those, I can do.  But her other suggestions  - things like carrots and celery, and even soups - are likely to trigger Bud's sensory issues.  I've always avoided artificial sweeteners and fat substitutes for Bud, but his doctor said they're the lesser concern right now - she suggested swapping out the regular jello, Popsicles, and other snacks for the sugar-free variety whenever possible. I'm sure Bud's not the first child to encounter this issue.  So what can you offer me, oh wise blogosphere friends?  What can I give to Bud that will fill him up and stay with him, without pushing his daily caloric intake through the roof?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/12/fill-em-up.html", "title": "\nFill 'em up\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 22, 2007", "body": "\nOver the past year, Bud has become a terrific reader. What I mean is that he can read almost any words set before him. He reads them out big and strong, with feeling. He reads with gusto. It's still unclear, though, how well Bud can read for content - how well he can follow the thread of a story, how attentive he is to the details, how much he can follow the shift of perspectives from character to character - the same challenges, of course, that he encounters in everyday life. But in recent months we have made the slow transition from storybooks to chapter books - from books meant to be read in one sitting to books that require a bookmark and a \"let's read some more tomorrow.\" Every night I read another chapter to Bud. Sometimes I try to gauge how well Bud recalls what has already happened, how well he can predict what might happen next. Mostly, though, I try to figure out if he is even listening closely enough to follow the meaning of the words I'm reading. Last night, Bud and I read a chapter of  The Chocolate Touch  by Patrick Skene Catling. It's the story of a boy, John Midas, who only wants to eat candy. In last night's chapter, John's parents were at wit's end. I read aloud the account of John's visit to the doctor as Bud hummed quietly in his bed, and though I wondered if he was tuning me out completely, I kept reading as John's father launched into a lecture: \"Don't you think there's such a thing as enough?\" Mr. Midas persisted. \"Don't you think that things are best in their places? I mean, don't you think there's a time for spaghetti and a time for roast beef and even a time for pickled herring and garlic toast, as well as a time for chocolate? Or would you --\" Suddenly, Bud bolted upright, grabbed the book from my hands, and shouted, \"WHAT???\" His eyes scanned the page and I wondered what I'd read that had triggered a reaction that strong: had I just said something that sounded suspiciously like \" Teletubbies \" or \" Dierks Bentley ?\" \"They eated TOES???\" Bud asked incredulously. \"No,\" I said, thinking I'd caught the misunderstanding. \"Garlic TOAST.\" \"They eated roast FEET???\" he asked. \"Oh!\" I said, \"No, roast beef. Roast BEEF.\" \"That's FOOD?\" \"Yes. Beef. It's like hamburgers.\" \"Not toes.\" \"No, not toes.\" Bud kicked back the covers, grabbed for his toes and tried to reach them with his tongue, apparently just to see how they'd taste. It gives a whole new meaning to \"putting your foot in your mouth,\" don't you think? A very Happy Thanksgiving from Bud and me to all those who are celebrating it today. May you enjoy good times in good company - and may your holiday table be entirely free of roast feet. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/11/roast-what.html", "title": "\nRoast WHAT???\n"},

{"date": "Friday, November 23, 2007", "body": "\nDaisy from  Compost Happens  has tagged me for a meme, in which I am instructed to: 1) Link to the person that tagged you, and post the rules on your blog. 2) Share 7 facts about yourself. 3) Tag 7 random people at the end of your post, and include links to their blogs. 4) Let each person know that they have been tagged by leaving a comment on their blog. I'm accepting the challenge with hesitation. I've done similar memes twice before - once by listing  five things  about myself and once by listing  eight things . As I mentioned in the first of the memes, I am, by nature, an almost pathologically private person, so \"outing\" myself on things is difficult. And I'm even more gun-shy about it in the aftermath of the \"eight things\" meme. In that meme, I revealed the fact that, though I take breaks of five or more years at a time, I have been following the ongoing plot line of a soap opera for more than twenty years. Shortly after I posted it, that juicy little tidbit was leaked (good-naturedly, of course) to a room full of college students, who had already considered me \"old,\" but who immediately changed their assessment to \"old and uncool.\" Unfortunately, the part about the five-year hiatuses was left out of the revelation and I was assumed to be a daily devotee of said soap, and though I tried to set the record straight, my attempts simply snowballed into \"the lady doth protest too much\" and all hope of redeeming myself was lost. Needless to say, thus began the next five-year hiatus. Anyway, Daisy has responded to my tags in the past, so I will muster up my courage and tentatively reveal the following seven facts. Be gentle with them, blogosphere. Be gentle with them. 1. I  mentioned  earlier this week that I'm having trouble sticking with a book - any book. I'm having the same problem with television shows. Fifteen minutes into an episode, and I'm pretty much done. I even have to work at making it through a whole episode of  Grey's Anatomy . And never mind a two-hour movie - that's just not going to happen. What do you suppose that's about? 2. I can't think of anything I want for Christmas. Okay, I can think of one thing -  this  - and I have my mom lined up to make the purchase. Beyond that, though, I'm pretty much all set. 3. I don't know who I'm going to vote for in the primary (are you sensing a trend here?). I would like to throw my wholehearted support behind a candidate. I'd like to be sporting a pin, a bumper sticker, and a yard sign - but I just can't commit. If I had to vote today, it would probably be for John Edwards, but, really, I could just as easily go for Obama or Clinton. I've always wondered how people could head to the polls still undecided, and yet I have a hunch that may be what's in my future. 4. I am going to see Dierks Bentley on his  Throttle Wide Open  tour. I haven't told Bud. I feel as guilty as I did when I went to see  Paul McCartney  without him - perhaps more so. On one hand, I know that there's nothing about a live concert that Bud would enjoy - not the volume, not the hour, not the crowd, not the lighting. Nothing. But still, on the other hand, it's  Dierks . It's like I'm sneaking into Teletubbyland for lunch with  the guys  and not inviting him. I feel like a crumb. (And yet, somehow, I don't feel bad enough to stay home...) 5. I am having a GREAT experience teaching writing this semester. Those who followed my adventures last fall may remember that my writing class and I struggled to make it through the semester together. Not so this time around. It's a lot of work, but I'm having a ball. 6. A couple of weeks ago, someone asked me what I liked least about my job. I couldn't think of anything. I'll bet there are not many people who can say that. 7. I don't like fudge, but I am attracted to the  idea  of fudge. For many years, when someone would offer me fudge, I would think,  \"I shouldn't take any, because I don't like fudge. But it looks so good, and I love chocolate. I must be wrong about this. I  must  like fudge.\"  And then I would take a piece and have a bite and realize that, in fact, I don't like fudge. I'm tagging the following seven people, with the caveat that this is entirely challenge-by-choice and all tags from me are completely optional: Mommy~dearest, from  The Quirk Factor David, from  Thoughts-0-Dave March Day, from  One March Day Kirsten, from  Kirsten Can Maddy, from  Whitterer on Autism Jenn, from  Good Job, Mama!

Next to that , you'll find a blurb written by Music Editor Chris Neal, which reads: Dierks Reaches Out The mother of an autistic child recently posted  an open letter to Dierks Bentley  on her blog, momnos.blogspot.com. She recounted how her son, Bud, was confused by the fact that Dierks has long hair in some of his videos and short hair in others. Dierks' wife,  Cassidy, read the post and e-mailed her  - and then  Dierks himself sent Bud a package  including a one-page handwritten letter explaining how he got his hair cut a year ago. The mother reports that  Bud is now comfortable  with seeing both the long- and short-haired Dierks. \"I believe that The Dierks Bentley Hair Crisis of 2007 is officially over,\"  she writes . Wild.

{"date": "Saturday, December 08, 2007", "body": "\nI'm putting this in writing now so that in a short time I'll be able to link back to this post and say I told you so. This is what I'm telling you: Dierks Bentley  is going to be HUGE. I know: He's already a major recording star. He's already had five number one singles. He has just been  nominated for four Grammy's . He's already big. I know. That's not what I'm talking about, though. I'm talking HUGE. I'm talking cover of  People  magazine, Barbara Walters' Ten Most Fascinating People, you-better-get-your-tickets-the second-they-go-on-sale-because-the-stadium-will-sell-out-in-minutes huge. If you've been reading this blog over the past several months, then you already know  how kind and generous  Dierks and Cassidy Bentley are. And if you've been reading the  comments  on this blog over the past several months, then you already know that Dierks is the sort of musician who has broad appeal and inspires statements like \"I've never really been into country music, but I bought his album and now I'm a huge fan.\" And if you've been reading those things, then you probably walked away from them thinking, \"Nice guy. Talented guy. Hope he continues to do well.\" So did I. Then I saw his concert. Let me put this in context for you: I have been to a lot of live shows.  A  lot  of them.  And I've seen a lot of incredibly talented people. I have almost always enjoyed the shows, but, by now, it takes a lot for a show to really blow me away. This show  really  blew me away. I've been trying to find the words to describe why, and here's what I've come up with: Most of the time when you see a live show, the artist takes the stage and performs for you. You stand on the other side of the invisible wall and marvel at their talent. They do what they do best for a couple of hours, and you are wildly appreciative, and then you all go home. But every now and then, you see an artist who knows how to  connect  with the audience. The invisible wall evaporates, and suddenly everyone in the room feels like an important part of the experience. There's an energy that builds as the connection tightens; there's a relationship that develops, until suddenly every person in the room - each musician on stage, each die-hard fan in the pit, and even each of the folks in the last row of the balcony - has the same feeling:  we are all in this together. I'm not sure why some artists can create this vibe and others can't. It's not about the size of the venue. I've seen performers in intimate club settings who didn't create it; I've seen Paul McCartney create it in a stadium. And now, I've seen Dierks Bentley do it, too. It's this sort of thing: My friend and I had to travel a way to see the show, so we booked a local hotel room to make the trip more manageable. As we were checking out the next morning, the woman behind the hotel counter asked, \"Were you in town for the show last night?\" We told her we were. She said she was there, too, and suddenly we were old friends. We talked, we raved, we gushed a little, and then we said goodbye with a \"see you at next year's show,\" because we all knew that, without question, we would be there. So here's the thing: It's too late to get in on the ground floor. It's too late to see Dierks and the band in a club. It's too late to be among the first to say \"I was a fan back when...\" But it's not too late to see him in a smallish venue, and I'm telling you, you ought to do it now, because soon it will be. He's going to be huge.

As you may recall, Bud has not been sleeping well lately. Since sometime in late August, he's been waking for the day between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. Over the past week, though, thanks to a shift in his medication, he has been sleeping most mornings until sometime between 4:00 and 5:00 a.m. What's even better is that when he wakes, he is much more calm and self-sufficient. He typically comes into my room a couple of times after he's awoken to: 1) assure me that  there are no storms , and 2) confirm that even though it's still dark, it is actually morning, by asking \"Can I read books?\" (In general, I respond to this question before 4:00 a.m. with \"No, it's still nighttime. Try to go back to sleep.\" and after 4:00 a.m. with \"Yes, you can read books quietly.\") Once he gets the thumbs-up on book-reading, he dons his iPod and settles in with a stack of books, and I half-doze as I hear him talk and sing - and sometimes dance - in his room. He clearly keeps his ears open, though, for the sound of my alarm clock, which signals to him that I am ready to get out of bed and join him. Lately, I've been using an iHome clock radio, which allows me to wake to a song on my iPod, and I usually only hear a few notes before Bud dashes into my room to greet me. One day this week, Bud woke a bit before 4:00 a.m., but was clearly up for the day. He spent almost an hour in his room, then moved out into the hallway and lingered by my open door, waiting for the sound of my iPod, which wasn't scheduled to go off until 5:30. Around 5:00, I heard him rustling around at my bedside, but I kept my eyes closed and pretended to sleep. He climbed up next to me, and very gently slid his iPod headphones over my ears. Seconds later, I heard the opening strains of Brad Paisley's \"All I Wanted Was a Car.\" \"I hear music!\" I said. \"Does that mean it's time for me to wake up?\" \"Yeah!\" Bud said with a giggle. I've gotta say, if you  have  to wake up at 5:00 a.m., that is definitely the way to do it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/11/wake-up-call.html", "title": "\nWake-up call\n"},

He'd already created the Bubble Castle, Follow-Me Theater, and the Musical Meadow, and he was searching through the house with an elephant in his arms. \"I need a Cousin Basket,\" he said. \"A Cousin Basket?\" I asked. \"What's that?\" \"A Cousin Basket,\" he explained. \"For the animals.\" I scrolled through the Reader Rabbit game in my mind: Rainbow Rock... Pop and Play Animals... Sky Shapers... Baby Basket Bingo. Bingo. I've mentioned before that Bud is not a fan of babies. They're not as bad as thunderstorms or dogs, of course, but they certainly run a not-too-distant third. They're loud. They're unpredictable. They move suddenly and quickly, and they are best avoided at all cost. Except. Except that Bud has a one-year-old cousin. She is a loud, unpredictable, sudden-moving little thing, but she's adorable - and Bud knows it. She adores Bud, too, and he enjoys the admiration, so, against all his better judgment, he just can't help but like her. Therein lies the conflict. But Bud is a  problem-solver , and problem-solve he has. He has decided that though he still doesn't like  babies,  he does like  cousins . And when the two come into conflict, cousins trump babies every time. So, he's happy to play a modified version of the Reader Rabbit game - and I think we can all agree that Cousin Basket Bingo is infinitely more palatable than Baby Basket Bingo could ever be. Bud's willing to expand his cousin horizon even further. We have  good friends  we have not seen much over the past two years, because they have two very small children. But, lately, Bud has been coming up with excuses to drop by their house - he wants to show them his paper bag mask; he wants to show them a dance he made up. And he is clear with his requests: he would like to show these things to our friends  and their cousins . It's very good news, really, because now I can let my brother and his wife know that they're free to introduce another new cousin into the family. Just as long as they don't go and have a  baby .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/11/cousin-boom.html", "title": "\nCousin boom\n"},

Bren, the person who tagged her,  did respond  to the meme, but I tracked back and discovered that Erin, the person who tagged Bren, had thrown meme-ing caution to the wind and just went and  made the darned thing up . So, given the rampant flouting of the rules that has defined this meme so far, I'm stealing it. What song is in your head? Chris Cagle's \"What Kinda Gone.\"  It's the story of a guy whose partner slams the front door and gets into her car saying something that sounds like \"I'm gone.\" The singer doesn't think much about it until hours pass, she's still not home, and he starts thinking about what exactly \"I'm gone\" might have meant: These days \"gone\" can mean so many things: There's \"gone for good\" and there's \"good and gone,\" There's \"gone\" with a \"long\" before it; I wish she'd been just a little more clear. There's \"gone for the day,\" \"gone for the night,\"  And \"gone for the rest of your dog-gone life.\" Is it a whiskey night, or just a couple beers?

Tricky question. The latest actual CD - real, live, take-it-out-of-a-plastic-jewel-case-and-hold-it-in-your-hands CD - that I bought was Paul McCartney's  Memory Almost Full . But I'm an iTunes kind of gal. I'm all about the download. And  really , I'm all about the single-track download - the most recent of which was Billy Currington's \"I Got A Feelin'.\" What is the top album on your wish list? If I were going to download an album today, it would be Keith Urban's  Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy Thing . What is the most recent live music event you attended? Brad Paisley, with opening acts Taylor Swift, Kellie Pickler, and Jack Ingram. Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun. What is the top live music event on your wish list? I wish I was going to be  here  tomorrow night. A bit more about live music: I saw a lot of live music in my teens and twenties, but I've seen significantly less in the Post-Bud years. I've probably seen  Elvis Costello  the greatest number of times - I'd guess it's somewhere around a dozen. I've seen him with the Attractions, with the Imposters, with the Brodsky Quartet, with Nick Lowe, and on his own. I've seen him skinny and edgy; I've seen him heavy and bearded. I've seen him indoors and outdoors, in large venues and small ones, from the second row and from the balcony. And it's been a great show every time. Paul McCartney must run a close second for the number of shows seen (though he's a clear first for best show of all time).  Leo Kottke  probably comes in third. What are the top three albums currently in rotation at your house? Again, I'm not all that album-oriented these days, but I'd have to say that between Bud and me, the highest-rotation albums at our house are all Dierks Bentley - his self-titled debut,  Modern Day Drifter , and  Long Trip Alone .

When I entered the house I was surprised to find that, though Bud was highly attuned to the thunder and was talking about nothing else, he wasn't panicking. My mom explained to me that because it wasn't raining and because they could only hear a distant rumble, she'd told Bud that the thunder wasn't near our house. He wanted to know where, exactly, it was, and since she didn't want to make him afraid to go to any of the places we normally frequent, she took a cue from  South Park  and told him that the thunder was in Canada. The thunder continued to roll for the better part of an hour, and with each distant roll, Bud asked for a status report: \"Where was that?\" And each time, we gave him an answer: \"Winnipeg!\" \"Ontario!\" \"Toronto!\" \"Vancouver!\" It worked, and it kept his anxiety from escalating.

Last December, Linda H. left a comment on  one of my posts . She wrote: Hi MOM-NOS, I have a totally different subject matter than your post. I hope you don't mind. I just recently read a book, and you kept coming to my mind when I was reading it. It is a bizarre connection because the book is about archaeology. Possibly the connection because in human history there are many mysteries where there are clues to what happened, but no smoking gun evidence to make positive conclusions. To me understanding autism is very similar to this. Anyway, if you are looking for a book to read, I think you will really enjoy it. Don't let the title scare you away if archaeology is not your thing. The book is by Josh Bernstein (from the History Channel), \"Digging for the Truth, One Man's Epic Adventure Exploring the World's Greatest Archaeological Mysteries\". Take care, Linda   How could I ignore a recommendation like that? I added the book to my \"to do\" list even though I'd never seen Bernstein's television show (still haven't), and it has taken me until now to finally get around to it. So far, I've read the Foreword of  Digging for the Truth , which is less than two pages long, and I can already see why I kept coming to Linda's mind as she read the book. And I don't think it's because I'm the Archaeologist of Autism. I think it's this: Josh Bernstein writes in my voice. Or I write in his. Either way, we each use a quirky combination of writing conventions that, when taken together, create a fairly distinct style. Or I thought it was distinct. But (now, I see) perhaps not. This discovery is actually well-timed, because I've been watching a writing meme float around the blogosphere, morphing with each post. For  Kristen  and  Kyra , it was meme about writing strengths. For  Drama Mama , it was observations about writing. For  Niksmom , it was more of a writing confessional. So, I'm jumping aboard the memewagon and morphing the meme a little further. My meme is entitled:  \"What I Learned About My Writing From Reading Less Than Two Pages Written By Josh Bernstein, or: How I Discovered that I'm Not So Original After All\" Some things that Josh and I have in common: 1. We use italics when we want to help the reader (and we  always  want to help the reader) know which word in a sentence should get the most emphasis - because, as you know, the right emphasis can make  all  the difference. 2. We tend to use a lot of dashes - though we use parentheses, too (like this) - because we make a lot of tangential comments in the middle of our sentences. 3. And we also start sentences with coordinating and subordinating conjunctions. Even though some people consider it weak writing. But we don't care. So sue us. 4. For us, the comma is a useful little device, because it allows us to collect our thoughts, giving our readers a moment to pause, allowing us to construct lengthy sentences in which we reflect upon subject matter, insert our own perspectives, ponder their meaning, and, of course, make lists. 5. We're concise. I'm anxious to continue reading the book, if only to find out more about my writing. But, I have to admit, I have a feeling that by the time I reach the end, I will want to either marry Josh Bernstein or punch him in the nose.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://fromherethereandback.blogspot.com/2007/10/finding-strength.html", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/10/egads-a-meme.html", "http://likeashark.blogspot.com/2007/10/shiny-look-over-there.html", "http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/10/writers-block-meme-about-me.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/10/digging-for-meme.html", "title": "\nDigging for the meme\n"},

The rhythm world of nature, and the rhythm world of culture. Those are the rhythm worlds. They all move on together okay, and how you relate to all that stuff is how well you go through life, how happy you are. If you're in love, that's rhythmic. When you're in love with somebody, you feel the synchroning, you feel this entrainment with somebody, you want to be close to them, your heart beats the same way. You feel this thing.

Your body is functioning well, the blood is pumping you know, you exercise in the morning, you feel vitality in your life and you're rhythmically tuning, it's a tuning fork, this is what this is. Drumming, rhythm, music allows in the focusing technique, that's what this is. Drumming is a focusing technique, that's all really it is.\"  -  Mickey Hart   \n \n Mickey Hart's book  Drumming at the Edge of Magic  has been on my mind for the past couple of days. I read the book in 1990. I'm not even sure why I picked it up - I like the Grateful Dead, but I've never been a serious fan. I've never been a drummer. But for some reason, it called to me, I read it, and it has stayed with me for the past 17 years. \n \nThe book is about Hart's life as a drummer and about the art and the spirit of percussion, but it's also about the rhythms of life - the rhythms that are in all things, the way we feel when we suddenly find ourselves in sync with the people around us, the environment we're in, the universe itself. \n \nHart calls it \"entrainment\" - the groove that develops when drummers play together in a circle and a spirit emerges and takes over, making the resulting rhythm something greater than the sum of its parts. But, Hart says, entrainment is about more than just drumming. There is a rhythm in life, he says, and we spend our lives trying to get in sync with the rhythms that surround us, to find our groove, to engage with something in a way that helps us become greater than we could be alone. \n \nI thought about entrainment yesterday as Bud and I hiked through the woods together. Bud and I had been out of sync for a couple of weeks - not just with each other, but in general, with the rest of the world. Somehow it seemed like we'd both been going through our days clapping on the off-beat, though, somehow not together, not in counterpoint, and never at the same time. \n \nThe weather certainly didn't help. We'd been out of sync since a morning thunderstorm broke our rhythm and started us flailing - Bud beating too fast, me struggling to keep any beat at all. \n \nBut not so for a few glorious hours yesterday, as Bud and I hiked together in the woods, alone, together with the universe for the first time in a long time. As we hiked, we fell into rhythm with each other - our footfalls, our heartbeats, and the intake of our breath - we worked together and built on each other, and as we did, the leaves that crunched beneath our feet, the wind that rustled the branches overhead, the squirrels that darted by unseen - they all joined the rhythm, and I was suddenly aware that it was not merely a nice day. It was a spectacular day. It was the sort of blue-sky, cool-breeze autumn day that actually makes you happy that summer is over. \n \nIt all came together as we hiked. \n \nEntrainment. \n \nI've also been thinking about  Drumming at the Edge of Magic  since a meeting with the team at Bud's school on Friday. They'd invited me to join them for some note-sharing, brainstorming and problem-solving as they tried to figure out the best way to address some challenges Bud has been having lately. It was a productive meeting and as we were about to wrap up, one of the team members brought up another behavior Bud's been exhibiting at school: tapping. Tapping with pencils, tapping with hands, tapping with feet, tapping, tapping, tapping, at all kinds of volumes, during all kinds of activities. \n \n\"Is he humming when he does it?\" I asked. \n \n\"Yes.\" \n \n\"He's drumming. To a particular song - whichever one it is he's humming at the time. He's actually very good at it. You can bet that he's drumming the exact same beat he's heard on the CD. Honestly. It's pretty amazing. You should have him do it when a CD is on sometime.\" \n \nThe women at the table were quiet. I glanced around nervously, then added, \"But of course, that doesn't make it okay to be disruptive when...\" \n \nThen, before I finished my sentence, the team members started talking, their ideas flowing, their energy building, their excitement growing: \n \n\"We could capitalize on his interest in drumming...\" \n \n\"What if we got one of those practice pads that dulls the noise? He could use that in the classroom...\" \n \n\"Maybe drumming is something we could use as a reward - you know, instead of using the computer all the time...\" \n \n\"Let's talk to the music teacher. Maybe she could use this...\" \n \n\"Maybe she'd be willing to work with Bud one-on-one...\" \n \nThe energy grew, the ideas meshed, and I could almost hear it buzz and resonate and echo as it filled the room. \n \n Entrainment .  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://ca.geocities.com/dcherniack@rogers.com/hart.htm", "http://www.amazon.com/Drumming-Edge-Magic-Journey-Percussion/dp/1888358181", "http://mickeyhart.net/Pages/senspeech.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/10/parenting-at-edge-of-magic.html", "title": "\nParenting at the edge of magic\n"},

So, when they know that he may have difficulty when the classroom aide is on her lunch break or when they know he'll need some down-time after a job well done, he's given structured choices that often include the option of listening to a book on tape or listening to music through headphones. So it should not have come as a surprise to me when I walked into his classroom this morning and his teacher held up the CD she'd just purchased to have available in the classroom for him:  Dierks Bentley's   Long Trip Alone . It is a very good feeling to know that when it comes to the collaboration between school and home, we are all, quite literally, playing from the same sheet of music.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dierks.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/09/it-takes-nashvillage.html", "title": "\nIt takes a Nashvillage\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, September 29, 2007", "body": "\nKristen from  From Here to There and Back  tagged me for an irresistible book meme. Maybe you'll want to play, too. Total number of books? For many years, I kept every book I read, packing and unpacking them and carting them around with me from college residence hall room to college residence hall room and from apartment to apartment. Sometime in my post-Bud years, though, I decided that I just didn't need them all and I cleared the bookshelves and donated them away with wild abandon. These days I only hang on to the books I lovelovelove and the books I think I might read again, which comes out to about three (smallish) bookshelves full. How many books is that? I'm not sure. I'm not good at that kind of estimate. A bunch. A good number. More than a few; less than a ton. Last book read? Sadly, I have not had a good run lately. I've stalled with  A Thousand Splendid Suns  by Khaled Hosseini , not because it's not well written (it is), but because one particular plot point stopped me cold, hitting me too close to my emotional center. That happens sometimes. I'd like to say that I'll go back to the book, but I really don't think I will. (I'm being intentionally vague about the plot point for those who plan to read it. It's not the book; it's me. You should read it.) Before  A Thousand Splendid Suns , I started but didn't finish another book that will (in the spirit of  The Believer  magazine) go unnamed. After several chapters, I still didn't care about any of the people in the book. Life is too short; I moved on. Before that, I read  What You Can Do Right Now to Help Your Child with Autism , which frankly doesn't really feel like it counts. It was more a handy reference guide than a BOOK. So, by process of elimination, I'm going to have to go with  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . Not especially high-brow or impressive, but, then, neither am I. Last book bought? Again,  Harry Potter . I borrowed  A Thousand Splendid Suns , and the other two were sent by the publishers. Before that? I'm not sure. I tend to seek out hand-me-down books more than I buy new ones. It might have been Andrei Codrescu's  New Orleans, Mon Amour . (An excellent book, and a bargain at any price.) Five meaningful books? Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism  by Paul Collins - This book was meaningful to me in many ways. It was one of the first autism books I read in which I \"recognized\" the child - on page after page, Collins' son Morgan reminded me of Bud. (He still does, in fact; in  this interview  with Collins and his wife, they report that Morgan is currently fascinated by TV and movie logos. I have spent many an hour drawing TV and movie logos for Bud. I'm not sure whether or not I should introduce him to the  YouTube videos  that Morgan finds so fascinating.) On another level (and in a story that was more interesting to live than it would be to read),  Not Even Wrong  set me on a trajectory that ultimately got me writing this blog. Interestingly, I discovered  Not Even   Wrong  via an e-mail from my sister that included a link to the book's page on amazon.com and a one-line message that read \"I think the universe is telling me that I'm supposed to let you know about this book.\" (Thanks, Sis.) A Prayer for Owen Meany  by John Irving - This book blew me away. Blew. Me. Away. Hamlet  by William Shakespeare -  Hamlet  might be my favorite thing ever written. I find myself thinking about  Hamlet  a lot - which is interesting, because throughout the play, all Hamlet really does is a whole lot of thinking. Really, though, thinking about Hamlet's thinking helps me to remember to get out of my head when I find myself getting all \"to be or not to be\" on myself. (And I don't mean suicidal here, folks. I mean painfully introspective and grossly self-indulgent.) Enough said. Operating Instructions  by Anne Lamott - This book kept me sane in the first months of Bud's life. It made me feel more normal and less incompetent as a mother. Or maybe it made me feel incompetent, but in good company. The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  by Michael Chabon - This book replaced  A Prayer for Owen Meany  as my favorite book of all time. In fairness, I should go back and read  Owen Meany  again before I state that publicly, since I read  Owen Meany  in 1989 and  Kavalier and Clay  in 2005. But, too late; it's already done. I'm not going to tag anyone specifically for this one, but I invite everyone to join the bandwagon.

{"date": "Wednesday, October 31, 2007", "body": "\nThis year, my fall has been defined by the weather. Specifically, it's been defined by Bud's anxiety about the weather. Rainy days - even those unaccompanied by  thunderstorms  - have been horrible, because in Bud's mind they all bring with them the potential for thunder. But even clear days have been a struggle this fall - because any cloud in the sky might be the  wrong  kind of cloud, and because every clear day ends with dusk. And dusk means that the sky gets dark. Just the way it does before a thunderstorm. In recent months, Bud's anxiety has been so intense that it led to a trial run with a new medication that is (so far, fingers crossed) having positive results. These days, Bud is not as  anxious  about the weather, but he is just as  conscious  of it. A few weeks ago, Bud jumped at every noise - real or imagined - after nightfall: \"What was that? Is that thunder? Is that a storm? Is a storm coming? Are the lights flicking?\" But these days, the anxiety has been replaced by mere preoccupation: \"That's not thunder. That's just the dryer. Is that you, Nana? That's just Nana making some noise. Don't you worry, Mama. There's no storm. That's just a truck.\" It's not as troubling, but it is just as constant, just as ever-present, just as nonstop. I've tried every approach I could think of over the past few months to respond to Bud's weather preoccupation. I've tried reassurance, negotiation, rational explanation, scientific analysis, myth and fairy tale, joking, ignoring, and (in my less proud moments) grouching and whining. Nothing has worked. This weekend, however, I began to see a glimmer of hope. Bud was doing his now-typical \"it's-not-a-storm\" commentary, and I was continuing to vary my responses in an ongoing trial-and-error way, until, finally, I was approaching wit's end. Bud asked, \"There's no thunder, Mama?\" And, with no game plan and no good ideas, I put a silly look on my face, zoomed across the room to Bud, put my face in his, and bounced my nose against his cheekbone. Bud laughed. He  laughed . I crossed back to the other side of the room and resumed what I'd been doing. Bud asked, \"There's no storm?\" I dropped what I was doing, zoomed over to Bud, and wordlessly bounced my nose against his face. \"What you did to me, Mama?\" Bud asked, giggling. \"That's what I'm going to do from now on,\" I said, keeping the silly look on my face. \"When you ask about a storm, I'm going to do this  {zoom-nose-bounce}  and that means 'no, there's no storm.'\" I began to walk away, then heard from behind me, \"That's just the wind?\" Zoom-nose-bounce. Laughter. I walked away again. This time I heard the laughter first, then a giggle-filled sentence asking \"There's no storm today?\" Zoom-nose-bounce. Laugh together. So far, the slapstick comedy of  zoom-nose-bounce  has carried us through three days - three  rain-free  days, of course, but three days nonetheless. Its effectiveness seems to be diminishing a little as the weather preoccupation regains its foothold, but unless it's my imagination, I think that maybe -  maybe  - the intensity of the perseveration is diminishing a little, too. Time will tell. In the meantime, I'll keep following my nose, keep my fingers crossed, and hope that the skies stay clear.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/10/plain-as-nose-on-your-face.html", "title": "\nPlain as the nose on your face\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 09, 2007", "body": "\nThe students in my writing class have spent the bulk of the semester writing personal narratives about a single day in their lives. They're currently on the fourth draft and they have officially reached the point at which they are 1) sick to death of that day, and 2) resentful at my insistence that each draft be comprised of  entirely new writing . \"But I  like  my last draft,\" they say. \"How much more can I  say  about that day? I've already  said  what happened.\" I respond by talking to them about spotlights. \"Let's say,\" I begin, \"that I am writing an essay about this classroom. Look around. There's a lot here. There's a lot to write about. But I only have four pages to work with. So I'm going to turn off the lights and shine a spotlight on just one area of the room, and I'll write four pages about just that area.\" I turn to a young man seated in front of me. \"Let's say that when I shine my spotlight, the only person I can see is Jim. In that case, my essay is going to be about Jim's experience of the class, or my experience of Jim in the class. I'm going to write in depth and in detail about Jim, and to my reader, Jim will be the most important part of this class. In my next draft, though, I'm going to shine the spotlight on that spot on the wall where the clock used to hang, but no longer does. Now my four pages are going to focus on how things fall into disrepair while we're not paying attention, or about how the presence of a clock affects the sense of timing in a classroom, or about how the  absence  of something can be even more powerful that the  presence  of something.  And this time, my reader will think that the missing clock is the most important part of this class.\" At this point in the lecture, the students sigh heavily and resign themselves to the fact that they are just not going to win this one. But why am I telling you all this? Here's why:  Blogging is a lot like those hypothetical essays about my classroom.  That clockless spot on the wall was there when I was writing about Jim.  Jim was there when I was writing about the clockless spot.  But they weren't in the spotlight, and so to the reader, they didn't exist.   So I want to say this:  I've been shining spotlights in recent posts.  My  last post  about entrainment captured two lovely snapshots - two real, true, genuine, lovely snapshots of my life.  The post yielded a lot of \"wow.\"  And I can see why: the snapshots were wow.  But outside the frame of the snapshots, there in the shadow not illuminated by the spotlight, there was much less wow.  Or there was a whole different kind of wow. So why am I still telling you this? Sometimes when my writing focuses on one kind of wow to the exclusion of the other, I start to feel disingenuous.  I start to feel like I'm lying by omission, like I'm painting a picture of life with Bud - life with autism - just plain life - that is designed to make readers believe one thing, when another thing is equally true.  And I start to worry that people will read my writing and think  \"How can it be so easy for her when it is so blasted difficult for me?\" So, I'm writing this vague and blurry post to let you know that if I shifted the spotlight on recent days and weeks, you'd walk away with a different perspective.  But  I won't shift the spotlight .  And I'll continue to focus on just one kind of wow.  Because, sometimes, that's just the best I can do.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/10/spotlights-and-shadows.html", "title": "\nSpotlights and shadows\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 03, 2007", "body": "\nI learned this week that Bud needs to have his tonsils and adenoids removed. I knew it was coming. His tonsils are the size of my head. (Okay, not really - but you know what I mean. They're  really  big.) When he's sick, he has trouble breathing. This summer we had to rush him to the emergency room; that's how bad it gets. It turns out that his tonsils aren't just causing problems when he's sick. They are also causing sleep apnea, which, in turn, means that he is not having restful sleep. The lack of restful sleep was  not news to me . The apnea - the fact that  he stops breathing  while he sleeps - was.  And that's a fact that could give me a lot of sleepless nights. So he's scheduled for surgery in December. I had my tonsils out a few years ago, and it was the worst experience of my life. Now, I understand that 1) I am, for the most part, a big baby about things like that, and 2) recovery from a tonsillectomy is easier for a child than it is for an adult, but, still, I wish it could be avoided. There is a silver lining here, however. Yesterday I told a special educator at Bud's school about the upcoming surgery and she said, \"Have you seen the research that suggests a connection between tonsils and ADHD?\" I hadn't. But  now I have , and it makes me hopeful. Bud doesn't technically have an ADHD diagnosis, but behaviorally, a lot of Bud's challenges look an awful lot like ADHD. So it will be interesting to see what the long-term benefits of the surgery are for him. At the very least, it's likely to result in more and better sleep.

On Tuesday afternoon, I received a lovely e-mail from Cassidy Bentley, Dierks' wife. They'd read my letter and wanted to give me an update on the status of his haircut. I won't keep you in suspense: Cassidy says that Dierks may be growing the short hair out. But, she assured me, he'll be growing it slowly and not to its original length, so maybe, she said encouragingly,  just maybe  that would give Bud the time he needed to make the transition, too. And, she said, they'd love to send Bud some short-hair-only mail when Dierks gets home from his current tour. Yes. It's true. Dierks and Cassidy Bentley really are that terrific. After I read Cassidy's e-mail and mopped myself up off the floor, I wrote back to thank her for her thoughtfulness, to thank her for reaching out, to thank her for caring that a seven-year-old boy with autism is troubled by the length of her husband's hair. We had a brief exchange from there about the power of the internet and about the remarkable nature of the virtual community it houses. The next morning I thought about our exchange as I drove to work. The title track of Dierks'  latest album  was playing on my iPod: It's a long trip alone over sand and stone That lie along the road that we all must travel down So maybe you could walk with me a while And maybe I could rest beneath your smile Everybody stumbles sometimes and needs a hand to hold 'Cause it's a long trip alone It's a short piece of time but just enough to find A little peace of mind under the sun somewhere So maybe you could walk with me a while And maybe I could rest beneath your smile You know we can't afford to let one moment pass us by 'Cause it's a short piece of time It started me thinking. Long trip alone.  Short piece of time. Two themes I seem to hear a lot about from the parents of children with autism. On one level, Cassidy sent me an e-mail to discuss Bud's concerns about Dierks with long hair vs. Dierks with short hair. But on another level - on a much more important level - she sent me an e-mail to reach out, to connect, to say \"I'm here, too.\" And her e-mail reminded me that this parenting journey - this parenting journey so often defined by autism - doesn't have to be a long trip alone. There are supporters around every corner. There are allies at every turn. And sometimes they come from the most unlikely of places. We just need to remember to reach out. Reach out when we need. Reach out when we're needed. Thanks, Cassidy. And thanks, Dierks. It was a short exchange, but it's one that will stay with me for a long, long time. Free and easy down the road we go.

I just don't tend to feel them about grandiose things; I'm a lot more modest when I expend those particular emotions. Let me give you an example. I go to a fabulous concert and see a wildly talented artist perform in front of thousands of adoring fans, who hoot and shout and stomp in appreciation, and I'm jealous. But I'm not jealous of the wildly talented artist, the recipient of the appreciative hoots, shouts, and stomps. I'm jealous of the person who is hooting, shouting, and stomping  in the front row . I mean, let's face it: I could never be the wildly talented artist. I have neither the ability nor the inclination. It could never happen. It's wasted envy. But that person in the front row? That could have been me. The same thing happens with writing. In fact, it happened recently when I was reading the final installment of the Harry Potter series,  Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . I got jealous of J.K. Rowling. I wasn't jealous because she is the best-selling author of an outrageously popular seven-part series of novels that has sparked the interest and inspired the allegiance of children and adults around the world. That's simply too far removed from my own personal reality. I don't even write fiction. I have neither the ability nor the inclination to write a short story, never mind an internationally best-selling seven-part series of novels. But I can write a great sentence. I can. Not always, of course. But every now and then I can write a really great sentence. Some of them appear right here on this blog - I stop back now and then to visit them. And so it was that a single sentence in Book 7 - one really terrific, stop-reading-and-marvel-at-me sentence - sent my envy into overdrive. Have you read  Deathly Hallows ? You have? Then you must know the sentence I'm talking about. It's right there on the top of page 236: \"Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.\" You know just what she means, don't you?

It's especially helpful when we're out shopping - it helps him manage the crowds, the bustle, the noise. It helps him stay focused and calm. But there is a flip side. Bud's iPod seems to invite comment from the older generation. Occasionally the remarks are made to the air, but are clearly directed to me, and involve some sort of commentary on the technology-driven isolationism of kids today, with a subtext of judgment about parents who indulge their young children too much - all said, naturally, with a wink and a laugh. That stuff rolls off pretty easily. More challenging to manage - and more common, unfortunately - are the comments directed to Bud himself. The comments themselves are innocent enough, but it's like the iPod is a  magnet  for them; we hear them nearly every time we're out in public. In almost every case, it seems the stranger takes a look at Bud and surmises two things: 1) Bud is listening to music so loud that it would be difficult to hear a comment made to him, and 2) Bud's failure to engage with the strangers around him and his seemingly complete focus on the music he's hearing is an unintended  side effect  of the iPod and is not, in fact, Bud's  intent . So the stranger leans down to Bud and asks loudly (or, sometimes, even shouts): \"WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE?\" or \"WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO?\" or \"CAN I HAVE A LISTEN?\" or \"HEY, WHAT'S PLAYING?\" Bud inevitably pulls back and doesn't answer, which prompts the stranger to either move closer or talk louder or both. I have not come up with a good response to this yet. Sometimes I try to engage the stranger myself, answering the question and shielding Bud from further interrogation  (\"He's listening to Dierks Bentley. He's a big fan.\")  Sometimes I pretend to engage Bud in my answer  (\"You're listening to Dierks Bentley, aren't you, Bud? You love his music.\")  And, occasionally, when my mom-sense tells me that this will continue unless I intervene more directly, I say  \"He's autistic. The iPod helps him feel more comfortable in crowds.\"  I never know how Bud feels about that particular response, so I try to use it sparingly. For the most part, I just smile and nod, and try to get Bud away from the questioner as gracefully as possible.

{"date": "Saturday, September 01, 2007", "body": "\nThis was a difficult week for Bud. He started second grade, and though he likes his teacher and classroom aide, though he is enjoying time with his  best buddy Kelly , though he seems happy to be back in the school building and the school routine, he is having trouble making the adjustment back to the norms of school life - the imposition of other people's agendas, the limited choices available to him, the new sights and smells and sounds that accompany any new classroom environment. And though, overall, he is managing the transition relatively well, it has been complicated by environmental factors - two house-shaking  thunderstorms  in rapid succession that have rattled him to his core, making it hard for him to relax and harder still for him to focus on anything else except the potential of another thunderstorm arriving without warning. It was in the midst of this back-to-school-preparation/bad-weather-perseveration that two packages arrived at our house. The first package was addressed to Bud, a boy who likes nothing better than getting a package in the mail addressed to him. He ripped it open and found two things inside: a  Dierks Bentley  concert T-shirt that was just his size and a page-long hand-written letter that said  just the right things in just the right words with just the right tone : Dear Bud, Hey buddy... I heard that you are a fan of my music! Thanks... I'm glad you enjoy listening to the records and watching the videos. You may notice that I look a little different in some of my earlier videos. That's because I use to have longer hair and it was pretty curly! But I got a haircut about a year ago. So I wanted to send you a picture and a T-shirt that shows what I look like now. Keep listening to the music... Thanks, my friend. God Bless, Dierks Bentley Bud was shaking as we read the letter out loud together. \"Wow, Bud,\" I said, as I read the final line. \"He says 'thanks, my friend.' Dierks says that you're his friend!\" \"No,\" said Bud. \"He's just pretend.\" I quickly realized that Bud was giving me the same response I give to him when he asks if he can visit Teletubbyland, play with Zoboomafoo, or interact with some other fictional character he's seen on television: \"That's just pretend.\" \"No, Bud,\" I said. \"Dierks is on TV, but he isn't pretend. He's real. He  really  wrote you this letter and he  really  said you're his friend.\" \"Yeah,\" Bud answered, his eyes still glued to the letter and registering a hint of disbelief, but his mouth curving into a shy smile. I opened the second package, which was addressed to me, and found a concert DVD and a note from  Cassidy Bentley  explaining that she wanted to sneak it in just in case Bud comes around to the long hair. They are good people, those Bentleys. Real  good people. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dierks.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/09/really-something.html", "title": "\nReally something\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 26, 2007", "body": "\nThough Bud will be eight years old in a few short months, he has continued to be a fan of television made for preschoolers. While his peers are buzzing about  Shrek  and  Spiderman , Bud's been content to focus his attention on the Teletubbies, Blues Clues, and Sesame Street. There has been a significant advantage to this: in the tv that Bud has always watched, there are no \"bad guys\" and the language the characters use is respectful and appropriate. As a result, because Bud still relies heavily on  echolalia , his language - so often based on scripts from the shows he sees - has remained relatively innocuous and pleasant. In recent weeks, though, Bud's been pushing the boundaries and taking a (tentative) walk on the wild side. He'd gotten a Disney book and cd set for Christmas, but had ignored it completely for months. Then suddenly -  as he does  - he pulled it out, dusted it off, gave it his full attention, and discovered the wonder that is  101 Dalmatians . He's been reading along with the storybook as he listens to the cd. He's been listening to the cd in the dark each night as he falls asleep. And, much to my surprise, he has gone to the shelf that holds a wholly ignored and overlooked Disney video collection and pulled down the  101 Dalmatians  DVD. For a while, he simply carried it around and looked at it. And then he watched it. Twice. It has opened a whole new, thrillingly subversive door for Bud. I wondered what Bud's take on this new on-screen interpersonal dynamic would be: would he get the good-vs-evil interplay? Would he understand why we are cheering on dalmatians Pongo and Perdita and disdaining the evil Cruella de Vil and her thugs-for-hire, Horace and Jasper? But I needn't have worried. Bud understands it perfectly. He knows who the good guys are; he knows who the bad guys are.  But for the first time in his life, he seems intrigued by - drawn to - not frightened of - the bad guys. So, suddenly, Bud's speech has become peppered with Cruella-speak: \"Why, you imbecile!\" he'll shout at me. Or, \"You fools!\" And, worse, \"Ah, shut up!\" Bud and I have started talking about time, place, and circumstance for words like that. We've talked about what makes Cruella a \"bad guy\" and why she uses words like that. He gets it. \"Mean words make people sad,\" I've explained. \"We don't say mean words to people.\" \"Just to toys,\" Bud has offered. And so I hear him as he plays with his characters, muttering under his breath as he makes Bert scold Ernie: \"You IMBECILE!\" I recognize it as another  double-edged  developmental step forward. Bud's discovering another layer of the human condition. He's recognizing it within himself. And, truth be told, he's grooving on it. He's channeling his inner Cruella. As for me - I'm just taking a deep breath and preparing myself as best I can for the  tween  years.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tween"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/06/cruella-de-bud.html", "title": "\nCruella de Bud\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 13, 2007", "body": "\nDear Dierks, We need to talk. It's about the hair. Now, I'll admit that Bud and I are relative latecomers to the  Dierks Bentley  bandwagon. Despite that, though, we are big fans. In fact, Bud has recently announced that you are his favorite singer. Better than  Paul McCartney . Better than Raffi. This is big stuff. Anyway, we discovered you through your latest hit single, \"Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)\" and, especially, through repeated viewings of the video. (If you've hit number one on the Yahoo Launch playlist, we have probably had something to do with it.) So the image of you that formed in Bud's mind - the image of you that is YOU as far as Bud is concerned - is the one that he saw in that video. The one, in other words, of you with short hair. Recently, Bud has been branching out and exploring the Dierks Bentley catalog. He's got  Long Trip Alone  on his iPod. He recognizes your voice when he hears it on the radio, and so we've also added a number of other songs to his db playlist - like \"Settle for a Slowdown,\" \"Come a Little Closer,\" and \"Wish it Would Break.\" (So far we've avoided \"Domestic, Light and Cold,\" thank you very much.) And now that he's familiar with so many of your songs, he is also interested in mining  your video library . We've checked out a lot of your videos on Yahoo. You know the videos I'm talking about, right? They're the ones of you with long hair.   Bud is, to say the least, unsettled by them. It plays out the same way no matter which early video we watch. The music starts, Bud is delighted, and then you and your long hair appear on the screen. \"That's Dierks when he was little?\" Bud asks. \"Well, when he was younger,\" I answer. \"That's Dierks when he was younger,\" Bud says. \"Yes,\" I reply. Bud pauses, watches for another moment, then says, \"Let's try something else.\" Inevitably, the path leads us back to \"Free and Easy\" and your predictable, familiar short hair. Now, I know that the length of your hair might seem like a trivial thing to be writing about, but trust me - in this corner of Autismland, it's not. For Bud, your short hair is grounding. It's an anchor. It's possible that we could work up some flexibility on the matter. Occasionally we are able to watch \" Long Trip Alone ,\" since you actually get your hair cut halfway through the video. But only occasionally. These days Bud is preoccupied with your hair even when there's no visual to distract him. We'll be cruising along in the car, happily listening to \"My Love Will Follow You,\" and a troubled little voice from the back seat will ask, \"Dierks has short hair, Mama?\" \"Yes, he has short hair now.\" \"He sings 'My Love Will Follow You' with short hair?\" \"Yes, I think he has short hair while he's singing this one.\" And yes, I know I'm lying, but honestly, sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do. Anyway, the reason I'm writing: I'm sure you're going to have a long, successful career, and Bud and I plan to enjoy it right along with you. We'd like to be able to watch your videos, check out your tv appearances, and maybe, someday, even see you in concert. So, the new look? The short hair?  Stick with it. All the best, MOM-NOS \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dierks.com/", "http://music.yahoo.com/ar-303313-videos--Dierks-Bentley", "http://video.music.yahoo.com/up/music/music/?rn=1301797&vid=39563390&stationId=&curl=http%3A%2F%2Fmusic.yahoo.com%2Far-303313-videos--Dierks-Bentley"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/08/open-letter-to-dierks-bentley.html", "title": "\nAn open letter to Dierks Bentley\n"},

{"date": "Monday, September 17, 2007", "body": "\nFor those who have been following the unfolding saga of Bud and the length of Dierks Bentley's hair (in  three   different   installments ), I offer yet another chapter. These days Bud has been proving that he's not a boy who runs from a challenge. Indeed, he is a boy who faces his fears head-on (as it were), seeking out the the things that unsettle him so that he can deconstruct and demystify them. For the past week, Bud's most-requested and most-watched video has been Dierks Bentley's \"Settle for a Slowdown.\" You can watch it here, and when you do you will probably notice the two things in it that have captivated Bud: 1. Bud's friend Dierks has long hair, and 2. Bud's friend Dierks is caught outside in a  thunderstorm . Bud watches the video as often as I'll let him. Each time he watches, he narrates the action as it happens. He is drawn, especially, to the flashes of lightning and he watches intently as his hero faces the storm outside and the storm within, as the rain starts falling, as his long hair clings, dripping, to his face. And somehow -  somehow  - watching this happen again and again, narrating it as it happens, Bud seems to be emboldened by it. The lightning in the video becomes a little less scary with each subsequent viewing. And while it hasn't yet transferred to a comfort with real-life lightning, it has got to be a good start. (There is a tag line here about \"settling for a slowdown\" that begs to be written, but, really, that's the easy way out, isn't it? I'll resist.) For some reason, Bud is also fascinated by the fact that in this video Dierks appears to live in a mobile home. Bud says he would really, really like to visit a \"car house.\" There are two other high-rotation videos on Bud's playlist these days - both featuring long-haired men, interestingly enough. The first is Keith Urban's \" I Told You So ,\" which also features a storm and seems to have the same emboldening effect on Bud. The second is Eric Church's \" Guys Like Me ,\" the bulk of which takes place in a pool hall. This weekend as we watched the video, Bud stared at the screen and asked \"They're in a church?\" \"No,\" I explained. \"His  name  is Eric Church. They're in a bar.\" And that was it - he was off: \"I want to go to a bar!\" he said. And then he continued to say it all weekend long: \"I want to go to a bar. Can we go to a bar? Let's go to a bar!\" Knowing Bud, his preoccupation with bars will continue all week.  I have to admit, I can't help but wonder what they thought at school today about the way we spend our weekends.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://video.music.yahoo.com/up/music/music/?rn=1301797&vid=42544965&stationId=&curl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.music.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fp%3Di%2Btold%2Byou%2Bso%26m%3Dvideo", "http://video.music.yahoo.com/up/music/music/?rn=1301797&vid=42779993&stationId=&curl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.music.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fp%3Dguys%2Blike%2Bme%26m%3Dvideo"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/09/for-those-who-have-been-following.html", "title": "\nFacing demons, watching friends\n"},

I've written a lot about Bud's language development - his  earliest language , the  flashes of development , my hopes for him to develop a flexibility and ease in  dynamic situations . But sometimes it's difficult to recognize Bud's development as it happens. To be sure, our conversations have gotten lengthier and more complicated, his language more spontaneous and free - but as it happens day-to-day, it is sometimes only in retrospect that I can see how far he's come. The other day, though, I recognized his progress in the moment. We were in the middle of the bedtime routine when I discovered that his toothbrush was missing. (Bud is a big fan of toothbrushes, and much to my chagrin he frequently carts them around the house to use as playthings and  character stand-ins .) With a sigh, I instructed him to go downstairs to the other bathroom and retrieve his spare toothbrush. I waited upstairs while I heard him pad down the stairs. Seconds ticked by, then minutes, and I heard him rattling around in the kitchen. In an exasperated tone I shouted from upstairs, \"Bud, did you find your toothbrush?\" His reply came instantly, also with a hint of exasperation: \"Papa's in the bathroom!\" The conversation stopped me short. In Bud's earlier logical, linear, concrete communication style, the question \"Did you find your toothbrush?\" would have had two possible responses: \"Yes, I did\" or \"No, I didn't.\" But Bud wasn't thinking in a logical, linear, concrete way. He was thinking in a flexible, dynamic, abstract way. He listened to my words, he listened to my tone, he considered the context, and he knew instantly that I was  not  actually asking him if he'd found his toothbrush. He  listened  to \"Did you find your toothbrush?\" but he  heard  (accurately) \"I am getting frustrated because I told you to get your toothbrush and bring it here and you haven't done it yet.\" Then, in a fraction of an instant, having considered my question, he responded. He  said  \"Papa's in the bathroom,\" but he  meant  \"Please get off my back - I am trying to follow instructions but I can't get into the bathroom right now and am just biding my time until I can.\" Bud spoke only four words.

I've also had a wonderful e-mail conversation with the woman from Ragdoll about their  new partnership  with Autism Speaks and Cure Autism Now and about the role that the Teletubbies have played - and continue to play - in Bud's life. She passed on a link to  Understanding Teletubbies ,  a terrific video for parents that walks through an episode of Teletubbies, spotlighting and explaining the ways that the program is very intentionally designed and structured to address the developmental tasks that typical two- and three-year-old children face. What was most interesting to me, though, was that many of the developmental tasks highlighted in the video are  precisely the same ones  that are challenging for Bud: making transitions, shifting attention, making predictions, managing change. And on and on and on. I always new that the Teletubbies were good for Bud's heart and Bud's spirit. But I'd never considered before that they are  also  good for his development.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 01, 2007", "body": "\n This post is written in honor of  Blogging Against Disablism Day . To find other participating blogs,  click here . Scenario One: I'm sitting with a group of college staff members - thoughtful, open-minded, warm-hearted young people in their first professional positions. They are talking about Richard, a student who is probably on the spectrum. He is finishing a rocky first year at the institution. He's been without a roommate since the first weeks of September. He has struggled in many of his classes. He has made few real connections on campus. The conversation focuses on preparations for next year and centers on concern about Richard's ability to manage placement with a new roommate. \"Couldn't he have gotten a single room for medical reasons?\" someone asks. \"He probably could have, but he didn't request one,\" someone else answers. Conversation turns to the reasons why it might be difficult for a new roommate to adjust to life with Richard. \"Richard talks to himself as he walks around campus.\" \"Actually he switches his voice to a higher pitch and talks back to himself.\" \"Really?\" \"Apparently the high-pitch voice has a name. Suzanne. He talks to her, and she talks back.\" \"Really?!\" On one level, the tone of the conversation is respectful and factual. But I think we are all aware of an undercurrent of incredulity, bemusement, and perhaps pity that is building momentum just beneath the surface. I'm not sure where the conversation is going and I'm not sure I want to go with it, so I open my mouth. \"When I look at Richard,\" I say, as heads turn toward me, \"I see my son in ten years.\" My words are followed by a very thoughtful pause. ------------------------------ Scenario Two: I'm reading blogs. There are no new posts on any of my regular reads - the blogs written by parents of children with autism or the blogs written by autistic adults - so I start surfing and I find myself in the world of \"mainstream\" mom-blogs. I read thought-provoking, insightful prose by mothers whose children are not autistic, are not disabled, are not developmentally delayed. I am startled to find that so many of these moms seem so much like me. Then I am startled because I am startled. I read a post written by a mom looking for support and reassurance. She has a child who is \"clingy,\" who wants to be held, who can only fall asleep in her mother's arms. In this lengthy post, I see flashes of Bud as a baby, Bud as a toddler, myself as a mother. This mom is writing, she says, for reassurance that she is not alone; she wants to know that others have experienced something like this. She's writing, she says, because she is starting to panic, starting to believe that she is not handling this clinginess the \"right\" way, the way that will be most helpful to her child. She wants to know what other mothers do to get through these moments of panic and self-doubt. I have a lot to say. I click on \"Post a Comment\" and the words flow.  You are not alone , I say.  I have been there , I say.  And this. And this. And this. And   this , I say. And then I finish the comment, and I freeze and think: This mom - this panicky mom - may follow my comment back to my blog. And then she'll discover that Bud is autistic. Bud - the baby who was clingy - the toddler who could not fall asleep unless his arms were wrapped tightly around my neck - the child who reminds me so much of her child - is autistic. The parts of Bud that remind me of her child are not the parts that pointed to his diagnosis. They are traits shared by many children, autistic and neurotypical alike. I know that. But she may not. She is looking for reassurance and support - but not, certainly, from mothers like me. She wants to know that she's not alone - but it couldn't possibly help her to know that I am in the seat beside her. She is looking for help. I have nothing to offer. I delete my comment. I leave nothing in its place. ------------------------------- Sometimes the disablism we confront in the world outside is a lot easier to handle than the disablism we confront in the world within.  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2007/04/blogging-against-disablism-day-will-be.html", "http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2007/04/blogging-against-disablism-day-will-be.html", "http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2007/05/blogging-against-disablism-day-2007.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/05/inside-out-blogging-against-disablism.html", "title": "\nInside out: Blogging Against Disablism Day\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 19, 2007", "body": "\nPeople blog for a lot of different reasons. Some blogs are designed to be a sort of virtual town square - a public forum in which all are invited to climb upon a soapbox and engage in robust politicking, complete with scathing diatribes and ad hominem attacks, in which free speech is valued above all else. This is not one of those blogs. In marked contrast to the town-square model of blogging, I think of this blog as my own personal living room. I've chosen the furniture, I've arranged the seating just so, I've brewed the coffee, and I've baked the pie. I welcome you into my home. I'm the mother of a child with autism and in my real life I don't know many other parents of children with autism. In real life, I don't know any autistic adults who talk to me about being autistic. In real life, I have a wonderful but small circle of educators and specialists to act as a resource. In real life, many of my friends and relatives live a long distance away from me. In real life, I don't get out much. But here, in this virtual living room, we can all come together. We can swap stories. We can offer support. We can laugh and cry together. And the coffee is always hot and never overbrewed. This is a good place we've got going. But here's the thing: My door is open. I welcome visitors. I am anxious to hear your stories and I look forward to our dialogues. But even though we are gathering together here on the Internet, I want to be perfectly clear: when you are visiting here, you are in my home. As such, I need to invoke the tired parenting adage that teenagers loathe, but later adopt when they have children of their own: My house, my rules. And my primary rule is this: you may not enter my house and treat my other guests badly. If you walk into my living room and start trashing the place, I will ask you to leave. If you visit my blog and use my comments section to level personal attacks at my other guests or at my parenting style or at my philosophy on life, I will delete your comments without fanfare - without, in fact, so much as a mention. My house, my rules. That is not to say that you can't disagree with me or with anyone else who is posting here. To the contrary - I welcome alternate views! I want to know what you believe, and why you believe it. But I ask that when you broach delicate subjects with others with whom you disagree, you do so in the spirit of the  moral conversation  - by looking for the truth in what you oppose and the error in what you espouse. Be passionate and forceful when you share your perspective, but be respectful - and know that if your comments smack of mean-spiritedness or baiting or disrespect, then they will disappear quickly. What standard will I use to judge? I'll use my own standards, guided by my own  beliefs . If I wouldn't stand for it in my wood-and-shingles house, then I won't stand for it in my virtual living room either. My house, my rules. So, to my friends who have long been making themselves comfortable on my virtual couch but who have been strangely absent in recent days, to those friends and strangers who have e-mailed me privately over the past 24 hours feeling too vulnerable to post their thoughts openly, please come back. There are plenty of comfortable seats left, and I've just brewed a fresh pot of coffee. Please, make yourself at home. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.uua.org/visitors/6798.shtml", "http://www.chookooloonks.com/kindblog/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/04/my-blog-my-home.html", "title": "\nMy blog, my home\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 17, 2007", "body": "\nTeddy Willis is an eleven-year-old boy with autism. Because April is Autism Awareness Month, Teddy thought it might provide him the perfect opportunity to talk with his classmates about autism. If other children understood autism, he thought, perhaps they would be kinder to him and to other children who have it. Unfortunately, Teddy's plan didn't play out the way he'd hoped it would. According to an article in the  Bucks County Courier Times , During a morning meeting last week, when a teacher talked about autism, Teddy raised his hand to share his story. But he said he was taken aside and told that autism is something \u201cpersonal\u201d he should keep to himself. Teddy doesn't understand what's wrong with talking about autism. The disorder is just a part of who he is. Sort of like how some people have red hair and others are better at math. Teddy's school principal doesn't seem to share his perspective, explaining her position by saying, \u201cThere are other children in classrooms who don't realize they are different than anyone else. I need to look at the privacy of others.\u201d In other words, it seems that the principal thought it would be in students' best interest to: 1) deny Teddy an opportunity for self-advocacy and empowerment; 2) forego a significant learning opportunity for neurotypical children - not just an opportunity to learn about autism, but also an opportunity to engage in conversation about sensitivity and about appreciating difference; and 3) forfeit the potential for autistic students to be better understood because, she believed, some of them might be unaware that they  are  misunderstood. I'm afraid that the principal's unspoken message to Teddy - and to all of the students she is trying to protect - might have been this:  Autism is not just a part of who you are.

You see, sometime last week I discovered that the traffic to my blog had suddenly jumped and I had several hundred more visitors than I usually see in a single day. After a bit of investigating, I learned that if you Googled \" Memory Almost Full \" that day, my blog post was the first hit that popped up. My traffic has dropped off a bit, as I've since been replaced in the number one spot. However, even though Sundays are usually slow around here, today things have been picking up again. It seems that today I'm the number one Google hit for \" Ever Present Past .\" So it got me thinking. You've been in the press a lot lately, and it's not all been good news. You've just  changed labels . You're set to release your first new album in several years. Perhaps you're wondering about the buzz...  Are people talking? And, if so, what are they saying?  If you wanted to get a sense of the spin, maybe you'd turn to Google. And if you turned to Google... well, you just might land here. So you may be wondering: who is this person that Google seems to think is a McCartney expert? I have you at a disadvantage here since I blog with a pseudonym, but let me help you out a little: Maybe you watched some of the interview outtakes from your last tour. Do you remember the  woman who talked about her autistic son , and how much your music  meant to both of them ? That was me. Still fuzzy? Well, perhaps you remember the card you got when Linda died, from the woman who'd  lost a daughter  three months earlier? Also me. Or maybe you remember the summer of 1990, when your Fun Club office was flooded with letters from people all over the U.S. requesting that you send an autograph to their friend who had a birthday coming up? Yes. Me. (And thanks for the autographed postcard, even if you only sent it to make the blasted letters stop coming.) So perhaps now the picture is a little clearer. Or maybe it's not. I imagine that there are a whole lot of folks like me out there in the world. I've met some of them, actually. They are good people. And I'd wager that more than a few of them  feel the same way about you  that I do. So, really, if you're surfing in here from Google, then I just want to say one thing: Thanks. Just thanks. You know for what. Oh, and one other thing. I'm not sure which celebrity circles you run in, and I don't know if British celebrities tend to cross paths with other British celebrities all the time or not, but I have to say this just in case: If you happen to run into the Teletubbies, could you  pass this on to them ? Thanks again. All the best, MOM-NOS\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/04/open-letter-to-paul-mccartney.html", "title": "\nAn open letter to Paul McCartney\n"},

I posted my thoughts following the original broadcast of  The View  in a conversation with Kristen in the comments section of another post. You can follow the whole conversation  here , but I've cut-and-pasted my thoughts into this post for your convenience: First of all, I have to say that Toni Braxton is amazing for being on the show just four months after her son's diagnosis. She was getting a lot of information all at once, which is overwhelming for anyone, but to get it in front of a national audience must have been that much more difficult. Overall, I think they made an effort to be balanced and tried to fit a broad range of experience in a very short amount of time. Of course, my preference would be that they highlight things like RDI and SCERTS, since that's where I hang my hat, instead of just ABA. There was some wording that made me cringe, but all in all I think they showed a range of perspectives. The thing that was most difficult for me personally was that for some of the segments the parents had their children with them, but they talked about them with the hosts as if they weren't sitting there. For me, it felt a little intrusive, and I kept wondering what the kids thought about what they were hearing. There was one set of parents at the end who talked to the hosts while their daughter was backstage, then invited her out at the end to give the hosts presents she had made for them. That felt a lot more comfortable to me. Then, in a later comment, I added: Did you get the sense that Rosie has a personal connection to autism in some way? She didn't say so, but she seemed very knowledgeable and very familiar with the \"lingo.\" She made reference to having read some of the books they mentioned, which made me remember that a long time ago she had Paul Collins's book  Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism  listed as a recommendation on her blog.  I don't know - I just got the sense that it went beyond \"celebrity charity\" for her. (She also seemed to be the driving force behind the one-hour special, since the other hosts only appeared briefly.)

{"date": "Tuesday, April 10, 2007", "body": "\nWe are currently in the midst of a bit of a blogging hiatus due to illness - Bud's and mine. I had called in sick to work yesterday to stay home and sleep away a head cold, but about an hour into my slumber I got a call from Bud's school reporting that he had delivered a bold display of sickness on the floor of the classroom. The display continued all day long, as Bud was unable to hold down even a sip of water. By late afternoon I started to get concerned about dehydration (which he'd experienced once before as a toddler and which I hope we never encounter again), so Nana and I packed him up and made the 45-minute journey to the doctor's office. Bud was sick in the car on the way, so we spent the trip issuing soothing reassurances about the outcome of the doctor's evaluation -  \"the doctor will help you feel better,\" \"the doctor will see if you need medicine,\" \"the doctor will take care of your tummy.\" The doctor checked him out and was not concerned about dehydration yet, so we were able to forego the IV drips and anti-nausea suppositories I'd been imagining, and we headed home with only a plan for droppers full of Gatorade at 10 minute intervals. We piled back into the car and were about five minutes into the return trip when Bud's sickness returned. As he hung over the bucket Nana held in front of him, his ears must have been ringing with the empty promises we'd made about the restorative power of a doctor's visit, because when the wave of sickness passed, Bud lifted his heavy head and from behind sunken eyes and sallow skin he said sadly, \"It didn't work.\" The good news is that after a mostly-sleepless night and many, many droppers full of Gatorade, we both seem in better shape today. We're still cocooned on adjacent couches, but Bud has graduated to toast and bananas and seems to be holding his own... as it were. If things continue to progress this way, we should return to our regularly scheduled blog-reading and comment-posting in no time. Be well, blogosphere friends.

I have to admit that I went in with low expectations, having read criticism of the show in the blogosphere and elsewhere on the Internet.  I expected the show to be alarmist and overwhelmingly negative, but I was pleasantly surprised.  There was negativity - a lot of it.  But there was also a lot of love, a lot of footage of autistic children who were not in the throes of difficult moments - children who were smiling and kissing their parents.  The parents interviewed talked about their challenges, their exhaustion, the failure of a marriage, the sacrifices they've made, the stress on their neurotypical children - but they also talked about how much they love their autistic children, how much their children have brought to their lives, and how much richer their lives are because of them. Of course, there are things I would have liked to see:  An interview with an autistic adult, for one.  Any mention of  RDI  or other promising educational practices or intervention strategies that went beyond \"the importance of early intervention,\" for another.  It struck me that most of the parents interviewed seemed to have similar backgrounds:  children who were developing normally until sometime after they turned 2, at which point they lost their previously acquired abilities; pediatricians who brushed off parental concerns and failed to diagnose the autism until much later.  Neither of those things were true for us - but are these experiences more common than mine?  And if not, then why was such a small cross-section of parents selected for the panel? So, those are my thoughts:  it was not ideal, but all things considered, it exceeded my expectations.

{"date": "Thursday, April 12, 2007", "body": "\nBud got the game Candy Land for Easter. He's never been a board game kid, but the time seemed right to try again and the game seemed manageable, so we broke it open on Sunday night. I explained the game to Bud - the premise, the rules, the goal - then we chose our playing pieces and we started to play. And then I became The Candy Land Czar. Bud drew color-coded cards and skipped his playing piece hither and yon around the board with nary a care about reaching the end as I barked out orders, re-directed him to move his playing piece to the \"right\" spot, and effectively stripped the game of any hint of joyful play. The game ended with Bud winning, but I don't think he cared. In fact, I think he was probably relieved to have it behind him. As we packed the game back into the box I silently scolded myself. What had my goal been? Was I using the game as an opportunity to teach Bud the importance of following directions, taking turns, and paying attention? Or was I trying to have fun with him? The truth is, I was probably trying to do both - but while I may have had a modicum of success with the first goal, I think I failed miserably with the second. I vowed to do it differently next time - if I could ever get Bud to play with me again. On Wednesday night, Bud agreed to give it another try. This time, I eased back on trying to micromanage his playing and, in response, he stepped up to meet the demands of the game. I taught him how to follow the cards to move forward to meet the established goal. He taught me that choosing a picture card that zips you back to the beginning is not a bad thing, because  Look! Ice cream!  , and that losing a turn on a Licorice Space is not really a penalty, but a treat - because, after all, it gives you twice as much time to enjoy the Twizzlers. He laughed with me when I accidentally moved  his  playing piece instead of my own, causing us both to lose track of our places on the board so badly that we had to go back several turns and start again. I indulged him in a jaunt off the Candy Land path to take a leisurely stroll through the Peppermint Forest. Wednesday night's game took a lot longer than Sunday night's game. It was much less efficient. It was entirely nontraditional. It was a lot more fun. And - what do you know - we still made it to the end. We still reached our goal.

{"date": "Monday, March 12, 2007", "body": "\nI've had a book on my mind all week. It's not Portia Iversen's  Strange Son , although  my post about that  is what sparked my thinking about this book.  This comment  and  this comment  made me think about it even more. The book is  Everybody Needs a Rock , a children's book by Byrd Baylor. Here are some excerpts: \"Everybody needs a rock. I'm sorry for kids who don't have a rock for a friend.\"  \"Not just any rock. I mean a special rock that you find yourself and keep as long as you can - maybe forever.\"  \"If somebody says, 'What's so special about that rock?' don't even tell them. I don't. Nobody is supposed to know what's special about another person's rock.\"   In two scenes toward the end of  Strange Son , Portia Iversen talks about the rock that her son Dov carries with him. In both scenes, Dov loses his rock and becomes visibly upset and  dysregulated . Dov needs his \"special rock;\" it grounds him. It is his own, very literal, touchstone. I've been thinking about Dov and his special rock for the past couple of weeks because I've noticed that Bud has recently had a tight grip on a metaphoric  touchstone  of his own: the Teletubbies. Bud has been a fan of the Teletubbies since he was a year old. We don't know why the Tubbies are so special to Bud; we only know that they are. In his early years, Bud was consumed with the Tubbies. His earliest language and his earliest echolalic scripts drew heavily from Tubby-style baby talk. The rest of us had a love/hate relationship with the Tubs - or \"the guys,\" as Bud calls them. We hated their slow-paced repetitive sequences, their infantile words, the banality of their plot lines; we loved how happy they made Bud. In recent years, Bud's passion for the Teletubbies has come in waves, with each wave seeming to lessen in intensity as the Tubby tide appeared to be going out. In recent months, especially, Bud's interest in other shows and  other characters  has continued to grow, and while he still played with Tubby characters, the books and the movies sat untouched as Bud seemed to be moving on. In the past couple of weeks, though, the Tubbies have made a comeback, and life is once again All Tubbies, All the Time. The Tubby movies are in high rotation, the Tubby toys are the only ones getting attention, the Tubby books are strewn throughout the house. I found myself feeling discouraged by their reemergence, and regarding it as a setback. I started wondering if Bud's peers would start to tease him - this seven-year-old who likes baby things. I started to bristle when I saw Bud engage in Tubby-play. Then I read  this post on AutismVox , in which Kristina draws a parallel between the Tubbies and the  other  \"Fab Four\" from England: The Beatles. And that helped me  regain some perspective . What I remembered is this: The Beatles in general, and Paul McCartney specifically, have played the same role in my life for the past thirtyish years that the Tubbies have played in Bud's for the past six. They have grounded me. They've been my rock. The Beatles didn't  really  make my first car run smoothly. But as I drove away from the dealership having made the first significant purchase of my adult life, I flipped on the radio and heard the opening strains of \"Drive My Car,\" and I was certain that it was a sign that I had purchased well. Perhaps Paul McCartney didn't  intend  to write a song that would make me feel close to  my children . But when I listen to his album  Flaming Pie , and I hear him sing  \"It was written that I would love you from the moment I opened my eyes...I'll hold you for the rest of my life,\"  I am certain that he did. And I know that The Beatles didn't  really  get me out any faster when my car was stuck in a snowbank last week. They didn't keep Bud and me from being an hour late to school and work. But, even so, as we sat waiting for rescue with the engine running and listened to the radio play  \"Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round,\"  I felt strangely reassured. My connection to the Beatles hasn't kept me from branching out. I listen to lots of different music. I have a wide range of interests. But despite that, the Beatles always lurk on the periphery of my life, and now and then - especially in the midst of challenge - they take center stage. I imagine, though I wouldn't ask (because  \"nobody is supposed to know what's special about another person's rock\" ), that the Tubbies provide the same sort of comfort, shelter, and sense of home for Bud. In that context, I can see clearly why the Tubbies came back in full force during what probably felt to Bud like an extended period of upside-down: a week of too-sick-to-go-to-school, followed by a week of school vacation, followed by a week of  Nana-and-Papa -are-on-vacation-and-every-day-is-a-little-bit-different-from-the-last. Though Bud has been revisiting the passion he's had since he was a baby, he is not reliving his infancy. He is approaching the Tubbies as a seven-year-old: working with me to add his Tubby books to his  Library Thing  account, reading their stories out loud to me, inviting me to help him create elaborate Tubbylands on the kitchen table, playing Director as he makes his characters act out the scenes on the videos he's watching, filling pages with gorgeous abstract art in purple, green, yellow, and red. He's not talking like a baby. He's not \"retreating into his own world.\"  He's not regressing. He's grounding himself. And we all do that in some way, don't we? Sometimes the things that ground us are actually made of stone. Sometimes they're fuzzy and they play movies in their bellies. And sometimes they just sing silly love songs. But everybody needs a rock.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Everybody-Needs-Rock-Aladdin-Book/dp/0689710518/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-2336735-9887902?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1173747115&sr=8-1", "http://www.autismvox.com/here-come-the-flab-four/", "http://www.librarything.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/03/everybody-needs-rock.html", "title": "\nEverybody needs a rock\n"},

I don't typically spend much time with developmental checklists. In fact, I pretty much stopped looking at them when Bud was an infant - he was already doing his own thing in his own way, and I discovered that even a cursory glance through  What to Expect the First Year  made my blood pressure start to climb. But today I threw caution to the wind and took a look at what the fine folks at the CDC had to offer. They write (italics and embedded links my own): Middle childhood brings many changes to a child\u2019s life.   (True enough.)   By this time, children can dress themselves   (Pretty much, except for the snapping and buttoning, but I\u2019ll call that a check) ,  catch a ball more easily with only their hands   (More easily \u2013 yes, sure. Check.),   and tie their shoes   (Nope - but, in fairness to Bud, we usually go with Velcro.).   Developing independence from family becomes more important now   ( Check ).   Events such as starting school bring children this age into regular contact with the larger world.  Friendships  become more and more important. Physical, social, and  mental skills  develop rapidly at this time. This is a critical time for children to develop confidence in all areas of life, such as through friends, schoolwork, and  sports .   (Check, check, check.) I have to say: for a child with developmental delays, Bud seems to be startlingly on target. His quest for independence is especially striking. And for Bud, it\u2019s not just about  doing things without assistance . It\u2019s also about doing things on his own \u2013 about striking out as a free agent \u2013 about establishing himself as an individual person, unique and separate from his parents. Last Friday was \u201cWacky Hair Day\u201d at Bud\u2019s school. It was Wacky Hair Day, that is, for the  other  children at Bud\u2019s school. Bud made his needs quite clear in the days leading up to the event: For Bud, Friday would be  Brown  Hair Day. Dark  Brown Hair Day. Regular  Dark Brown Hair Day. At the end of Wacky Or Regular Dark Brown Hair Day, Bud\u2019s class was scheduled to gather for a rousing rendition of the Chicken Dance. When I dropped Bud off in the morning, Ms. Parker invited me to join them for the Chicken Dancing. She said she\u2019d watch out the window for me and would open the back door when they were ready to begin. I arrived on time, fifteen minutes before the end of the school day, but the back door to the classroom remained closed. I sat in my car and waited as the minutes ticked by and, eventually, dismissal time arrived. Ms. Parker emerged with Bud, and explained that he\u2019d decided  not  to have me join them for the Chicken Dance. Bud himself offered no explanation, but hugged me when he saw me, then happily climbed into the car. I didn\u2019t bring it up again with him, but on Sunday, privately, at home, when the two of us were on our own, Bud invited me to do the Chicken Dance with him. We stood together in front of the full-sized bathroom mirror, clucking with our chicken-beak hands, flapping our chicken-wing arms, shaking our tails feathers down to the floor, and laughing, laughing, laughing. Bud didn\u2019t talk about it directly, but I understood his meaning:  \u201cIt\u2019s not you, Mom; it\u2019s me. I love you, Mom. I have fun with you. But there are some things I need to do on my own.\u201d It was good preparation for me, actually, because it eased me into the conversation that Bud and I had this week when he came home with a flyer about an upcoming first-grade field trip to see a children\u2019s play.  Parents are welcome , the flyer said,  but get your tickets soon! I read the flyer out loud to Bud and asked if he\u2019d like to have me come along on the field trip. \u201cJust me and the other kids,\u201d he answered quickly. \u201cAnd Ms. Parker.\u201d \u201cSome of the other moms and dads will be there, Bud.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d \u201cSo maybe I could come, too?\u201d \u201cNo. You can wait in the car. At school. You can wait and pick me up when it\u2019s over. Okay?\u201d \"Okay, Bud.\" And it  is  okay, Bud. You\u2019re growing up. You\u2019re stepping out. You\u2019re moving on. It\u2019s hard for me. But it\u2019s good. It\u2019s  really  good. And we hold  that  truth to be self-evident. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/child/middlechildhood.htm"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/03/declarations-of-independence.html", "title": "\nDeclarations of independence\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 19, 2007", "body": "\nWe got the written report from Bud's day-long assessment at the  developmental clinic . Honestly, I have no right to be disappointed. They didn't promise anything more than they delivered and, in fact, they tried to warn me about the limitations of their assessment. But I heard \"interdisciplinary,\" and I made assumptions: I assumed that each specialist would gather information in his or her own area of expertise, and I thought they'd drop it all together into a pot and look for what bubbled up, watching closely for the subtleties in the aromas, for the ways that the flavors mixed together, and then try to capture in words the unique delicacy that emerged. My assumptions were only half right. Each specialist gathered information from his or her own area of expertise. Then they put each bit of information in a tidy little pile on a plate, spacing the piles out so that the flavors complemented each other but never really mingled together. And then they wrote a report that described each item on the plate, clearly and accurately, in black-and-white terms. It's the black-and-white that I find most disheartening, I think. I'm not typically a fan of black-and-white. I prefer greys - and even then, I want to know more about them:  are they more charcoal, or more slate? Are they a smokey grey, or more opaque?  But there are few greys in this report. Instead, the report is a series of results from  standardized assessment tools . It lists scores and averages and percentiles and standard deviations that, ultimately, have no real-life meaning or relevance to me. The end result is a stack of pages that reflect the testing process, but that do not seem to reflect much of my son. In fact, I find myself getting defensive as I read the lists of percentiles. Part of it, I know, is simply the reaction of a mom who refuses to acknowledge that her son is anything less than \"best\"  (\"What do you  mean  my son won't be the starting pitcher for every little league game this season?\")  Beyond that, though, I take issue with the assumption that these tests are useful as a measure of Bud's ability, of Bud's performance, of Bud's intelligence. Without question, these scores and percentiles are an accurate measure of Bud's ability  to take these tests . But I would submit that these tests are not designed with Bud's unique ability in mind. I was talking about it recently to a friend, who asked, \"But didn't they use versions of the tests that weren't language-based? Didn't they assess nonverbal intelligence?\" Yes, yes. Of course they did. But they assessed nonverbal  neurotypical  intelligence. It seems to me that the only thing they confirm is that Bud is not neurotypical. They confirm that he's autistic. And we already knew that. My hunch is that if we  really  want to assess how Bud thinks - how well and how differently he thinks - then we have to cast aside our preconceived ideas about the ways we measure intelligence. We need to do more than try to measure the same things in different ways. We need to determine how to measure  different things entirely . We need to start working in a whole new paradigm. Interestingly enough, it was a Gray who started me thinking about paradigms. I recently attended a presentation by  Carol Gray , the originator of  Social Stories (TM) , in which she talked about the idea of paradigm shifts. She quoted Joel Barker from  The Business of Discovering the Future : a \"paradigm is a set of rules and regulations (written or unwritten) that does two things: 1) it establishes or defines boundaries; and 2) it tells you how to behave inside the boundaries in order to be successful.\" Gray contends that if you're not operating within the correct paradigm, then it doesn't matter how hard or how efficiently you're working.  Even the best made, most detailed map of New York City , she says,  won't help you find your way around Chicago. And that's just how I feel about much of the testing that was part of Bud's evaluation. It tested his ability to navigate a city he'd never visited. It neglected to ask him questions about his own hometown. And, in retrospect, I can see that they told me that this might be coming. They cautioned that I might be disappointed. They told it to me in black-and-white. But I was listening in grey.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thegraycenter.org/", "http://www.thegraycenter.org/socialstories.cfm"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/03/black-and-white-is-not-my-favorite.html", "title": "\nBlack-and-white is not my favorite color\n"},

Okay, so maybe not  coveted , as it is actually just a meme posing as an award.  It's almost embarrassing that it means so much to me, but there you have it. As a designated Thinking Blogger,  I am charged  with the task of linking to five other bloggers who make me think. This is not as easy as it sounds; I read a lot of bloggers who make me think. Many of them currently have links on the main page of my blog. Here are five who don't: 1. Gretchen from  gretchen's blog : I read a lot of blogs written by parents of children on the autism spectrum. Many of their children have shadows of similarity to Bud, but Gretchen's Henry consistently reminds me of him. Bud and Henry seem to be following a similar developmental path, and Henry is the one child I find myself comparing to Bud. Posts like  this  make me think for days. 2. Liesel Elliott from  Dante's Inferno With Children : I love that Liesel writes with a  real  pseudonym and not a  blogger  pseudonym like RockinMamaBabe or, you know, mom-nos. I love the photography; I love the posts that read like fiction but probably aren't; I love the soul-searching posts about her childhood; and I love  this one  - which is really just a post about the nature of thinking itself. 3.  Her Bad Mother : Somehow, linking to a blog that regularly gets 80 comments per post and on which I faithfully lurk but never surface feels a little like asking George Clooney to the prom, but, honestly,  this piece  about posting pictures of our kids has had me thinking for a week. It hasn't changed my own posting decisions, but I really value her perspective. 4. Vicki Forman from  Speak Softly... : This is another blog on which I am a committed lurker. Many of her posts, both here and at  Literary Mama , have made me think, but  this piece  absolutely blows me away. 5. Zilari from  Processing in Parts : Through  Autism Hub  I've been introduced to number of great bloggers who are autistic. Zilari is one of them. Her posts are introspective and thoughtful, and she investigates issues in depth. Posts like  this one  not only make me think, but also make me a better parent.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ePQukxV_PvU/Rd-zJJyXcLI/AAAAAAAAANA/7uxzM1v3q8w/s1600-h/thinkingblogger.jpg", "http://imdb.com/title/tt0085334/quotes", "http://bubandpie.blogspot.com/2007/02/thinking-bloggers.html", "http://ilkeryoldas.blogspot.com/2007/02/thinking-blogger-awards_11.html", "http://ilkeryoldas.blogspot.com/2007/02/thinking-blogger-awards_11.html", "http://gretsblog.blogspot.com/index.html", "http://gretsblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/different-ness.html", "http://blog.dantesinfernowithchildren.com/", "http://blog.dantesinfernowithchildren.com/2007/02/follow_that_tra.html", "http://badladies.blogspot.com/index.html", "http://badladies.blogspot.com/2007/02/exposed.html", "http://www.vickiforman.com/", "http://www.literarymama.com/columns/specialneedsmama/archives/2006/12/the_mother_at_t.html", "http://www.vickiforman.com/?page_id=616", "http://partprocessing.blogspot.com/index.html", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://partprocessing.blogspot.com/2007/02/speech-histories-and-misconceptions.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/02/linkin-linkin-ive-been-thinkin.html", "title": "\nLinkin', linkin', I've been thinkin'\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2007", "body": "\nYesterday was Brain Day on the blogs for me, as I read  this post from Andrea at A Garden of Nna Mmoy  followed by  this post from Kristina at AutismVox , which both dealt with neurology and brain function. If you're a regular reader here, you may already know that Kristina is mom to almost-ten-year-old Charlie, who is autistic. Andrea is not an autism blogger, but - for me - her post had as much to do with autism as Kristina's. I don't think I can summarize either Kristina's writing or Andrea's and do them justice, so please hop on over and read them. Go ahead. I'll wait. Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause. You're back? You read them? See what I mean? When read back-to-back, the two posts raise all kinds of questions for me about the nature of \"mindlessness\" and the nature of \"mindfulness.\"  Are they the same thing viewed through  different filters ? Or are they different things entirely? And what are their relative values? And by whose standards are those values determined? I left a fairly lengthy comment on Andrea's post, but as she is not an autism blogger she said she felt ill-equipped to respond to it. I'd love to hear what anyone else thinks about any of these issues. My comment, in case you didn't scroll down that far when you were reading: This is a fascinating post for me on a number of levels, but primarily because my son has autism and language is a challenge for him. I wonder about his \"internal monologue\" - is it as constant as mine? Is it language-driven, as mine is, or is it altogether different? Is his internal monologue more experience-based, more driven by emotion, color, sound? (It seems to me that he is much more attuned to those things and experiences them more acutely than me, at any rate.) So, then, I wonder - to what extent is Bud experiencing - really, genuinely EXPERIENCING - more than I am, with all my words spilling over and diluting the experience itself? And then... what does that say about the way we look at and define \"disability\"? You  wrote :  \"I have, once or twice, used the opportunity of a long meeting in which I had nothing to contribute or a presentation to enter a mini trance, and then had a question directed at me--and the difficulty of understanding, first of all, that the sounds had meanings, and I was expected to do something with them; and then determining what those meanings were, and what meanings I should be directing back, and how; and the sensation of those words coming from a long way away, as if I were unconnected to them, and the sounds coming out of my mouth were unconnected to me, was odd, though not unpleasant ... Even the feeling of speaking is different, as if one's mouth and tongue and throat are thick. Speaking is effort.\" And I wonder: Is this what my son experiences every day? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.athenadreaming.org/Beanie/archives/2007/03/the_words_get_i.html", "http://www.autismvox.com/the-wandering-mind/", "http://www.athenadreaming.org/Beanie/archives/2007/03/the_words_get_i.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/03/brainy-days-and-grey-matters.html", "title": "\nBrainy days and grey matters\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 02, 2007", "body": "\nIf you've been watching my sidebar, then you know that I've been reading Portia Iversen's  Strange Son: Two Mothers, Two Sons, and the Quest to Unlock the Hidden World of Autism  for weeks. My husband says that my slow progress through the book tells him all he needs to know about what I think of it. But it's just not that simple. Last week, as I was reading, I did a lot of thinking about thinking, and especially about  what and who makes me think . I realized that I'm usually drawn to like-minded writers - to those who make me think  more  about things I already think. But I also recognize that sometimes my best learning - by best thinking - comes as a result of reading things written by people who  think very differently  from me. Sometimes those different-thinking writers help me appreciate perspectives I'd not considered before, and alter my own perspective; sometimes they make me better able to articulate why I'll continue to think what I've been thinking all along. That's the spirit with which I tried to approach  Strange Son , because it became clear to me almost from the outset of the book that Iversen and I differ in our approaches to parenting a child with autism. As I read, I reminded myself that our boys are very different from each other: Iversen's son Dov is almost entirely nonverbal, and for many years Iversen felt unable to reach him. I reminded myself that Iversen's life, experiences, and parenting journey were undoubtedly different from mine, and that I could not possibly know for certain what I would have done - what my choices would have been - what approaches I might have tried - had Bud been less like Bud and more like Dov. I could not possibly know. And yet, I could  think . And what I  think  is this: I think that no matter who Bud had been when I met him - whether he'd been nonverbal or deaf, whether he'd had seizures or been hyperactive, whether had he been unresponsive or typically developing - no matter who he'd been, I think that at any point at which I felt like I couldn't understand him - at any point at which his behavior seemed frightening - at any point at which I felt out of my element - my first instinct would have been to spend more time trying to engage with him, trying to understand him, and trying to let him know I was there - for him, and with him. Unlike Dov, Bud is verbal and visibly engaged with the world, but I  think  - I  believe , though I can't  know  - that if he wasn't, I would have had the same philosophy. If Bud spent his days staring past me, not responding, watching dust mites in a sunbeam, I believe that - for a while, anyway - you'd find me sitting next to him, feeling the warmth he felt, watching the patterns he saw, and thinking:  how can we use this? what can we do next? what can we do here together? Iversen took a different approach, and in the first half of  Strange Son  she outlines the journey she took in the years immediately following Dov's diagnosis, as she invested herself fully into learning about the science of autism - the biology, the neurology, the genetics - and into raising money and recruiting researchers. Together with her husband she founded the Cure Autism Now foundation, sponsoring research, fundraising efforts, and national conferences. With the financial support of CAN, she brought Tito Mukhopadhyay, a young man \"nonverbal and severely affected by autism\" and his mother Soma to the United States from their home in India. Under Soma's direction, and despite his \"rocking and flapping and staring ahead as if he (didn't hear) at all,\" (p. 49) Tito learned to communicate by pointing to letters on an alphabet board, revealing his IQ of 185 and his talent for writing poetry. Iversen lobbied researchers and scientists in the U.S. to raise awareness of Tito and Soma, and to promote research that might make this kind of communication possible for other people with autism. Iversen's efforts were exhaustive, focused, and intense. She devoted every bit of her time and energy to her work with autism - to the work she did on Dov's behalf. But throughout most of  Strange Son , it remained unclear to me how much of the work she did was actually  with  Dov. Dov remained a stranger to me for most of the beginning chapters of the book. Iversen's love for him is palpable; but, so too is her sadness, frustration, and fear. As I read, I got an increasing sense that, despite the long hours and hard work she put into studying, lobbying, and networking around autism, she regarded spending time with Dov just too difficult a task. In the second half of  Strange Son , Dov became a larger presence, as Iversen recounted Soma Mukhopadhyay's work with him, teaching him to use an alphabet board the same way she'd taught Tito. In a short time under Soma's tutelage, Dov was using the board and Iversen discovered through Dov's own words that he had been able to read for years, that he understood everything he heard, that he'd been paying attention to news reports on NPR, and that he was a smart, engaged boy. I would have imagined that this would read like a moment of triumph - this unveiling of the \"real\" Dov - this moment in which mother and son could finally connect. And yet, it was one of the most heartbreaking moments in the book, as Iversen realized that her nine-year-old was a stranger to her. She writes,  \"After all these years, I had a thousand questions to ask him and a million things I wanted to tell him. And yet, I couldn't think of what to say. 'I love you,' I blurted out. My words hung strangely hollow in the interior of the car.\"  (p. 291) I imagined that the rest of the book would lead to a denouement of lessons learned: the importance of recognizing your child's own unique talents and gifts, the need to savor every moment that you have with your child, the importance of connection. But the lessons never came, and Iversen remained a stranger to me. As a result, the more I read, the less inclined I was to keep reading. The science that Iversen presented was thought-provoking. Her description of scientific studies about the arousal states of children with autism was fascinating. Tito and Soma's story was interesting. But it was Dov whom I longed to know. So I kept reading - until, toward the end of the book, Iversen described a presentation by Dov at a CAN annual scientific meeting. He was scheduled to appear with Soma in front of a room full of people to give a demonstration of how he used the alphabet board to communicate. When the presentation began, Dov seemed anxious and tense and pointed out the word \"rock.\" Soma pushed him to name three types of rocks, and his anxiety and anger grew as he growled, pinched, and head-butted Soma, but ultimately typed the words  igneous ,  sedimentary , and  metamorphic . It was an extraordinary achievement, especially given the conditions under which Dov was asked to perform. And yet, Iversen describes her reaction this way: \"I was relieved when it was over and Soma and Dov joined Erika and Tito and they left the room. I rationalized to myself that at least this was a demonstration of how even such an out-of-control, behavioral wreck of a person could still be intelligent.\"  (p. 352) An \"out-of-control, behavioral wreck of a person.\" Her son. I put the book down, and thought perhaps I was done with it. A few days later, I returned to it. Perhaps, I thought, the next page would reveal her regret, her learning, and her determination to do better next time. Instead, I read this: \"The room was emptying out for the morning break when Gino came over to me. 'I found this under the camera tripod,' he said, handing me a rock. 'I think Dov dropped it on his way up to the stage.' I turned the rock over in my hands. It was Dov's rock, the one he had been carrying around for days, a security blanket of sorts. ... I now realize that Dov spelled 'rock' because he had lost his rock on the way to the stage. He wanted his rock; he  needed  his rock. But when Dov spelled 'rock,' Soma pushed him, until he spelled out what she wanted him to.\"  (p.352-353) I was relieved that Iversen gained this insight - that she recognized Dov's need for  local coherence , and understood the loss of local coherence that came with the loss of his rock. I was certain that this knowledge would make her realize that Dov's  dysregulation  in the demonstration was an understandable reaction to that loss, and did not make him a \"behavioral wreck of a person.\" I scanned the pages ahead, looking for the conversation in which Iversen apologized to Dov for failing to pay attention, for not working harder to understand what he was trying to say, for pushing him to perform in the midst of overwhelming and unreasonable conditions, and for blaming him for his reaction to them. I hope that the conversation happened in real life. It didn't happen in the book. At least, I don't think it did. I'm about 25 pages away from the end of  Strange Son , but I've finished reading it. It may be that Dov's story is not really the story that Iversen intended to tell with this book; unfortunately, it was the story I wanted to read. Though the book's subtitle calls it the story of \"two mothers and two sons,\" at its most basic level,  Strange Son  is a book about one woman's take on autism - one woman who knows a lot about the science of autism. I learned a great deal of information through her writing, and she made me ponder issues I'd never considered before. But, really, I am not particularly drawn to books about the science of autism. I am drawn to parenting memoirs; and, to my mind anyway, at its most basic level,  Strange Son  is not a parenting memoir. And so, I've stopped reading just a few chapters from the end of the book. I realize that there may be great insight in these final chapters. There may be a glorious \"a-ha\" moment ahead. But that will be for another reader to find out. I'm off to spend time with my son. 3/2/07, 6:00 p.m. Addendum to Original Post: In the interest of full disclosure and in response to some commenters who seem to have interpreted this post as an unprovoked attack on Portia Iversen's parenting, I'd like to add this: I received a complimentary copy of  Strange Son  from Iversen's publicist for my review. I knew when I accepted the book that I would need to post my reaction to it, no matter what that reaction was. I'm certain that both Iversen and her publicist would insist on getting an honest review. Anything less would compromise the integrity of us all. This post is intended to be a review of  Strange Son , and not a commentary on Portia Iversen or her parenting. And among the positive reactions that I had to the book (Iversen presents compelling information about the science and research of autism; Iversen writes with great intellect; Iversen's account of her tireless efforts in promoting autism research is impressive), were less positive reactions (I found some of her language when writing about Dov jarring; though the book promotes itself as the story of \"two mothers, two sons,\" Dov struck me as a supporting player with a minor role for large segments of the book; I would have found the book more engaging if she had written more about her parenting and delved more into her life with Dov.) I've tried to capture all of that in the post above.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1573223115/104-2336735-9887902?SubscriptionId=0EMV44A9A5YT1RVDGZ82"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/03/more-reading-and-thinking-strange-son.html", "title": "\nMore reading and thinking: Strange Son\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 04, 2007", "body": "\nPicabo Street. Alberto Tomba. Bode Miller. Bud. Artists of alpine. Masters of the mogul. Superstars on the slopes. Bud had his very first lesson today through an adaptive ski program for people with disabilities. I hadn't prepared him very much - we'd talked about it, of course, but I'm not a skier, so I couldn't give him the step-by-step of what he could expect. Luckily, Bud didn't need the preparation; he was a natural. We were greeted by the two instructors who would be working with Bud for the day. They helped him get fitted for boots, helmet and skis, then we headed to the bunny slope. Bud was comfortable on his skis from the start, and after just a few minutes of sliding on the level ground at the bottom of the slope one of the instructors asked my husband and me if we'd like to take a break. I took his point right away - Bud would be better able to pay attention to their instruction if he wasn't so focused on us. I told Bud that his dad and I were going to find the bathroom and that we'd be back in a little while. To my surprise, Bud was fine with our departure and as we walked away from the slope, he turned back to his instructors to get his lesson underway. We wandered over to the lodge for coffee, and after about 30 minutes we decided to sneak back to get a view of him, just to make sure that he hadn't gotten worried because we'd been gone so long. As we walked back to the children's area, we saw another staff member from the adaptive ski program walking toward us. \"Are you headed back there?\" he asked. I immediately pictured Bud in tears, inconsolable, believing he'd been abandoned. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Good,\" he said. \"They asked me to come find you so you could see him in action. They said he's doing a great job. Try to stay where he can't see you, okay?\" \"Okay,\" we answered, resisting the urge to break into a run. We got back to the children's area and slipped into a warming hut with a wide window. They were right: Bud was doing a great job. He was riding a little lift to the top of the slope, then gliding gracefully to the bottom. His instructors struck just the right balance of staying close enough to make him feel safe and far enough away to make him feel independent. Each time they ascended the slope they took him a little further up. As he descended, he held out his arms and bobbed his head from side-to-side. Though I was too far away to see his face or hear his voice, I could read his body language clearly:  Look at me,  he said.  I'm flying! About 90 minutes into his two-hour lesson, his instructors stopped to consult with each other (to determine, I found out later, whether or not to move over to a larger hill.) I watched Bud as the instructors chatted. He faced away from the slope, and his face scanned the group of strangers collected at the bottom of the hill. \"He's looking for us,\" I said to my husband. \"I think he's starting to worry.\" As if on cue, his instructors turned their attention back to him, and after a brief interaction the three of them headed toward us. We exited the warming hut and joined them. The instructors had picked up on the same change in Bud's demeanor as I had, and they responded right away. We were scheduled for an afternoon session as well, and they thought that Bud would be ready for a larger incline once he'd had a break. We asked Bud if he'd like to ski again after lunch, and he said that he was tired and ready to go home. We decided not to push it and to end on a positive note, so we all headed back to the office to return Bud's gear and cancel the afternoon session. As I got Bud unbundled and ready to go, my husband chatted with one of the instructors. Bud had done incredibly well, the instructor said. He'd made more progress than most kids do in their first lesson. \"He's going to be a great skier,\" he said. We stopped at the lodge for an apr\u00e8s-ski chocolate chip cookie, which Bud munched as we headed back to the car. \"Bud,\" I asked, \"Was it a hard day or an easy day?\" \"An easy day,\" he said. \"What was your favorite part?\" \"The skiing.\" \"Do you want to come back another day and ski again?\" \"Yes.\" Yes. Without question: A gold medal day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/03/snow-wonder.html", "title": "\nSnow wonder\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 18, 2007", "body": "\nOh, what a book. What a gorgeous, gorgeous book. I just finished reading  Rules  by Cynthia Lord, which is a book geared for children in Grades 4 - 7. In other words, it's ostensibly too old for Bud and too young for me. But we both love it, albeit for different reasons. Bud loves the book itself. I bought it a couple of weeks ago and added it to the stack of books-to-be-read that clutter my bedroom. Bud found it there and adopted it. He carted it around with him from room to room. He tucked it into his bag when we left the house. He browsed through it while he ate his breakfast. He seemed captivated first by the cover art: I think it spoke to his  artistic sensibilities . Beyond that, I think he enjoyed the book's heft. The book is lightweight and manageable, but its hard cover and lack of illustrations may have made it feel Important and Grown Up to him. And he seemed particularly delighted to find that when he opened to the first page of this Important and Grown Up Book, he could actually read the words: \"RULES FOR DAVID: Chew with your mouth closed... If someone says \"hi,\" you say \"hi\" back... No toys in the fish tank.\" What Bud didn't know, of course, was that he was reading a list of rules composed by the book's narrator, twelve-year-old Catherine, to help her eight-year-old brother David navigate the world. David loves rules, Catherine tells us. David has autism. David is, in fact, quite a lot like Bud, which made me fall in love with him almost instantly. But  Rules  is not really David's story; it's Catherine's. And it's beautiful. I won't say too much, because I don't want to spoil it for you. The story passes too quickly as it is - I started the book yesterday, and sped through until there were no more words to read. So I won't ruin it by giving you summaries and synopses and overviews. I'll just say this:  Rules  is a book about being a parent, being a child, being a sibling, and being a friend. It's about ability and disability and about how we all manage through life with a healthy dose of both. It's about growing up and growing wise and making mistakes and making things right again. It's about integrity and respect and understanding and love. And it is, very deservedly, a  2007 Newbery Honor Book . Two things before I end this post.

I wasn't sure how to ease into the conversation, so I just plunged right in when Carla's mom answered the phone. I introduced myself and thanked her for inviting Bud to the party. I asked if she knew Bud, and she said she did. \"And,\" I said, not sure how to proceed, \"Do you know that he's autistic?\" \"Yes, I do,\" she answered. \"I mean, I don't know what his autism  means  for him exactly, but... Carla really wanted... well, she invited everyone in the class, and she... I  do  know about his autism, and you're a much better judge of whether or not... but I think that Carla and Bud have made a really nice connection, so...\" I began to realize that she wasn't sure why I called, and that maybe \"do you know that he's autistic?\" might have come out sounding like \"why in the world did you invite him to a  party , you insensitive clod?\" \"No, no...\" I stammered. \"I think Carla and Bud really  do  have a great connection. He's  very  fond of her and he's delighted to be invited to the party... I just... uh...\" I could hear her voice relax on the other end of the phone. \"Well, as I said I'm not sure what Bud's autism means for him exactly. Carla says that sometimes noises bother him?\" \"That's true. Some noises. Sometimes.\" \"It could be loud. We're going to have a Hawaiian-themed party and we're going to learn the hula - Carla's idea - so we'll have music, and there will be lots of kids, but it's only the kids from class, so he'll know everyone. And we'll have pizza and cake and games. I don't know how that would be for him, but if there's anything we could do to make it easier...\" \"Well, he's usually pretty good about knowing his limits. I explained the party to him - that it would be at Carla's house, that lots of kids would be there, that it would be noisy - and he didn't hesitate. He really wants to go.\" \"That's great!\" \"Do you think... Would it be okay if I stayed there with him?\" \"Oh, of COURSE! I was going to suggest that. That would be great!\" \"Then you can definitely count us in,\" I said, finally exhaling as I wrapped up the conversation. \"Bud is really looking forward to it.\" That's the truth.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 24, 2007", "body": "\nAll the way to school this morning, Bud sat in the back seat of the car and read the book  Arthur's Birthday . To be honest, he may not actually have been  reading  it, since he memorized the book a long time ago and would not even need to look at the pages to be able to recite it verbatim. Either way, he was engrossed in the book for the whole ride. When we got to school, he left the book in the car but continued to  script  passages of it as we walked together toward the school building. As I often do, I tried to engage with his script to pull him out of his echolalic track and into more spontaneous speech as he made the transition to his school day. \"Three dollar bills fell out!\" he said. \"That's right,\" I said. \"Arthur got three dollars from his Uncle Bud.\" A little lightbulb clicked on in my head, and I said, \"Hey, I just thought of something. What name do I call  you  sometimes?\" \"What?\" he said. \"What name do I call you sometimes?\" \"Mom.\" (Darn those pesky pronouns.) \" You  call  me  'Mom'. Do you remember the name I call you when I write about you on the computer?\" Bud knows about my blog, though he doesn't really understand what it is. He enjoys looking at it to see pictures of his toys, his writing, and his drawings, and likes scanning the text for his favorite words: \"Teletubbies,\" \"Curious George,\" \"Jack Johnson,\" etc. Recently he saw one of those words on the screen and asked me what I was writing, so I read the sentence to him and explained that when I write about him on the computer I always call him \"Bud\" (a name which, frankly, I call him more often than not in real life as well). \"What?\" he asked again. \"I call you ' Bud' ! Just like Arthur's  Uncle  Bud!\" \"Yeah,\" he said, as we continued to walk through the school. Then he added, \"That's a great name.\" \"It  is  a great name,\" I said. \"Because  you  are a great kid.\" He didn't look at me. He just smiled a shy, private smile, then reached over and slipped his mittened hand into mine as we walked down the hallway to his classroom. Great name. Great kid.

{"date": "Thursday, January 25, 2007", "body": "\nAs Bud and I walked down the hallway toward his classroom this morning, I heard a small voice ring out from behind us: \"Bud!\" We turned and saw Bud's classmate Carla walking toward us. Bud doubled back, flung his arms open, and hugged Carla as well as he could manage through the bulk of their winter parkas. Carla walked with us the rest of the way to the classroom, and as she walked, she talked. And talked. And talked. I honestly had no idea how much the average neurotypical first-grader has to say. Here's a (fairly accurate) transcript: \"I saw you,\" she said, \"And so I called Bud's name because I didn't think he saw me. It sure is cold outside today.\" \"It sure is,\" I said. I turned to Bud as we reached the classroom. \"Let's get your boots off, Bud.\" \"You really have to wear a lot of clothes when it's so cold.\" \"Yep. That's why you're all bundled up, right, Bud?\" \"Yeah. He's bundled.  He's REALLY bundled. He's a bundle of FUNNY!\" \"Very true.\" I got Bud out of his boots and into his sneakers and we made our way to his cubby as Carla trailed us without missing a beat of her monologue. \"It's going to be so cold on Friday that the outdoor activities are going to be cancelled. They are going to be indoors. I was supposed to do an outdoor activity, but now I have to do an indoor activity instead.\" \"Bud was supposed to do an outdoor activity as well. He was --\" \"Yes, I already know that. He did an outdoor activity last week too, and him and Ms. Parker saw deer tracks. They saw deer tracks in the snow. Did you know that? It was really cool. Because deer are tricky. You sometimes see them, but you never really know where they're going. Where I live, it's near the woods and sometimes there are deer near there but sometimes we don't see them. But we saw a BEAR, and you want to know what? Michael - that's Michael right over there in the blue shirt - Michael is AFRAID of bears!\" \"Well, I might be afraid if I saw a bear up close, too.\" \"Not me. Nope. I saw a bear right up close and I wasn't afraid. We were in the car and we saw a bear right there. And you know what?\" \"What?\" \"My favorite word is  underwear .\" \"Really?\" \"Yes. That's my favorite word:  underwear .\" \"Well that's a great favorite word. It's very funny.\" By this time, Bud had finished hanging his things at his cubby and wandered, wordlessly, to his desk. Molly, whose cubby is next to Bud's, approached us and Carla immediately shifted her attention: \"Molly, you want to know what?\" \"What?\" asked Molly. \"My favorite word is  underwear .\" \"Really?!\" said Molly, turning to Carla. \"Hey! You have the same pants as me!\" And they were off. I walked over to say goodbye to Bud with a smile big enough that Ms. Parker asked what caused it. I explained that I'd just learned that Carla's favorite word was  underwear . \"Well,\" said Ms. Parker, catching my smile, \"If  underwear  can't be your favorite word in first grade, when can it be?\" I smiled all the way to work. There is magic in first grade. There's magic in the guileless, genuine stream-of-consciousness wonder of first-graders. There's magic in their unwavering self-confidence, their certainty that what they have to offer is just exactly what the world needs to have. Walk into the average first grade classroom and ask all the artists in the room to raise their hands. Every hand will go up. Walk into a classroom full of first-year college students and ask the same question. If you're lucky, a few tentative hands will raise - but it's likely that at least half of the people with their hands up will mutter something like \"but I'm not very good...\" It's no wonder that Bud is thriving this year, surrounded each day by so much fascination, so much enthusiasm, so much  life . It seems to me that we could all use a little more first grade in our lives. And if you think so, too, then I offer you this: Underwear .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/01/first-grade-magic.html", "title": "\nFirst grade magic\n"},

Despite the fact that Clay's birthday was a  smashing success , I've got some anxiety about Carla's party. I don't know Carla's parents. I don't know if they know who Bud is. They may have invited everyone in the class. They may not know about Bud's autism. The invitation doesn't say specifically, but I imagine that this is a drop-off-your-child party. Bud is not a drop-off kind of child. All of this ran through my head as I read the invitation and my brain jumped to the easy out:  Maybe Bud won't want to go.  I broached the subject with him. \"Bud, Carla invited you to her birthday party. Do you want to go?\" \"Yes.\" \"The party will be at Carla's house, with all the kids from school.\" \"Okay.\" \"You want to go to Carla's birthday party at Carla's house?\" \"Yes.\" Unequivocal. He's going. I'm rehearsing the telephone conversation I need to have with Carla's mom: about Bud - that I'll need to stay with him - that I'd be happy to lend a hand with serving cake or doing crafts or whatever, and is there anything I can bring, and oh-my-goodness is he looking forward to the party. And then we need to go shopping for a present, even though I have no idea what one buys for a neurotypical seven-year-old girl whose favorite word is  underwear . My stomach is in knots just thinking about it. But I'll make the phone call and I'll do the shopping, because Bud's going to the party.

At bedtime this evening, Bud and I were headed to his room to put on his jammies and I got sidetracked (by which I mean that I stopped to show my mother the  OK Go treadmill video  on YouTube. She was impressed that it had gotten three million hits until I told her that two million of them were from me.) Anyway, when I finally got back to what I was doing I discovered that Bud had gone into his room and closed the door behind him. I heard him talking and banging things around in his room, and thought he was just playing, passing the time, and waiting for me to show. So I did what I have been doing for the past seven-and-a-half years when Bud's on one side of a door and I'm on the other - I opened the door and started walking in. Bud was bare-chested and was in the final stages of pulling on his pajama bottoms. His head whipped toward the door when he heard it open, and his face registered shock and annoyance. \"Hey!\" he shouted. \"Gimme a minute!\" I quickly apologized and shut the door. Then I remembered that Bud and I have never had an exchange like that. \"Gimme a minute?\" Seriously,  \"Gimme a minute?\" That wasn't a script. That was Bud. That was Bud being annoyed.

{"date": "Monday, January 29, 2007", "body": "\n Bud's pet goldfish, Dorothy, died this weekend. She has been unwell for a long time. She had a  close call  last March and she  pulled through , though she's never really been the same since. I've been thinking about Dorothy's eventual death since she took ill last year, so I've had plenty of time to plan - though I've had no real sense of how Bud would react. He  loves his fish , and he talks about them like they're family members. He offers frequent, unprompted declarations of his affection for them: \"I love my pets Dorothy and Stevie!\" But I didn't want to project onto him what he  should  feel or inspire uncertainty where none existed, so I decided I'd just react as events unfolded. For the past couple of weeks we've been watching Dorothy struggle to stay upright as her gills and tail began turning black. I've been planting small seeds with Bud:  Dorothy is very sick. Not the regular kind of sick - a different kind of sick. Yesterday afternoon Bud was playing on the computer and Nana came upstairs to let me know that the end was near. I broke the news to Bud. \"Remember when we talked about Dorothy being very sick? Not regular sick?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Well, honey, now she is dying. That means it's time for her to leave us and go to heaven.\" \"And she will be back soon?\" \"No, sweetie. She doesn't get to come back from heaven. She has to stay in heaven, where she will be very happy and she won't be sick anymore. Do you want to go downstairs and say goodbye to her?\" \"Goodbye to Dorothy?\" \"Yes.\" \"Stevie's friend?\" \"Yes. And we can tell Stevie that it will be okay and that we'll take care of him.\" So down the stairs we went. Dorothy was lying on her side near the bottom of the bowl, barely breathing. Bud peered in and put his nose against the side of the bowl. \"She's sleeping?\" \"No, honey. She's not sleeping. She's dying. It's almost time for her to go to heaven.\" \"Goodbye, Dorothy,\" he said. \"We'll miss you.\" \"We love you, Dorothy,\" I added. Bud turned to me. \"I can go back to computer now?\" \"Sure, honey.\" Dorothy died about 30 minutes later, and Nana removed her from the bowl. I told Bud that Dorothy was gone, and asked him if he wanted to go talk to Stevie. He said no. Poor Stevie is a wreck. He's spent most of his life being bossed around the bowl by the bigger, more dominant Dorothy. It was startling to watch as, over the past few weeks, Dorothy started shrinking and Stevie became the fish in the power position. But he continued to defer to Dorothy, trying to nudge her to the surface when it was time to eat, falling still as she lay struggling for breath. Now, without her, he's darting crazily around the bowl, all bulging eyes and twitching tail. Bud, in contrast, is serene. He hasn't asked about Dorothy, and he's given Stevie only a fleeting glance. We told him that Dorothy is in a happy place, and it seems he has taken us at our word. We had planned to buy another goldfish to try to ease the loss for Bud, but as it turns out Bud is just fine. I guess we have to turn our attention instead to the family member who needs it most. The question is: how do we figure out how to ease the loss for Stevie?

{"date": "Monday, January 15, 2007", "body": "\nThis weekend, a new extended version of the Autism Speaks video  Autism Every Day  will be screened at the  Sundance festival . As a result, the post  An alternate view of Autism Every Day  - which I wrote last summer in response to the old, briefer version - is experiencing a bit of a renaissance, as people stumble onto it through  the magic of Google . Some of the visitors in recent weeks have left comments, but since the post is six months old few regular readers are likely to see them. Comments are an interesting phenomenon. A blog would be lifeless without them, yet some of them - particularly those left anonymously - can be scary enough to make even  the most intrepid of bloggers  want to run for cover. The comments I get on this blog aren't usually controversial or inflammatory, perhaps because most of my posts are not controversial or inflammatory. On the contrary, most of the comments I get are helpful, insightful, thoughtful, respectful, and kind. Some of those - often the ones I  most appreciate  - are comments from people who disagree with something I've written or people who want to offer a different perspective that I haven't considered. Once in a while (rarely, thank goodness) I get a comment that seems inexplicably mean-spirited. I have a hunch that those comments come from people who oppose my affiliation with  Autism Hub . Every now and then I get a comment from someone who disagrees with what they  think  I've written, but which, in fact, I have not written at all. It's hard to formulate a response to comments like that - first, because my responses tend to sound defensive, and second, because those comments are often left anonymously. I can't follow up through e-mail or by leaving a comment on the writer's own blog. I can only leave a follow-up comment there in the post, with the arrogant assumption that the commenter will check back to see if I've responded. So, I typically don't respond to the commenters who somehow missed my point; I just try to move on. I've been moving on for the past couple of days from  a comment  someone left anonymously last weekend on  An alternate view of Autism Every Day . The commenter wrote: Yes, a film about the hardships of rainy days should show nothing but sunny ones. You  seem to have missed a simple point. This film isn't meant to highlight the fact that children  are a blessing in life because we should know that without question and without being  reminded. What the film does show are the things that have been taken from these children  as a result of something that shouldn't exist. The average public is not going to be moved to  action by pictures of happy people living problem free lives. Your child is wonderful, joyful,  and a blessing to the whole world, as are all children. That isn't the part that needs help. The commenter makes some good points (specifically, that my child is wonderful, joyful, and a blessing to the whole world), and I appreciate that balance to the criticism of my post. The trouble is, of course, that the commenter seems to have missed a simple point - namely, that the post called for  balance  in the portrayal of life as the parent of a child with autism, not for an artificial view through rose-colored glasses. I thought about trying to compose a response to the comment, but ultimately, I decided to let the original post speak for itself and let readers draw their own conclusions. I'm glad I did. Today, another anonymous-ish commenter (using the name \"ulyyf\") posted a response, which just might be  my favorite comment  of all time. ulyyf wrote: \"A film about the hardships of rainy days should show *accurate* rainy days. Rain brings flowers, and crops, and rainbows. Clouds erase shadows and make the world soft. Fog and mist make the world a mystery. Thunder and lightening are the world's best and cheapest entertainment. Thrills and chills, folks! Colors seem brighter in drizzle - clear and neat, instead of dulled by the constant sunshine. Who hasn't enjoyed splashing in puddles, or standing with their tongues out to catch raindrops? How can you say that the only part of the rainy day that's worth talking about is the part where your shoes get wet and your hair frizzes? Sunny days have their virtue too, but also their faults, which are separate from the faults of rainy days. But I do prefer the rainy ones - even outside the bounds of this analogy, and even considering how much I hatehateHATE walking in wet shoes.\" Thanks, ulyyf. Thanks for your poetry.

The blog friends gave me concrete ideas to consider. 2.  The blog friends made me feel understood and supported. 3.  The blog friends gave me the courage to look to a professional for help. 4.  I am on medication to reduce my anxiety (and chest pain). 5.  I see a therapist once a week for myself. 6.  I go with my husband to the same therapist once a week for a couples session. 7.  Our therapist has given us very concrete suggestions for solving specific problems. 8.  The therapist helps us to get over the \"not wanting to hurt each other\" and get to the truths that need discussion and action. 9.  We have taken several very big steps already including having Ernie stay upstairs and out of my hair.  (My guilt over his being like a prisoner was overruled by the therapist who said it's HIS choice to stay up there.  He could go out, he could get a hobby, he could make a friend...) 10.  The other big step is that I no longer drive Ernie anywhere.  My husband and Ernie had a talk and he realizes now that he is not my responsibility. 11.  We are acutely aware of this being a work in progress.  Ernie may have to move out eventually, but we will try the \"least restrictive environment\" kind of thing first. I guess that's the update.

{"date": "Friday, January 12, 2007", "body": "\nWith every new skill come new challenges, and we've been seeing a lot of both around here lately. Bud's been proficient on the computer since he was about 2 years old, and even before he could read he could recognize familiar words (PBS, Teletubbies, Noggin) well enough to surf the internet with ease. After a while, we discovered that his digital self-sufficiency gave us some (otherwise rare and highly-coveted) time to get our own stuff done while he was happily pointing and clicking. In other words, we stopped paying close attention to what Bud was doing on the computer. Many months ago, Bud discovered Google and started doing searches by typing in words he had memorized (mostly \"teletubbies.\") Then he got creative and started hauling favorite books and videos to the computer, so he could copy the words for new searches (\"teletubbies hat\" or \"teletubbies windmill\"). Then he discovered Google Images, and a whole new world opened up for him. His literacy skills continued to improve and he tried typing phonetic approximations of words into Google, until the day he tried sounding out \"Tinky Winky\" and landed himself on a pornographic website. Luckily, Nana happened to be in the area and quickly put the kibosh on it. I talked to Bud that evening about The Evils of Google, and told him that he could only use Google when one of us was with him. He agreed to my terms and I walked away relieved, because Bud had always been a rule-follower - if we told him not to do it, he wouldn't. So I was surprised several weeks later when I walked into the family room and found him with a screen full of thumbnail images that were obviously the result of a search. \"Bud!\" I said. \"We said 'No Google' unless someone is with you.\" \"It's not Google, Mama,\" he said calmly. I peered over his shoulder and looked at the screen. It was Yahoo Images. (In fairness, I did say \"No  Google \".) I explained to Bud that, really, any search engine needed to be off-limits, because they all had things that weren't for kids. He acquiesced readily. I see, in retrospect, a little too readily. It seems that, instead of steering him away from search engines, our conversation served as the impetus for Bud to achieve a few more developmental milestones: deception and sneakiness. (And, yes, I know that developmentally these are very good signs, but really - why is it that so many of the neurotypical developmental achievements result in  less pleasant behaviors ?) Of course, this is all knowledge that I have in hindsight. At the time, I naively assumed that I could take Bud at his word, and that now that he  knew  the rules he would abide by them. And he did. That is, until The Great Thanksgiving Day Teletubbies Massacre of 2006. I spent a large portion of Thanksgiving Day prepping and eating and cleaning up downstairs as Bud quietly and contentedly puttered away at the computer upstairs. I should have been more mindful of limiting his computer time, but I was just so pleased that  this  Thanksgiving was going so much more smoothly than  the previous Thanksgiving  that I was reluctant to rock the boat. Finally, though, I dragged him away from the computer. At first he was fine. Then, slowly, he started telling me stories with plots I couldn't follow -  \"the man and the Tubbies and then the man in the sun and then KRSHHH and then BANG and Oh No Tinky Winky and the man and the water and is gone\"  - and when I asked more pointed question he told me he'd been watching \"Spanish Tubbies\" on the computer (I'm not sure where the \"Spanish\" came from - except that, perhaps, since he didn't understand it he assumed it was in a different language?) After Bud went to sleep, my husband pulled up the history on the computer and discovered that Bud had been surfing Teletubbies in Yahoo Video and had watched a great deal of footage. Some of it was actual pirated footage from the show. But the rest... oh, the rest. It was horrible - parody with foul language and violence, first-person shooters, blood spurting out of the lobbed-off appendages of Bud's best friends, and George W. Bush as the Baby Sun launching grenades and erecting oil wells throughout Tubbyland. (I swear that in Bud's recounting of the day's events I heard him use the word \"President,\" though I'd be surprised if Bud is familiar with either the man or the office.) I sat with my husband watching horrifying clip after horrifying clip, our guilty feelings of negligence growing - especially when the history showed us that Bud had watched several of them several times. I wondered how Bud had made sense of the footage - my boy, who has never watched commercial television, who finds  Finding Nemo  too action-packed for his liking - and the pit in my stomach continued to grow. My husband enabled the security feature on the computer in a close-the-barn-door maneuver, and the next morning I sat down with Bud to talk to him about the videos he'd watched:  Those are not real Teletubbies .  They are pretend and they're not nice. Bud agreed. \"I don't like Spanish Tubbies, Mama.\" And he's stayed away from the video searches. But he can't keep away from Google. Even with the security feature enabled, Bud is able to do a preliminary Google image search and pull up a page with thumbnail images - he just can't load the sites from there. He knows he's not  supposed  to do it, so he's started getting sneaky. He minimizes the screen when he sees us coming. Instead of waking us as soon as he's out of bed in the morning, he lets us sleep while he creeps into the computer room. Or, when I'm just a room away, he dashes across the room to shut the adjoining door so I won't see what's on his screen. (I said he's getting sneaky and deceptive. I didn't say he's mastered subtlety.) When I call him on it, he evades: \"Bud, what are you doing?\" \"I don't know.\" Or he lies: \"Bud, what are you doing?\" \"Nothing.\" The good news, of course, is that he's refining his  theory of mind skills . I'm walking a fine line between addressing the behavior and ignoring it. I'm not interested in turning Google into Bud's very own Holy Grail. At the same time, though, the stakes continue to rise. His spelling is getting better and better. He's not relying on memorized words or things he can pull from books. According to our computer's history, in the past several weeks Bud's areas of Google interest have focused on things like  poop ,  bum ,  tummies , and  belly kiss , and he's been viewing tiny thumbnails of huge pregnant bellies, men giving each other belly smooches, and the occasional set of bosoms. Now it seems that Bud is tiring of the thumbnails and is developing greater ambition. He's creative and determined - always a formidable combination - and he's branching out. The other night my husband was checking his e-mail on  my mother's  computer - the computer, incidentally, that Bud is forbidden to use - and I sighed as I heard him look at the history, then shout to me: \"Hey, honey? It looks like Nana's been Googling  bellies  again!\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/01/sneak-googling-and-slippery-slope-of.html", "title": "\nSneak-googling and the slippery slope of literacy\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, January 10, 2007", "body": "\nIt seems it's time to start paying more attention to Bud's sensory integration needs. I have to admit, I'd gotten lazy in that department. A couple of years ago, when Bud was in preschool, sensory integration was a Top Priority, but the better he got at self-regulating, the less attention I paid to it. We ended his supplemental Occupational Therapy sessions last spring (though he still has them at school), and bit by bit I've started slacking on all the other stuff - the jumping, the swinging, the marching. In the past couple of months, I'd even gotten slack with the  Wilbarger Brushing Protocol , which we'd been using faithfully with Bud since he was three. My laziness has caught up with me. To be fair, it's not  just  my laziness. Sensory integration activities are easy in the summer, when we can spend whole days splashing in the lake and rolling down hills and playing at the park. It's even pretty simple in the fall and spring, when the weather is still mild and the days fairly long. But in winter - especially this winter, when there has been no snow for sledding and digging and building - it's a much greater challenge. The days are short, the calendar is packed, the cold metal playground has low appeal - and even playing in the backyard is difficult, because we are currently managing through some particularly unpleasant issues with our septic system (and I will spare you the details, but suffice it to say that it makes the  scatalogical issues  I've been reading about in the autism blogosphere lately pale by comparison.) Anyway, for the past couple of weeks, Bud has been making his sensory needs known. I've been particularly aware of them in the middle of the night, when he  crawls into our bed  and tries to slide underneath me, or digs his heels into my shins, or buries his chin between my shoulder blades or hides his elbows in my ribs as he thump-thump-thumps his feet against whichever part of my body is closest, or as he wraps his leg around my kneecap and yanks. When Bud needs sensory input, he gets closer than close - and now that he's over 60 pounds and solidly built, it feels a bit like we've got a  Marmaduke  who thinks he's a lap dog. So sensory integration is making its way back to the top of the priority list. We're brushing regularly - at least twice a day. We're ending our days with games that involve a lot of climbing, marching, dancing, pushing, pulling, hugging, squeezing, jumping, and crashing. My favorite was \"sled dog,\" in which Bud (the dog) pulled me (the sled) by the hands as I slid across the wood floor in my sock-covered feet. I think Bud's favorite was the game in which Bud, Daddy, and I dog-piled on top of each other in varying order, requiring the person on the bottom to wriggle themselves free. Kyra also provided a terrific (and well-timed)  list of sensory integration activities  on  This Mom . I just keep thinking back to the workshop I attended a few years ago, in which Carol Stock Kranowitz, author of  The Out of Sync Child , said that the keys to promoting sensory regulation were \"push, pull, lift, carry,\" and I'm trying to build in those activities wherever I can. It seems to be doing the trick, and Bud must be remembering how good it feels to have his sensory integration in check, because as I tucked him into bed last and he wriggled and twitched and tried to get comfortable, he stopped and said, \"We need a swing.\" He went straight to the closet to unpack his  doorway swing , and after a few minutes of flight he was ready to settle into sleep. Bud's upcoming evaluation with the child development clinic is well-timed, since an OT is among the consultants we'll meet. In the meantime, we'll just keep pushing, pulling, lifting, carrying, sled-dogging, and dog-piling. And swinging, of course. Always swinging.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pbbkids.com/the_wilbarger_brushing_protocol.htm", "http://www.autismvox.com/kaka/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmaduke", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/01/the_handle_im_l.html#comment-27284977", "http://www.thismom.com/", "http://www.out-of-sync-child.com/", "http://www.playawaytoy.com/index2.ivnu"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/01/push-pull-lift-carry.html", "title": "\nPush, pull, lift, carry\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, January 03, 2007", "body": "\nI'm doing my best to complete the next round of paperwork for Bud's appointment with the  new child development clinic , which has been moved up to February. As always, I'm struggling to figure out how to use a standardized assessment to describe my delightfully nonstandard son. The assessment that's giving me the most trouble is the \"Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6-18.\" It seems to be designed as a general, global assessment tool, and is not specific to ASD. It asks me to respond to questions by checking the box by the answer that best reflects my view of Bud's behavior. The problem is, the boxes it provides are entirely inadequate. The assessment starts by asking me to list the sports and activities that Bud enjoys, and indicate how well he does each \" as compared to others of the same age \". The boxes are marked:  Below Average ,  Average ,  Above Average , and  Don't Know . Huh. I list some activities, though if I really want to describe the things Bud likes to do I'll need more than an inch-wide space. Then I start checking boxes. For most of the activities I check \"Don't Know.\" I'd like to check the box marked \"Differently From,\" but it doesn't exist. I move on to the next question, which reads:  About how many close friends does your child have?  It's followed by boxes marked \" None ,\" \" 1 ,\" \" 2 or 3 ,\" and \" 4 or more .\" I have no idea how to answer this. What does this mean? How are we defining \"friend\"? How are we defining \"close friend\"? Does physical proximity mark the difference between the two? Is a friend \"close\" only if we spend a lot of time together? I think about  VTBudFan , whom I haven't seen in about five years, but whom I consider a very close friend, and I rule out proximity as a defining feature. So, what  are  the defining features? A spiritual connection? A mutual understanding? Just a  feeling ? How can I begin to assess the depth of feeling that Bud has for the other children in his life? Or theirs for him? We don't have playdates with the children from school; Bud is not interested in having them. Yet, there is genuine affection between  Bud and Kelly ,  Bud and Lily ,  Bud and Sophie , Bud and Michael, Bud and Clay... Bud and a number of other friends at school. How can I - why should I - try to qualify and quantify? It is what it is - and what it is, is wonderful. I scribble a note in the margin, leave the boxes blank, and move on to the next question. Compared to others his age, how well does your child: Get along with other kids? Worse, Average, Better Behave with his parents? Worse, Average, Better Play and work alone? Worse, Average, Better I resist the temptation to tear the paper in half. I breathe deeply, pour another cup of coffee, and take them one at a time. Compared to others his age, how well does Bud get along with other kids? Well, that depends on what we mean by \"get along.\" Does he initiate play? Not really. Does he have sustained conversation with them? No. Does he engage in games with complicated rules and turn-taking? Not without a lot of assistance. On the other hand, he has never once (to the best of my knowledge) hurt another child's feelings. He has never been mean. He has never been aggressive. He has often been kind. He makes other children laugh. He makes them feel good. Children want to be around him. So what answer is that? Average? Better? I scrawl another note and move on. Compared to others his age, how well does Bud behave with his parents? How do other seven-year-olds behave with their parents? I have no idea. Frankly, it seems to me that there is no universal standard of \"behavior\" that parents use to assess their children, and \"good\" is a slippery, subjective classification for it. There are a lot of unreasonable parents out there. I've seen them in the grocery store, yelling at children who seem perfectly well-behaved to me. So, I wonder, is this question asking about Bud, or is it asking about my husband and me? Is it asking how well-behaved Bud is, or is it inquiring about the extent to which Bud's  actual  behavior matches our  expectations  for his behavior? I decide it's the latter, and I check the box marked \"Better.\" Compared to others his age, how well does Bud play and work alone? What exactly is our goal here? Are we seeing the ability to play alone as a goal-worthy outcome? He's autistic, for goodness sake. Of course he can play alone. And work alone? What am I being asked to measure?  Willingness  to work alone? High.  Productivity  when working alone? Varied.  Task-orientation  or  focus  when working alone? Depends on the task. I scribble again in the margin and leave the boxes empty. I finally reach the end of the \"compared to others his age\" section of the assessment and I breathe a heavy sigh of relief. I hate the \"compared to others his age\" section. It runs counter to my entire philosophy of parenting. In Bud's early years, I tried not to compare him to others his age. Now it doesn't even occur to me to try. I compare Bud now to Bud yesterday, and to Bud a week ago, a month ago, a year ago. And by that standard, he is  More ,  Better ,  Advanced ,  Above ,  Beyond . In the next section, I'm asked to assess Bud's performance in academic subjects:  Reading, English, or Language Arts ;  History or Social Studies ;  Arithmetic or Math ;  Science . The boxes read  Above Average ,  Average ,  Below Average ,  Failing . Seriously? Failing? What would it feel like to check a box marked \"Failing\" when assessing your own child? I will never know. I scan for a box marked \"In Progress.\" There isn't one. I plod through several additional pages of more of the same, and I do my best to answer honestly within the rigid boundaries that the assessment provides. At the end, I have a document that reflects some shadows of my son, but captures none of his essence. I'm reluctant to stick these papers into an envelope and let them be the only representations of my thoughts about my son that this clinic has on file. If I really want them to understand my assessment of Bud, maybe I should send along the URL to this blog. Or maybe I'll print out a few blog posts. Like  this one . Or  this one . Or this one.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogger.com/profile/30514736"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/01/check-one-dont-know-dont-care-doesnt.html", "title": "\nCheck one: Don't Know, Don't Care, Doesn't Matter\n"},

No, I'm not talking about the 1960 Steve McQueen western. This  Magnificent 7  stars Helena Bonham Carter as Maggi, the single mother of seven children: three daughters who are neurotypical, and four sons who fall on four different spots on the autism spectrum. The film is based on the Jackson family of Blackpool, UK. The real-life Maggi, Jacqui Jackson, is the author of  Multicoloured Mayhem  and served as a consultant on the film. Jacqui's son Luke is the author of  Freaks, Geeks, and Asperger Syndrome . (I haven't read Jacqui's book, but Luke's has been sitting on my bookshelf for quite some time and is now on the fast track to my nightstand.) I'm not familiar enough with the Jackson family to know how much of  Magnificent 7  is a fictionalized version of their lives. Their names have been changed, which tells me that this is not a film designed to maintain historical accuracy. And there is a love-story element to the plot that may or may not have been based on real-life events. But the movie is brimming with moments that families who have been touched by autism will recognize. None of Maggi's sons is overtly like Bud, and yet there were shadows of him everywhere - especially in Christopher, the character based on Luke, who  waited months  before opening his Christmas present and who took pictures of things  close-up and at odd angles  (he especially liked taking pictures of people's  shoes .)

Yesterday I took him to the local pharmacy, which is a \"catch all\" kind of store that meets the needs of residents who aren't up to making the 40-minute drive to a box store, so that he could buy Christmas presents for Daddy, Nana, and Papa. I wasn't sure what to expect, but imagined that he'd head straight to the toy department to choose things that both he  and  his recipients might enjoy. He didn't. In fact, he never stepped foot in the toy department. He walked through areas of the store he'd never visited, picking things up, looking them over, and putting them back down. He made his decisions carefully, but decisively, declaring \"This one is for Daddy!\" or \"Nana's going to love this.\" We went home and wrapped the presents together, then he took them one by one to place them under the tree, where they stayed for about three hours, until he could stand it no longer and started delivering them to their recipients. We all gathered in the kitchen for the grand unveiling, in which Daddy got heart-shaped soap, Nana got a Christmas-tree shaped tube of shower gel, and Papa got a Christmas platter. Bud's enthusiasm grew with each present that was opened, and with each shriek of delight that he heard. He hopped up and down, clapping his hands and laughing as we gushed over each present in turn. Then he ran to get two more presents, one for Daddy and one for me, that he'd made at school. Dad got a lovely covered dish, and I got a book, written by Bud and bound in hardcover. It instantly became my most treasured possession, and once I have access to a scanner and can do it some sort of justice, I will share it with all of you. Bud wanted to keep the good feelings going for as long as he could, and if one of us set down our gift he scurried over to hand it back to us. He suddenly realized that he was the only one among us without a present, so he dashed over to the kitchen counter, grabbed a gift bag, and tossed in the nearest item he could find: a bottle of Triaminic cough syrup. Then, with his own gift in hand, he joined us in the middle of the kitchen for a celebration of the spirit of Christmas, pulling us all together in a five-way hug. It was a Christmas moment that will stay with me forever. The shower gel, the platter, the soap, the box, the book - even the cough syrup - are wonderful gifts. But, without question, the warmth and love that filled our kitchen because of them were reminders to each of us that Bud himself is the best gift of all. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/12/santa-bud.html", "title": "\nSanta Bud\n"},

{"date": "Friday, November 24, 2006", "body": "\nI've been thinking today about mean girls. Where do they come from? Are they born mean? Are they mean as young children, or is their meanness some sort of mutant recessive gene that emerges suddenly when their bodies begin to sprout hair? If you've ever been to junior high, you're probably familiar with the mean girl phenomenon. Mean girls are not just run-of-the-mill hormonal, dramatic, mood-swinging teenagers. They are a breed unto themselves - a breed with a tell-tale modus operandi: mean girls get to know you just enough to discover the place where you are most vulnerable, and then they use that information to exploit it. For fun. Just because they can. Bud and I had an encounter with some mean girls today. Bud's been seeing the same hairdresser for several years - a woman who's in business for herself, which means that Bud is able to get his haircut without the typical beauty-shop sensory inundation of the sound of blasting hairdryers, the smell of chemical dyes, and the sight old ladies with their hair standing on end. When Bud gets his haircut, the only other people in the shop are Julie, the hair-dresser, and her daughter Meg, who is often in the shop waiting for her mom to be finished so that she can get a ride to soccer or basketball or the movies. Meg has always seemed like a nice enough kid - in that bored, disinterested, angst-filled way that preteens are nice. She has been especially helpful in getting the shop ready for Bud's arrival, by whisking the family dog out of the main room and into the back, or - if the dog is having a high-energy day - into the car, where his barking will not  disturb Bud . Julie has recently moved her shop out of her previous store-front and into an area on the ground floor of her home, and today was the first day that Bud and I went there for his haircut. I'd explained the move to him, but when we pulled up to what appeared to be a stranger's house, Bud was tentative about going in. He stood in the driveway refusing to go any further until Julie came out to greet us. Then he followed her in slowly and uncertainly, and he remained on edge throughout his haircut. Julie, who has come to understand Bud in the time she's been cutting his hair, remained unfazed by his skittishness, and happily chatted to him as she gently snipped away at his hair. Meg walked through the shop several times during our visit, accompanied by a friend. The shop, it seemed, was in the path from one area of the house to the other, and the girls made frequent trips back and forth, whispering conspiratorially. Each time they passed through, Julie reminded Meg to keep the door shut, giving her a look that we both recognized as \"Don't let the dog in here or Bud will get upset.\" Julie finished quickly, much to Bud's relief, and we were able to head back to the safety of the car. As we walked down the driveway past the rear of the house, a loud bark emanated from a second floor window. The bark was not quite canine; it sounded suspiciously like the tone of a thirteen-year-old girl. Bud feigned fear with a half-hearted \"Aaaaaaahhhhh!\" that was really more feigning than fear, but he moved quickly toward the car, more eager to put this unsettling new hairdressing shop behind us. \"They are just playing a trick on you, Bud,\" I said loudly in the direction of the open window. \"They are just playing a  very   mean  trick.\" I imagine the experience was less than satisfying for the girls. But I've spent the rest of the day wondering: Why did they go out of their way to do that? What did they hope to achieve? What element of superiority did they expect to walk away with? What could they possibly gain from besting a seven-year-old autistic boy? And all I can come up with is this: they did it just to be mean. Bud was unaffected by the experience, and I'm sure he stopped thinking about it moments after it happened. But I've been thinking about it all day. When do mean girls turn mean? What about the  delightful little girls  who have befriended Bud at school? Do any of them show the early signs of developing into a mean girl? Will Bud - trusting, loving, innocent Bud - someday turn to  his friend Sophie  or  his friend Kelly , only to discover that she's the mastermind behind an elaborate joke made at his expense? Meg and her friend thought they'd have a laugh by capitalizing on Bud's fear of dogs. Their plan fell flat, and they probably noted that they'd have to come up with a better scheme for meanness when they found their next victim. I wonder if they'd be satisfied to know that they  hit the target  with me and that, by barking out an open window, they left me feeling exposed and vulnerable for the rest of the day. That ought to be good for a laugh or two, right? It ought to be a downright scream - you know, if you're a mean girl.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/11/mean-girls.html", "title": "\nMean girls\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 15, 2006", "body": "\nIn a comment on yesterday's \"the tedium of me\" post,  MothersVox  left a list of compelling topics she'd like to see me cover as I struggle to fill bandwidth during the NaBloPoMo experiment. One of those topics jumped out at me immediately. She wrote, More on how you and DAD-NOS navigate household and childrearing responsibilities together. You both work, so how to you navigate all the housework. Just curious. It's simple, really. We have a secret weapon: live-in grandparents. For obvious reasons, this is not a solution that would work for everyone. And there are many folks in our inner and extended circles who are incredulous that it works for all of us. But it does. And mostly - most importantly - it works for Bud. Interestingly, the journey toward cohabitation began when we discovered that we were expecting twins and our heads started swimming with questions about how we'd manage it. My parents lived a state away from us at the time, and we had no relatives who were local. But my mom was approaching retirement age and my dad had been retired for years, so they started making plans to move away from the town in which they'd both been raised to buy a house around the corner from us. They were in the final stages of planning their relocation when Bud was born and his twin brother, Pal, died. But, even though we were no longer facing the daunting prospect of having two babies at the same time and even though we were not yet aware of Bud's autism, my parents moved forward with their plan to move to our neighborhood. When I look back at it now, I recognize that it's  yet another gift that Pal gave us . In the early months of Bud's life, I worked days and my husband worked afternoons and evenings, and we had a complicated choreography of shift-work childcare, which involved drop-offs and pick-ups and fly-by visits for nursing. As Bud got a little older, my husband switched to a daytime shift and Nana and Papa took on the full-day responsibility of caring for Bud. In a short time, and as a result of a complicated series of events, it became clear that consolidating our households would make the most sense for all of us. So the summer before Bud turned 2, just before we got Bud's \"official\" diagnosis, we pooled our resources and bought a big house with a lot of levels and a great deal of elbow room. As with any shared-living experience, there are negotiations and compromises that have to be made. There have been some tension-filled moments. But there has also been a house filled to the brim with Bud-focused energy and insight and love. It's hard to imagine what Bud's early years would have been like without Nana and Papa in his daily life. The reality is that before the day he started first grade (at almost seven years old), Bud had never spent more than four hours without at least one of the four of us. His life has had the kind of consistency and predictability that he's needed to feel safe and to build a sense of competence. Though he struggled with language for many years, he was always secure in the knowledge that his Big Four would be able to read him. But Bud hasn't just gained a sense of stability from our arrangement. He has also developed a genuine flexibility and an understanding of human difference. At a very young age, it was clear that Bud understood that Mom is different from Dad who is different from Nana who is different from Papa. He knows us all well, and he has developed a unique relationship with each of us. He navigates the subtleties with ease - he knows what works with each individual: when to turn on the charm, when to push the issue, when to use humor, when to back down. We provide a real learning laboratory for the art and science of human interaction every single day. And we benefit from having four sets of eyes and ears and hands; four minds; four hearts. We  problem-solve together .  We worry .  We celebrate .  We hope . Times four. Is it a challenge? Of course it is. But we all keep our eyes on the prize.

Today, Bud's answer came more slowly and more thoughtfully. \"It was,\" he said, \"a big day.\" I waited a little while and asked him again, but the answer was the same: \"It was a big day.\" As I reflect on the day we've had, I can see that he's right. This was not a  black-and-white , good-or-bad sort of day. It was somewhere in between - perhaps  more grey than gray . Bud lost another tooth yesterday - his fifth, and one of the top front ones. The tooth fairy left him two dollars and he wanted to head out to spend them right away. He knew exactly what he wanted - a new  Teletubbies  DVD he'd seen online. That was all easy. We couldn't go shopping first thing today. That was hard. The reason was that he had a ski lesson - which would have been totally easy, if it wasn't standing between him and the Teletubbies. We headed to the mountain on a beautiful sunny day (easy), for what he knew would be his final ski lesson of the season (hard). He had a new instructor who was less guarded and protective than the instructors he's had for his last couple of lessons. They spent the whole lesson on the bigger hill instead of starting off on the smaller one (easyhard - excitingscary), and Bud had more freedom (easyhard), he took more risks (easyhard), he was more independent (easyhard), he moved down the hill faster (easyeasyeasy), but fell more (hard). His instructor urged him beyond his comfort zone and he was more successful than he knew he could be (easy), but the instructor kept pushing when Bud had decided that he was done for the day (hard). My husband and I also encouraged \"one more time\" after he'd taken a break, which probably felt like we'd joined the opposing team (hard). Bud stood his ground, and we packed it in with no more runs (easy). There was big cookie waiting in the Lodge (easy) and we got to ride the shuttle bus back to the car (easy), and then we were off to spend Bud's tooth fairy money on the new Teletubbies DVD (very easy). Toys R Us didn't have the DVD (hard). I suggested that we look at Target (hard - because Bud knows that I tend to need to look at  just one more thing  every time I enter Target and Bud is not a fan of shopping), but he refused. Then he asked if I would go to Target but not do any other shopping. I agreed (easy) and we were off. But Target didn't have the DVD either (hard). Neither did Borders (hard). But after long deliberations (hard), Bud decided to buy a  Boohbah  DVD instead (easy- just not  as  easy).  Bud's dad had promised that we could have a pajama party and watch the new DVD before bed (very easy), but that meant he wouldn't be able to watch it as soon as he got home (hard). Luckily, when we got home we discovered that the mail had arrived and in it was the Teletubbies book we'd ordered through a seller of used books on March 2, and which had apparently been shipped via pony express. It had been a very long wait (exceptionally hard), but the wait made the book's arrival feel like a holiday of the grandest nature (exceptionally easy). Bud spent the rest of the afternoon with his book (easy), and after dinner we all gathered for our pajama party and the inaugural viewing of the new Boohbah DVD (easy). We watched all three episodes on the DVD (easy), but drew the line at checking out all the \"special features,\" as it was already well past bedtime (hard). As we got ready for bed, we talked about what we'd do tomorrow. I suggested that we might go to church (hard). Bud suggested that we should play outside, and got a non-committal answer from me (easy? hard?) Then Bud and I started talking about his day. I asked him lots of open ended questions about the things that were hard and the things that were easy, and he struggled to find the words to explain to me what was weighing on his mind. And what was on his mind was this: today was hard because he was thinking about yesterday. And yesterday, I yelled at him. I have almost no recollection of this event. According to Bud, I yelled at him because he was screaming. Then I vroomed him. Then I \"terrificked\" him. I asked him what it sounds like when I vroom him, and he made an exasperated growly sort of sound in his throat (which, frankly, sounded more like me than I'd care to admit). I assume my \"terrific\" was some sarcastic response I made to him - this boy who doesn't really understand sarcasm. I felt about two inches tall. \"Wow. That  was  hard, Bud,\" I said. \"It was hard because...\" \"It was hard because you hurt my feelings. You're sorry you hurt my feelings.\" \"I  am  sorry I hurt your feelings, Bud. I'm very sorry I hurt your feelings.\" \"That's okay.\" \"Well... thank you.\" \"You're welcome.\" I finished the bedtime routine, then slunk out of his room to try to mop myself up. I can't believe I vroomed him and terrificked him and hurt his feelings and barely remember the incident that he's been carrying with him all day. That's really hard. On the other hand,  he told me what was bothering him.  He explained his emotions. He explained the cause-and-effect of how my actions affected his emotions. He talked it all through until he got it off his chest and felt better. That had to be a hard conversation for him to have. But I'll bet that having it has made it a lot easier for him to get to sleep tonight. And what's more - Bud has fully grasped the complexity of his day. He didn't seize one particular moment and let it define his day: his day was not the yelling, or the skiing, or the movie, or the book. His day was not hard or easy; it was just big. A little over a year ago, I wrote  this post , in which I discussed my frustration with the strategies outlined by Simon Baron-Cohen and his colleagues for helping children with autism to \"mind read\" as they learn about human emotion. My concern was that their approach treated emotion as black-or-white, without any consideration for the extraordinary percentage of emotional responses that are driven by grey. At that time, I wrote: If I want Bud to be successful in the world, I need to help him understand and make sense of the flexible, evolutionary, constantly changing world of human emotion. I am doing him a disservice if I set low expectations and define success as a rigid understanding of a series of \"if this, then that\" scenarios.  And here we are, thirteen months later, with Bud reminding me - teaching me - that some days cannot be summed up by either \"hard\" or \"easy\" - that sometimes you spend your days skiing through the slopes of emotion and you slalom between the hard and the easy; and even though you know just exactly what you want, you find that you can't always get it right away - but, the alternatives are not so bad, and sometimes there are even exciting surprises in store for you; and mostly, at the end of the day, you remember that it's okay to get angry with the people you love and that even though they sometimes hurt your feelings, you know that you still love them and they still love you. Bud was absolutely right: It was a big day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/03/big-day.html", "title": "\nA big day\n"},

But the highlight of the trip was  Episode 32  of Autism Podcast, which features Dr. Steven Gutstein, founder of Relationship Development Intervention (RDI).  I've seen Dr. Gutstein in person, and I think he's brilliant.  His perspectives on autism, human development, and parenting make intuitive sense to me.  I believe in RDI because it, too, makes intuitive sense.  But, mostly, I believe in RDI because I think it has been - and continues to be -  transformative for Bud .  This podcast gives just a glimpse of Gutstein and the RDI philosophy.  It's not a lengthy interview, but it's a nice place to start if you're looking for more information about the program.  You can download it for free from iTunes, or listen to it at the  Autism Podcast site .

{"date": "Wednesday, November 01, 2006", "body": "\nI've never been a huge fan of Halloween before, but I have to admit - this year's festivities have left me feeling positively  Wiccan . In the past, Bud has shared my take-it-or-leave it Halloween attitude. There was not much about the holiday that appealed to him - the costumes, the talking to strangers, the gaggles of masked children making squealing noises. Even the candy was not a draw - for Bud, if it's not M&M's or Twizzlers, he's not particularly interested. Not so this year. Bud's excitement didn't really kick in until the weekend, but by Sunday he was ready to don his costume and start trick-or-treating spit-spot. We spent the next two days in a constant state of counting down and reciting each activity that would take place: Bud would bring his magician costume to school in a bag; after snack, he would put on his costume and join the costume parade around the school; then his class would have a Halloween party; after school, Nana would pick him up and take him home; after supper, Mom would come home and he would put his costume back on; then Mom and Dad and Bud would all go trick-or-treating. We also spent a great deal of time breaking down the trick-or-treating experience into its component parts:  you ring the doorbell; somebody you don't know opens the door; you say \"Trick or Treat\"; they hold out candy; you open your bag; they put candy in the bag; you say \"thank you\"; we go to another house and do the whole thing again. Of course, for two days as we recited this litany together I had a silent litany of Plans B, C and D running through my head: We would bring Bud's costume to school in a bag, and give him verbal assurance that he did not have to put it on  or  participate in the parade  or  go to the party at school; after supper, Bud would decide if trick-or-treating still sounded like a good idea; if it did, Mom and Dad and Bud would drive to a house; Bud would either go to the door or not; if he went to the door, he would either speak to the resident or not; he would either get candy or not; we would either continue to another house or not. If at any point trick-or-treating seemed to Bud to be a bad idea, we would head to Dunkin Donuts and get a treat we didn't have to work quite so hard for. As it turned out, my silent litany was completely unnecessary. Bud was delighted when the time came to put on his top hat and cape and become The Amazing Bud. He marched in the parade. He attended the party. And he was absolutely giddy by the time I got home to pick him up for trick-or-treating. Bud, Daddy and I drove to a lovely neighborhood with houses that were fully decorated for the season. Without hesitation, Bud strutted up the long driveway of the first house with his wand held high and he pressed the doorbell with gusto. He smiled as a woman opened the door, and then - out of the blue -  a small dog  charged around the corner and rushed up behind her at full speed. She jumped, Bud jumped, and I thought \"Dunkin Donuts, here we come.\" But she held the dog, and Bud held his ground. He collected his candy, thanked her, and walked away, saying \"Let's go to another house.\" And another house, and another, and another. Ring, stranger, talk, open, thank. Ring, stranger, talk, open, thank. With each new house his confidence grew. We approached houses with cobwebs hanging, houses with spooky music playing, and even a house with a ghost that popped out of a pumpkin. Along the way we encountered pirates and gypsies and assorted other ghouls. And Bud took it all in stride. As we neared the end of the neighborhood, I realized that I hadn't thought through a Plan B for how we'd bring the evening to a close if things went  well . I wondered if we were in store for a tear-filled finale when I told him it was time to go home. But Bud beat me to it, suggesting \"Let's go home and have a treat!\", and Dad and I agreed that it was a great idea. I never imagined that a no-big-deal-holiday like Halloween could feel like such a significant milestone for us. It's funny. In the  Celtic tradition , Halloween marks the time when we prepare for the dark months to come. I know that the calendar says that winter is approaching, and I know that it means that the days are getting shorter. But this year, for our family, Halloween felt like a step  out of the darkness  and like a leap into the light. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.celticspirit.org/samhain.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhain"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/11/halloween-magic.html", "title": "\nHalloween magic\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, October 03, 2006", "body": "\nI have followed, with interest,  conversations among fellow bloggers  about the use of the terms \"high functioning\" and \"low functioning\" as descriptors of autism. They're not categories that I tend to use, because I think they're arbitrary, artificial constructs that are too situation-dependent to be of any real value: How high is \"high\"? How low is \"low\"? And how are we defining \"functioning,\" anyway? Even if we look at particular skill sets in isolation, it's difficult to clearly define what constitutes \"high\" and \"low\" functioning. Take language, for example. On the surface, we would assess a child who is able to use language conversationally as \"high functioning\" and one who is not as \"low functioning,\" with a broad spectrum of ability between the two. Right? I'm not so sure. I began to consider this issue when I read Cammie McGovern's  Eye Contact ,  a mystery novel set primarily in a school. Several characters in the novel are either identified as autistic or described in a manner that implies that they are on the spectrum. One boy, identified as autistic, uses very little language. His limitations in that area are fully recognized by other characters and he has staff who work closely with him as he successfully manages each school day. A second boy is articulate and verbose and, though he's not specifically identified as such, he appears to have Aspergers. Because he is smart and verbal, he is frequently left alone to navigate complicated and confusing social environments at school. As a result, he is bullied and assaulted by classmates. I wonder: which boy has \"higher functioning\" at school? I look around my real-life work environment and consider two young men, Christopher and David, who are in the incoming class of college students. I don't have any specific information about their neurology, and my conclusions about them are based only on observation and speculation. However, what I see tells me that Christopher may have some sort of language processing disorder. His writing is clear and precise, but conversations with him are slow. When asked a question, Christopher pauses, his eyes scanning the ceiling as if he's searching for a cue card stashed there. His pauses last an unusually long time, and are typically followed by a brief answer - sometimes as brief as \"yes\" or \"no.\" After a single conversation with Christopher, other people on campus can (and do) clearly recognize his challenge and make reasonable accommodation for him by slowing their rate of speech, giving him more time to process his response, and, when possible, providing him opportunities to converse through writing instead of speech. David, by contrast, is quick with verbal comebacks and retorts. His answers are so articulate, in fact, that it's easy to get the impression that their acerbic bite is intentionally designed to insult the recipient. David talks at length about his areas of interest - his esoteric collections of things foreign to most college-aged people. He seems indignant and self-righteous when he insists that his peers  must  know what these things are, and that only an imbecile would lack such knowledge. David enjoys playing his music (Peter, Paul, and Mary; Arlo Guthrie - not the standard Dave Matthews college student fare) frequently and loudly, much to the chagrin of his neighbors, who have complained to their Resident Director. When the RD asked David about it, he responded that things were going well on the floor. He knew this, he said, because every time someone had a problem with his music, they told him and he turned the music down. He reported that he got this request three or four times a day, and each time he happily obliged. David was unable to generalize from the specific in this situation - to draw the conclusion that if his neighbors were asking him to reduce his volume  four times a day , they would prefer that he keep his volume lower all the time. He was also unable to read the nonverbal cues from his neighbors, which most certainly indicated their decreasing patience with his continuing noise. Again, I wonder: As Christopher and David progress through their first semester at college, who will be more successful in the world of college housing - slow-talking, less verbal, \"lower functioning\" Christopher, or fast-talking, more verbal, \"higher functioning\" David? I thought about it a third time with an example much closer to home. Bud is verbal, but he continues to struggle with sustained conversation and he often relies on  mitigated echolalia  and scripts to make his points. Our blog-friend  Owen , on the other hand, is very verbal and would be considered \"higher\" than Bud on the scale of verbal functioning. Both Owen's mom, Tara, and I were nervous about our sons' transitions to school this year. Bud made the transition well, with  extraordinary support  from his teacher, classroom aide, and special education staff. Owen, on the other hand, was forced to withdraw from school after experiencing not just a  lack of support , but also  actions that made his transition more difficult  - and, ultimately, impossible. Clearly, one primary difference is that Bud is in a student-centered, collaborative school system and  Owen was not . Beyond that, though, I wonder to what extent the staff of Owen's school underestimated the level of support he would need because they focused too much on the strength of his language and failed to recognize the challenges of his autism. By dismissing him as \"too high functioning\" to require significant accommodation, they created a dysfunctional - and now, a non-functional - learning environment for Owen. It's examples like these that make me reject the \"high-functioning\" and \"low-functioning\" descriptors and regard them as inadequate, ineffective, and inappropriate. And, I have to say, if these are the classifications that will drive the services my son receives, that will shape the responses he gets from other people - if the degree of accommodation, understanding, collaboration and compassion that people will be willing to proffer will be based  solely  on their assessment of his \"functioning level\" - then I can sum up my philosophy in two words: Aim low.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/lfa-and-hfa/", "http://coloring-outside-the-lines.blogspot.com/index.html", "http://coloring-outside-the-lines.blogspot.com/2006/09/somewhat-dissatisfied.html", "http://coloring-outside-the-lines.blogspot.com/2006/09/our-eyes-wide-open.html", "http://coloring-outside-the-lines.blogspot.com/2006/09/home-free.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/10/high-cost-of-high-function.html", "title": "\nThe high cost of \"high function\"\n"},

I'd foolishly been looking forward to this year's \"fall back.\" For the past several weeks, in a radical departure from his  summer sleep schedule , Bud has been sleeping in on school days, especially when the already dark skies were made darker by rain clouds. I was loathe to rouse him when he was sleeping so soundly (and when I could guess that he was in for a  challenging day ), and as a result we had more than a few mornings of rushing through the house in a frenzy to make it out the door on time. So, I thought, perhaps the time change would allow Bud's system to re-regulate to a more reasonable wake-up time and give us an opportunity to have a few leisurely mornings. It re-regulated him alright. Today our day started at 3:30 a.m., when Bud bounded out of bed with jet propulsion force despite the middle-of-the-night darkness that filled the house. It was clear from the moment he opened his eyes that he was up for the day. I've been awake for 13 hours now and I'm still about seven hours and five projects away from falling back into bed. I say we abandon this Daylight Savings business and start up a Nighttime Protection Program. Anyone?

It's obvious that she's fond of him - but, then, many of the children in Bud's class are fond of him. Each day at pick-up time, a group gathers around him. The boys give him high-fives; the girls hug him. He opens his palm to receive the high-fives; he stands still and allows himself to be hugged. But there has been something different about Kelly. Kelly is always among the huggers - and she is usually the most enthusiastic of them. She's the first person to greet him when he arrives in the classroom each morning. And she recently painted him a picture and wrote both their names on the back. She gave it to him as Nana was getting him ready to go home. \"Oh, Kelly,\" said Nana, \"This is a beautiful picture! I'll bet Bud would like to hang it on his wall.\" Kelly smiled, and replied wistfully, \"And then every time he looks at it he'll think of  me ?\" I have to admit, I've been worried that Kelly was setting herself up for heartbreak, as I've suspected that she was unknowingly embroiled in a love triangle: Kelly loved Bud, but Bud only had eyes for  Mrs. Parker . But it seems that persistence may have paid off, and the tides might be turning in Kelly's direction. At the end of the school day yesterday as the students said their farewells for the weekend, Kelly approached Bud with her arms open. Bud turned to her, flung his arms open... and hugged back.

{"date": "Sunday, October 08, 2006", "body": "\nIn  a recent post  I discussed my growing concern about two elements of the business side of the autism intervention model Relationship Development Intervention (RDI). I had two primary concerns: 1) The cost of the RDI \"protocol,\" which is so high that it precludes its use by many (perhaps most) families, and 2) My perception that some proponents of RDI suggested that only those parents following the prescribed RDI protocol were doing \"real\" RDI, and those of use researching, studying, networking, and implementing on our own ran the risk of setting our children's progress back instead of moving it forward. I was pleased, then, when a  recent edition of the RDI newsletter  addressed both issues. It reads, We have never wanted to discourage parents who either cannot afford or do not have access to Certified Consultants, from attempting to work with their child using RDI\u00ae Program principles. We have certainly read and seen many accounts of exciting changes brought about by parents who were intuitively using our methods as they were intended. Yet we do highly recommend parents follow the  RDI\u00ae Program protocol , including taking full advantage of the Parent Seminar and the expertise of Consultants because this is the best way to get the most effective RDI\u00ae Program. So far, parents needing outside funding have accessed it through a variety of sources. The newsletter  goes on to list seven sources of funding that RDI families have used and concludes with, Our goal is for the RDI\u00ae Program in its entirety, (Parent Seminars, RDAs\u2122, ongoing consulting, etc.) to be accessible to every family with a child on the autism spectrum. However, this is not something we can do by ourselves. Nor can this be done through FARR, whose charter restricts it from funding treatment programs for individual families. It is time for all of us, as a community to work together to help those who cannot afford RDI\u00ae Program services. The Connections Center wants to take a leadership role in this initiative, and has already started discussions with a parent who is willing to spearhead fundraising. What we need next is a non-profit foundation to act as the conduit and administrator for providing the funds. If you have access to a non-profit organization that would be willing to do this, or if you have any good connections to possible funding sources, please  let us know.  We do not want any child, teen or adult on the spectrum left behind due to lack of financial resources and are actively working on a solution. We welcome your ideas and your support and hope to be able to start providing RDI\u00ae Program scholarships in the very near future.  I'm delighted to see that the folks at the Connections Center are recognizing and addressing the very real issues of access. The RDI philosophy has made - is making - a tremendous difference in our lives. I hope it will continue to do the same for many, many more.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rdiconnect.com/archive/newsletters/2006/09/12/default.htm#article", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/RDI/RDIProtocol.asp", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/archive/newsletters/2006/09/12/default.htm#article", "mailto:gutstein@RDIconnect?subject=RDI%20Scholarship%20Fund%20"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/10/rdi-financing-redux.html", "title": "\nRDI financing redux\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 17, 2006", "body": "\nMy friend Teal is at wit's end with her live-in father-in-law, and I thought it might be prudent to turn to my wise resources in the autism blogosphere for some insight on the matter. Teal's father-in-law, Ernie, a widower, has been living with them for several years. It has been difficult from the start, but over time it has gotten almost unlivable for Teal. Some of the highlights: - Ernie is a collector. He goes to yard sales every Saturday and purchases old cameras and kits for model airplanes. He does not use the cameras. He does not build the models. He does not catalog them. He does not, in fact, look at them once they've been purchased. He stores them in cartons in Teal's basement. Until Teal declared mutiny and rented a storage unit this summer her very large basement was - quite literally - packed floor to ceiling and wall to wall with Ernie's \"stuff.\" - Ernie is not considerate. He makes demands on Teal's time (announcing, for instance, that he would like bagels from the bakery as Teal is rushing at top speed to get her children on the bus and herself off to work, expecting her to accommodate his whim and go get his bagels because he does not drive, and being shocked and offended when she does not acquiesce.) - Ernie is (to put it mildly) not a people-person. He works as a science professor at a community college, but when he is not working he is sitting at Teal's kitchen table. All day long. - Ernie has hygiene issues. He bathes infrequently. He does laundry even less. - Ernie has skin problems. He picks at his problem skin while he is sitting at Teal's kitchen table, leaving shards of skin and drops of blood in his wake. Because he has hygiene issues, he fails to clean up after himself. - Ernie is a creature of habit. His preference to stick with his habit often outweighs his desire to avoid contact with people, so when Teal has visitors Ernie stays at the kitchen table. When he does not enjoy their conversation, he puts his hands over his ears. The list, I'm sorry to say, goes on from there. Recently, Teal has begun to compare Ernie's behavior to the DSM-IV criteria for Aspergers, especially 1) severe and sustained impairment in social interaction; 2) the development of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities; and 3) significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, and it all seems to fit. This realization, however, has thrown Teal into a bit of a tailspin. She cannot tolerate Ernie, but she wonders  Am I being prejudiced and narrow-minded ? She wrote in a recent e-mail: (I imagine that) Aspergers (or whatever label you want to use as an example) isn't the only factor at work. I'm sure there's still the issue of personality. Of course, then you get into the chicken or the egg thing: did the Aspergers help shape the personality, or did the personality flavor the person with Aspergers? In terms of Ernie, I can only guess that Aspergers helped to define and shape the personality. For instance, the guy can't stand loud noises or lots of sensory stuff, and therefore learned to shy away from any situation that could possibly include those things, such as crowds, being with people, etc. And since he didn't know how to act quite appropriately (in social situations, anyway) people started to choose not to be with him - like in grade school, etc. On the other hand, I look at Bud, who clearly has a personality of his own that is not AUTISM, but just Bud - charming, funny, draws you to him, and I think that personality must not be shaped by disability. So, in all, I just don't know. I wish I had insight for my friend. Ernie is not a child. Teal can't hire an OT to work with him or start an RDI program at home. Ernie is not interested in changing. But Teal is simply not able to continue living with the status quo. So, blogosphere friends, what advice do you have for Teal? She is a warm-hearted, fiercely loyal person. Ernie is her husband's father, and she wants to do the right thing. But, as is so often true in life, the right thing remains elusive.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/10/friend-in-need.html", "title": "\nA friend in need\n"},

I keep saying it that way - \"I'm thinking about writing a book\" - despite the fact that I have  already  started writing - despite the fact that this blog itself is just a big old jumble of pre-writing. But a book is different from a blog. A blog can be edited and re-edited and deleted on a whim. A book has permanence and heft. A book is Significant and Important. A book requires thought. So I'm thinking about it. A book, I mean. Writing one. But I'm starting to feel a little like Hamlet, spending a whole lot of time on the \"to be or not to be\" contemplation, and very little time on the actual  doing  of anything. I sit down at the computer and think, \"Right. Book. Okay... Page 1,\" and my mind goes blank. A couple of months ago, through the magic of Google, I tracked down my college writing professor to tell him that, twenty years out, I remembered his class, his advice, and his wisdom. I told him that as I developed a  writing class of my own , I used his as a model. He wrote back to say that \"of course\" he remembered me (which, I think, says more about the kind of teacher he is than about the kind of student I was). We've been in touch a few times since, and recently I described my book-block to him. He said that the solution was simple: Stop trying to write a book. Just let the book happen. Yesterday, I had lunch with a writer friend who has published several books and who, it seems, is about to publish The Big One Which Will Make Him Wildly Famous. He's been supportive and encouraging about my Thinking About Writing a Book and has offered his help and direction. As I talked through my current paralysis, he suggested that I type out three words and post them on my wall: Trust the process. \"Trust the process,\" he said. \"It's not about you; don't try to make it about you. Have the courage to make a mess of your work, and to let the process unfold. Engage in it completely, and trust that it will move in the right direction.\" And then I got it. My friend had just described my philosophy of parenting: Don't make it about me. Be brave. Engage fully. Pay attention. Trust the process. I do it every day with Bud. As he changes and evolves and grows and develops and morphs, I co-pilot without a guidebook or a road map - without, even, a clear sense of our destination. We just sit close together, hold on tight, and follow the Force. We trust the process. And the process never lets us down. So I'm trying it again. I'm plunging in and making a mess and navigating by instinct and watching to see what unfolds. I'm trusting the process. I'm writing a book.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/10/trust-process.html", "title": "\nTrust the process\n"},

It's a good mystery story with realistic characters, interesting plot twists, and an unpredictable resolution. I hated it. I found it hard to focus on the actual plot of the novel because I was too distracted by the sickness growing in my stomach and by the panic rising in my chest. From my vantage point, this was not a mystery story; it was a warning: Be aware that people will taunt, torment, harass and harm your child. They may even kill him. Do not send your child to school. School is dangerous. Teachers and aides cannot possibly watch your child at all times and if they look away for only a moment, unspeakable things can happen. If you take the risk and send your child to elementary school and he has the good fortune to survive the experience, do not under any circumstances send him to middle school. If you are foolhardy enough to send him to middle school, do not let him ride the bus. Do not let him go to the restroom unattended. Do not let him walk through school hallways by himself. Do not make him go to study halls. Do not make him open his locker. Your child is not safe. This book is too well-written, so it pierces me in all the places I feel most vulnerable.  This week , for  more than one reason , those places were even more vulnerable than usual, and  Eye Contact  hit me with a full-force blow that knocked me to the ground.

He had also been clear about the specifications and agenda (most were a direct lift from Dora, but it was heartfelt all the same): Balloons, streamers, party hats, blowers. Pizza, cake, candles, ice cream, treats. Pinata, Pin the Tail on the Donkey, Goodie Bags, Musical Chairs. And, of course, presents, presents, presents. We also threw in a treasure hunt for good measure, and Bud delighted in calling the shots and orchestrating the event.

{"date": "Saturday, August 19, 2006", "body": "\nOver the past year I've spent a great deal of time,  here  and  elsewhere , celebrating Steve Gutstein's autism intervention program,  RDI  (Relationship Development Intervention.) The philosophy behind RDI makes intuitive sense to me, and the work that I've done with it seems to have made a tremendous difference for Bud. But over the past several weeks my enthusiasm for RDI has been dampened. Early this month, Gutstein unveiled \"RDI 3.0,\" a new \"operating system\" that promises to revolutionize the RDI program, streamlining it, making it more easily understood and easier for parents to implement. The catch? It will be available only to certified consultants, who can then dole it out in small portions to their paying customers. When I've read  criticisms of the RDI program , they have rarely had to do with the RDI philosophy and often with the RDI  business . The full RDI \"protocol\" as outlined by Gutstein's Connections Center, which includes a four-day parent workshop, an intensive initial assessment, and ongoing work with a certified RDI consultant, is expensive. For many (most?) parents, it is prohibitively expensive. However, I have stayed buoyed and positive throughout the past year because it seemed to me that Gutstein had built in provisions for parents who were not able to afford the full protocol. As one of those parents I have, for the past year, pieced together a \"make your own RDI\" program. I attended the  two-day introductory workshop , purchased the 5-hour  RDI DVD , read  Solving the Relationship Puzzle , lurked on a listserv for parents and consultants, participated in free chats with Gutstein and his wife and RDI partner Rachelle Sheely, purchased the official RDI  tracking sheets , and purchased a book of RDI activities called  Relationship Development Intervention with Young Children . This was a significant financial investment for my family, but it represented a fraction of the cost of the full RDI protocol. And it seemed to be working. I watched Bud's progression and compared it to what I saw described on the tracking sheets; to my amazement, the activities I was doing with Bud - the way I was approaching my parenting - was producing exactly the sort of development that RDI told me I should expect to see. So I was excited to hear that the new, improved and more easily understood Operating System 3.0 was going to be unveiled. I watched the listserv faithfully for reports from the conference. I began to read exciting scraps of information about the new system, and then began following a discussion thread about the high cost of RDI, the limiting of information on 3.0 to consultants, and the exclusion of those who are unable to pay high consulting fees. That's when I got discouraged. I read comments that suggested things like:  The only people who are  really  doing RDI are those who are working with consultants. Those working without consultants are probably doing it wrong. They may believe they are seeing results, but they are probably not. They don't know what to look for, so they are seeing what they want to see. In fact, they may actually be doing more harm than good. The unwritten tacit subtext that I walked away with was this:  Are you really saying that your child is not worth the money? Again, nobody actually said it. It was probably my own guilty feelings that filled in the empty space. And the comments on the listserv were not made by Gutstein or Sheely - they were made by parents or consultants (the latter of whom clearly have an interest in limiting access and maintaining the status quo.) Here's the thing. RDI is expensive. If I thought that working with a consultant and paying the extraordinarily high cost would make a  significant  difference in my ability to implement the RDI philosophy, I would try to find a way to do it. I'm not sure what we would do - refinance the house? max out the credit cards? But, without knowing whether or not working with a consultant would really make a significant difference in the effectiveness of the work I'm already doing, it's hard to think about putting my family in that kind of financial peril. I'd love to have an opportunity to work short-term with a consultant to try to get a sense of how far off I am in the work I'm already doing -  Is Bud really making the kind of progress I think he's making? Am I doing more harm than good?  I mean, before I hire someone else to make my chocolate chip cookies, I want to know if she's going to tell me that I've been trying to make chocolate chip cookies with molasses and cinnamon, or if she's just going to suggest that I add a pinch more salt. But that's not how the two consultants within driving distance of my house work. I had started down the path in working with one, but pulled out when my sixth-mommy-sense said \"this is not the right person for us.\" The fact was, before she had even spent a moment in Bud's presence, before I had any indication of her style, her talent, or her ability to connect with Bud, I was expected to sign a contract hiring her for the \" RDA \" assessment and three months of contract service; in effect, I would be agreeing to pay several thousand dollars to a stranger, without any sense of how much difference this person would actually make to my son. So I'm discouraged. But, really, I still love RDI. I love that it's designed to help Bud become a more flexible thinker, a broadband communicator who can \"read\" a situation by taking in and making sense of several streams of information simultaneously. And I really do think that the work I'm doing without a consultant is making a difference. Last night my husband was upstairs listening to music and I wanted to let him know that supper was ready. I stood at the bottom of the stairs and shouted his name. He didn't answer. I shouted his name again. From the next room I heard Bud shout to me, \"He can't hear you!\" I walked into the room where Bud was. \"I think you're right, Bud. Poor Daddy. He doesn't know that supper is ready.\" \"I can go talk it him,\" Bud said. No big deal, right? Wrong. That brief 20-second interaction involved Bud attending to, interpreting and responding to an extraordinary amount of information. In rapid succession, and often simultaneously, Bud had to think: Mom is shouting Dad's name because she wants to tell him that supper is ready. Dad is not answering her because he can't hear her. Mom is still shouting Dad's name because she doesn't know that he can't hear her. Mom's plan is not working. I know this, and Mom does not. This information would be helpful to Mom.  I would like to be helpful to Mom. I will give Mom this information. Dad still doesn't know that supper is ready. If Dad doesn't know that supper is ready, he won't come downstairs to eat. Dad will be sad if he doesn't get to eat supper. Mom doesn't want Dad to be sad. Mom wants Dad to be happy. I want Dad to be happy.  Eating supper will make Dad happy. If Dad knows that supper is ready, he will come downstairs to eat. Mom does not have another plan for letting Dad know that supper is ready. Going upstairs and telling Dad that his supper is ready is another plan. I could go upstairs and tell Dad that supper is ready. I could be helpful to Mom and Dad. That would make Mom and Dad happy. I would like Mom and Dad to be happy.  Mom doesn't know that I have come up with another plan in which I can be helpful and make them happy. I will tell her. Flexible thinking. Intersubjectivity. Social coordination. Dynamic intelligence. Regulation and repair. Relational information processing. Broadband communication. This may not  technically  be RDI we're doing, but I have to think that whatever it is, it's a very good thing.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/07/rdi_is_like_mag.html", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/", "http://coloring-outside-the-lines.blogspot.com/2006/08/rdi-in-earnest.html", "http://morethanalabel.blogspot.com/2006/04/rdi.html", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/RDI/2dayIntro-Parents.asp", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/resources/viewResource.asp?pid=200", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/resources/viewResource.asp?pid=6", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/resources/viewResource.asp?pid=79", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/resources/viewResource.asp?pid=21", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/RDI/ongoing.asp"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/08/renegade-rdi.html", "title": "\nRenegade RDI\n"},

Not a book about autism; a book about a woman. Autism is an important character in this novel, but it plays a supporting role. Autism is the device upon which the plot turns. The star of the novel is Melanie, mother of two, whose husband, unable to deal with the reality of having and raising an \"imperfect\" son, walks out on his family and moves in with his ex-girlfriend. Leimbach's writing is rich and full; she creates in Melanie a character with intelligence, wit, and limitless strength, full of flaws, insecurities and fearful desperation. Melanie and I are both autism mothers, but I did not see myself in her; our lives, our families, our sons, our perspectives are different. But I did see  her , very clearly - enough to wish that she weren't a fictional character so that she could be my friend. Daniel, too, is a supporting character, though without doubt the most endearing one in the book. I fell in love with him during a scene in which he visits a shoe store with his mother, covets a pair of little girls' party shoes with sparkling buckles, and encounters a saleswoman who insists that the shoes with buckles are for girls.  Only  girls. Leimbach writes, Along the wall of the shop is a pretty display of pink shelves, interspersed with Barbie logos and pictures of blond dolls. In this decorated world of carnation pink lie the shoes that Daniel wants. He sees this. He understands what the woman is reporting. Language is no longer lost on his ears. And so he goes to the dinosaur display on the boys' side of the shop and removes some of the shoes there, those big greenish-black shoes with heavy treads and prehistoric monsters in holographs on the straps, and takes them to the girls' side. He swaps the dinosaur shoes for the pretty patent-leather pumps with the buckles, the ones he so desperately wants. \"Excuse me, could you  do  something?\" says the saleslady pointedly. But I am fascinated by what I see before me. How Daniel knows what the trouble is, how he has been separated from his desired object by means of his gender. It seems to him a simple thing to switch the decorations. To make the shoes with the heavy tread and Velcro part of the world of girls and Barbie, and embed the sacred buckled pumps into the masculine surround of dinosaurs and jungle grass. How can you help but fall in love with this clever boy and his creative attempts at problem-solving? As the scene continues, the saleslady scolds Daniel and reaches to snatch the pumps away from him. He bites her on the hand. Melanie reacts quickly: she buys the shoes and lets him wear them home.

At the end of the day, Nana waited for Bud at the side door of the classroom, where he is dismissed to us early so that he can avoid the hubbub of the crowd at dismissal time. Bud bounded out the door as his aide reported on his fabulous day, then he returned unprompted to the classroom to shout \"Goodbye, Mrs. Parker. Thank you, Mrs. Parker. I had a great day!\" Several of his classmates overheard him, and rushed over to say goodbye. Kelly flew outside first and threw her arms around him as he leaned in for her hug. She returned to the classroom and a moment later our morning friend Molly came out. \"Bye, Bud!\" she said, eyeing him, and then backing up slowly as Bud's  old friend Sophie  appeared. \"Bye, Bud! See you on Monday!\" Sophie said, wrapping him in her arms. \"See you Monday,\" he replied happily. Then Molly, emboldened as she watched this scene unfold, approached Bud while Sophie returned to the classroom, and she too gave him a big hug and wished him a good weekend before skipping back inside. It may be that Bud is becoming a ladies' man. My hunch, though, is that he has developed a bond with some classmates who have a strong mothering gene and who are seeking him out to care for him, nurture him, and encourage him. I already knew that Bud was in  good hands ; I just had no idea that the hands came in so many different sizes.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/09/smaller-hands-people.html", "title": "\nThe smaller hands people\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 30, 2006", "body": "\nI'm bumping the  threat level  back down to blue. Today was the first day of first grade. Bud and I woke around 5:15, which gave us plenty of time to get ready to be out the door by 7:30. For most of the morning, Bud was upbeat and positive; he sang several verses of \"To School We Go\" from the  Blue Takes You To School  Blues Clues DVD. He even posed for first-day-of-school pictures. His anxiety surfaced when it was time to leave the house. He'd been watching an episode of Clifford's Puppy Days in which Jorge the dog was nervous about a visit to the grooming shop. Bud echoed Jorge all the way out to the car: \"I don't want to gooooooooooo!\" His anxiety escalated again when we arrived at school and saw the swarms of parents and children streaming into the building. I made the mistake of parking near the front entrance, which left us no other choice but joining the swarm. \"I don't want to go,\" said Bud as I helped him out of the car. \"I know, sweetie, \" I said. \"But it will be okay.\" \"It will be okay,\" he echoed, adding the promise he hears me make so often: \"If it's too crowded, we can leave.\" \"It will be crowded,\" I said. \"But then all the moms and dads will leave, and it will just be kids and teachers. Then it won't be crowded anymore.\" \"And you will stay with me,\" he added, \"so it's okay.\" \"No, I'll need to leave with the other moms and dads. But I will be back when school is over and it's time to go home.\" He knew all of this. This was not news to him. The reminder may have been comforting for him. It was not comforting for me; my heart broke a little more with every word we spoke. We walked through the hallway, Bud a pace or two behind me, being pulled along quietly by the hand. He stopped when we reached the classroom door and announced more boldly, \"I don't want to go! I don't want  you  to go!\" I pushed him into the classroom, which was already bustling with happy children and excited parents. I heard \"Hi, Bud!\" and turned to see that  Clay  was greeting him, but keeping his distance and giving Bud space. Bud stared at the ground and I could see that he was starting to get overwhelmed. I knew that we needed to get the transition portion of the morning over as quickly as possible.  Mrs. Parker  spotted us and came right over. I kissed Bud and told him that I'd see him soon, then walked out quickly as Mrs. Parker led Bud to his cubby. My throat tightened as I made my way back through the school. I marveled at the parents who filled the hallways, chatting, laughing, and snapping pictures as though this was not the most difficult day of their lives. As I approached the exit I saw Miss Josephs, Bud's former classroom aide, who took one look at my swimming eyes and gave me a hug. \"Can you check on him?\" I croaked. \"I'm afraid it might be harder for him if he saw me,\" she said. I knew she was right. I walked out the door feeling crushed under the weight of alone-ness. I wondered if Bud felt it too. I made it to the car before I burst into tears. I enjoyed a good, therapeutic cry all the way to my office. As soon as I got to my desk I picked up the phone to call the school, thinking that maybe somebody from the special ed team could make sure he was okay. The inclusion coordinator answered, and with my voice breaking I squeaked out my request: \"Could somebody just go check on him?\" \"I was just there,\" she said. \"Mrs. Parker is giving the class an introduction. Bud is walking around the classroom, but he's listening. He's not upset. He's doing just fine.\" I felt the tension start to ease as the picture I'd imagined of a hysterical, abandoned Bud disappeared. Feeling a little braver, I headed off to a meeting. When I returned two hours later, there was a message on my voice mail from his speech pathologist. \"I just wanted to give you a good-news report,\" she said. \"He just came in from recess. He had fun outside and made a smooth transition back to the classroom. He's doing really well.\" About an hour later there was another voice mail on my phone, this time from his case manager: \"I just passed the classroom. He's eating his snack, looking around, and smiling. I caught Mrs. Parker's eye and she gave me a thumbs-up. He's doing great.\" A few minutes ago, Mrs. Parker called. The children were in the art room, and she wanted to call to let me know what a fantastic day Bud was having. \"He is exceeding my wildest dreams,\" she said. \"He's spent time at his desk, he's been writing, he's using spontaneous language, he's making eye contact, he's connecting well with the classroom aide. The day could not have gone better.\" The alone-ness feeling is gone; we are in  good hands . They get it. They're invested. They're on it. It's working. He's having a great day. I can't imagine a better  birthday  present.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/08/good-hands-people.html", "title": "\nThe good hands people\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, August 12, 2006", "body": "\nWe've been easing Bud into the transition to first grade slowly. As his Kindergarten year ended, his  teacher  found opportunities for him to visit his first-grade classroom. His new teacher, Mrs. Parker, created opportunities to interact with him. Over the summer we've started name-dropping the children who will be in his class (which took on even greater significance when we saw  Sophie  in the grocery store and she gave us the insider scoop on the make-up of first grade classrooms.) Bud seems to be ready to make the move. He talks about going to first grade, about Mrs. Parker, and about his new classmates, which thankfully include Sophie and  Clay , who is returning to our district. He's chosen a new backpack, a new pencil case, and a new water bottle. He knows it's coming and seems happy enough about it. It seems that the gods of pupil placement have once again smiled upon us, and we are quickly learning that Mrs. Parker is another  dream-come-true teacher . She called me last week because she thought it might be a good idea for her to get together briefly with Bud once a week this month to build his comfort and familiarity with her before the school year starts. She'd be leaving soon for a long weekend, she said, but perhaps we could drop by the classroom for a visit? Or she could stop by our house if I thought that might be easier for him. Oh, and while she had me on the phone, she was hoping to get my ideas about how she might be able to create a comfortable corner in the room where Bud could go when he needed a break or needed to be alone for a while. And did I think it would be a good idea to leave some space at the back of the classroom where he could get up and walk around during the activities that had the children seated for long periods of time? Dream. Come. True. My hunch was that visiting the classroom would be easier than having Mrs. Parker come to our house, since seeing people out of context can be  dysregulating  for Bud. So we set up a time, and Bud talked eagerly about the visit. We decided to bring  dancing bear  with us to show Mrs. Parker our fabulous creation. We were prepared. But as we drove to the school Bud's anxiety began to build; by the time we got to classroom he had firmly decided that he would  not  be visiting Mrs. Parker today. I got him into the classroom, but he refused to engage with Mrs. Parker, refused to look at the books on the shelf, refused to look at the calendar she was hanging. He cried real tears, shouted loud shouts, and said he had to go home. We visited for a stress-filled ten minutes. By the end of it, Bud was puffy and blotchy and tear-soaked; I was knotted and tense and sweat-stained. But Mrs. Parker was cool and breezy and upbeat, and acted as though we'd just brought her cupcakes. She cheerfully kept her distance and even seemed sincere when she told us how wonderful it had been to have us visit. She sent us on our way with some pictures of the classroom and her home address, just in case Bud would like to send her a letter in the mail. She even reminded us to come back again next week. Bud's usual calm demeanor had returned by the time we got home and I transferred him to Nana so that I could return to work for the rest of the day. I kissed him before I left and as he headed up the stairs to play he said, \"Thanks, Mom. That was fun.\" \"It was  fun , Bud?\" I asked, following him. We sat together on a step halfway up. \"Yes,\" he said. \"What do you think of Mrs. Parker?\" \"She's good.\" \"I thought she was nice, too. She wants you to visit again next week.\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you  want  to visit again next week?\" \"Yes.\" I remain in awe of that child. Today Bud mailed a letter to Mrs. Parker. He composed it on the computer by himself. It says: Der mis prker I liek horn moeosik Iliek read er rabbit Luv bud Horn music and Reader Rabbit: I guess now they have something to talk about during the next visit. But just to be safe... maybe I ought to bring along some actual cupcakes this time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/08/first-grade-second-thoughts.html", "title": "\nFirst grade, second thoughts\n"},

He has rarely slept past 5:00 in the past several weeks. He's often been up at 4:00. He started one day at 2:30 a.m. - and so, of course, did I. So you can imagine my frustration when yesterday I was awoken, not by a six-year-old climbing on my head, but by the ear-splitting crows of my neighbor's rooster assaulting me through the open bedroom window. I live in a rural area now, but I didn't grow up in the country. I grew up in a city, and my knowledge of roosters was limited to what I read in storybooks. I have since discovered that what I learned about roosters in storybooks is pure myth. In storybooks, roosters always do the same thing: they crow a rousing \"Cock-a-doodle-doo\" when the sun comes up. And then they, and everybody else on the farm, quietly go about their daily business. This is not so with real-life roosters. In real life, roosters crow an annoyingly loud \"ERR-ERR-ERR-ERR-ERRRRRRR\" at the first glimmer of dawn, long before the sun is actually over the horizon. Then they continue to ERRRRRRR until the sun goes down again, which in the summer months is an extraordinarily long period of time. Sometimes they take breaks. Sometimes they don't. Yesterday, the neighbor's rooster started to ERRRRRR around 5:00 a.m. I woke and was astounded to find that Bud was sleeping soundly next to me. With a heart full of gratitude, I rolled over for what I hoped would be another hour of sleep. I closed my eyes and ERR-ERR-ERR-ERR-ERRRRRRR ERR-ERR-ERR-ERR-ERRRRRRR ERR-ERR-ERR-ERR-ERRRRRRR ERR-ERR-ERR-ERR-ERRRRRRR 40 minutes. Nonstop. At the end of 40 minutes, the rooster either collapsed from exhaustion or was shot by another disgruntled neighbor. Either way, it was finally quiet enough for me to go back to sleep. And that's when I heard it. Not quite as loud. Nowhere near as annoying. But equally persistent, and this time at close range: \" When will Daddy be home ?\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/07/up-with-roosters.html", "title": "\nUp with the roosters\n"},

He loves to play with water balloons, with watering cans, in puddles, in the rain, with a sink full of water, in the bathtub, in pools, near streams, at the lake; Bud has never met a body of water he didn't like. This weekend we made our annual trip to the ocean so Bud could ride the waves of the frosty Atlantic. Despite the high temperatures, the ocean breeze was chilly and the water was so cold that the only souls brave enough to actually submerge themselves appeared to be under the age of 13. I stood with the other cowardly parents shivering on the shore, feeling intrepid when the waves crashed over our feet. We were there at high tide, and between the thunder of the crashing waves and the roar of the winds whipping off the water it was impossible to hear much of anything. So I watched Bud and the other children around him as they starred in their own silent movie. Each child was in a world of his own, engaged in a struggle of kid vs. nature, some armed with boogie boards, some preferring to take on the waters with only their bare bellies for armor. They each crashed into the waves, the water splashing into their faces and over their heads, and then sprang to their feet, startled by the cold, talking rapidly to themselves, shaking their arms and flapping their hands, hopping and staggering to warm themselves, then turning around to start again. It's funny: so many parents of autistic children talk about their hope that someday their child will be indistinguishable from other children. But as I watched Bud bobbing and weaving with the other children in that magical land of Atlantis it struck me: here, they have all become indistinguishable from him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/07/great-equalizer.html", "title": "\nThe great equalizer\n"},

One line, over and over and over. Of course, he's not watching one line of Pinky Dinky Doo exclusively. He's also watching one line of Dora the Explorer: \"It's time for the pinata!\" And one line of Max and Ruby: \"La, la, la - HICCUP! - excuse me, Louise.\" And one line of... well, you get the point. This is not the same sort of \"productive rewinding\" that  I've seen him do in the past . This is a more manic perseveration that is building upon itself, spiraling to a place that's beyond Bud's control. It's behavior I've seen before; it's strikingly similar to the reaction Bud recently had to the  video camera , and once again it's made me think of a comment that I heard RDI founder Dr. Steve Gutstein make about  video games . He said that it's important to expose children with autism to the same things you would any other child, \"except video games. Video games are like heroin to kids with autism.\" And that's the image that keeps coming to mind as I watch Bud hit the rewind button on the  miper : heroin. He can't stop. Even if he wanted to - and I'm not sure that he'd want to - I don't think that he could resist the urge to rewind just  one more time . I keep re-reading the  comment  that  Zilari  made when I wrote about this before: My parents used to tell me, \"If you get upset when you're doing something you think is fun, you have to stop\". And if I ended up getting upset or at a point where I couldn't stop, then I wouldn't get to do the \"fun thing\" for a while. I also remember having very strong feelings not only of liking something a whole lot, but wanting to continue liking that thing, and getting edgy when the thing started to not have quite the same appeal.  Over time I have learned to alternate perseverations a bit, and keep an eye open for new things on the horizon that have the potential to be just as interesting. The \"brain stickiness\" is always there and is something I would never want to lose because I do think it lends tremendous, awesome, all-encompassing depth to experiences. But fun is supposed to be fun, and when it's not fun anymore, that is indeed a sign that it is time to take a break. I don't think it's fun for Bud anymore. So I'm taking Zilari's advice and I'm telling Bud that it's time to take a break from the miper. I'm not cutting him off completely, as I did with the video camera - not yet, anyway. But when he picks up the miper I give him a ten-minute warning: ten minutes with the miper, then it's time to choose a show to watch. Luckily, we're also cultivating an alternate perseveration that seems to delight Bud even more than time with the miper: water balloons. We stand at the sink together: I fill small balloons with water and Bud  counts  them as we put them in a shopping bag. Then he carries the bag very carefully into the yard and hurls the balloons at the garage, one or two at a time, until they break. Some balloons smash right away, little fireworks of water streaming across the garage door. Others prove more challenging, bouncing away and rolling down the driveway as Bud chases them in his bare feet. Once all of the small balloons have burst we head back inside and fill a really big balloon, then we head back to the driveway for a grand finale in which Bud drops the balloon to the ground and the water splashes our feet and he dances in the puddle as it streams toward the street. I have to say, I'm enjoying Bud's passion for water balloons. It's certainly a welcome break from the intensity of the miper. And it's a show I don't mind watching again and again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.thomaspages.org/bloggg/index.php/site/ever_see_a_playstation_fly/", "http://partprocessing.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/07/miped-out.html", "title": "\nMiped out\n"},

He was already  in our bed  by the time it started, around 2:00 a.m. And this episode was particularly aggressive - full-body sneezes that shook the ground in rapid fire, again, again, again, and filled Kleenex after Kleenex after Kleenex.

Bud has actually come a long way from his  early dental visits  and usually greets the news of a check-up with enthusiasm because he knows that it will end with a very cool toy being produced from the trunk of my car. (Yes, I know this is bribery, but it is  effective  bribery... though I'm afraid it means I'm going to have to buy him a pony the first time he has to get a cavity filled.) His visit six months ago was glorious. He had a full dental exam and cleaning without a moment of anxiety. In retrospect, I think that the hygenist for that visit was just a good match for him - she read his cues, she used the right language, and everything clicked. On Friday Bud had another check-up and though this hygenist was nice and patient and slow, the same magic didn't happen. Bud let the hygenist (the \"mother dentist\") examine his teeth, but balked when it was time for her to clean them. I think she just used too many words, asked too many questions, and gave him choices about thing that confused him. The turning point was when she starting discussing toothpaste flavors with him - \"You can have mint, orange, bubble gum, grape...\" - and his anxiety began to build. She told him she would use \"the bubble gum,\" and I think he believed she was going to brush his teeth with actual bubble gum. Bubble gum is an unknown to Bud, and he just decided he didn't want his teeth cleaned after all. My anxiety began to build at that point as well, and I realized that it was heightened by the horrible music blaring from the radio on the shelf beside my head. That's when I remembered that I had Bud's iPod in my bag. In the midst of the \"I don't want bubble gum, I want MY toothpaste!\" rebuttal, I slipped the headphones over Bud's ears, and he settled right down. The hygenist cleaned his teeth (with her bubble gum toothpaste, but a regular low-tech toothbrush), and Bud didn't protest at all when the dentist (the \"father dentist,\" that is) came in to do the final inspection. I made mental notes to myself so that for his next visit I'll 1) slip a note to the hygenist ahead of time giving her a few helpful hints about what to say and how to say it, and 2) make sure he has his iPod in place from the start. I'm certain that Bud will look forward to his next visit as well.

{"date": "Saturday, June 10, 2006", "body": "\nThanks to  Mrs. H , we've had a pretty amazing \"a ha!\" regarding Bud's recent behavior. Several months ago, there was a staffing change in Bud's classroom. The classroom aide who'd been there during the fall left, and was replaced by Miss Josephs, a warm, soft-spoken, child-focused assistant. She is precisely the sort of person to whom Bud is usually drawn. To my surprise, though Bud has clearly had warm regard for her, he's kept an invisible wall between himself and Miss Josephs. She has respected his need for some distance, but has spent time and energy trying to make connections with him. This week, everything changed. Bud has been tripping over himself in his effusive proclamations of love for Miss Josephs. At school he has been her constant (and adoring) companion. At home, he talks about what he's done with her and what they'll do together next. Tonight he told me, \"I go for a walk with Mom and say 'Surprise, Miss Josephs!' and that will cheer Miss Josephs up!\" We've all been scratching our heads wondering what has prompted this rapid change of heart. Then yesterday, Mrs. H read my  recent post  about Bud's fascination with the new  Sesame Beginnings  DVD, and wrote me this e-mail: Hi there - I've been thinking about the New Beginnings post. Miss Josephs has been asking me \"why now\" questions in regard to the undying show of affection Bud has showered upon her the past two days. She insists that she has done nothing new, or changed her behavior towards him lately. (Although she has always been sweet and quiet spoken.) These behaviors do seem like they had come out of the blue, and there seemed to be \"something\" to it there that I couldn't name; so my response was - \"Enjoy it, you two have a great connection now.\"  However, as I read the blog about the Sesame Street DVDs, I can't help but replay the scripts, voices, actions, and mannerisms he uses toward Miss Josephs. For lack of any other analogy - it's almost... Mothering? Nurturing? I can't find the expression. It does feel like that \"love affair\" stage that a younger child might establish with a caregiver. You should see the facial interplay...it's not the same kind of coy \"flirting\" that he had done with me at first, and then with  others . This is an \"open face\", \"eye to eye\" exchange. With all the RDI work that you have been doing at home, and the bit that we try here - it does feel like a passage into some new territory.  It seems that  Sesame Beginnings  is doing more for Bud than I first thought. Yes, he enjoys watching the interactions between babies and caregivers. But somehow, it seems that he  recognizes  it so much - it resonates so well with him - that it has given him the confidence to strike out on his own into previously unexplored terrain. For the first time, he is establishing a relationship not simply by responding to cues, but also by sending them. He is initiating relationship, inviting it, nurturing it. And he's in love with the feeling it has inspired. In his book  Solving the Relationship Puzzle , Steve Gutstein introduces the RDI model and talks about the need for children to be able to move past the skills they learn in the \"lab\" to be able to apply them in real-life situations. He writes, Generalization, the desire and ability to use relational skills outside of treatment settings, is a critical step, akin to taking a product from the lab and \"field testing\" it. In our model, it involves gradually expanding the complexity of the relational field, by having the child work with different partners, increasing numbers of people, adding peers, increasing flexibility and teaching the child to be a co-creator of new activities. It seems that Bud is in the midst of his very first field test - and the early results are extraordinarily promising.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1885477708/qid=1149990427/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-0643133-9896931?s=books&v=glance&n=283155"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/06/field-experience.html", "title": "\nField experience\n"},

I've been thinking about it mostly because this week Mrs. H's father-in-law, \"Gramps,\" passed away very suddenly. I didn't know him, but he's been on my mind. His obituary was in the paper today, and it mentioned a lot of wonderful things about him: he was a family man, a singer in the church choir, a craftsman, a volunteer, a veteran - a much-loved man who will be deeply missed. What I've been thinking about is his hat. At some point in his life, Gramps had a tweed hat. I don't know how long he had it, nor how often he wore it. I don't know if he would have recognized it as his own if he'd come across it last week. But somewhere along the line, he gave the hat to his daughter-in-law, Mrs. H, the woman who has been such an  extraordinary presence  in Bud's life this year, who has taught us both so much, and who is living and working in our town, it seems, because this is the town where Gramps summered for many years, and the place he chose to retire. Mrs. H brought his tweed hat to her Kindergarten classroom and put it in the dress-up area. And Bud found it. Bud wore Gramps's tweed hat almost every day this year. Perhaps it was the sensory input of the heavy tweed weighing down on his head that helped Bud feel anchored, and allowed him to use his hands for something other than covering his ears. Maybe it was because the hat reminded him of the one worn by Sesame Street's  Sherlock Hemlock . Maybe the hat  smelled  like a grandfather and reminded Bud of his own beloved Papa. Whatever the reason, Gramps's hat became a  touchstone  for Bud this year. It grounded him; it helped him feel safe. He never asked to take it home with him, the way he did so many other beloved items in the classroom. To the contrary, at the end of every school day Bud happily returned the hat to its shelf in the dress-up area, its mission accomplished for the day. It's hard to imagine Bud's year without Gramps's hat. It's impossible to imagine it without Mrs. H. And I think we were lucky enough to have both in our life because of Gramps. So this week I've been thinking of him fondly, and I've been feeling sad about his death. I didn't know him... but he changed my life.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sherlock_Hemlock"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/06/ripples.html", "title": "\nRipples\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 13, 2006", "body": "\nIn retrospect, Friday should have been Bud's last day of school. That sort of thing is always so much easier to see in retrospect, isn't it? And there it is, clear as day from this vantage point: Friday was the last \"regular\" school day, when routines were the same and the flow of the day was predictable. But I'm always afraid to set low expectations for Bud, to assume that \"he couldn't possibly\" or \"he would just never.\" And so we ventured forth into these final two days; I tried to prepare him for the out-of-the-ordinary activities that would end the school year, and I hoped for the best. Yesterday his class had a very low-key \"end of the year celebration,\" in which parents were invited to come in for the last half hour, hear the children sing a song, and then eat some cake. No big deal, no high stakes, no pressure. Mrs. H, Miss Josephs and I had talked about Bud's level of participation in the singing portion of the program, and I assumed that one of three things would happen: 1. Bud would sit with Miss Josephs and the other children and listen as they sang, 2. Bud would sit with Miss Josephs and the other children and play the bongos as they sang, or 3. Bud would sit in the audience with us. I didn't consider the fourth option: Bud would pace the classroom, furiously scripting something about going with Mom and watching the kids from his apartment building, as the parents arrived. He would get more agitated upon seeing me, and would burst into tears when he learned that we would not, in fact, be going to our apartment building (since we do not  live  in an apartment building). Bud would sit in the hallway with Mom and Dad, sobbing loudly, while the other children sang. Guess which one happened? A clear-thinking person would chalk that up as a learning experience and exit the school year gracefully at that point, don't you think? But not me. I didn't want Bud to miss the last day of school's \"Fun Day.\" It was a lovely school-wide celebration with music, games, and a bounce house for the Kindergarteners. But it was just too much for Bud. I was there with him again - and again, he wanted to go to his apartment building. For the first hour or so, the other children made crafts while Bud registered his protest in shrieks and bellows: \"No! You can't make a necklace!\" Things got better once the activity moved outside. He made it through the whole afternoon by seeking out activities after other children had abandoned them. He spent most of his time at the sponge relay site, where the other children used sponges to transport water from one bucket to another. Bud used the sponges to transport water from one bucket to his head. But he  did  bounce in the bounce house when one of the girls in his class took him by the hand and invited him in. And he did enjoy his ice cream, even though he insisted that we take his ice cream back to the classroom instead of eating outside with everyone else. The fact is, he did a lot better at Fun Day than I did. I was tense and anxious for the duration of the seems-like-four-days-but-is-really-just-three-hours event. My dysregulation was heightened by the fact that when I arrived I was handed a \"Fun Day Volunteer\" t-shirt - bright yellow, at least two sizes too big, and so long that it covered my shorts and made me look like some kind of miscreant creeping around the schoolyard with no pants on. It was only when I got home, my knees still wobbly and my shoulders still knotted with anxiety, that my husband pointed out the irony in the shirt I was wearing and I was able to have a good laugh about it: You can't make this stuff up. So, Bud's Kindergarten year ended more with a shriek than a bang, and I've made mental notes so that  next  year we will plan differently for these year-end events: scale back expectations, plan an escape route or two, get a smaller t-shirt or wear long pants. But, of course, you never can predict these things - sometimes you plan for the worst and get the best. Sometimes you just have to grit your teeth, get through it, and hope that later on you'll be able to find the humor in it. One thing is certain: nothing can diminish the fact that this was an extraordinary year for Bud. And that's a fact that remains the same no matter what your vantage point.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/06/hindsight-foresight-and-insight.html", "title": "\nHindsight, foresight, and insight\n"},

Tell me about apple.\" I respond with something like, \"Apples are crunchy and they grow on trees. Now you tell  me  about apples.\" Then Bud says something like, \"Apple is red and to eat.\" Then he moves on to B. Anyway, in the particular script we were using that day, E was for eggplant. When instructed to tell about eggplant, I waxed poetic about the joy of parmigiana. I turned the conversation over to Bud, and he said \"Eggplant is in Babaganoush.\" (I credit  Grover  with Bud's knowledge of this, incidentally.) \"That's right,\" I said. \"Eggplant  is  in Babaganoush!\" \"Babaganoush!\" Bud sang. \"Babaganoush!\" I sang back.

You know those sounds you hear when your child is in a different room - the ones that tell you that something is going on that probably shouldn't be? Sometimes they come in the form of bangs and crashes. Other times your radar is triggered by a long period of silence. These are not the sounds that scream \"danger\" and make you run to your child before your brain has even registered the reason for your movement. They are the sounds that say \"mischief,\" the sounds that say \"you better give your boy a shout-out so  he  knows that  you  know that something is going on.\" Bud always responds to the shout-out, and his responses are becoming increasingly sophisticated. He doesn't respond  truthfully , of course; I never get responses like \"I'm just dumping all my toys into the middle of the room,\" or \"I'm trying to play the drum with my feet,\" or \"I've stripped down naked and am sitting in the empty bathtub with shampoo in my hair.\" No, Bud's responses are far more thoughtful than that: he tells us what he thinks we want to hear.

{"date": "Monday, June 05, 2006", "body": "\nBud is \"a child with the diagnosis of autism.\" Bud is \"a child with the label of autism.\" Bud \"is on the spectrum.\" Bud \"has autism.\" Bud \"is autistic.\" These are some of the ways that I've heard parents and professionals talk about children. I've used many of them myself. In some ways I can use them to trace my thinking about Bud's autism. When Bud was initially diagnosed, I viewed autism as \"other\" - an interloper, a roadblock, an obstacle. I saw it as something to take care of and to get rid of as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Later, I began to see autism as a part of Bud (and not apart from him). I saw it as a small part, but a significant part. I'd read about the importance of using \"person first\" language - \"people who use wheelchairs\" instead of \"the handicapped;\" \"people living with AIDS\" instead of \"AIDS patients\" - and so I incorporated \"My son has autism\" into my vocabulary and used it the same way I'd use \"My son has a head cold.\" But as I came to understand Bud better, I learned that his autism is not like a head cold. It is not one small part of him. It infuses every part of him and it shapes who he is in this world. It makes some things terribly difficult for him. It makes other things laughably easy. About that time, I read \u201c Why I Dislike Person-First Language ,\u201d written by Jim Sinclair, who is autistic. Sinclair makes a persuasive argument against the use of person-first language when referring to autistic people. One of the several cases that he makes struck me deeply: Saying \"person with autism\" suggests that autism is something bad--so bad that is isn't even consistent with being a person. Nobody objects to using adjectives to refer to characteristics of a person that are considered positive or neutral. We talk about left-handed people, not \"people with left-handedness,\" and about athletic or musical people, not about \"people with athleticism\" or \"people with musicality.\" We might call someone a \"blue-eyed person\" or a \"person with blue eyes,\" and nobody objects to either descriptor. It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative that suddenly people want to separate it from the person. I know that autism is not a terrible thing, and that it does not make me any less a person.  Over the past several months, as I've been experiencing this evolution in my thinking about Bud's autism, I have done a lot of thinking about the concept of \"cure.\" To be honest, I have never been particularly cure-focused either in my philosophy or in my actions. In a  post on Autism Vox  today, Kristina references a  New York Times Op-Ed piece  by Cammie McGovern about the fervor with which many parents seek \"total recovery\" for their autistic children. McGovern writes, When your child is initially diagnosed, you read the early bibles of hope: \"Let Me Hear Your Voice,\" \"Son-Rise\" and other chronicles of total recovery from autism. Hope comes from a variety of treatments, but the message is the same: If you commit all your time, your money, your family's life, recovery is possible. And who wouldn't do almost anything - mortgage a home, abandon a career or move to be closer to doctors or schools - to enable an autistic child to lead a normal life? Now, as the mother of a 10-year-old, I will say what no parents who have just discovered their child is autistic want to hear, but should, at least from one person: I've never met a recovered child outside the pages of those old books. Not that it doesn't happen; I'm sure it does. But it's extraordinarily rare and it doesn't happen the way we once were led to believe. As I read McGovern's essay I remembered that I own Catherine Maurice's  Let Me Hear Your Voice , the book she calls one of the \"early bibles of hope\". I can't remember if I bought it myself or if someone gave it to me. I know that I've had it for a long time. I also know that, despite the fact that I read books about autism and autistic children all the time, I have never read a single page of it. It wasn't a conscious decision, nor one that was philosophically or politically motivated; it just never felt like the right book to read. In fact, as I think about it now, I have only read one book in which a child appeared to \"recover\" - and I loathed the book. The books that spoke to me - the books that are  my  bibles of hope in the land of autism - are the ones in which the authors acknowledge their fears and struggles as they delight in their autistic children: Paul Collins's  Not Even Wrong ; Beth Kephart's  A Slant of Sun ; Charlotte Moore's  George and Sam . These are the parents I want to hang with; these are the children I long to know. At the same time, even though it's not one of my goals, \"cure\" is not a  fighting word  for me. There is much that is not known about autism; I've read a great deal of speculation that in the years to come, the thing we now know as \"autism\" will be seen as a great number of different, if related, conditions. It's plausible to me that there may be some conditions that are being called \"autism\" but that are not, in fact, autism as I know it. There may well be neurotypical children out there who are having reactions to foods or toxins that are manifesting in autistic-like characteristics; I simply don't believe that Bud is one of them. From his earliest moments, I knew that there was something different about Bud - not that there was something wrong with him; just that there was something different about him. As strange as it might sound, I began to have these inklings before Bud was even born. My  twin pregnancy  was high-risk and I was followed closely by perinatologists. As a result, in the later months of my pregnancy I always knew which baby was which, and where each was located in my belly. Consistently when we went out in public places - the mall, crowded parties, etc. - Bud's brother would get very excited, as though he was happy to be there. In contrast, Bud would try to wedge himself under my ribcage as though he was trying to get as far away as possible. When we had ultrasounds, Bud's brother would dive face-first toward the sensor and seemed to be saying \"Look at me!\" But Bud turned his back and tried to hide behind his brother, and seemed to be saying \"This is all too much for me.\" I have read that when one identical twin is autistic, the chances of the other being autistic are very high. Despite that, and though I will never know for sure, I believe that just as Bud has autism but not spina bifida, his brother would have had spina bifida but not autism. So what does all this mean? If I'm not trying to \"cure\" the autism, what am I trying to do? The analogy that's been buzzing around my brain in recent months is this: I'm trying to react the same way that I would if I knew that Bud was gay. He may well be gay - he probably won't know for several more years. I have no idea what the future might hold for him and what challenges he might face. Despite that, I need to do the best I can  right now  to help Bud lay the foundations that will serve him best, whatever his sexual orientation. It's not really a far-fetched analogy. We are not defined by our sexual orientations; at the same time, our sexual identities are important parts of who we are and they affect every aspect of our lives throughout our lives. Until 1973, homosexuality was listed in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . Many parents are still devastated when they learn that their children are gay, and they go to extreme lengths to try to \"cure\" them. Even less reactionary parents are often consumed with fear and anxiety as they contemplate their children's future: Will they ever marry? Will they have children of their own? Will they suffer harassment? Will people mistreat them? Will they experience discrimination?  Will they be happy? So now, before I know what the future will hold for Bud, there are things I need to help Bud learn: about love, about respect, about partnership, about self-esteem. As he gets older, I will need to help him learn the things that teenagers need to know. And then, ultimately, I will need to step aside and let him use the things he's learned. Or not use them. But if I learn that Bud is gay, I will never try to make him \"not gay.\" I will never suggest that he try to \"pass\" or that he keep his sexual orientation secret. I will not tell him that he should  try  dating a few girls, just to find out if he actually likes it. If Bud is gay, it will be because he is emotionally wired that way. And, similarly, I believe that Bud is autistic because he is cognitively wired that way. So I will not focus my energy on trying to make him \"not autistic.\" I won't teach him how to \"pass\" or keep his differences under wraps. But I  will  try to help him build the foundations that will serve him best as an autistic person in a largely neurotypical world - foundations of relationship, flexible thinking, broadband communication, mindfulness. And then, ultimately, I will need to step aside and let him use the things he's learned. Or not use them. My goal, I suppose, is to help Bud have options, to let him know that his life need not be driven by fear and limitations, nor by the prejudices of small-minded people. The goals from there? They'll be entirely up to him.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://web.archive.org/web/20060213160217/web.syr.edu/~jisincla/person_first.htm", "http://www.autismvox.com/mythologizing-recovery/#more-246", "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/05/opinion/05mcgovern.html", "http://www.autismvox.com/thems-fighting-words/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/06/revolutionary-parenting.html", "title": "\n(R)evolutionary parenting\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 05, 2006", "body": "\nWhen Bud started Kindergarten in August, he could write his name in block letters. With direction and effort he could make assorted other letters, but he avoided the process whenever he could. Throughout the school year, Bud has developed an increasing interest in  letters, reading, and making words . In March, he started clicking letters into the TiVo to record his favorite shows. That quickly progressed into typing favorite words into the computer. But this week I was astounded to see it evolve even further into handwriting. We've been playing a game recently in which I write out three-letter words and Bud sounds them out. He and I have both been thrilled with his success.  This weekend  we put a new spin on it when, after he sounded out the words, he copied them in chalk on the driveway. Later, he wanted to add another step. When I wrote a three-letter word, he took the pen from me and added a fourth letter: Then he read his new words loud and strong: \"Fixn!\" \"Tapa!\" That gave me an idea. I tried writing the first two letters of a word to see what Bud would do. That experiment yielded: \"Bib\"  (which was a surprise. I'd expected to see \"Big,\" as in \"Jack's Big Music Show.\") and \"Cat\" Cool. The next night, I thought we'd try to play the game again and I thought it would be wise to start with a word he'd already done, so I wrote \"ca\" expecting him to write a \"t\" or possibly an \"n.\" To my surprise, he wrote an \"i\" and then two lines that looked like the makings of a capital H.  He's not interested in playing tonight , I thought. But he kept writing. When he stopped, I looked at what he'd written:   Caillou.  The children's cartoon on PBS. Of course. He asked if he could do another. I wrote a \"t\", and he added: Teletubbies. Then to my \"b\" he added: Boohbah.  (Also on PBS, and by the creators of Teletubbies.) He got so excited by this new-found ability that he ran to get his prized Teletubbies CD so he could copy down some of the track listings: Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh. And he continued transcribing, song after song, diligently consulting the track listing and copying each letter on to his page: Lullaby. Dipsy's Fancy Hat. Animals. All penned by Bud's own hand. The finished products are remarkable, of course, but they weren't the highlights of this project. The highlights were Bud's enthusiasm, his confidence, his sense of competence, his pride; these were the things that showed me that this year in Kindergarten has been an  unqualified success . He's come so far so quickly. And he knows it. Way to go, Bud.

{"date": "Sunday, April 30, 2006", "body": "\nLatex balloons often make me think about the challenges of parenting a child with special needs, because they were one of the first indicators - very early on in my  parenting journey  - that there are an extraordinary number of fine points and details that parents of children with disabilities have to consider and plan carefully, that most other parents have the luxury of taking for granted. Several years ago, when I learned that I was carrying a child with spina bifida I tried to learn as much as I could about what my child's life would be like. I learned many things that, while difficult, were not surprising. But the first real surprise I got came in the form of balloons. Many people with spina bifida have extreme latex allergies, and for that reason it is recommended that parents of children with spina bifida keep latex away from their children from the start. (Our twins were delivered in a latex-free OR, and Bud and I stayed in a latex-free hospital room, despite the fact that, by then, it was no longer necessary.) Latex is in a lot of products new parents use every day - baby bottle nipples and pacifiers, diapers, rubber toys; it is also in balloons. Balloons - the colorful carefree symbol of childhood - could have been deadly to my children. Perhaps because the big picture was too overwhelming I found myself obsessing on this detail in both of my spina bifida pregnancies. But my obsession was short-lived, and those sweet babies are not with us. Shortly after we lost each of them my husband and I wrote messages on balloons and let them go, watching them drift high into the sky, in the hopes that our babies, no longer concerned about allergy or disability, would catch them. Perhaps in a bit of cosmic homage to his siblings, Bud is a balloon enthusiast. Latex, mylar, helium-filled or blown from the lungs - he loves them all. On any given day you can probably find a balloon somewhere in our house - a withered balloon tumble-weeding it's away around the living room, a wayward mylar balloon clinging to the rafters for weeks on end, a soggy-with-spit blob of deflated latex that Bud has been practicing with. So this morning when we went to the grocery store to buy the fixings for Daddy's special birthday dinner and Bud saw that the store was giving away balloons with their logo, he marched bravely to customer service and asked for one. When the woman at the counter discovered it was Daddy's birthday, she gave him a second one to take home to Dad. Bud held tightly to his balloons through the check-out and across the parking lot, then let them roam free in the car. One made it's way to the front and brushed my cheek while I drove, and I began thinking about our lost babies and our long and complicated history with balloons. When we got home, Bud raced in to show the balloons to Daddy, and we quickly tied each one to a lightweight plastic balloon anchor - heavy enough to keep them from flying away, light enough to let them bounce along, barely skimming the ground. All day long, the balloons caught my attention. Bud brought them outside with us, and they hovered as we ate our lunch at the picnic table. When we moved to the other side of the house to rake leaves and stack branches, they bobbed around the corner to find us. They joined us as we played catch with the big orange ball, and as Bud sounded out, then copied in writing, the words I wrote in chalk on the driveway: hat, can, big, sun, zip. Over and over, the balloons made me smile. They weren't connected to each other but they stayed together, propelled by the same invisible breezes. They looked like they were putting their heads together, comparing notes and sharing secrets. They made me think of my babies, and I was happy to have them along. When we finally moved indoors, Bud went upstairs with Dad to play on the computer and I headed to the kitchen to prepare the birthday feast. As I cooked, the balloons floated through together, paused for a while, then continued on their way. I wondered briefly if they'd come to the party, then quickly got back to the business at hand. After a great dinner it was time for cake and presents. As I got the cake ready, Bud ran into the kitchen and opened the drawer where we keep the aluminum foil. \"I need some help,\" he said. In his hand, he held a plastic purple star that he painted several years ago in preschool and that has been hanging in his room ever since. He wanted to wrap it to give it to his dad for his birthday. I tore a sheet of foil, and Bud wrapped the present tightly and asked for a bow. He stuck one on, then shook with glee as he presented the gift and watched Daddy gush over it. Then it was time for cake. We sang the  conga-line version  of the song (HAP-py-birth-day-dad-DY!\"), as has become the family tradition, and Bud \"helped\" Daddy blow out his many candles. I turned to get Dad's other presents, and when I looked back I saw that Bud had taken his two balloons and was balancing the balloon-anchors on the top of his dad's head. The anchors slipped down, and Dad wrapped one balloon string under each arm. He finished opening his presents with one balloon bouncing against each ear, and Bud dancing with giddiness at the sight. My heart has never felt more full. We spent the rest of the festivities watching Bud put treasured possessions into the bed of a big inflatable shoe, then present them to his Dad as additional birthday presents to \"open\": among other things, Bud's favorite toothpaste, his rubber duck, a Blues Clues video, and - the  piece de resistance  - a Teletubbies CD. I'm not sure if Daddy was more pleased to get them or Bud was more pleased to give them. Bud rounded out the evening by eating two bites of birthday cake - the actual cake, not just the frosting. It may not sound like much, but it is the first cake I have seen my six-year-old eat since the piece he had on his first birthday. Bathtime and bedtime went smoothly, all of us happily exhausted by a day full of sunshine, fresh air, presents and parties. The balloons, too, are starting to deflate. They are still hovering by the table, but are closer to the ground now, their helium spirit making a quiet exit after a busy day. That's the thing about helium balloons. They're not around very long, and they often leave before you're ready to see them go. But  these  helium balloons - these particular balloons on this particular day? I have a feeling they'll be with me for a long, long time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/04/my-beautiful-balloons.html", "title": "\nMy beautiful balloons\n"},

I imagine that McCartney will be barraged with I-told-you-so's in the coming weeks; the press and the public have rarely been kind with their comments about this marriage. But I have no I-told-you-so's to offer. Only sympathy. It can't be easy to be the \"new wife\", especially when the former wife had a fairy-tale romance and a rock-solid marriage with your husband. It can't be easy to  really  open yourself up again after 30 years in a rock-solid, fairy-tale relationship that ended in a devastating loss. It can't be easy to have your every move documented in words and photographs by total strangers who believe that your personal life makes good material for their blog posts. (Uh... sorry.) A year ago the press was full of speculation that the McCartneys had suffered a miscarriage several months into a pregnancy. They denied the rumor. On the other hand, just a couple of days ago they denied that their marriage was in trouble. I guess it's not fair of me to speculate. On the other hand, I know what it's like to  lose a child . I know the toll it can take on an individual and on a marriage. I know how hard it is to look into your partner's eyes and see your own pain and grief and sorrow reflected back and magnified. It's an extraordinary partnership that can withstand that kind of loss and make it through intact - and that's  without  being pursued by the paparazzi and the adoring public. So, no, there are no I-told-you-so's here - only warm thoughts and sincere wishes for healing, for comfort, and ultimately, for finding joy again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.paulmccartney.com/main.php"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/05/nothing-but-love-for-you-paul-and.html", "title": "\nNothing but love for you, Paul and Heather\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 07, 2006", "body": "\nA very quick and somewhat frantic update, in response to  Wendy's  most recent (and much-appreciated)  comment . This is a busy weekend for us, as we are about to embark on a three-day whirlwind of festivities to commemorate my parents' 50th wedding anniversary. Siblings, inlaws, cousins, and friends are flying in from hither and yon to join us and though we've done our best to prepare Bud for the onslaught and give him lots of options for opting-out, it's hard to know how it'll go. Here's how it started: Last night I left before bedtime to pick up my sister and her two kids, who were flying in at 10:00 p.m. Bud knew that they'd be here when he woke up. As I climbed into bed around 12:30 a.m. I could hear Bud in the next room talking (loudly and at length) in his sleep. It continued for about a half hour, at which point he woke up and climbed into our bed. The talking continued, though now he was wide awake (and so was I.) At 2:30 a.m. I gave him additional Melatonin and he fell into a very restless sleep, tossing and turning and kicking my husband mercilessly until 6:00 a.m. At that point, we all threw in the towel and got up. Bud was reluctant to greet his cousins. Instead, he pointed his  miper  at them, pressed a button and shouted \"Be gone!\" It didn't work. Luckily, my niece and nephew are older than Bud, understand him, and don't take those kinds of things personally. Bud eventually warmed up, especially when his cousin joined him (read: watched him) playing on the PBS Kids website. Then it was time for school. I was relieved. It would give Bud a break, and a brief return to his normal routine. Not quite. When I brought him to the classroom, his aide let me know that Mrs. H had a meeting at the end of the day and would not be there at pick-up time. The substitute teacher is a woman he knows well and likes very much, so I thought that though this would be a bump in the road of his day, it would likely be a very small bump. Warning: frost heave ahead. When I walked to the door of the school to pick him up I found a note directing me elsewhere. It seems there was a septic back-up of some sort and the Kindergarten classes - both of them - had been evacuated to the school library. I walked in to find most of the children sitting together, and Bud at the far end of the room, in fairly good spirits, but pacing and talking a mile a minute. I told him it was time to go home; he asked if he could hide in his room. I told him he could. We're home now. A handful of guests are here. The rest arrive in an hour. Bud's got the computer, the iPod, and the portable DVD player ready to roll. He's scoped out some hiding places. I'm just taking deep breaths and crossing my fingers. Wish us luck. And stay tuned...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://wencubhuy.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/04/into-fray.html", "title": "\nInto the fray\n"},

Giving  him every advantage means  taking  his perspective, trying to think a step ahead, and imagining how whatever it is that's coming might appear to him.

It seemed to be the same tired and rehashed minutiae I've come to expect from parenting magazines - limit screen time, don't  co-sleep  with your infant, buy our great new bubble bath. Then I got to the page titled Focus on Health, which featured three one-paragraph blurbs: the link between childhood television habits and adult obesity; the problems associated with lead paint; autism. Oh, autism! Let's have a read... DID YOU KNOW? Autism is now the third most common developmental disability in the U.S. By defining early predictors, researchers hope at-risk infants and toddlers will receive the early intervention that can potentially prevent the onset of autism. Visit kennedykrieger.org for information. Potentially prevent the onset of autism? Are you kidding me? Who ARE these people? I visited Kennedy Krieger Institute's web site and learned they are \"an internationally recognized facility located in Baltimore, Maryland dedicated to improving the lives of children and adolescents with pediatric developmental disabilities through patient care, special education, research, and professional training.\" Surprisingly, there was no banner headline on their home page instructing me to  click here  to find out how to potentially prevent the onset of autism. So, instead, I clicked through their autism links and got - well, autism information. Perhaps I was looking in the wrong place. I found the box that would allow me to search their site and typed in \"prevent onset autism.\" My results read: Here are your results for search: prevent onset autism No results where return for Search Maybe I was being too verbose. I went back to the search box and entered \"prevent autism.\" That yielded: Here are your results for search: prevent autism No results where return for Search Apparently Kennedy Krieger  loves them the bad grammar , too. Okay, so maybe I should have entered a direct quote from the magazine.

Now, I understand that this is just some give-away magazine that is mostly just advertisements posing as feature articles. I  know  they don't expect people to actually  read  it. And I get that it makes nice copy, this little blurb that implies that if you pay enough attention to your small child's development, then you can whisk him away from that pesky little autism thing you keep reading about. But shouldn't  some  standard of journalistic integrity apply, even to the publishers of  Parent & Child: The Learning Link Between Home and School?

{"date": "Saturday, April 15, 2006", "body": "\nI've been thinking a lot about Bud's logical, sequential, \" systemizer \"-type mind. I first started thinking about it this afternoon, when Bud completed his very first science experiment. It was a test of buoyancy. Bud filled a pan with water and placed it on the counter, then wondered aloud if a lemon would sink or float. I could tell by his inflection (\"Will the lemon SINK -  pause  - or FLOAT?\") that this was a  script , but I went with it. The lemon floated. Bud repeated his script, suggesting that we test the buoyancy of the lemon again: \"Will the lemon SINK -  pause  - or FLOAT?\" \"I wonder what else might sink or float,\" I said. Bud looked around the kitchen and shouted, \"A pear!\" The pear sank. And quickly started turning brown.  Now  it was getting interesting. Bud abandoned his script and we set out testing everything we could think of. We got two sheets of paper and (with a little help) Bud wrote \"FLOAT\" on one and \"SINK\" on the other. After we tested each item we scurried into the dining room to draw a picture of the item on the appropriate list. Big goldfish float. So do Cheerios and walnuts. Pasta sinks. So do baby carrots and grapes. Pretzels float, but get really, really disgusting after a while. Or, to quote Bud, \"It's very GOOEY!\" I continued to think about Bud's sequential mind after he went to sleep and I started my Easter Bunny duties. Easter took Bud by surprise this year. He's been out of school all week, so he hasn't been around other children talking about the upcoming holiday. The family members who would typically come to our house for the weekend cancelled their plans to steer clear of our illness. So the usual signs that Something Is Happening are absent, and he was startled when I told him this afternoon that tomorrow is Easter. He is used to a build-up; he expects the agony of the wait. So he quizzed me about it for the rest of the day. \"Tomorrow is Easter?\" \"When I wake up?\" \"And will be eggs waiting for me?\" \"Easter Bunny will hide my eggs when I'm sleeping?\" It was clear from his questions that he needed no reminders about what the flow of activity looks like on Easter. He was able to recall it all immediately. But I found it interesting that his questions focused on the eggs and not on the basket. \"Tell me about the eggs, Bud,\" I said. \"They're maps.\" he said. Maps. His favorite part of Easter is the maps. Throughout my own childhood, my favorite part of Easter was the hunt for candy eggs hidden all around the house. My siblings and I would scatter in a frenzied scramble to collect as many of the foil-wrapped treasures as we could. In my memory, Easter morning is a frenetic pace and a mound of chocolate. I always imagined I would recreate the scene for my own family. But when Bud was very young, I recognized that my idealized Easter morning would not work for him. First of all, Bud has never been all that fond of candy. A mound of chocolate would hold very little appeal to him. And second, even before Bud had a diagnosis - before I knew there was anything to diagnose - I simply couldn't imagine him engaging in a \"traditional\" egg hunt. I guessed that he wouldn't see the point in rushing around collecting eggs at random. My hunch was that he would not be interested in hunting, and would abandon the search quickly. But I wanted Easter morning to be something special for him, so I tried to create an experience that I thought he  would  enjoy. I bought some brightly colored plastic eggs and I created an egg hunt - a  concrete sequential  egg hunt, in which each egg led to another egg in a predetermined order, leading him through the house and, ultimately, to his Easter basket filled with little toys and treats. That first year, I drew pictures of places in the house and hid the pictures in the eggs. The egg at his bedside held a picture of the couch, the egg on the couch held a picture of the sink, etc. The following year, and each year since, I've used digital pictures. Or, according to Bud, digital  maps . I'm sure he remembers the Easter basket pay-off. I'm sure he'd be disappointed if it wasn't there. But the magic of Easter morning for him is in the thrill of the hunt - starting at the beginning and following each step in sequence to reach a logical conclusion. And the Easter Bunny will not disappoint this year. The hunt is on; the game is afoot. And perhaps when the hunt has ended and the goodies have been discovered we'll finally be able to answer the question that's been on everyone's mind: Do those Cadbury cream eggs SINK -  pause  - or FLOAT?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/04/science-sequence-and-celebration.html", "title": "\nScience, sequence, and celebration\n"},

But as I think about it and consider it from  multiple perspectives , I keep coming back to the same thought.

{"date": "Tuesday, April 11, 2006", "body": "\nThe anniversary celebration was a smashing success. We honored my parents' 50th in true family style - with a family trivia contest, a poker tournament, karaoke, geocaching, a video slideshow, and food food food food food. Today family members are all exhausted, five pounds heavier, and very, very happy. Bud managed the weekend extraordinarily well, despite - or, I suspect,  because of  - a virus that put him right out of circulation. During his  crazy day  at school on Friday, he was doing a lot of scripting from an episode of Caillou about being sick. His aide said that in addition to talking about being sick, Bud did a lot of fake coughing and sneezing. I hypothesized that he felt like he was feeling the first stirrings of a cold and was using the best words he had to talk about it. On Friday night as the downstairs of our house filled with people, Bud retreated to the second floor landing, where he could station himself by the computer and still keep an eye on the goings-on below. He alternately pronounced the area his \"Space Ship\" and his \"Tree House,\" and by the end of the evening he'd decided it was his \"Spaceship Treehouse.\" The activity he was undertaking (printing page after page from the PBS Kids website), he dubbed \"Computer Club.\" He only occasionally ventured downstairs, but managed well as people came and went through the Spaceship Treehouse. By the end of the evening, though, Bud had sick eyes. It's a look we rarely see from our usually healthy and robust child, and it is a sure sign that he feels terrible. My suspicions were confirmed in the middle of the night, when he woke and called out to me. For the first time, he was able to tell me what he was feeling in a way that I could understand. \"My tongue hurts,\" he said. \"My mouth is hot. My tongue is itchy.\" I think he had a sore throat. I felt his forehead and it was burning, so I gave him some children's Tylenol and told him it would make him feel better. \"And remember!\" he sang out. \"No more flashing colors!\" \"Do you see flashing colors, Bud?\" \"Yes.\" Definitely a high fever. I remember experiencing the same thing as a child. The next morning he still had a fever and had completely lost his appetite. As I sat trying to get him to drink a few sips of juice he said to me \"Close my eyes, Mom.\" \"Close your eyes?\" \"Yes. Close my eyes and hum.\" \"Close your eyes and hum?\" \"Yes. Just the hum. Not the flashing colors.\" So the fever was no longer creating visual effects, but auditory ones instead. This, it seemed, was no ordinary illness. And so, we reconfigured Bud's plan for the anniversary weekend. As the rest of us headed out for fun and festivities, Bud and my husband cuddled up to nap, watch Teletubbies, sip fluids, and nap some more. In many ways, Bud's sickness made the weekend a whole lot easier for him. He didn't have to manage the crowds. He didn't have to encounter unpredictable changes in schedule. He just had to take it easy, which is exactly what he needed to do. My husband had to make do with \"to go\" meals from each of the weekend's festivities, and the poor guy ended up catching whatever it is that Bud had. But Bud's spirits stayed good throughout. He developed a feel-better mantra that he encouraged us to say with him all weekend. \"Bud is sick,\" he'd say. \"Bud is what?\" \"Sick.\" \"No, Mama. Bud is sick. You do it. Bud is what?\" \"Bud is sick.\" \"And Bud will what?\" \"What?\" \"Bud will feel better soon.\" \"Yes.\" \"You do it, Mama.\" \"Bud will feel better soon.\" \"Bud is what?\" \"Bud is sick.\" \"And Bud will what?\" \"Bud will feel better soon.\" \"Bud is sick. Bud will feel better soon. You do it, Mama.\" \"Bud is sick. Bud will feel better soon.\" So the anniversary celebration has officially ended. Our last houseguests left for the airport this morning.  My husband lost his voice, ingested megadoses of Nyquil, and is out cold. Bud's eyes are clearing slowly, but his appetite hasn't returned, he's still fighting a low-grade fever, and he has developed a cough, so he's spending a second day home from school. Bud is sick. But Bud will feel better soon. Or so I've been told.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/04/in-sickness-and-in-health.html", "title": "\nIn sickness and in health\n"},

In the intro to the  story , Oprah said that it is widely believed that personality is formed by the time a person is six years old. Interesting. \"I wonder if that's true for children who have developmental delays,\" I said, thinking about our resident six-year-old.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 02, 2006", "body": "\nThis weekend as we were getting ready to go outside to play, Bud approached me with his arms full of toys. \"Mama, can I take my peards outside with us?\" Peards? I looked at the things he was carrying - a ball, a hat, a car, a horse, and assorted other toys. \"You want to take those toys outside?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay,\" I said, still a bit mystified. We went outside and Bud dumped the toys in a pile on the picnic table, then grabbed the hat and said, \"Come on!\" He ran to the grassy hill beside our house and plunked the hat down with determined purpose. Then he backed up and announced, \"One day in Budsland, something appeared from far away! It was a hat!\" It clicked. The grassy hill next to our house has always been Teletubbyland, and one of Bud's favorite Teletubbies scripts is \"One day in Teletubbyland, something appeared from far away.\" But now that Bud is using less direct echolalia and is mitigating his scripts more and more, he is working to break down the scripts into their component parts. As a result, I am getting even more insight in the ways in which his language development is nontraditional. I'm not an expert on language development, but it seems to me that most children learn the rules of language as they learn to speak. So even though they don't consciously know they're doing it, as they learn to talk they follow the rule of sentence structure. Sentences have subjects (nouns) and verbs. Even in their very first sentences, Somebody does Something: I go. You go. He/she/it goes. Not so with Bud, whose earliest sentences were less likely to sound like \"I go\" than \"Oh no! Let's get out of here!\" It seems that most typically developing children also use the rules of grammar in their receptive language, to decode the messages they hear. So they hear \"something appeared from far away,\" and their brains decode automatically:  \"right - must have subject and verb: something = subject, appeared = verb.\"  Of course, children make mistakes as they learn this process, resulting in some of the hilarious \"Kids Say the Darnedest Things\"-type quotes. (My favorite example of this is a colleague's daughter who, when reprimanded and told to behave, replied \"I'm BEING have!\") But Bud, as a gestalt learner of language, does not decode language the same way. As I  posted previously , he has begun to deconstruct his gestalt language into its composite parts, but because he did not  acquire  language through the use of rules, he doesn't use those rules in the deconstruction. So while other children hear a traditional sentence with a subject and a verb - \"One day in Teletubbyland, something appeared from far away,\" - it seems Bud hears a headline, a title, an announcement, a declaration: \"One day in Teletubbyland: Something! A peard, from far away!\" So, naturally, when he wants to play this game he needs to gather up his peards. It makes me wonder - how often does Bud hear things differently, and decode them in this different way? How often does he have to disregard the words themselves and make meaning by reading the context, by determining that this-string-of-words said by this-group-of-people in this-sort-of-circumstance must have this-kind-of-meaning. My goodness,  I think,  that must be so difficult! It must be exhausting! And then,  He must be a genius! But, no. It would be difficult for  me . That does not make it universally difficult. And he  is  very smart - so smart, in fact, that he would not  choose  to do things in the most difficult way. My way - the traditional way - is not necessarily the right way. His way is  not even wrong . It strikes me that there's a parallel between words and people. Words string together to make sentences and paragraphs that express complicated thoughts and ideas. But when you deconstruct them, the thoughts and ideas mean far more than their component parts. Bud has my eyes and disposition. He has his dad's mouth and love of music. But he has a mind of his own.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/05/pieces-parts-and-peards.html", "title": "\nPieces, parts and peards\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 01, 2006", "body": "\nBud's spontaneous language just keeps getting better. Even his  scripting  is getting more and more sophisticated. The greatest part is that he is finding it easier to talk about how he feels and what he needs. We have a play date scheduled tomorrow with good friends of ours who have twins Bud's age. The kids have been playing together since they were three, and Bud always has fun with them. Hayden and Hannah are sweet, gentle children who take Bud at face value. They don't push him too hard. They welcome his presence, but don't get offended when he chooses to move away. They intuitively understand that they will all be more successful with games that involve running and chasing than with activities that involve focus or talking. More than that, they don't just passively accept Bud; they actively request play dates with him. I adore these children. Bud adores them, too. But it has been a while since our last playdate, so I imagine that it might be hard for him to predict the specific ways that tomorrow might play out. We talked about it as he got ready for bed. \"I'm feeling scared,\" he said. \"What makes you feel scared?\" I asked. I have learned not to ask \"Why are you scared?\", because Bud doesn't know what sort of information I'm looking for when I ask \"why\" questions. I waited, but Bud didn't answer, so I prompted, \"I'm scared of...\" \"My friends,\" said Bud. \"You feel scared about playing with Hayden and Hannah.\" \"Yes,\" he said. Then he began a series of mitigated scripts. I can't quote them exactly, but I recognized snippets of some - Bob from It's A Big Big World, Elmo from his first day of school - mitigated to the extent that they might as well have been his own. He climbed into my lap and said something like \"It's going to get me! It's going to get me! It's okay, it's okay. You can just snuggle here with me. We can stay together. You can hold my hand.\" He slipped his warm little hand into mine. \"Of course we can stay together, Bud.\" \"We can just snuggle together.\" \"Yes, we can snuggle together if we feel scared. It's okay to feel scared.\" \"Bud's scared.\" \"You know, Bud, we don't have to play with Hayden and Hannah tomorrow if you don't want to. We could play with them  another day .\" \"I'll play with Hayden and Hannah when I wake up.\" \"Okay, Bud. That's a great idea.\" I'm sure he's still anxious. But we've talked it out and we have a plan: we'll keep hand-holding and snuggling in our back pockets in case we need them, and we'll forge ahead boldly into the play date with our scary, wonderful friends. We've talked it out, and we have a plan. Wow.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/04/wonderful-scary.html", "title": "\nWonderful scary\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 30, 2006", "body": "\nOne of the most exciting developments in our world over the past couple of months is that Bud has started reading. He is sounding out letters and slowly stringing them together until *PING* he recognizes them as words - \"ba-ba-ih-baih-baih-ga-ba-ih-ga-ba-ih-g-baihg-BIG!\" He is VERY proud of himself, and there's just about nothing better than that. He's also really  interested  in the process. Part of his motivation comes from the fact that he has discovered a real utilitarian value to being able to spell out words: it allows him free reign to program the TiVo all by himself. Last week as I was getting ready for work, Bud called up the stairs \"Mama, I need help!\" \"What do you need help with?\" I called back. \"I need help to tape Jack's Big Music Show!\" It's not unusual for Bud to ask me to tape things for him, so I headed down the stairs to help him. I stopped short, though, when I entered the living room and saw the tv screen. Bud had used the  miper  to maneuver to the right screen to enter the program title (which is no easy task in itself), and then had clicked on each individual letter to type out the program he wanted to tape. On the screen in front of me was: JACKSBG The boy is amazing. Since that time, he has mastered the art of Tivo as well as the spelling of Jack's Big Music Show, It's a Big Big World, Teletubbies, and Boohbah. It's not all about the tv, though. Bud also loves books. He loves reading together, and he enjoys spending quiet time alone with his books looking at the pictures and talking to the pages. He is passionate about his favorites - and I have to say, he has good taste. I think I enjoy his favorites as much as he does. And so, in tribute to Bud's emerging literacy, I present  le creme de le creme : Bud's Best-Loved Books. Daddy, Could I Have an Elephant?   by Jake Wolf This is hands-down Bud's favorite book. It follows a boy named Tony through his morning routine as he tries to entice his father with great ideas he has about different  pets  they could get. Tony's dad appears to be a single parent, which has prompted questions from Bud (\"Where's Tony's mom go?\") and has given me the opportunity to talk to him about the many different ways that you can make a family. Interestingly, in one of the illustrations we see a framed photo on the bedside table showing two adults and a child, prompting me to create my own elaborate backstory. (Yes, I know, I really need to get a life.) And Here's To You!   by David Elliott This beautiful book is an instant classic, and it has become the gift I give to newborns to welcome them into the world. Bud adores its playful poetry and unique exploration of the animal kingdom. His favorite line: \"Here's to the cats! The purring people - cats! Here's to the creeping ones - the get you when you're sleeping ones!\" About a year ago I heard Bud \"reading\" the book to himself in the next room: \"Here's to the cows! The GETCHU when you're sleeping ones! Here's to the bugs! The GETCHU when you're sleeping ones! Here's to the bears! The GETCHU when you're sleeping ones!\" (Myself, I've never much cared for the get-you-while-you're-sleeping bears.)   Feast For Ten   by Cathryn Falwell This simple counting book was one of the first that Bud memorized and could \"read\" to me. He still loves it. He seems particularly drawn to the family dynamics, and eagerly points to each family member to determine the equivalent person in our own family. As this family has five children and we only have Bud, we have to employ cousins in our version of the story... but I suspect that that's all part of the fun.   Cows Can't Fly   by David Milgrim This book really captures Bud's imagination, as it tells the story of a boy whose picture of flying cows inspires an entire herd to take to the sky. Alas, none of the adults can be bothered to look UP, and the boy and his dog are the only witnesses to this magical event. I especially love the conversations that Bud and I have about the boy's mother, who is working with a power drill, and his grandmother, who is working as a mail carrier. Giraffes Can't Dance   by Giles Andreae Two of Bud's very favorite things - jungle animals and dancing - are central to the plot of this beautiful book about being different. Bud loves the monkeys who cha-cha. I love the message that the story sends to my boy about finding his way in the world. And the best part is, I can finally read the whole thing out loud without getting choked up. The New Adventures of Curious George   by Margret and H.A. Rey We took this book out of the library so many times that I just went ahead and bought a copy. The book is a compilation of more recent stories about everyone's favorite \"good little monkey\". The stories are as sweet as the originals, but have the added bonus of featuring doctors and mayors and other important people who are women and people of color. Though Bud enjoys every story, his favorites are  Curious George Makes Pancakes  and  Curious George Goes to a Movie  (and no,  the irony  has not been lost on me.)   Caps for Sale: A Tale of a Peddler, Some Monkeys and Their Monkey Business   by Esphyr Slobodkina I loved this book when I was Bud's age, and I love that he loves it just as much as I did. It is a gentle story that reads like (and may well be) a traditional folk tale. Bud loves the monkey-see, monkey-do shenanigans on which the plot turns, and we both delight in shouting out the peddler's lines together... okay, the peddler's lines AND the monkeys'. The Best Picnic Ever   by Clare Jarrett Bud loves that the main character in this book is named Jack, especially now that he can READ the word \"Jack\"... as in, Jack's Big Music Show. But he also loves that as Jack waits for his mom to prepare their picnic, he passes the time playing with a giraffe... and an elephant... and a leopard... Now THAT is Bud's idea of a good time! As long as we're just pretending.   Just Another Morning   by Linda Ashman This book gorgeously, delightfully crawls inside a young boy's imagination and takes us along on his wild, exciting morning expedition. Sometimes when Bud and I read the book we talk about how the \"giant\" is really the boy's Daddy and how the \"monster\" is really the vacuum cleaner, and Bud scurries to find his own \"wild\" animals so that he, too, can sleep in a zoo. But most of the time we just hold on tight and enjoy the adventure. Peanut Butter Rhino   by Vincent Andriani  and P.J. Funnybunny Camps Out   by Marilyn Sadler These are two seemingly unrelated books, but in my mind they are connected.  Peanut Butter Rhino  tells the story Rhino, who is preparing for a picnic when he accidentally (an unknowingly) sits on his peanut butter sandwich. He spend the story looking for his sandwich, while Bud squeals with glee, \"It's on his BUM!\" In  P.J. Funnybunny Camps Out , P.J. and his male friends go camping and exclude the girls, saying \"Camping is not for girls.\" However, in a twist ending (don't keep reading if you don't want to ruin the surprise) we discover that the girls have posed as ghosts and scared the boys, proving that the boys may not be as tough as they thought... nor the girls as weak. Neither of the books is particularly compelling to me as a work of children's literature. But they are both invaluable learning tools as I work with Bud on perspective-taking. As Bud and I read them together, it is easy to talk about how  we  know where the peanut butter sandwich is (\"On his BUM!\"), but how  Rhino  thinks it might be up that tree or in this cave. We have similar conversations about the fact that  we  know that Honeybunny and Donna Duck were pretending to be ghosts, but that P.J. and his friends  believe  that the ghosts were real. Bud continues to struggle with the concepts, but the allure of these books keeps him engaged in the conversation. So there you have it - the best in books from Bud and me. Lots of other books go in and out of vogue, but these are the ones that continue to find themselves on the bedside table. We hope you liked our choices and, hey - thanks for reading!  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/daddyElephant.1.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/daddyElephant.2.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/AndHeresToYou.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/AndHeresToYou.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/FeastForTen.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/CowsCantFly.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/CowsCantFly.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/GiraffesCantDance.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/CuriousGeorge.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/CapsForSale.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/BestPicnicEver.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/JustAnotherMorning.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/PeanutButterRhino.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/PeanutButterRhino.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/PJFunnyBunny.0.jpg", "http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/daddyElephant.jpg"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/what-were-reading.html", "title": "\nWhat we're reading\n"},

As we approached the car, Bud said enthusiastically, \"Mama, can I go  exploring ?\" \"Sure you can!\" I said. His enthusiasm never dimmed, but he said, \" Clay is not here .\" \"No, he's not.\" I said \"It's kind of sorrow,\" Bud said very matter-of-factly. \"Parting is such sweet sorrow.\" And then he skipped off to play. Now, granted, he wasn't quoting Shakespeare directly; Bud hasn't actually read  Romeo and Juliet . He was quoting  Monster Clubhouse , which was quoting Shakespeare. But really -  sorrow ? I didn't know Bud knew what \"sorrow\" meant. And, sure, it's a script - but of the  dozens of hours of scripts  that Bud has in his head,  that  is the one he pulled out: \"Parting is such sweet sorrow.\"  I wouldn't be so sad to leave you if I wasn't so happy when I'm with you.

{"date": "Monday, March 20, 2006", "body": "\nI've decided to write the post I desperately wanted to read a few years ago when Bud's speech was exclusively echolalic, when I was split down the middle, half of me thrilled to hear the sound of his voice and the other half of me anxiety-ridden by the thought that I should find a way to make him stop obsessively quoting videos. I felt like I was standing at a high-stakes crossroad without a guide map, and I had the overwhelming feeling that whatever I did at that very moment would lead to a happy, rewarding life for Bud or would unleash the  doomsday machine  that would spell the end of life as we knew it. It started the summer before Bud turned three, on a family trip to a Sesame Street-themed amusement park in Pennsylvania. Bud was in Early Intervention but had not yet gotten a diagnosis. We knew he had a speech delay, but beyond that we just thought he was a little quirky in a high-maintenance kind of way. In retrospect I recognize that much of the language he did have then was echolalic (singing songs word for word, falling down and saying \"areyouokay?\"), but I didn't really see it at the time. The issue came into much clearer focus at the theme park, though. It was the first time I remember Bud having the \"I love this, make it stop! I hate this, I want more!\" reaction that I have come to know as one of the hallmarks of  dysregulation  for him. Bud was simultaneously enchanted and overwhelmed in an overactive, unfocused sort of way. And throughout our time at the park, our mostly nonverbal boy kept repeating the same thing over and over: \"Duh-No! Ahssiswih dunna. Deedeedee! DUWAH!\" I couldn't understand what he was saying, but there was  something  about the cadence of his speech that triggered recognition in the recesses of my mind. On the same trip, our hotel television was one that powered on to a hotel \"preview\" channel with a cartoon cowboy who welcomed us and told us what to expect during our stay. Bud was fascinated with this cowboy, and after a couple of days in the hotel he started mimicking the character's speech. My immediate reaction was one of panic, and the word flashed in my brain: ECHOLALIA. I began to pay more attention to the other phrase that I kept hearing from Bud throughout the trip: \"Duh-No! Ahssiswih dunna. Deedeedee! DUWAH!\" and kept running it through the filters in my mind -  what did it mean? I remember the moment that I figured it out. I was strapping him into his car seat, and he was clutching several of his Sesame Street figures (one of his quirks was the tendency to carry small characters with him wherever he went.) I started saying the script along with him, paying close attention to the tone, the inflection and the emphasis he put on each syllable, and it hit me: Baby Bear, from the beloved Elmo's World video - \"Behold! Artist with crayon!  trill of music  Drawing!\" I was fascinated and horrified. From that point on, I began to tune in more intentionally to the cadence of the sounds he made and I came to recognize that he was repeating scripts from favorite videos frequently. As his speech grew less garbled, it became even more obvious. At first the scripts did not seem to serve a purpose beyond their play value and their self-soothing qualities. But he was talking and scripting more and more and more. That's when I first encountered that crossroads feeling.  What should I do? If I try to make him stop scripting will he just stop talking altogether? Will he feel like I'm telling him that he is not good enough? But if I just let him keep scripting will it drive him further and further into a fantasy world, and further and further away from the real one?  I'm sure I must have read things. I'm sure I must have talked to people - his EI specialist, his doctor... someone! - but I have no recollection of any advice that I got about it. I just remember thinking that the most important thing - the thing that would keep him in this world, that would make him  prefer  the real world to the fantasy world - was  connection  to other people.  You can connect without   language,  I reasoned,  but language without connection is useless.  And so, the  content  of his speech became a secondary concern. My primary goal, instead, was to use his speech to connect with him - however and whenever I could. So I learned the scripts, and climbed into his fantasy world with him. I tried to engage him in dual-scripting -  you say one line, I'll say the other  - to approximate the reciprocal flow and give-and-take of conversation. I worked with him to develop scripts of our own - private jokes that we shared with each other. And whenever I could, I looked for the moments when he was well regulated and I tossed a little  chaos into the creation , hoping to provide just enough dissonance to move him forward a bit, to expand the possibilities of language, to help him consider that there could be more to talking than scripting alone. Bud continued to script, but as time passed I noticed a clear evolution in his scripting. It became less random. He began to assess his surroundings and select the script he had that best fit the circumstance. So if he wanted to play ball, he would approach us with ball in hand and say \"Quick, Dipsy. Help Laa Laa catch the ball.\" After more time passed, he began to  modify his scripts . The sentence structure would remain intact, but he would swap out the pertinent details, so that \"Quick, Dipsy. Help Laa Laa catch the ball\" would become \"Quick, Daddy. Help Mama catch the ball.\" As his talent to modify scripts became more sophisticated, it allowed him to interact and be  understood  by people outside our home. His speech patterns still sounded stilted and awkward to \"outsiders,\" but they could finally understand the basic gist of what he was trying to say - and it seemed that this new milestone became a real turning point for him. Bud's confidence seemed bolstered by his ability to be understood, and allowed him to start taking risks with language and start putting words together on his own. Using creative, spontaneous language was much more difficult for Bud and took a great deal more time than it did for him to assess a situation, mentally thumb through hours of memorized scripts to find the most relevant script to the given situation, and modify the script by swapping out a few details. As a result his creative speech was much slower and less polished than his modified scripts. But, in time, \"Quick, Daddy. Help Mama catch the ball\" became \"Daddy ball?\". And slowly, slowly, two-word and three-word phrases became sentences, and sentences became conversations, and personal pronouns began to match, and the  rules of grammar  began to emerge. It was in the midst of this transformation that I attended a  workshop  led by SLP Barry Prizant, and during one of the breaks I told him about Bud's increasingly complex modification of movie scripts. Dr. Prizant told me that Bud was using \"mitigated echolalia,\" and that it was an excellent prognostic indicator for future language development. \"I'll bet you'll start seeing spontaneous language soon,\" he said. \"We already are, \" I said. Dr. Prizant smiled and said, \"And I think you'll probably see a lot more.\" He pointed me in the direction of some great articles on echolalia. One of them was  Finding the Words  by Marge Blanc in the May-June 2005 issue of  Autism/Aspergers Digest Magazine . The article talked about \"gestalt language acquisition,\" or exhibiting delayed echolalia with whole sentences repeated verbatim. I read the article with fascination: it seemed that she was writing about Bud. And there in the sidebar was a quick overview titled The Stages of Gestalt Language Acquisition. It could have been titled The Stages of Bud's Use of Language. It read: Stage 1: Communicative use of language gestalts (learned and spoken in their entirety) - \"Let's get out of here!\", \"Want some more?\" \"Quick, Dipsy. Help Laa Laa catch the ball!\" Stage 2: Mitigation into chunks (a) and recombining (b) - (a) \"Let's get + out of here!\", \"Want + some more?\"; (b) \"Let's get some more!\", \"Want out of here?\" (a) \"Quick + Daddy. Help Mama + catch the ball!\" (b) \"Daddy catch the ball!\" Stage 3: Isolation of single words and morphemes, and beginning generation of original two-word phrases - \"Get...more!\", \"Want...out?\" \"Daddy ball?\" Stage 4: Generation of more complex sentences - \"I got more.\", \"I wanna go out?\" \"I playing ball with you, Daddy!\" Bud still does a lot of scripting, especially when he's  dysregulated  or when he is focused on pretend play. But he also uses a lot of spontaneous language, with increasing frequency, in a greater variety of situations, and with a greater number of people. He is really beginning to understand this confusing morass we call \"language.\" And so the movie quotes, the sound bites, the long streams of monologue and dialogue he recites verbatim - they are no longer the enemy. I am no longer standing at a high-stakes crossroad. Bud has chosen his path and I've joined him on it. Our traveling companions may include Blue and Joe,  Snook and Bob ,  Jack and Mary ,  Zack and Weezie ,  Zoboomafoo , the Teletubbies, and the entire cast of Sesame Street, but we travel secure in the knowledge that we are moving forward, together, toward a very promising future.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/plotsummary", "http://www.autismdigest.com/", "http://www.noggin.com/shows/jacks.php"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/dr-strangetalk-or-how-i-learned-to.html", "title": "\nDr. Strangetalk or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Echolalia\n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 27, 2006", "body": "\nI really appreciate the response that I got to my  last post . The diversity of opinion reflected in the comments is fascinating to me, and it has given me a lot to  think about . Clearly the negative associations that I have with the word \"stim\" are not broadly held, especially - as several people pointed out in their comments - by adults who are themselves autistic. I've been thinking about that a lot, and am reminded again of some concepts from my Interpersonal Communication class, in the unit in which we discussed perception. In communication theory, \"perception\" refers to the way that we take in information and the way that we make meaning of that information. Many of the perceptual processes we use occur automatically - we notice what we notice, and it means what it means to us. We are conditioned to make meaning of our experience without even being aware that we're doing it. According to  Joseph DeVito  in  The Interpersonal Communication Book , \"One frequently used rule of perception is that of  proximity  or physical closeness: Things that are physically close together constitute a unit.\" So, for example, when we see 555 3344 many (but not all) of us think \"telephone number.\" Though we have no real reason to think that \"555 3344\" is anything other than a random string of numbers, our minds resist that kind of chaos. The physical proximity of the 5's make us see \"555\" as one unit; the space makes us see \"3344\" as a separate unit. And different perceptual processes (what DeVito calls \"schemata\") make many of us in the U.S. look at a unit of three numbers followed by a unit of four numbers and think \"phone number.\" Our previous experience with \"555\" as the exchange used for fictional numbers in movies and books only strengthens our inclination to view these numbers in that specific way. But things don't have to be  physically  close to each other to trigger the perceptual rule of proximity. We also use a  temporal  rule, or as DeVito says, \"Things occurring together in time belong together.\" Kristina at  Autismland  has written about this phenomenon from a literary perspective in her posts about  metonymy . As a result of the \"temporal proximity\" rule, DeVito says, we perceive verbal and nonverbal signals sent at the same time as being related to each other. Taking it a step further, I consider the way that the Dire Straits song  Money for Nothing  always reminds me of the bookstore I worked at for a brief time in the summer of 1985, simply because the song was at the top of the charts at the time. These temporal connections can be powerful, even if we are not consciously aware that we have made them. I was reading a wonderful biography of Paul McCartney when my daughter  died . The bookmark remains untouched halfway through the book. I can't read the book now, because the book itself makes me sad. That connection is so powerful, in fact, that when I opened the new Beatles  biography  that my husband bought me I found myself unable to read it. It reminded me too much of the McCartney biography and it, too, made me sad. I've been thinking about temporal proximity as I've considered my reaction to the word \"stim.\" I was introduced to the term when Bud had just been diagnosed, and I was confused and unsettled about it. I was introduced to it in posts written by parents who wanted their children's behavior to stop, and their writing was infused with frustration, helplessness, hopelessness, and anger. As I wrote previously, I didn't know  what  they were writing about and I ended up feeling panicked, more confused, and even afraid. That is the connection - the gut-level reaction - that I have to the word \"stim.\" It has nothing to do with the behavior - nothing, really, to do with the word itself. Just as the McCartney biography is not sad, the word \"stim\" is not angry. And yet they each feel that way to me. The reverse is true of the word \"dysregulation\" for me; those temporal connections are with things like excitement, enthusiasm, insight, understanding, and respect. I first heard the word at a  SCERTS  workshop, at an important time in the evolution of my thinking about Bud's autism. It was this workshop (and a previous one on RDI) that allowed me to think differently about my reactions to Bud's behavior and, I believe, to be more respectful of it. Prior to that time, I had only been exposed to approaches that sought to address \"problem behaviors\" like \"aggression\" and \"stimming\" - the very terminology of which seemed to make value judgments, i.e., \"this child's behavior is a problem, so this child is a problem.\" (The unspoken statement, of course, being \"and problems are bad.\") But in the SCERTS model, the words \"regulation\" and \"dysregulation\" are intended to be value-neutral. What I like about  using them  to consider Bud's behavior is that instead of focusing on the \"problem\" that his behavior might be creating for  us , they challenge us to focus on the problem that the environment  we have created  might be for Bud. A recent example from school: Last week Bud had a difficult time transitioning from his classroom to a session with his Occupational Therapist. He didn't want to go with her, despite the fact that it was time for his session and despite the fact that he likes his OT very much. As his OT led him out of the room, Bud turned to her and yelled (very uncharacteristically) \"I'M GOING TO BITE YOUR HAND!\" They pressed on, and further down the hallway Bud took off the Sherlock Holmes hat he was wearing and hit the OT with it. At pick-up time, Mrs. H and I talked about what happened. I believe that if we did not have the SCERTS language of \"dysregulation\" we would have had a conversation about Bud's \"aggressive behavior\". Instead, we had a conversation about what might have caused Bud to feel dysregulated to the extent that he felt like his best options were threatening and hitting. We talked about the difficulty he has had sleeping recently and how tired he has seemed, and we talked about the fact that Bud had not gotten any prior notification that this transition was coming - something he has come to expect in school. Once we had considered those factors, our problem-solving was not about how to make Bud stop being aggressive; it was about how I can help him get more and better sleep, and about how Mrs. H can insure that he will get prior notice before he's expected to make transitions. In my opinion, using the philosophy and the language of \"emotional regulation\" helped us to be more respectful of Bud. That being said, I definitely understand why \"dysregulated\" is a jarring, clinical word to people who don't have the same associations with it that I do. I looked up the \"dys\" prefix  online . Two of the definitions listed were \"Abnormal\" and \"Bad.\" Both offensive, and both entirely inappropriate when making reference to Bud. But it is the  third  definition of \"dys\" that I'm using when I use the word \"dysregulated\": Difficult. The SCERTS model defines \"regulation\" as being \"available for learning and engaging.\" So when I say that Bud is \"dysregulated\" I mean that he is having  difficulty  being available for learning and engaging. He might be having difficulty because he is overtired, or because people are talking too quickly, or because his environment is overwhelming - but whatever the reason, he is not in a state in which anyone can tell him to \"sit down and pay attention\" without making the situation a whole lot worse. Instead, our efforts need to focus on helping him to regulate - to become available again - before we can make any requests of him. I hope that when others read this blog, they will understand that this is the spirit and the philosophy behind the words that I use. \"Dysregulated\" is not an ideal term, as recent conversations have indicated. But it's the best one I have at the moment. And regardless of the mixed reactions to the word, Bud's reaction to the  philosophy  is very positive. It seems to work for him. And if it works for Bud, it works for me. At least for now.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tcbdevito.blogspot.com/", "http://www.kristinachew.com", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2005/10/this_message_wa_2.html", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316803529/qid=1143499231/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-3334217-5347027?s=books&v=glance&n=283155", "http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dys-"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/more-than-words.html", "title": "\nMore than words\n"},

He'd close his eyes, toss the penny, then go diving to find it. Every time I suggested that it was time to get dry, he'd request five more minutes to play. So, I admit it, I was getting bored and wasn't paying careful attention to his every move. That's when I heard, \"Where's my penny, Mom?\" I looked in the tub. No penny. \"I don't know, Bud. Where is it?\" \"It's in my bum.\" \"WHAT???\" \"The penny's in my bum. Can you get it out, please?\" \"It's in your BUM?!\" \"Yes. Can you get it out, please, Mom?\" Oh. My. Goodness. Don't panic. Don't laugh. Don't make him anxious. I scooped him up and dropped him on the toilet. \"Push, Bud,\" I told him. \"Push like it's a poop.\" He pushed and strained and... nothing. \"Get it out, Mom, okay?\" I got him some apple juice to help get things going, then called the doctor's office. The woman who answered sounded kind (if amused) and said she'd have a nurse call me right back. The nurse called quickly, and with equal parts compassion and humor told me that if he wasn't in any pain and the penny wasn't blocking any...  action ... then we'd just need to bulk up on fruits and fibers and wait for it to pass.

I have  posted previously  that one of my primary goals is to help Bud become a  broadband communicator  who can receive and make meaning of information coming to him through multiple channels simultaneously, then respond automatically and appropriately. I have been using the  RDI  philosophy as a framework and guide toward that goal. It's working. Here's how I know: This weekend, we had a family birthday party and, with it, a house full of people. Bud was a bit more hyper than he normally is, but overall he was doing well. Shortly before dinner, I was in the kitchen talking to my mother who was checking the readiness of a vegetable casserole. Bud came zipping through the kitchen at top speed - a boy on a mission to somewhere - and ran right between my mother, her hands struggling to maintain an awkward hold of a steaming casserole, and the counter on which she hoped to place it. My mom swerved just in time to keep the casserole from falling onto either Bud's head or the floor. Bud never slowed his step, but just as my mother swerved and avoided the collision he called over his shoulder, \"Sorry, Nana!\" He wasn't responding to any verbal statements; no one said \"Watch out, Bud,\" or \"Nana's going to drop a steaming hot casserole on your head.\" Bud was not carefully watching Nana or anyone else in the kitchen; his mind was clearly focused on something else. But in an instant - in a FLASH - he read the nonverbal message in my mother's rapid swerve; he interpreted the halt of conversation and ensuing moments of silence; he recognized the quick exhales in the room that signaled that the crisis had been averted. In a fraction of a second, his brain received the information, interpreted it, and responded to it - effortlessly and appropriately. We're getting there. He's making the connections. Bud is learning how to navigate the interaction super-highway.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/02/broadband-communication.html", "title": "\nBroadband communication\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 05, 2006", "body": "\nThe goldfish gave Bud a black eye today. Well, okay, not directly. But I hold them responsible anyway. Bud didn't really want to go to the grocery store with me. I was going to the far-away grocery store that requires a 30-minute car trip, instead of the preferred nearby grocery store that offers free cookies and half the travel time. But, as I reminded Bud, the nearby grocery store only carries the SMALL Pepperidge Farm goldfish, but the far-away grocery store has the BIG giant goldfish that Bud has been wanting for weeks. So, with his mind focused on goldfish with all the taste in a bigger, flatter, smilier cracker, Bud climbed happily into the car to make the long journey with me. He was patient through the drive, through aisle after aisle of the store, and through a long wait at the deli counter, but by the time we got to the cracker aisle his patience had worn thin. He spied the big goldfish on the bottom shelf, but somehow neglected to see the shopping cart that someone had parked directly in front of the big goldfish boxes. Bud dove for the crackers - and his eye flew straight into the rounded corner of the abandoned cart's handle. I heard the loud SMACK as Bud went down, then saw him stagger to his feet, his face red, his eyes streaming, his mouth yowling, and his arms tightly clutching a box of giant goldfish. He was inconsolable as we sat together on the floor in the middle of the cracker aisle, his face buried against my chest. When I could finally pull his face far enough away from me to get a look at it I could see that it was starting to swell. I handed him some sausages to lay against his eye until we could make it to the frozen foods section and upgrade to a bag of peas. Bud whimpered through the checkout aisle and held the peas tightly to his face, offering them up for just a moment so the clerk could ring them through. He remained pea-faced through the long ride home, and then declared that he was feeling better and banished the peas to the freezer. I could see the swelling start to return, and detected a faint reddish purple that I'm guessing will be a much lovelier and deeper shade by morning. Bud had only one request before bed. He wanted a snack: Goldfish. Big ones. He never was one to hold a grudge.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/shiner.html", "title": "\nShiner\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 07, 2006", "body": "\nThis morning Bud woke up early. Very early. 3:15 a.m. early. And when I say \"woke up,\" I don't mean \"woke up briefly\" or \"dozed off and on until dawn.\" I mean woke up bright and fresh, ready to start the day. I even gave him a second dose of  melatonin , which had absolutely no effect. It was odd and frustrating and more than a little tiring, but I didn't give it a great deal of thought until I read  today's post  at Autismland, in which Kristina wrote, More than a few  fellow traveler autism parents  have been noting how the change in the seasons--the huge transition from cold winter to wet spring---has been affecting their children, sometimes to intense outbursts... Charlie has been having odd transition trouble, not so much between activities at school or home...but with transitioning from one state of consciousness to another: For the past few days, he has been agitated and tense a minute after waking.  and  this comment  from MothersVox at  Autism's Edges : My thought is that a good bit of this may be seasonal. . . esp. as it seems that a number of us are seeing regressions in our children this week. Personally I am very sensitive to changes in the amount of sunlight, and around this time of year I can be prone to changes in mood and difficulties modulating sensory information. People used to call this spring fever or March madness. I think it's a very real phenomenon. When the light changes suddenly -- such as a spate of really sunny late winter or early spring days after a number of grey days -- or perhaps just when the amount of daylight passes some critical juncture, I can become very very sensitive... When I think about how many hormones are thought to be activated by light levels, this does seem to make some sort of sense. Also, when I think about how many ASD kids have trouble falling asleep, I really wonder if being in artificially lighted environments keeps them awake. Maybe our kids are super-attuned to light levels.  It hadn't occurred to me that Bud's body might be dysregulated because of a sudden change in light levels, but it makes some sense. Historically he has struggled with sleep patterns during Daylight Savings time shifts and throughout the bright summer months. As I think more about it I realize that, like MothersVox, perhaps I am being affected as well. I am typically a deep sleeper and rarely have dreams that I remember. But last night was unusual not just because I woke with vivid images of my dreams, but also because of their content. For the first time since we lost Bud's  twin brother , I had a dream about the two of them. They looked like Bud at about age 3 and were absolutely identical. I was trying to get them ready for bed, but I was struggling to try to figure out how to get two giggling, squirming boys through the bedtime routine. And I was puzzled.  I do this every night , my dream-self thought.  Why can't I remember how I do this? I know I must have a routine. Why can't I remember what the routine is? My dream-self was really confused when I brought them into their room (which, in the dream, was actually my brothers' room in our childhood home) and saw that there was only one bed.  Do I really make them share a bed?   Why do I make them do that? Why don't we have two beds for them? Then my dream-self had a moment of panic:  Oh no! What's going to happen when they  climb into bed with us  tonight? How will the four of us fit ? But they must do this every night. We must fit just fine. I looked down at Bud and his brother - I wasn't sure which one was which - and saw that they had fallen asleep, two duplicate profiles side by side, sleeping peacefully. And then I woke up, and for a moment I couldn't remember...  there is something about that dream that isn't quite right... I'm not sure... but I know it's something important... Oh, right. I remember now. Just one boy. Just one Bud. It was inexplicably unsettling and soothing at the same time. I think about falling asleep tonight and both hope and fear that the twins will be there again. ( Ay, there's the rub.) So it makes me wonder. What is it that disrupts Bud's sleep so profoundly from time to time? What woke him in the middle of the night, not enough to upset him but enough to prevent him from falling back to sleep? Is it seasonal? Hormonal? Is it the same thing that gave him night terrors as a toddler? Is it a sensitivity to light? Or is it exposure to a light that's even more difficult to explain?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/03/the_long_way_ba.html#comments", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/03/keeping_the_fai.html#comment-14734975", "http://www.autismsedges.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/to-sleep-perchance-to-dream.html", "title": "\nTo sleep, perchance to dream\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 09, 2006", "body": "\nThe good news is that in our little autism community, even though our kids often have  behavior squalls  at the same time, they also frequently synchronize their great days. So it was yesterday for  Henry , and  Charlie , and Bud (and hopefully, even more friends who have just been too busy enjoying the good times to post about them.) Yesterday's \"yipee!\" for me came in the form of a note in Bud's School-to-Home Notebook. Since Bud's very first IEP we have been trying to help him take the skills we know he has at home, and transfer them to the classroom. In preschool we carefully worded his IEP so that his goals reflected the transferability - Bud will identify colors  in the classroom environment ; Bud will identify shapes  in the classroom environment.  In Kindergarten, the skills we know he has and are trying to help him transfer are more language-based - things like rhyming and sounding out words. Last spring when Bud struggled through an  assessment  with a child psychologist, the doctor suggested that we look into intervention models that would help strengthen Bud's facility with joint attention - ones that would help him understand that the teachers, doctors, parents and peers in his life have a separate agenda from his and have expectations  of  him; ones that would help him  want  to try to respond to those external expectations appropriately. This doctor was the one who first mentioned  RDI  to me, and who really set us on the course we're currently following. So imagine my delight when I opened Bud's notebook today and found this note from  Mrs. H : Bud has had the most amazing two days. His sense of humor is in rare form, his energy level is finding a home between \"high octane espresso\" and \"herbal tea.\" I find I can \"joke\" him out of potential escalations, and by saying \"Hey, Bud, I need a hug,\" he'll come over for the hug  and  the directions I am then giving him.  I have started repeating lessons 1:1 with him after I have done it with the whole group. Today's favorite was \"A Hunting We Will Go\" where he gets to reach into the huge bag and pull out assorted Beanie Babies and one large sand-filled frog. It's a rhyming game. Here's how it went: Song intro (please note - they were taught in September \"the  fox  goes in the  box \" to catch on to rhyme) Mrs. H: We catch a dog and we put him in a ---? Bud: Box? (smiles) MH: We could! What rhymes with dog? B: Log. (tentative smile) MH: Yes! (Big smile - song again)... catch a pig, put him in ---? B: Mud! MH: Yes, what rhymes with pig? B: Jig! (smiles and laughs) Etc. - assorted animals are pulled out and EACH time B tells me the appropriate habitat for the animal. I agree with all of it and then ask for the rhyme - which he correctly gives me (and even plays with language!) Finally he pulls out the big, fat frog. MH: Catch a frog, and put him in a ---? B: ( Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause.  Looks at me, smiles and yells) BOG! Habitat AND rhyme! Silly ol' Mrs. H - sometimes it takes you  so  long to get it! Happy Wednesday! Happy Wednesday, indeed!

I'm not sure why, but things that other people dismiss as aroma-free or scent-neutral have strong odors to my nose. And of all the senses, smell is the one that can most easily trigger memories for me. Seeing a place I've been before, hearing a song that reminds me of a time in my life - they certainly bring back reminiscent feelings. But the  scent  of a thing or a place or a person - a scent can transport me back in time in an instant. It's not just a memory; for that instant, it is a reality - one whiff, and I am momentarily sitting on my grandmother's couch, or walking to the pencil sharpener in my third-grade classroom, or standing on the stage of the high school auditorium, or kissing a cute young man in college. My husband thinks I'm a little kooky, but he's gotten used to my overactive olfactory sensitivities and my proclivity to go through life sniffing things (though to be honest, the extremely overactive sense of smell I experienced in pregnancy was almost enough to send us both over the edge.) For the most part, though, he complies with my requests to smell things for me, and indulges my lengthy sniffs in the crook of his neck. I have a theory that in a blind test in which Bud was presented to me at random times throughout the day I would be able to give an accurate report on what he'd been doing just by smelling his hair. In the morning, I'd know if he'd been sleeping in his own bed or ours, and if he'd been in ours I'd know if he'd been sleeping closer to his Dad or to me. Later in the day, I'd know if he'd been playing outdoors or in. I'd know if he'd been to school (and would be able to tell if he'd been at Kindergarten or if he's been visiting his old preschool, as they create entirely different hair smells.) If he'd been in Kindergarten, I'd know by the smell of his hair if he'd had a fairly independent day or if he'd been clinging a lot to Mrs. H. And on and on and on.

He was chattering non-stop as we unpacked his school bag, but stopped in mid-thought as he pulled out Cat in the Hat, then plunged his nose into Cat's belly. \"Mama!\" he squealed with glee, \"Cat in the Hat smells Kindergarten!\" I plunged my own nose in. \"He sure does, Bud!\" I agreed. \"He smells EXACTLY Kindergarten!\" That's my boy!

{"date": "Thursday, February 09, 2006", "body": "\nI read once that when you are struggling to figure out what direction to take with your life, you should try to remember how you answered the question \"what do you want to be when you grow up?\" when you were ten years old. I don't remember the specific rationale, but I think it had something to do with ten being the magic age at which you knew enough about who you were, but had not yet begun to deal with the self-doubt and self-loathing of adolescence that often results in a lot of self-imposed limitations. When I was ten years old I was certain that when I grew up I wanted to be two things: a mom and a writer. I became a mom in 1998 when my  daughter  was born. I became a writer one year ago today when I started this blog. I only recognize that in retrospect. When I started blogging, I thought it might be a fun diversion and perhaps a helpful way to keep track of Bud's development. I could not have guessed the extent to which  my fellow bloggers would inspire me, challenge me, and drive me  not only in my parenting, but also in my writing. I had no idea that a year later I would think of myself as a writer; that I would  be  a writer. In many ways, this realization gives me a new sense of self, and with it the grown-up blogger-mom part of me is further inspired, challenged and driven to become better and to set the bar higher.

He was overflowing with warm feelings and, in the spirit of the holiday, spent his day kissing his teacher and classroom aide. Luckily, with only one exception - when he was moved by the spirit while the aide was standing next to his chair and he leaned over and gave her a big smooch on the thigh - his kisses were apparently appropriate and well-received. Much to my delight, his kissing fest has continued at home and I have been the lucky recipient of pecks and smacks and big sloppy expressions of affection. He's reluctant to let Love Day end, and has been faithfully carrying around the small foam heart that  Mrs. H  gave him as he's tried to keep the feeling alive. He's also been wearing the adorable red beret we gave him instead of candy for Valentines Day. (He'd spied it - and coveted it - in a store before Christmas, so I'd returned to the store, bought the hat, and squirreled it away so well that I couldn't find it in time for December 25. Enter the Valentines Day present.) He looks dashing, and is so pleased with himself that he's even been wearing the beret to bed. It makes sense, though.

This delightful show is a mix of computer animation and puppetry and stars Snook, a slow-moving tree sloth who speaks in the listless, you-do-your-thing-I'll-do-mine kind of hippie-speak that the guy down the hall in college who smoked way too much marijuana used to use. Bud has the sort of echolalia in which he not only adopts the  words  in a script; he also adopts the tone, the dialect, the inflection, the cadence - everything. He's the boy of a thousand voices: he sounds Australian when he's doing the Wiggles; he can do back-and-forth high-brow British and cockney accents when the Tubbies segment calls for it; and you have to hear it for yourself to truly appreciate his rendition of  Ruby  the Bunny as he tries to give Daddy a make-over, complete with beehive hairdo. So it's been a lot of fun lately to watch him do his slow sloth-like shuffle around the house, sounding totally - well, to be honest - stoned. He greets his dad at the door with a sluggish, drawn out \"Heeeyyyy... you came back to hang with us!\" His grandmother gets a different, equally lethargic greeting: \"Heeeyyyy, Nana... how's it going?\" But my favorite greeting came as we drove down a rural street on our way home from school and I slowed the car as we passed a group of wild turkeys. One of the turkeys was primed for mating - his head held high, his wattle a brilliant red, his chest puffed up and thrust forward, his tail feathers in full plumage. He was strutting his stuff and was clearly out to impress the ladies. And that's when I heard from the back seat, \"Heeeeeyyyyy, turkey... lookin' good!\" I laughed so hard I almost drove off the road. So, my thanks to PBS for a very sweet new show filled with lovable characters and singable songs and, mostly, for a lot of great laughs.

{"date": "Sunday, January 22, 2006", "body": "\nI recognized Bud instantly in a  recent post  on Autism's Edges, in which MothersVox explored her daughter Sweet M's difficulty with tantrums at the end of an activity that she's not ready to end, like being on the playground bridge by herself. She writes: \"But if I can find a way to help her know that she's not losing the possibility of that pleasure forever, then the transition can be easier. Tricks include consistency\u2014though not necessarily rigidity\u2014but also early warnings, and reminders that TV (or the bridge all to yourself) will be possible again, TV later, TV tomorrow. Aggressive language, a combative attitude, and demands for obedience\u2014\"TV off now, take your bath now!\" would be completely counterproductive, because then her fear of losing the TV or the wobbly bridge for all time and eternity, would escalate. Parental, and pedagogical, cool heads matter so much.\" This is so totally, utterly, and completely true for Bud. Early warnings, in particular, work so well in helping Bud make transitions. Trying to get him to end his computer time used to be a battle until we figured that out. Now, all I have to do is say \"Ten more minutes, Bud, and then it's time to turn off the computer and play toys,\" wait for the \"Okay, Mom,\" and give him ten minutes to wrap up. At that point, he very calmly shuts down the game, powers down the computer, and walks away. (I have also learned that letting him bring closure to the activity himself is very important; it does not go well if I try to turn of the computer or - heaven forbid - we try to leave the computer on.) MothersVox's idea of the need for kids with ASD to know that endings are not forever is also true for Bud; he transitions away from fun activities best when he knows he is not giving up his one and only opportunity to do them. For that reason, it is HUGELY important that I make sure that my actions match my words. Luckily, that was an important parenting philosophy for me even before I knew that Bud was on the spectrum; I knew that I never wanted to use \"quick fix\" solutions to make a transition easier in the moment unless I was fully committed to following through on the promise. I have always chosen my words and made my promises very carefully. Bud has not heard \"If we leave the playground right now, then maybe we'll have time to get ice cream after supper,\" only to learn after supper that \"It's too dark and Mommy is tired. Maybe tomorrow, Bud.\" I avoid answers like \"maybe\" or \"we'll see\" in the hope that after some time passes Bud will  forget  to ask again. Because I have tried to be so consistent with following through I think that Bud has come to trust that if I tell him we will do something at a later date, he can be confident that we really will. (And I really believe he has internalized the value of a promise as well, which is why I wait for the \"Okay, Mom,\" when I give him a ten-minute warning; I think that, when he is regulated, Bud follows through on  his  promises as well.) He has also come to trust that when I can't follow-through on something (because, let's face it, we can't always follow through) there is a good reason. So when we couldn't go to gymnastics this week because I was sick, Bud rolled with it beautifully and said \"we go to gymnastics anudderday.\" Even back when he first started using language Bud recognized that if, by catching me off guard, he could trick me into saying that he could do xyz, I would not reneg on the deal. So I would tell him it was time to stop playing computer and he'd say \"Computer in-a morning,\" and I would agree, thinking that \"in the morning\" meant \"sometime tomorrow.\" But there he'd be, bounding out of bed at 5:30 a.m. and heading for the mouse. And only then would I realize I'd been had. I've become more sophisticated since then. But so has Bud. In fact, I now recognize that he uses our negotiations of future pay-offs as a  tool for self-regulation . He knows that he will be able to stay regulated through a transition if he has the comfort of knowing that the pay-off will come. The typical transaction usually goes something like this: \"Oh, no! The computer game is broken.\" \"Yes, Bud, I think it is.\" \"We buy a new one at the S Store,\" (which is what Bud calls Toys R Us, for some reason.) \"We can look and see if they have one, Bud. They might not have it.\" \"Yes. In the morning.\" \"No, Bud, you have school in the morning.\" \"Tomorrow.\" \"No, honey, we won't be able to go to the S Store tomorrow.\" \"Anudderday.\" \"Yes. Another day. You got it.\" \"Anudderday\" has become Bud's magic solution for maintaining balance and regulation. All is not lost. Mom said it will happen. I know it will happen. Anudderday.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=19421951&postID=113781219791210831"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/01/anudderday-closer-to-self-regulation.html", "title": "\nAnudderday closer to self-regulation\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, February 05, 2006", "body": "\nI'm currently reading the book  Teaching Children with Autism to Mind-Read  by Patricia Howlin,  Simon Baron-Cohen , and Julie Hadwin, which outlines a systematic approach to helping children on the spectrum develop \"theory of mind,\" or perspective-taking skills. The authors suggest that there are five levels of emotional understanding that provide the foundation for theory of mind skills: 1) recognition of facial expressions (happy, sad, angry, afraid) from photographs; 2) recognition of emotion from schematic drawings; 3) identification of situation-based emotions (the dog is chasing the boy, so the boy feels afraid); 4) desire-based emotion (if a person gets what a person wants, that person will be happy; if that person does not get the wanted thing, the person will be sad); and 5) belief-based emotion (if the person believes that the wanted thing is coming, the person will be happy; if the person believes the wanted thing is not coming, the person will be sad). They go on to provide tools to assess a child's ability on each of the five levels, and then activities to help develop skills based on the level at which the child is assessed. Tonight I sat down with Bud and the book to give it a try. Foolishly, I started the process in the evening, when Bud was already getting sleepy and was probably ready for bed. Nonetheless, he flew through the first three levels - identified emotions in photographs and in sketches of faces, and could accurately predict emotions based on the situations provided. I knew we were done for the day when we started Level 4. I was following the book's instructions to the letter. 1) Show the pictures. 2) Read the statement. \"This child wants x. The child's dad gives him x.\" 3) Question for comprehension of desire: \"What does the child want?\" 4) Question for comprehension of emotion: \"How will the child feel when dad gives him x?\" 5) Question for comprehension of justification: \"Why will he feel that way?\" So I opened to the first scenario - pictures of a boy by a pool, chosen because I could tell that Bud's interest was waning and I thought I could hold him a little longer because of his love of pools. I began the canned routine: \"Look at this, Bud. Ben wants to go to the pool.\" I pointed to the first picture. \"Yeah.\" \"Ben's Daddy takes him to the pool.\" I pointed to the second picture. \"Yeah.\" \"What does Ben want?\" I asked pointing to the first picture. \"His flippers,\" Bud yawned.

{"date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2006", "body": "\nI have  posted previously  about how much I adore Bud's teacher, Mrs. H. Now you get a chance to see why. This afternoon, following the  hitting incident , I gave Bud some time to unwind after we got home from school, then said \"Bud, I'd like to hear about what happened at school today.\" Much to my surprise he said, \"I hit.\" \"Who did you hit?\" \"I hit Mrs. H.\" We talked about how Mrs. H. felt about being hit (angry and sad), and I asked him if he thought he might hit again tomorrow at school. He said \"no,\" so we talked about what  else  he could if he got angry. Here's what we came up with: use his words, clap his hands, take a breath. And then we practiced together fake-angry-face to fake-angry-face: \"I feel angry.\" CLAP. Breathe in ... breathe out. Bud grabbed onto it, and even recounted it to Nana a couple of hours later, so I sent an e-mail to Mrs. H. so she could use it as a starting point at school tomorrow. A short time later I got this fabulous reply, which she has kindly agreed to let me post: Hi there - first let me preface this with that fact that I am still in my \"processing\" stage of the day. It's when I spend my \"chore time\" reflecting on what has happened in the day and what I need to do, or not do. I will apologize right out front, because I will be doing some of my processing \"outloud\", and you can certainly chose to ignore any or all of it.  Bud. Bud is an ever evolving child, no different , in so many ways, as the children I have watched evolve for the last 27 years...I started young ;) . Yet, he is so vastly different, as has been each child with whom I have worked within the spectrum. Bud is Bud, and there is no escaping that. His evolution hinges on both where he falls on a particular day within the spectrum, and where he is developmentally. I am not an expert, I am a practitioner - my practice is observing children, loving them, encouraging, and nudging them....all in the name of learning.  Bud's hitting response seems to me to stem from different avenues. It is a new tool which he has discovered, and now must learn how to use. It was a matter of time, I believe, before he discovered the \"power\" of hitting/kicking. With this action there is power, and response. It appears that the notion of these actions was activated by a recent video, but again I believe it was only a matter of time. The slight changes in his daily routine could have an impact on this new behavior, (specialist schedule changes, you on the couch), but in the long run, these small changes have not impacted him in the past - I know, it could now.  The issue at hand for me is not \"should I address this\", but rather, \"how should we all address this?\" There are a couple of issues at hand. First there is the actual hitting/kicking. Bud is brilliant in that he has chosen to adapt these inappropriate behaviors at perfectly appropriate times - when someone is in his \"territory\" (dollhouse, computers, cars. legos, my lap - especially when it's being occupied by another child in my room who is also on the spectrum), or when the world is not going \"his way\" (ie - I would rather just sit in front of the computer all day thank you Mrs. H., and please don't ask me to paint, draw, build, go to the bathroom, etc.).  With a child, not on the spectrum - these are daily, developmentally appropriate challenges - they just have quicker (easier?) access to coping tools. For these behaviors, we have developed a routine that appears to have worked very well: clear, consistent visual, non-verbal cues, clearly set/realistic expectations (when/then), declarative language, validation of feelings (Bud is angry/sad/worried. - \"Yes\". \"Bud wants to shut down the computer.\" --\"Yes\"....(like everything else, I pick my battles - this is one of them. When he shuts down the computer, he thinks no one else should play on them.)  One of the first things I did was to read all the children the story, \"If you're angry and you know it\", and he loved it. Choices when you're angry were - walk away, tell a friend, stomp your feet, and >>>>take a breath...which we practiced a lot - sound familiar? I'll send the book home tomorrow. I have been trying to find a way to communicate my new expectations to Bud so that they will make sense to him. \"Waiting and seeing\" has never been my strong suit. Saying \"No\", or \"That's not nice,\" just doesn't do it.  This leads to my next issue. I am not the only adult to come across Bud's path during the day. I spend a great deal of time advocating/instructing other adults in the optimal way to draw out the \"real\" Bud, and how to tease out all the \"great stuff\" in him. Fortunately, the majority of us are on the same page, so my job is easier. However, sometimes it takes just a moment of battle of wills - and it quickly becomes a lose/lose situation.  So here I am, still trying to figure out how I can follow Bud for the years to come, still trying to come up with the magic words which will help shape his behavior the way I want it to go (HA!), and keep him feeling like he is the bees knees, and the light in my heart that he is.  You know, a long time ago, I read somewhere that it takes saying something at least 500 times to a child to get it somewhat a part of their \"working memory\". Now, I know for a fact, I have spent the last two decades telling children in my house to load their own dishes...well over the 500 times mark - still not to total success. So, how many times am I willing to say - \"Hitting/kicking hurts. Mrs. H. doesn't want Bud to hit.\"...I've got a lot of staying power.  Let me know what else you come up with, and I'll share this with the team. I'll talk to you tomorrow...so sorry so long winded! Get healthy! - Mrs. H. Sigh.

Well, the renting part is not really challenging; it's the renting-to-watching hurdle that sometimes seems insurmountable. I can't begin to count the number of times we've rented movies with the idea that we'd settle down to enjoy the film once Bud was asleep only to discover that this was one of his won't-fall-asleep-till-11:00 nights, or one of his up-every-half-hour nights. Inevitably, we'd return the movie unwatched. Sometimes we'd muster up a never-say-die attitude and keep it, only to end up paying three days worth of late fees for an unwatched movie. Less frequently, we'd stumble into nights when Bud would be snoozing soundly by 8:30, but we'd find ourselves with nothing to watch and no late-night movie rental place nearby. Then we discovered Netflix. Netflix lets us keep three movies at our house for as long as we want them. They don't care if we keep them for a month. They don't care if we watch them in 15 minute clips. We still don't watch a lot of movies, but when the  desire  to watch one intersects with the  ability  to watch one, we always have a new movie at the ready. Such was the case the other night, when we watched a delightful film called  Dear Frankie . Netflix describes the movie this way: Faced with the prospect of raising her son, Frankie (Jack McElhone), with a good-for-nothing man, Lizzie (Emily Mortimer) spirits him away to Scotland and pretends the boy's father is aboard the HMS Accra. After years of pretending, including sending Frankie fake letters detailing his dad's adventures, the jig is up when Frankie learns the ship is docked by their home. Now, Lizzie must find a man to pose as Frankie's father \u2026 fast! The description really doesn't do the movie justice. It doesn't mention, for example, that young Frankie is deaf. Now, I recognize that the \"special needs\" factor coupled with the \"jig-is-up\" Netflix description makes the film sound like a tedious, predictable Lifetime television movie. Luckily, however,  Dear Frankie  is able to walk the fine line that allows it to be heartwarming without becoming maudlin or saccarine. The characters are realistic and engaging; the plot is intelligent and moving. And, in the end, it sends a message that can't be sent enough or in too many ways: never, never underestimate a child simply because he has a disability. Rent it.

{"date": "Saturday, January 21, 2006", "body": "\nI just finished Susan Senator's book  Making Peace with Autism . I feel like I've gotten to \"know\" Susan a bit over the past few months, through the insightful posts on her  website  and  blog  and through her warm, supportive comments on my blog and others. As I expected, in her book as in the blogosphere she is thoughtful and engaging; but what really struck me about her most as I read chapter after chapter was just how  honest  she is. In  Making Peace with Autism , Susan invites us into the most private parts of her mind, her heart, and her family as she explores the effect that her oldest son Nat's autism has had on her, her marriage to Ned, and their family life with younger sons Max and Ben. She tells it all just as it happened, without euphemism and without gloss: her fears, her mistakes, her challenges, her anger. She gives voice to the feelings that so many parents of children on the spectrum must have, but are afraid to express because of how they might look to others: feelings of anger, grief, desperation, and hopelessness, all topped with a heavy dose of guilt for having those feelings in the first place (or, as Susan puts it, \"feeling bad about feeling bad.\") Susan's message comes through clearly: you can be angry and fearful and grief-stricken and desperate and still love your child with all your heart, still be a phenomenal parent. Nat's autism manifests in very different ways from Bud's and many of the things that Susan has had to manage - aggressive behavior, uncontrollable tantrums, tutors and educators who refuse to work with Nat, and even violence - are not in my experience. I found myself thinking over and over, \" this is one  penguin  who had to walk 70 miles AND confront a seal AND battle a predatory bird, and lived to write about it .\" It   would be a valuable book if it were simply a memoir; however, Susan takes it a step further and provides sidebar information in a sort of \"what I know now that I wish I knew then\" way. She gives suggestions about very specific issues - preparing for an IEP meeting, deciding whether or not to use medication, surviving beach vacations, getting through the hard and hopeless days - not from the perspective of an expert, but from the perspective of a friend who has been there, has the benefit of hindsight, and is willing not only to spotlight and celebrate her successes, but also to expose and explore her mistakes. And  that  is a very rare gift.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590302443/103-3317162-9607065?n=283155", "http://http://susansenator.com/", "http://susansenator.com/blog/index.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/01/making-peace-with-autism.html", "title": "\nMaking Peace with Autism\n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 02, 2006", "body": "\nWhen I started this blog, I thought I would use it to write about a lot of things (\"raising a son on the autism spectrum, progressive politics, pop culture, and coffee addiction.\") But in the blog, as in life, everything else tends to fade into the background as autism takes it's solo position on center stage. It's nice, then, to have some time off from work around the holidays to be able to continue to think, write, listen, practice, and do all the regular autism things and still have a little time for something else. So this week I've enjoyed long stretches of time with some very good books; one in particular seems worthy of a mention. I have long been a fan of the mystery whodunit, starting back when I discovered Nancy Drew, the Hardy Boys, and the Bobbsey Twins. For several years in Bud's infancy (before I had autism to occupy every waking moment), I indulged in mysteries like they were candy - until I discovered that, as with too much candy, I'd had so much that the thought of reading another could almost turn my stomach. So now they're a once-in-a-while treat, and I try not to waste the splurge on any old two-for-a-dollar chocolate bar. For that reason I was thrilled when my husband returned from a trip with the Godiva of mysteries for me - the latest release from  Rochelle Krich ,  Now You See Me.  Krich writes mysteries that are easy to devour. The plots are tight, the characters are believable, and the writing is interesting. Perhaps instead of Godiva, though, it would be more appropriate to consider Krich's novels bags of Chanukah gelt, because in addition to being enjoyable stories of suspense, they also provide a fascinating perspective on the culture of Orthodox Judaism. In  Now You See Me,  as in most of Krich's previous novels, Judaism is both central to the plot and peripheral to it, in that it provides both pivotal plot points and the color and detail that make the characters real. Now You See Me  is the fourth installment in Krich's Molly Blume series, which centers on a crime reporter who is married to an Orthodox rabbi. In this latest novel, Molly works with the family of another rabbi whose teenage daughter has purportedly run away with a man she's met on the internet. The novel explores the many pressures that young people - not just those from strict religious backgrounds - face in the world today, and is a thrilling, suspenseful read. And for those fans who, like me, miss the police-detective-focus of Krich's previous Jesse Drake series,  Now You See Me  provides some welcome surprises as well. So, Kol ha'kavod (kudos) to Rochelle Krich on another terrific novel - one that has given me Shavuah tov (a good week.)\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://rochellekrich.typepad.com/rochelle_krich/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/01/now-you-see-me.html", "title": "\nNow You See Me\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 27, 2005", "body": "\nWhen I read  Kristina's post on Charlie's use of \"hi\"  over at Autismland, I realized that my  recent post  on the myriad meanings of Bud's I-love-yous did not present an exhaustive list. Since then I've recognized even more uses that I missed. Like Charlie's \"hi,\" Bud's \"I love you\" can be an admonition against singing in the car. Last week, as I belted out \"Sleigh Ride\" in the front, I heard from the back a determined \"I love you, Mom. Don't sing.\" (Translation: \"No offense. You're bugging me.\") It can also express gratitude. This morning he shouted up the stairs to ask me to rewind his videotape (in Budspeak, \"Mom, it needs to be winding!\") When I shouted down to tell him I'd be right there, he shouted back \"I love you!\" (Translation: \"Thanks!\") It also acts as punctuation. Bud has taught himself the alphabet in sign language, using a poster that hangs in the bathroom in his classroom. The poster shows a hand making each letter, then shows the sign for \"I love you.\" When Bud does his sign language alphabet he talks along, \"A - B - C ... - X - Y - Z - and - Iloveyou.\" (Translation: \"The end.\") And tonight, as I sat down to blog, I heard Bud in the next room having trouble winding down, calling out for water, telling me that he was scared, and trying anything he could think of to get me to come back in. \"Mo - om,\" he sing-songed out. \"Come give your buddy a HUG!\" That did it. I peered around the corner and said \"Okay, one more hug.\" \"I love you!\" he cheered. \"YEAH!\" (Translation: \"Hooray! One for the home team!\") I'll let him go on thinking it was a win for the home team. But we know the truth; it was really a tie.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2005/12/the_difference__1.html#more"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/12/i-love-you-more.html", "title": "\n\"I love you\" more\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 15, 2005", "body": "\nI started thinking about it months ago when I read  this post  by Kyra on This Mom, and found out that Fluffy was conceived via in-vitro fertilization after a long struggle with infertility. I continued to think about it as I considered the  explosion in the rate of autism diagnoses  in recent years. Clearly, I thought, exposure to mercury via immunizations is one thing that has changed in that time; what  else  has changed that perhaps I should consider? I thought about it months later when Astryngia posted  these thoughts  about stressful pregnancies. I thought about it most recently when I read Gretchen's post about  Henry's difficult entry into the world . It's still an incomplete thought, but it goes like this: how many of the children who are currently diagnosed with autism would not have made it, say, twenty years earlier? How many would never have been conceived? How many would have miscarried early? How many of them (how many of us?) would have died in childbirth? Without the tremendous medical advances that have been made in infertility treatment, perinatology and the maintenance of high-risk pregnancies, neonatal intensive care, etc., how many of our children would not have survived the first hours, the first days, the first weeks, the first months of life? How many would not have been success stories in Darwin's survival of the fittest? There are  a lot of us  out here in the blogosphere posting about our children and our current struggles, victories, advances and setbacks with autism spectrum disorders. But not many of us have posted about the path that led us to where we are. It makes me wonder: How many of us struggled with infertility? (I did.) How many of us lost other pregnancies? (I did.) How many of us had high-risk pregnancies with our ASD babies? (I did.) How many of us had complicated or troubled deliveries? (I did.) How many of our children had to remain in the hospital longer than the \"typical\" newborn? (Mine did.) Maybe it's all a coincidence.

{"date": "Wednesday, January 11, 2006", "body": "\nI've been using an analogy lately that has gotten good feedback from both  MommaD at Alphabet Soup  and Bud's teacher that helps me think about the best way to work with Bud when he is dysregulated. Lately, Bud has been experiencing more frequent moments of  extreme dysregulation  both at home and at school. The dysregulation often manifests in trantrum-type behavior - shouting, pouting, arguing, wailing, crying, stamping, crashing - and both at home and at school we often find that our initial instinct is to try to manage it with discipline. Unsurprisingly, this approach does not typically yield success; more often, in fact, it only makes the dysregulation more pronounced. And so, as a reminder to myself and a roadmap for others, I've developed the allergy analogy of dysregulation. It goes like this: Let's say that instead of having autism, Bud had severe allergies. Then let's say something happened that triggered his allergy and he was overtaken by extreme fits of sneezing, his eyes so watery he could barely see, his breathing shallow and wheezy. My hunch is that no one would address the situation by scolding Bud and saying, \"Now stop all of that silly sneezing and act like a big boy.\" No one would fault Bud; no one would assume that he was making the choice to sneeze and water and wheeze. Instead, we would help him wipe his nose. We would try to identify the allergen that was triggering the reaction and physically remove him from it. We would help him to calm down and breathe normally before we asked him to sit down and engage with whatever task he had been undertaking before the allergy attack hit. Bud doesn't have allergies; he has autism. But just as if he were having an allergic reaction, Bud does not  choose  to become dysregulated. It is not a pleasant state of being for him; if he  could  regulate on his own without shouting, stomping, crashing, and arguing, he would. But he can't. He needs us to intervene - to remove him from the activity/person/environment that is triggering or complicating the dysregulation, to soothe and quiet him, and to help him regain an optimal level of emotional arousal before we ask him to sit down and engage with whatever task he had been undertaking before he became dysregulated. If he had allergies, we'd head for the inhaler and the Kleenex. With autism, our best resources are a slow pace,  declarative communication , and a great deal of  silence .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://betsoup.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/01/nothing-to-sneeze-at.html", "title": "\nNothing to sneeze at\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 24, 2005", "body": "\n\"I love you\": the three little words that every parent waits to hear. Many parents of children on the spectrum have to wait longer than most to hear them; some have to learn to recognize other expressions of the sentiment. With Bud, however, we never have to wait long to hear \"I love you.\" Hearing it is not a challenge; interpreting it, on the other hand,  can  be. \"I love you\" is sort of Bud for \"Aloha,\" in that it means different things at different times and in different contexts. Sometimes it's a greeting, as when he creeps into the dark bedroom where his father is sleeping, crouches up by his dad's head and says \"I love you, Daddy.\" (Translation: \"I know you're not much of a morning person, but I'd love it if you'd wake up, and if you  do  wake up, it'd be great if you would not be cranky.\") It's also a farewell, as when I am leaving for work while he's engrossed in watching Jack's Big Music Show on Noggin and I'm distracting him by trying to say goodbye and get one more kiss: \"ILOVEYOU!\" (Translation: \"Okay, okay, goodbye already!\") At other times it's a request, as when he sidles up to his grandfather who is eating slices of apple for breakfast and says \"I love you, Papa. What a great breakfast!\" (Translation: \"Can I have some of that apple?\") Sometimes it's a comforting phrase designed to let me down easy, as when I suggest that we not watch Barney Christmas for the hundredth time and instead watch Elmo's Christmas: \"I love you, Mom. Another day.\" (Translation: \"Don't take this personally, but no.\") Frequently it's a diversionary tactic, as when we are sitting at the dining room table, hear a loud CRASH from upstairs, and shout \"Bud, what are you doing?\" The response comes instantly shouted back: \"I love you!\" (Translation: \"I'd rather not discuss it.\" A side note, the other common answer to this question in similar scenarios is \"Just helping.\") Still other times, it's an admission of guilt, as when I am standing at the stove cooking dinner and he walks up to me quietly and says, \"I love you.\" (Translation: \"You know that bowl you told me not to touch...?\") Very often it's an apology: \"Bud, please stop banging those pans!\"; \"I love you.\" (Translation: \"Sorry.\") And sometimes, when he and I are both at our  dysregulated  worst, when I'm frustrated and angry, when I've lost my cool and started shouting, when I have just frayed my very last nerve, it's a reminder to keep things in perspective, as he moves his impish little face nose-to-nose with mine, blinks his long Bambi-lashes, and gives me a tight-lipped grin: \"You not angry; you happy. I love you.\" (Translation: \"Is it really all  that  important, Mom?\" Funny - it never is.) But my very favorite \"I love you, Mama\" is the one that comes accompanied by his little arms around my neck, his face buried, breathing warmth into the crook of my neck. That's the one that means - well, just \"I love you.\" And it's in that spirit at this holiday season that in addition to our  usual litany of good wishes , Bud and I send one more out to our friends in the Austismland blogosphere: We love you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/12/i-love-you-means-never-having-to-say.html", "title": "\n\"I love you\" means never having to say you're sorry\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 12, 2006", "body": "\nI got a flyer in the mail the other day about a two-day conference being held in Providence, Rhode Island in March titled  Identifying and Building Strengths and Nurturing Talents: The 11th Annual ASD Symposium 2006 . The conference is co-sponsored by Barry Prizant, who led the team that developed the  SCERTS  model. It's an interesting focus for an autism conference:  building strengths and nurturing talents . It instantly made me think of two posts from Brett at 29 Marbles, from  December  and  September . Brett's posts really resonated with me, especially this quote from Keith Ferrazzi's book  Never Eat Alone  (which Brett has read and I have not): The trick is not to work obsessively on the skills and talents you lack, but to focus and cultivate your strengths so that your weaknesses matter less. This makes intuitive sense to me. Let's say I struggle with math - the concepts just don't \"click\" for me - but I have a talent for languages. I have limited time and limited energy. I can opt to spend the bulk of my time and energy learning math. It will be difficult and the chances are good that I won't enjoy it, but I will make progress. The progress is likely to be limited, however; I'm probably never going to get an A in Differential Equations or pursue a career as a mathematician. On the other hand, if I put that time and energy into languages instead of math I am very likely to become fluent in a foreign language ( French , for example.) I am likely to enjoy it, and it is likely to build my confidence to pursue further opportunities for learning. It is likely to open doors to me that would otherwise have been closed - I might live in Paris, I might become an interpreter for the United Nations, I might become a French teacher. Isn't the same thing true for people on the spectrum? And if it is, then why do we always seem to focus on the deficits and challenges?  Of course  we need to remediate the core challenges in autism, just as I need to develop the math skills I will need to balance my checkbook, figure percentages, and solve problems. But we also need to seek balance in our children's lives. Bud needs to work at the things that don't come easily - using spontaneous language, making interpersonal connections, developing executive functioning skills - but he also needs spend time and energy pursuing the things that come easily to him and feed his spirit: singing, drumming, playing music, working with computers and electronics, performing, swimming, and more. He needs to become functional in his areas of deficit; he also needs the opportunity to truly  excel  in his areas of strength. So the symposium in March is exciting to me. The brochure reads: This symposium is the first national forum to address the importance of understanding interests, strengths and talents of people with ASD relative to social, academic, vocational and leisure skills and settings. Presentations and discussions will focus on the importance of identifying and enhancing these abilities for people with ASD of all ages and ability levels in educational, community, home, and vocational settings. The symposium's speakers include  Temple Grandin  and  Stephen Shore . It will also feature a performance by 13-year-old award-winning jazz pianist  Matt Savage . As parents we already spend so much of our limited time and energy focusing on our children's challenges and deficits; this symposium offers an important opportunity to achieve a bit more balance and focus on the good stuff.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ccseminars.com/ccseminars/documents/ASDSymposiumFlier.pdf", "http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/12/focusing-on-positive-new-book-for.html", "http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2005/09/work-to-your-kids-strengths.html", "http://www.templegrandin.com/templehome.html", "http://http://www.autismasperger.net/", "http://www.savagerecords.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/01/give-me-strength.html", "title": "\nGive me strength\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, January 04, 2006", "body": "\nWe've got a new obsession at our house right now: it's Dragon Tales all day every day. I have to admit that I brought this on myself. I've been trying to move Bud away from the  Teletubbies  and toward more plot-driven children's programming. He's had a long-standing relationship with Zoboomafoo, Sesame Street and Blues Clues, and has had passing flirtations with lots of other shows on PBS and Noggin, but the Tubbies remain his One True Love. But I was determined to keep this Christmas Tubbies-free, and I couldn't bear the thought of bringing yet another Blues Clues or Sesame Street video into the house, so this year I went with Dragon Tales. I got a little playset with the Dragon tales characters (dragons Ord, Cassie, Zak & Weezie - the two-headed dragon, and Quetzel; he has since added two Fisher Price dolls to play the roles of real children Emmy and Max), a cd of Dragon Tales music, and a video that has three little Dragon Tales stories on it. Bud was thrilled. Since then, it's been All Dragon Tales, All The Time. He loves the video. He even loves the opening production sequence that shows the  logo for Columbia/Tri-Star  (the Columbia lady with the torch and the Tri-Star Pegasus, which he calls \"the mom statue\" and \"the horse statue\"... and, of course, he would like to own these two statues, please, Mama, please.) All things considered, it's a pleasant obsession and a nice break from Tubbie-talk (\"Eh-oh, Dipsy. Eh-oh, Laa-laa. Ook! Whassatt?\") This morning, however, about half an hour after I dropped him off at school I got a call from his teacher. He was in the special ed room and she wanted to have a chance to talk to me out of earshot from him. She was concerned because he got angry and told the classroom aide he was going to hit her. Ugh. Dragon Tales. In one episode on his video, Max hits his friends when he doesn't get his way. The teacher-figure, Quetzel, teaches Max that hitting is not a good way to solve problems and gives Max lots of other, better strategies. Unfortunately, the moral of the story is not the part that stuck with Bud. The  hitting  part, though - that was a whole different story:  Hitting??? I never thought of that! Cool!  (Lesson learned: Be careful what you wish for. The Tubbies may talk like babies, but they are impeccably well-behaved.) I gave Bud's teacher the context and we did some problem-solving. She explained that this is actually one example of a larger pattern she is seeing lately, and she has a hunch that he has hit the developmental stage that most kids hit around age 4: I-am-my-own-independent-person- and-who-are-you-to-tell-me-what-to-do. And then, because she is such an  amazing Kindergarten teacher , we brainstormed and schemed and got on the same page and ended the phone call with a pretty good plan in place. When I picked Bud up from school later, I didn't say anything about the \"I'm going to hit you\" incident. But as we pulled away from the school, I heard a sad little voice from the back seat say \"I'm not going to hit you, Mom. I'm not going to hit you.\" I told him that was a very good thing, and that hitting makes people sad and angry. He was quiet for a moment, then said \" I love you, Mom.  Can you turn it up?\" (Translation: \"I'd like to end this conversation and listen to music now.\") I tried to bring it up gently a couple of other times during the day, but he wasn't having any of it. He reported that  he  was happy all day,  his teacher  was happy all day, and  the aide  was happy all day. End of story. So I spent a good chunk of the afternoon wondering if innundating him with Dragon Tales had been a bad idea. But after dinner, Bud let me know it wasn't when he led me through the  pretend play  adventure of a lifetime. He created an elaborate story, and used totally unscripted language as he explained his role and my role and the characters and the plot: he JUMPED into Dragonland, and he told Cassie \"we need to find the Mother Statue in her blue bathrobe and the Horse Statue\" and Cassie said \"The mother statue is  somewhere \" and Cassie said \"Do you want to jump on my back?\" and he said \"Sure!\" and then  he  rode on Cassie's back and  I  rode on Ord's back and Daddy and Nana and Papa watched us and - NO! - Daddy rode on Zack and Weezie's back and Nana and Papa rode on Quetzal's back and we flew all over Dragonland and... It was amazing. His eyes were sparkling, his excitement spilling over, his little arms flapping so hard he could have flown without the aid of a dragon. He could  see  it - and he could make me see it, too. He made it up as we went along, he altered the plan when he had a better idea, he improvised when he couldn't find the prop he needed. We set up his  sensory integration swing  and he climbed up with his Ord doll to fly over Dragonland so he could find the missing statues, and he talked and talked and talked. I even threw a little  chaos into his creation  just to see what would happen: \"Bud, if  you  ride on Cassie's back, where is  Emmy  going to ride?\" Bud didn't even blink before he responded, \"Emmy rides on Bud's back - come on!\" Bud fell asleep quickly tonight, having safely rescued both the Mother Statue and the Horse Statue. My heart is still beating a little fast, though. I'm not as young as I used to be, and it's the first time I ever rode a dragon. But I can't wait to do it again.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.reelclassics.com/Studios/Columbia/columbia-logo-gallery.htm", "http://www.playawaytoy.com/index2.ivnu"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/01/testing-and-triumphing-in-dragonland.html", "title": "\nTesting and triumphing in Dragonland\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, November 24, 2005", "body": "\nIt seems I attended the  SCERTS seminar  at just the right time. As most parents of children on the spectrum know, the holiday season can be a challenging time for kids with ASD. Bud is no exception. Bud has been slowly winding up since  Halloween , and hit full-tilt earlier this week. It actually started as birthday obsession. Bud's birthday is in September so it will be a long time before he celebrates another one, but he recently got a new Caillou's Birthday video and has been perseverating on having a birthday party. (Specifically, he'd like a Sesame Street birthday with an elephant cake.) This week was Nana's birthday, however, so there was a celebration, and some out-of-town family who hadn't seen Bud since his birthday came bearing gifts, so my insistence that \"it will be a long time before your birthday comes\" stood in contrast to Bud's real-life experience and only confused the issue for him. And that's not all. It was a two-day week at school, which included a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving party. He spent a whole day with me at my office on Wednesday. We have out-of-town guests staying at our house. Daddy and I are home from work. We are eating meals at different times. We had our first significant snowfall. The tv has been playing football games instead of PBS kids. People are drinking and conversations are louder than usual. We cooked a turkey on the outside grill. Bud's sleeping has been thrown off. I've been cooking and doing dishes and talking to other adults instead of focusing my time and attention on him. It has been an unpredictable, upside-down sort of week for Bud and despite my efforts to talk him through each turn of events, the poor kid is simply on overload. So today we had A Very Autistic Thanksgiving at our house. And this is why I am very, very glad that I've just attended Barry Prizant's seminar. As Bud went through his shrieking, throwing, banging, avoiding, refusing, protesting, ignoring, obsessing Thanksgiving Day, I was able to see his behavior for what it was: Bud was not being aggressive or difficult. Because of the wacky nature of the week, Bud was experiencing extreme dysregulation. As Prizant and the SCERTS model explain, when a child is regulated he is in an optimal state of arousal and is \"available\" for learning and engaging. When a child is in extreme dysregulation (either because he has very low or very high arousal), he is no longer available for learning and engaging. Trying to engage in a \"teachable moment\" with a child in extreme dysregulation is futile. The primary goal, instead, is to help the child achieve regulation. I kept the SCERTS philosophy in mind all day, trying in small ways to help him adjust and regulate as he encountered obstacles. As we approached evening, however, Bud passed the Point of No Return and all signs started flashing \"meltdown ahead.\" I shuffled him quickly upstairs to the bathroom, away from the crowd and into his bedtime routine even though we were about an hour early. Daddy joined us to try to provide extra support and comfort, but Bud was having none of it. \"NO! I don't want to go to bed! I don't want to brush my teeth! I want to play my toys!\" he wailed. Daddy approached him, speaking in a low soothing voice, and leaned in for a kiss. Bud flailed wildly, belted Daddy in the nose, and sent his glasses flying across the room. Daddy's face registered shock. Bud's didn't show even a flash of acknowledgement that anything had happened. Barry Prizant's words flooded into my mind. \"Most \"aggressive behavior\" from children with ASD is not really aggression; it's dysregulation.\" \"But how do you know the difference?\" someone in the audience asked. \"I mean, obviously sometimes it's really aggression.\" \"Again, you have to look at the intention that's driving the behavior. Ask yourself why the child is doing this. If he's doing it to hurt himself or someone else, it's aggression. If he's not, it's dysregulation.\" In a split second, I caught Daddy's glasses as they flew through the air and somehow (was it silently?) we agreed not to pursue a discussion with Bud about the incident. Daddy left quietly, and I continued helping Bud through his nighttime routine, not rushing it, making it as predictable and normal as possible. We got to his bedroom, turned down the lights, started reading a book, and before I finished page 3 Bud was sound asleep. One day down; 31 shopping days to practice the art of regulation ahead.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/extreme-dysregulation.html", "title": "\nExtreme dysregulation\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 07, 2005", "body": "\nI think that Paul Collins could write a telephone directory and make it compelling. He is  that  good a writer. The first time I read one of his books, he was writing about a  subject dear to my heart , but since then I've read and loved his other books, which were about  things I'd normally find mildly interesting  and  things I would not have pursued otherwise . His latest release,  The Trouble With Tom: The Strange Afterlife and Times of Thomas Paine  falls into that third category; it's not the sort of book I'd typically seek out. It actually reads a bit like a prequel to Sarah Vowell's  Assassination Vacation , and leaves me hoping that someday Collins and Vowell will take a trip together then co-author a book about the journey. The Trouble With Tom  is not exactly a biography, though it certainly has biographical elements. It's more a historical exploration, with a heavy dose of mystery whodunit, a bit of nineteenth century medical journal, and a great deal of comedic travelogue. It's... well, it's hard to pin down. The book begins with the revolutionary Thomas Paine, and provides a brief account of his life. It is at his death, however, that the story gets rolling. Collins writes in a flash-back-flash-forward style as he retraces the steps that Paine's body (well,  some  of the pieces of his body, at any rate) took (well,  may  have taken, at any rate) from the moment of his death in 1809 until... well, it's hard to say when. Through Collins's narrative we travel to 1809 and the Herring Street boarding house where Paine breathed his last; we also join Collins on his recent pilgrimage to that hallowed ground, now a Grove Street piano bar filled with the sounds of Rogers and Hammerstein in bass-barritone. And it only gets stranger from there. Along the way, we meet a variety of supporting characters who participated in the complicated catch-and-release of Paine's remains and others who searched for them as they remained perpetually out-of-reach. And we get a fascinating history lesson to boot. My favorite moments in the book, though, are those in which Collins shares his own insights, perspectives and notions. He writes: We forget  all the time . We forget nearly every single impression that passes through our minds. What we ate for lunch: who our roommate was ten years ago: what we paid for a soda in 1982: what we just came from the living room to the kitchen for. It is constant and vital, and we only notice it if everyday useful things go missing. Every moment gets thrown out like so much garbage - which, in a sense, is what the past is. Memory is a toxin, and its overretention - the constant replaying of the past - is the hallmark of stress disorders and clinical depression. The elimination of memory is a bodily function, like the elimination of urine. Stop urinating and you have renal failure: stop forgetting and you go mad. And so it is that the details of nearly every single day that we have lived, nearly every single moment of each day, nearly every person that we have met and spoken to,  the exact wording of the paragraph that you have just read ...   Gone. The Trouble With Tom  is overflowing with these thoughtful asides. It revisits long-since-discarded ideologies and theories. It depicts a history in which disparate characters and uncommon worlds collide. It paints the past as a series of mishaps and missteps, all stumbling sideways, askance and askew, but always in the general direction of the future. It is a remarkable book. If only I could remember what it said.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1582343675/qid=1131414110/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-8940066-2597754?v=glance&s=books&n=507846", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000AKXD7M/ref=pd_sim_b_4/103-3334217-5347027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance", "http://http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0312300336/ref=pd_sim_b_1/103-3334217-5347027?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/trouble-with-tom.html", "title": "\nThe Trouble With Tom\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 12, 2005", "body": "\nOne of Bud's favorite activity centers at Kindergarten has two easels, bright paint, thick paintbrushes, and reams of blank canvases of construction paper. Several times a week he brings home a masterpiece, rolled up in an rubber band, sometimes so fresh the paint is still sticky. One such masterpiece, a swirling collage of blobs and streaks of primary colors, is framed and hanging on the wall of our family room. Bud is proud of his artwork, and we are appreciative patrons of his art. A couple of weeks ago he bounded out of school with a rolled-up paper peeking out of his backpack, but when I got it home and unrolled it I was speechless. There was a strip of blue paint across the top and penciled in next to it, in adult print, was the word \"sky.\" There was a green strip of paint at the bottom (\"grass\"), a brown strip up the center with a green blob on top (\"tree\"), red dots on the green (\"apples\"), a yellow blob near the blue strip (\"sun\"), and an orange blob near the green (\"cat\"). It looked exactly like the work of a typical Kindergartener. It looked, in other words,  nothing  like Bud. My initial reaction was that he must have mistakenly taken another child's painting. But I flipped it over and, sure enough, there were Bud's initials on the back. I was completely shaken.  What is going on in that classroom? What are they trying to do? What are they trying to make him  be ?  What are they doing to him? I began to wonder if I had completely misread the cues I'd gotten from the educators who work with Bud. I thought we were collaborating. I thought we were on the same page. I thought we shared the same philosophy. But this - this - this PAINTING changed everything. I started rehearsing the conversation in my head. I pictured myself approaching his teacher, a wonderful, insightful, caring, tireless woman whom Bud adores, and who makes Bud feel like the center of the world. And I saw myself speaking, wondering if I'd be risking everything, wondering if my words would cast aside any progress we'd made, or - worse - if they'd reveal that there had never been any progress and that our mutual understanding was mere illusion. I knew what I had to say:  \"That picture that Bud brought home: it was jarring to me. That's not how he paints. That's not how he expresses himself. That's not  who he is .\"  I wanted to tell her that I was concerned about the message that picture sent to me about the educational philosophy being used with Bud in the classroom: that it indicated a lack of respect for him, for where he is, for what he can do. It told me that there is a box -one single box labeled \"correct\" -and that the goal in this classroom was to make Bud pretend to fit into it - not, as I thought, to help him explore what he already has inside him and help him bring all the best parts of himself to the surface. It told me that the creative, colorful, dynamic artwork he brought home was not good enough. Worse - it told me that the message sent to  him  was that his masterpieces were not good enough. It told me that the product - and not the process - was at the center of the educational experience. It told me that they didn't  get  Bud, and that it seemed they weren't  trying  to get him. It was a daunting message to think about delivering to a woman I like very much. But the next day I steeled my resolve, took a deep breath, and entered the classroom. I lingered until the other parents were gone, then I launched into the speech I'd rehearsed. \"That picture that Bud brought home...\" I started. \"I know,\" she said. \"It was jarring to me.\" \"It was jarring to me, too. Someone else was working with him at the time. But we've talked about it - you know, this is a learning process for all of us - and it won't happen again. It was very well intentioned, but...\" \"But it's not Bud,\" I finished. \"No, it's not Bud,\" she sighed. She went on, and unrehearsed and impromptu, gave my practiced speech back to me. We are in synch. We're on the same page. We share the same philosophy. \"Now,\" she said. \"I've just got to figure out a way to be his teacher for the next twelve years.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/art-of-education.html", "title": "\nThe art of education\n"},

There were two primary groups of children there: loud, rambunctious 4-to-6-year-old boys and louder, squealing-and-shrieking 10-to-12-year-old girls. Almost all of the other children were strangers to Bud. And yet there he was in the thick of things - engaged, smiling, and extraordinarily  well-regulated . He was so well-regulated, in fact, that when the boys' sledding activity turned into a game of human obstacle course he laughed as boys hurled themselves in front of his sled as it sped down the hill, resulting in a jumble of boy arms and boy legs and boy faces covered in snow. He waited patiently for his turn as five boys shared two sleds, and he asked other boys \"is it my turn now?\" He was unphased when, without warning, Clay jumped onto his sled as it zipped by and held tightly onto Bud's back and they flew down the hill together. He didn't even seem to notice the mayhem that ensued as the girls attacked the boys in a snowball fight that continued until Clay's mom noticed and started ushering them all inside. He didn't  seem  to notice. But once they were inside and he had the sleds and the hill to himself he turned to me with a twinkle in his eye and gathered up a mitten full of snow. \"I throw at you,\" he said tossing the flakes of snow toward me in a gentle flurry. \"I got you, Mama!\" Inside, Bud took lots of breaks from the crowd and made his way to the playroom where he discovered an electronic keyboard. \"Look, everybody!\" he shouted down the stairs. \"It's Bud's Dance Party!\" He played happily upstairs, sometimes on his own and sometimes among a squall of shrieking children. But he joined the group quite a bit as well. He played Pin the Nose on the Snowman - blindfold, spinning, and all. He joined the group for singing Happy Birthday and eating ice cream. He had a perfectly wonderful time, and when it was time to go he protested: \"But I want to stay at the party! I want to stay at Clay's house!\" Clay's mom promised that he could come back another day, and he grudgingly agreed to leave. What a milestone we've reached. The best part is that Bud  knows  it. He's been talking about the party since we left, reminiscing about Bud's Dance Party, jumping on my back to recreate Bud And Clay's Excellent Sled Adventure, blowing his party blower till he just can't blow no more. There's a new aura of confidence around Bud these days. And why not?

{"date": "Monday, November 21, 2005", "body": "\nOne of the great ironies in my life is that I teach a college course in Interpersonal Communication. To the students enrolled in the class and the college that employs me, I am (on some level) considered an expert on the subject. And yet, my son - the student who gets the greatest number of hours under my tutelage - finds that this is the very subject that evades him most. There is some sort of cosmic somersault at work here, I think. I have found, though, that my life with Bud has greatly informed my teaching, and that the material I teach has provided a valuable lens through which to view Bud's strengths and challenges. I recently added a new perspective to the mix when I attended a seminar by Barry Prizant on the  SCERTS  model, which is \"a comprehensive, multidisciplinary framework designed to enhance the communication and socio-emotional abilities of young children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.\" Since the summer, we have been integrating  RDI  into our activities with Bud at home, and I really believe in the program. The downside of RDI, however, is that it is complicated. I've given the team who works with Bud some basics of the philosophy - slow down, use fewer words, wait 45 seconds for a response, use declarative language - and they've been great about implementing them, but the bulk of the work we do with RDI will continue to be at home with the guidance of an outside consultant. SCERTS, on the other hand, is designed to be a curriculum-based assessment for use by professionals who work with children in the classroom setting. It is in line philosophically with RDI, but is packaged in a more user-friendly way with clear assessment tools that yield specific goals and objectives appropriate for each individual child. It is a program that I think Bud's team will find helpful, and even inspiring. The SCERTS program addresses three domains for assessment and intervention: Social Communication, Emotional Regulation, and Transactional Support. Social Communication and Emotional Regulation are, of course, two main areas of challenge for children on the spectrum. In the area of Social Communication, SCERTS sets as the overriding goal \"to help a child become an increasingly competent, confident, and active participant in social activities and events,\" by enhancing the child's capacity for joint attention and reciprocity, expression of emotion, and understanding of others' emotions. It seeks to help children become more conventional communicators and to enhance their abilities for pretend play and symbolic behavior. It seeks to help them become full partners in the intricate dance of communication. Through a focus on Emotional Regulation, SCERTS helps children achieve and maintain an optimal level of emotional arousal to maximize their \"availability\" for learning and engagement. The focus in ER is trifold: self-regulation (using strategies to regulate independently), mutual regulation (achieving regulation through social transaction), and recovery from dysregulation (being able to employ these strategies in times of extreme dysregulation, when the child is no longer available for the learning process.) Transactional Support is an area not addressed in RDI, but is extremely important in the educational setting. TS focuses on the collaborative efforts of everyone (teachers, parents, caregivers, siblings, peers) who work with a child so that the same goals and strategies are infused across a child's daily activities. Fundamentally, SCERTS is about integration: integrating work across disciplines, so that SLPs, OTs, PTs, classroom teachers, special educators, school psychologists and parents are all working from the same guide book; integrating approaches and philosophies that reach core deficits, instead of focusing on treating symptoms; integrating strategies for communication development with strategies for emotional and sensory regulation. And so I start the process of integrating SCERTS into our own little grassroots approach to ASD. It's not too difficult, really. SCERTS, RDI, my class in Interpersonal Communication: they all have the same goals, when you break them down. To use an analogy from RDI's Steve Gutstein, we are all trying to help our students become \"broadband communicators\", to trade in their 2800 baud modems for high speed cable, to download and interpret volumes of information in an instant and respond appropriately. SCERTS encourages students to simultaneously share attention, share affect, share intention, and share symbolic systems. RDI promotes dynamic intelligence through the development of emotional referencing, social coordination, declarative language, flexible thinking, relational information processing, hindsight, and foresight. And my class in Interpersonal Communication teaches students to view themselves and others as sender-receivers, to be intentional with and attuned to verbal, nonverbal, and paraverbal messages, and to remain aware of their filters of perception and attribution. Different words; strikingly similar goals. So I take it back, what I said about teaching Interpersonal Communication and having a child with ASD. I was wrong. It's not a cosmic somersault; it's a cosmic cartwheel. It's not one of the great ironies in my life; it's one of the very good fortunes.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.barryprizant.com"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/communication-and-integration.html", "title": "\nCommunication and integration\n"},

So this year there was no pirate costume, no trick-or-treating-and-trying-to-hold-the-candy-bag-while-keeping-hands-on-ears, no Kindergarten classroom party or school costume parade, no nothing.

{"date": "Friday, September 30, 2005", "body": "\nThere is a soundtrack in our house these days. Either we're listening to the CD player, or we're watching the DVD documentary, or we're singing it in two-part harmony. Bud and I are both in love with  Paul McCartney's  new album,  Chaos and Creation in the Backyard . Because he is more skilled in this area than I, Bud has pretty much memorized the lyrics to the entire album. He knows the tracks in order and, in fact, often calls them by their track numbers. His current favorite is 9. To the rest of us it is the track called  Riding to Vanity Fair , and is uncharacteristically (for McCartney, and for Bud) dark and bitter. It is a song about being betrayed by a friend and, though in interviews McCartney says it's not about anyone in particular, it appears to be directed toward his former long-time PR man, Geoff Baker. The conflict between Baker and Paul's new wife, Heather Mills McCartney, has long been reported in the press and speculation that the negative press Heather has gotten since her engagement to Paul was spoon-fed by Baker has been rampant. McCartney sings, \"The definition of friendship apparently ought to be showing support for the one that you love. I was open to friendship, but you didn't seem to have any to spare while you were riding to Vanity Fair.\" Unsurprisingly, one of the interviews in which Heather was called out to defend herself against rumors of fights, pre-nuptial agreements, and conflict with McCartney's daughters, was in the magazine Vanity Fair. You don't need to do a lot of searching to read between the lines. I have to say, the song is a lot brighter when sung in Bud's lilting little voice, but I imagine his teachers wonder what's going on at home when he walks around singing lyrics like,  \"I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m gonna do - I\u2019ll try to take my mind off you. And now that you don\u2019t need my help, I\u2019ve used the time to think about myself.\" Another of Bud's favorite tracks is the bright and upbeat  English Tea . This song sounds so-much-like-the-Beatles-except-not-the-Beatles that the first few times I heard it I could swear it was  The Rutles . It is instantly familiar, like a warm, comfortable, broken-in-just-the-way-you-like-it sweater. It also, McCartney is quick to point out, features the word \"peradventure\" (meaning perchance, or perhaps) and he wonders if it may just catch on so that people all over the world will start saying \"peradventure I'll have a cup of coffee...\" Bud and I are both especially fond of the acoustic  Jenny Wren , which is classic McCartney in the  Yesterday / Blackbird / Here Today / Calico Skies  tradition. It's a quiet song about finding your voice when life's situations can make you feel powerless. And we do a MEAN duet on this one. My favorite moment on the album is the one-two punch near the end -  This Never Happened Before , followed by  Anyway . They are both love songs, which is often McCartney at his best. And, like the rest of the album, these tracks are not overproduced. They feel organic and homegrown. It's as though you're sitting around the living room and they slowly waft up out of the fireplace and fill the room with warm air. And both tracks have those McCartney chord progressions that somehow create a physiological response, gently lifting up your heart and slowly rolling it over in a way that is startling and pleasant all at the same time. Chaos and Creation in the Backyard  continues an evolution for McCartney that began with  Flaming Pie  and continued through  Driving Rain . These are the songs that trace his life from Linda's diagnosis and battle with breast cancer, through his loss and grief, and towards a hopeful (if less naively positive) future. This is a more introspective and tentative Paul McCartney, but in many ways it is also a more human, more accessible Paul McCartney. And for a six-year-old boy with autism and a mom who loves him, an album filled with hope and possibility in the face of challenge and despair provides a soundtrack that feels just about right.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.paulmccartney.com", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00004ZEU2/103-3334217-5347027?v=glance"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/09/chaos-and-creation-at-buds-house.html", "title": "\nChaos and Creation at Bud's house\n"},

Last night, when I posted about Paul Collins's new book,  The Trouble With Tom , I quoted a passage from Collins about memory and shortly after that my mind began to boil over. Collins wrote, Every moment gets thrown out like so much garbage - which, in a sense, is what the past is. Memory is a toxin, and its overretention - the constant replaying of the past - is the hallmark of stress disorders and clinical depression. The elimination of memory is a bodily function, like the elimination of urine. Stop urinating and you have renal failure: stop forgetting and you go mad. So, what if I've been looking at it backwards? What if Bud's \"splinter skills\" - remembering volumes of video dialogue with appropriate inflection and dialect, remembering the lyrics to every song he's ever heard, remembering the track number of every song on every CD, entering a store he was in once before several years ago and knowing instantly what he played with there - what if all these things are not because of an extraordinary ability or even an obsessive compulsion to remember? What if they are because of a diminished capacity to  forget ? The more I think about it, the more sense it makes. Perhaps Bud is overretaining some one-off interaction with a dog that happened so quickly I didn't even see it, but has rendered him pathologically fearful of dogs ever since. Perhaps it's the overretention of information that produces scripting echolalia; if he is unable to forget these lines, maybe obsessively reciting them is the only means he has of purging, of letting off some steam. Perhaps it's the overretention of memory that prevents him from cycling down with the rest of us at sunset, that keeps him sleepless, that wakes him early. Doesn't it make sense that he'd be reluctant to interact with new people if he ran the risk of having to carry them all with him forever? Wouldn't it make him want to stick to the videos, the experiences, the foods, the  everything  he already knows he likes if he knew he wouldn't be able to sort out and discard the videos, experiences, foods, and everything that he didn't like? Wouldn't it make him want to put his hands over his ears in new situations to try to keep some of it from getting in? Maybe this is where the  computer metaphor for the autistic brain  makes sense. Perhaps Bud's brain has enormous capacity for memory, but is unable to selectively delete the contents of his hard drive that he no longer needs. Maybe he needs help to defrag. I think about the imperative messages I deliver to him all day in an effort to help him to focus, tune in, and attend to the world around him: \"Listen, Bud.\" \"Pay attention.\" \"Look at this.\" Perhaps I'm overlooking the most important imperative of all: \"Forget about it.\" \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mysonhasautism.blogspot.com/2005/11/roll-over-bettelheim-131.html", "http://mysonhasautism.blogspot.com/2005/10/whats-wrong-with-computer-metaphor-of.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/only-memory.html", "title": "\nOnly a memory\n"},

We met Clay at the open house the day before school started, and since his was the name I remembered it was the one I used as we prepared for the first day of school. \"And you'll play on the playground with your teacher and the other kids, like Clay...\" Every day after school we have walked from the classroom to the car at about the same time as Clay and his mom. And every day I have prompted Bud to say goodbye to Clay by name. We did this throughout Bud's two and a half years of preschool with a myriad of other children, so it never occurred to me that anything special was happening. Bud did talk about Clay at home, though. When I asked who he liked at school he named his teacher, then his aide, then Clay. When I asked who he played with, he named his teacher, then his aide, then Clay. Last week he told me he wanted Clay to come and play at Bud's house. But I sort of thought Bud was just trying to give me the \"right\" answer when I asked a question. Yesterday as we were leaving school, Bud - because he has the very sweet habit of ALWAYS telling on himself - announced \"I can take it home with me!\", which prompted me to frisk him and find each one of his pockets stuffed with toy fruit from the classroom. We headed back to the classroom to return the contraband, then I spent some time chatting with Bud's teacher. It was about 15 minutes later when we finally headed back to the parking lot. As we approached I saw that Clay was sitting on the lawn by our car, and I heard him say \"Mom! Here he comes!\" Clay's mom got out of the car and said to me, \"Clay insisted that we couldn't leave until he said goodbye to Bud.\" They had waited 15 minutes, with Clay's mom wondering if we had walked to an appointment somewhere, and with Clay steadfast in his resolve to wait us out. Bud gave Clay a high five, and they both said goodbye and climbed into their respective cars. It took every ounce of restraint I had to keep from scooping Clay up and smothering him with kisses. Clay likes Bud. No one told him he had to. No one even suggested that he should. He just likes Bud. He likes Bud for Bud.

And yet, this mercury-based preservative continued to be used in children's vaccines through the late 90's, despite mounting evidence that there could be a connection between mercury in vaccines and a rapid increase in the incidence of autism. Eli Lilly then climbed into the pocket of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who slipped a rider into the homeland security act of 2002 that shielded Eli Lilly from subpeonas. Eli Lilly is also the maker of Strattera, the medication that has had the single most positive effect for Bud of all  the interventions we've tried so far . After a summer full of trials-and-errors with  medication  (Ritalin, Adderall, Adderall plus Strattera), we tried 18 mg of Strattera alone. It's been about two weeks and the results have been astonishing. Bud's verbal skills - especially his ability to engage in back-and-forth conversation - have taken a huge leap forward. He is less distracted. He uses less echolalic scripting. He has less sensory overload. His transition to Kindergarten has gone beautifully. And - knock on wood - so far there have not been any negative side effects. I know for certain it's the Strattera. One day in the past week I picked him up from school, and the teachers looked harried as they handed him off. Bud had his hands over his ears, which I only then realized he hadn't been doing lately. In the car on the way home he was perseverating on a script and I couldn't get him to stop. I tried to figure out what was going on, and it hit me: I had forgotten to give him his medication that morning. (So I had sixty seconds of \"I am a horrible mother,\" immediately followed by the smug satisfaction of having (inadvertantly) run my own blind trial.) I will admit there is a dark place in the back of my mind that entertains the conspiracy theory that goes like this: Eli Lilly is a for-profit corporation developing drugs used to manage the symptoms of neurological disorders. In a capitalist ecomony, profit is driven by supply and demand. In order to maximize profit for their product, Eli Lilly must strengthen the demand for it. An increase in the incidence of neurological disorders means an increased demand for their product, which means an increased profit. Eli Lilly has another product which could increase the incidence of neurological disorders... But, really, if I want to continue to get out of bed in the morning and make it through each day, I can entertain the thought, but I can't really go there. For right now, Strattera is having a tremendous effect on Bud, and Eli Lilly will continue to get my money. But my mind, and my heart, remain conflicted.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0616-31.htm"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/09/my-lovehate-relationship-with-eli.html", "title": "\nMy love/hate relationship with Eli Lilly\n"},

This is a new school for Bud, and he doesn't know any of the other kids. The day is structured so that they start out on the playground. Bud was very brave as we got to school, and even smiled for a picture. We headed out onto the playground and I made a beeline for the playground aides and introduced Bud to them, explaining that he didn't know any of the other kids and that he is autistic. One of them blinked at me. \"We're just the playground aides.\" \"Right,\" I said. \"You need to know that he might leave the playground and head for the woods.\" \"Oh,\" she said. \"We'll keep a close eye on him.\" Bud walked over to the slide and stood by as hoards of children swirled and romped around him. He was quiet, but didn't seem anxious or overwhelmed. He didn't even put his hands over his ears. He just stood. Not wanting to drag it out for him any longer than necessary, I said the goodbye we've been practicing for weeks and made the long walk to the car. I couldn't resist the temptation to look back over my shoulder, and saw Bud watching me. He waved as my broken heart and I got in the car and drove away. Okay, I admit it. Once I was out of sight, I parked the car and walked back to peer around the side of the building. Bud was standing in the same place, but instead of watching the parking lot he was watching the kids. I went back to the car and drove away again. Okay, okay. I left the school, then circled back around to do a drive-by from a distance. Bud was in the middle of a group of kids and teachers. But he didn't seem upset, and no one seemed to be consoling him. I finally screwed up the courage to leave. It is taking every ounce of strength I have to keep from sneaking down to the school to peek in the windows.

Bud came bounding out of school at the end of the day with a big smile, announcing that \"school was fun!\" He says his favorite part was when his teacher gave him a kiss. As we bounced toward the car he waved and shouted over his shoulder, \"Bye, string cheese! See you tomorrow!\" (He brought string cheese in his lunchbox today and apparently only ate half.)

I don't know this boy or this family, but I just can't stop thinking about them. This is a scenario that plays on all of the darkest fears that I try to keep buried in the furthest recesses of my mind and heart. We have not pursued chelation with Bud. In fact, though the thimerosal/ mercury link rings true to me on an intellectual level I find that I have been unable to deal with the possibility of it on an emotional level. How can the universe possibly make sense if something I did to keep my son safe actually did him irreparable harm? When I allow the anxiety to surface, this is the form it always takes. Because we know so little about autism - because we don't know what causes it - because we don't know what helps it - because we don't know what could cure it - how can we as parents be anything other than immobilized with fear? Who do we trust? How do we trust? If I hadn't gotten him vaccinated, would Bud be healthy and happy now? Or would he have died from a complication brought on by chicken pox? Or would he be just as he is now: happy, healthy, and autistic? I can't know. I will never know. And that is what makes the dark days almost unbearable. Because if I can't even see the path that brought us here clearly in retrospect, how can I possibly envision the road ahead? When I give Bud his daily dose of Strattera, I experience simultaneous hopefulness and dread. Am I giving him a fighting chance? Or am I making a horrible mistake? Is Bud's doctor our greatest ally? Or is Big Pharma our most insidious enemy? And so, as I follow this unfolding story I cannot help but cast myself in the role of mother to this poor little boy in Pennsylvania. I can feel to my core how much I love him. I know that I will do anything in my power to give him every opportunity to have a full, rich life. And then I watch, as in a nightmare, while I stand rooted to the floor, unable to speak, unable to move, unable to scream, as the very action I took to save him somehow, cruelly and inexplicably, takes him away from me.

He could work a CD player by the time he was 2, and since that time he has had distinct musical preferences and a vast CD collection of his own. He also has an uncanny ear for melody and could sing in tune well before he talk. Up until now, his tastes have run from the age-appropriate - the Wiggles, Laurie Berkner, Hap Palmer, Raffi, Sesame Street - to the things he has adopted from the collections of Mama, Daddy, Nana, and Papa, which include Paul McCartney, Sam Bush, John Denver, and the Irish Tenors. But yesterday he was singing to himself while he was playing, and I started listening to him. It was clearly not a song I'd heard him sing before, but it was somehow familiar: \"An she be weeeeeeeeeee be loooooove... an she be weeeeeeeee be loooooove.\" \"Bud,\" I said, startled. \"Are you singing Maroon 5?\" \"An she be weeeeeee be looooooove...\" So I started singing. \"Bud, is that the song that goes, \"I don't mind spending every day out on your corner in the pouring rain... and she will be loved?\" \"Yeah,\" he said matter-of-factly.

I don't own that CD, and neither does anyone else in the family. \"Where did you hear that song?\" \"In the car.\" I called to my mother in the other room, \"Did you have the radio on in the car today?\" She did (which is unusual, because Bud is usually very insistent on listening to his own music in the car, and she usually lets him.)

Most of the jokes he tells are ones he's memorized from Zoboomafoo, like: \"Knock knock.\" Who's there? \"Panther.\" Panther who? \"Panther no panth, I'm going swimming!\" He's got a million of 'em. Sometimes he takes a more surreal approach and just tells the punch line, like: \"Ants. And maybe uncles!\" I don't think he understands why any of these jokes are funny. He just knows that they are intended to make people laugh, and is always the first one laughing once the joke is out. Tonight he was repeatedly scripting a joke from an Arthur computer game, in which Arthur's dad is giving the kids ice cream. \"Look,\"  says dad.  \"We have chocolate, strawberry... and mocha almond spinach.\" \"Eeeeeewwww!\"  shriek the kids. \"Just kidding,\"  says dad. \"Dad, that's not funny!\"  say the kids. And actually, because Bud is not familiar with mocha or almonds, his version of the joke includes  \"milk on spinach.\"  The way we \"tell\" this joke is to take turns being dad, or being the kids. After a few rounds, Bud started  substituting words  to make the joke his own: \"Look! We have pancakes, jello... and chicken nuggets!\"  or  \"Look! We have grilled cheese, apples... and bananas!\" After a couple of rounds like that I decided to try deconstructing the joke for him. I explained that the reason it was funny is that the dad named two very yummy foods and the kids expected him to name another yummy food, but then he fooled them and named somthing really yucky instead. I gave him a couple of examples, like \"Look! We have grapes, pretzels... and bugs.\" He caught on almost immediately.  \"Look!\"  he said slowly.  \"We have apples, waffles............ and banana hay!\" \"Eeeeeeewwwwww!\"  I squealed, and he squirmed with delight. He made a joke and he knew it. And not only that, he knew WHY it was funny! He continued telling me versions of his joke, then wanted to take turns so that I would make up new versions too. Every version was different, but every one ended in something yucky. I realized quickly, though, that in Bud's versions the third options always took the form of \"something good-something yucky.\" So in addition to banana hay I was offered apple branches, orange juice leaves, and the like. I imagine this is because in his original joke, the punchline \"milk on spinach\" mixes the yummy milk with the yucky spinach. And, purist that he is, he needs to stay true to the format. I am absolutely delighted with these jokes. This seems like an enormous step forward for Bud - with reciprocity, problem-solving, creativity, flexibility, language, and emotion-sharing. The only problem is, I've suddenly got this odd craving for pretzel dirt...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/08/best-joke-ever.html", "title": "\nThe best joke ever\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, August 20, 2005", "body": "\nIn a  recent post , Tamar recounts a visit to the playground during which she encountered a little boy and his father. The father explained that his son was speech delayed, but did not indicate - indeed, did not even seem to know - that his son was, for lack of a better phrase,  from France . Tamar asks a question, startling in it's simplicity because it masks so many levels of complexity: \"How do you tell a stranger that his son is autistic?\" Of course, the question begets so many other questions:  Should  you tell him? Is it any of your business? Who are you to make a diagnosis? What are the implications for this child if his parent continues to live in ignorance or (worse?) denial? Do we-who-have-been-there have an obligation to connect with others who we know (in the way that only we-who-have-been-there know) will share our journey? Do we have any right to drag someone into a journey for which they may not be ready? Tamar asks for feedback, for future reference, for this boy and for the others (because there will be others) who follow. She asks: If you're reading this and you too are a parent of a spectrum kid and if someone came up to you in the park pre-diagnosis and said \"Get your kid checked out, he [or she] is in trouble,\" how would you have responded?  Her question took me back about four years. When Bud was just under two we took a Kindermusik class. It was the first time I saw him around children his own age, and the developmental difference was striking. While the other kids sat and listened to stories, participated in simple hand-movement song games, and played instruments appropriately, Bud spent his time running, flicking on and off the lights, throwing instruments, and melting down. After one particularly difficult class, another mom said to me \"I give you credit that you keep coming,\" which rightly or wrongly I took to mean \"Your child is disrupting the experience for the rest of us.\" So I lingered while everyone else packed up, and I caught the class instructor one-on-one. She'd worked with a lot of young kids and she had a degree in early childhood education; I wanted her take on what was going on, and whether or not we should withdraw from the class. \"I worked with a little boy who was a lot like Bud at the last daycare I was at,\" she said. \"Obviously, similar behavior can mean really different things, but that little boy had a diagnosis of PDD-NOS.\" I think it was the first time I'd heard those letters, which are now so familiar they feel like my own initials. I stammered out some sort of response, and I'm fairly certain she wondered if she'd said too much. \"He's doing great now,\" she added with a smile. \"In a regular classroom.\" \"Really?\" I asked, secretly relieved that this was just a phase. \"Well, with an aide. But really much better.\" \"Oh.\" I wonder if she replayed that conversation a thousand times, too. I wonder if she thought of a hundred other things she could have said to spare my feelings or to avoid overstepping her boundaries. But for as difficult as that moment was, I am incredibly thankful that she said what she said. Unlike her,  I  had never known another child like Bud. And to me, Bud was (and continues to be) perfect, so it probably would have taken me a lot longer to look into early intervention if she hadn't given me some letters to google. So my vote, for Tamar, for myself, for any others who find themselves in the situation, is to say something. Say anything. Say it inarticulately if you must, and say it with care. \"I see. I know.

{"date": "Sunday, July 24, 2005", "body": "\nAs many of you know, several months ago we made the  difficult decision  that it was time to try medication for Bud. As we have moved through this maze of trial and error I've been combing the blogs looking for some stories of actual people with actual children with ASD and their actual experiences with these medications. There is very little out there. So, for the sake of those who will someday google their way into this blog, here is a run-down of our experiences so far. Our first trial was with Ritalin - first 5 mg, then 7.5 mg, then 10 mg. It had no effect whatsoever. Next we tried Adderall - again a steady increase from 5 to 7.5 to 10. Adderall was a mixed bag. We saw great results - much less scripted language and more conversational language, greater focus, more pretend play. But the negative effects were significant: agitation and constant chatter or humming (not scripted language, but definitely not normal), sleeplessness, a major \"crash\" when the medication wore off - uncharacteristic temper and tears, accompanied by hitting his head (a behavior we hadn't seen in a long time), heightened anxiety, and loss of appetite. He also looked terrible - pale, drawn, with dark circles under his eyes. It was clearly not working. Our most recent trial has been with a combination of 7.5 mg of Adderall and 10 mg of Strattera. Bud's doctor said it would take about two weeks to see the effects of Strattera. We saw them on day 1. Bud has been focused, calm, and engaged. On day 1, he participated in the group movement games at school - something they'd never seen before. They said that he usually looks like he's not paying attention to them and they had no idea that he'd been learning the songs and movements all along. He's using a lot less scripted language and much more conversational language. He's less obsessive about tv and computer time and is focused on pretend play. He's sleeping well and his appetite is back. And he looks like himself again - robust and healthy. We're feeling very optimistic. Here's something I couldn't find on blogs, though I searched high and low: just how does one administer medication to a child with a limited diet whose sensory integration issues make texture and color of paramount importance? Here's what we did: Ritalin: Ritalin comes in a white pill that can be crushed. Mixing it with ice cream was not successful, because the ice cream was too smooth to mask the powder. As Bud said \"It's seeds. I want regular.\" Mixing it with applesauce worked well. Adderall: Adderall comes in blue pills that can be crushed. However, it turns applesauce blue which was not acceptable. (\"I want regular.\") Adderall powder, however, dissolves (no seeds) so it can be mixed into juice. It also dissolves into yogurt, turning Rockin' Raspberry from a dark pink to a light purple, which was acceptable. Strattera: Strattera only comes in capsules, which cannot be opened. This fact sent me into a panic, but as it turns out this has been the easiest medication to administer. I created a sticker chart with a big pay-off: 5 stickers yields the Boobah video he's been wanting for ages and I've been refusing to buy. Each time he takes his medication he gets one sticker. I put the capsule in jello, and he washes it down with juice. Easy way to earn a Boobah movie. (We're now on sticker chart 2: 9 doses earns a Teletubbies book. I find the sticker charts work best when the pay-off is something he knows he's not going to get any other way.) One other important step in the process: we practiced with mini M&M's before we moved up to the actual capsules. First I gave him a couple of M&M's to eat, to remind him that he liked them. Then he got to earn his first sticker by swallowing the M&M in jello without chewing. Once he mastered that, we moved on to the capsule. It worked like a charm. There's our story. I'm still interested in hearing other people's experiences with medication, so if you've got a story to tell, please comment away!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/07/medication-update.html", "title": "\nMedication update\n"},

Her friend Bennett has been taken along on this pilgrammage, which involves setting out at 6:30 on a cold February morning to catch the Lincoln's Birthday wreath ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial before the Seward-site highlight for the day. She writes: I lead him around the corner to the Court of Claims Building. In the coutryard, past the fountain, I point at a plaque, chirping \"Ta-da! This was the site of Secretary of State Seward's house where he was stabbed in bed the night Lincoln was shot!\" Bennett looks at the plaque, then back at me, wondering, \"This is my surprise? A plaque about Seward?\" \"Uh-huh!\" He doesn't say anything for a while, just stands there reading the plaque, shaking his head...(then) looks at me, rolls his eyes, and silently trudges out of the courtyard... \"Seward plaque\"... has become our synonym for disapointment.

I can take it. My people have been getting Seward plaqued for millennia.\" Vowell also interjects (progressive) political commentary on the current state of affairs throughout the book. She draws a particularly interesting parallel between the state of the nation around the time of the McKinley administration and during the current Bush administration.

The Big Chill  is the story of old friends who come together following the suicide of a mutual friend; they spend a weekend engaged in introspection and analysis, each using the others as barometers by which to compare the level of his own misery, and finding comfort and direction in the process.  A Long Way Down  is the story of four strangers who meet on New Year's Eve on a London rooftop where they have all come with thoughts of killing themselves, but instead spend the next three months engaged in introspection and analysis, using each other as barometers by which to compare their levels of misery, finding comfort and direction in the process. It sounds like a downer, but the book is full of Hornby's characteristic warmth and humor and the characters he creates are compelling, if not always endearing. Surprisingly, the character who seemed most artificial to me was the most Horbyesque character: JJ, a down-on-his luck musician whose band has just broken up and whose girlfriend has dumped him. JJ is a character that Hornby could bring to life with ease... except that this time Hornby made him American. Hornby is quite clearly British to the core; as a result, JJ seems more like a caricature than an actual person. Have you ever seen an American character on a British comedy ( As Time Goes By ,  The Office ,  My Family,  whatever)? They all tend to reflect the British  idea  of an American - loud, quick-talking, superficial, and cliche. And while many Americans are loud, quick-talking, superficial, and cliche, I haven't met any yet that are exclusively those things - certainly not in that unidimensional sit-com way. My issue with JJ is similar. He is not the same boarish American of BBC-TV, but he talks the way I imagine British people think Americans talk, instead of the way Americans actually talk. And since each chapter of the book is written in the voice and perspective of one of the four main characters, about 25% of it seemed just a half-step off. Hornby is much more successful in making real Martin, a morning chat-show celebrity who has been in prison and the tabloids for sleeping with a 15-year-old; Jess, the troubled daughter of a government junior minister; and, especially, Maureen, the middle-aged mother of a profoundly disabled young man, who has only the Catholic church as an outside connection in her life. A Long Way Down  is a great read. Fans of Hornby's early work -  Fever Pitch ,  High Fidelity ,  About A Boy  - may be surprised by the greater complexity of this novel, which is similar in tone to 2001's  How to be Good . But to me, the only thing really wrong with Nick Hornby books is that there are just too few of them.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/08/long-way-down.html", "title": "\nA Long Way Down\n"},

I've decided to stop doing that because of an essay I read recently. It was written by Glen David Gold, author of  Carter Beats the Devil , and was published in  Bookmark Now: Writing in Unreaderly Times , which is a compilation of essays by mostly twenty- and thirty-something writers about the writing process and the writerly life. In Gold's essay, titled  Your Own Personal Satan , he comes clean in a Writers Anonymous sort of way about an addiction he's working hard to beat: googling himself. At the time of publication, Gold had identified 6,950 pages that mentioned him and he had set out to view them all. The tongue-in-cheek essay, in which Gold takes us through the anticipation and let-down he experiences in his quest, is very funny. But it's also eye-opening. It had honestly never occurred to me that an author might google his way into my blog and be insulted by what he read. (And, coincidentally, the point was reinforced because I had, in fact,  written previously  about Glen David Gold, and while I believe I was very complimentary I don't know that Gold would see it the same way. Hi Glen, if you're reading.) So, anyway, I'm not going to keep an ongoing list of books I buy but never get around to reading  (she read Harry Potter before she read my book?)  or books I've read but didn't like  (but that's an absurd interpretation of what I was trying to say!)

There have been thunderstorms brewing outside since morning. The air is thick and heavy and is waiting, waiting, waiting for the coming storm that threatens and looms. And poor little Bud has been a mess all day. This morning he was uncharacteristically weepy. \"Bud's sad,\" he said, as his Nana helped him get ready for school and talked about all the fun things he'd do there. He only responded with more tears. \"But you don't love school!\" he told her. And as I loaded him into the car for the long mournful drive to school, he enumerate the many reasons why this was a bad idea: \"But I'm too big. School is too early. But school is loud. It's too late for school, Mama.\" Somehow he made his way through his time at school (coincidentally the day his kindergarten teacher chose to come and observe him... figures, right?) The teachers didn't get into detail but said \"he wasn't himself.\" After school, Nana took him to Dunkin' Donuts - usually a favorite treat. But the Munchkins went uneaten and Bud went into manic phase, approaching truck drivers with uncharacteristic bravado and loudly scripting from Sesame Street, \"Are YOU my mystery friend???\" Tonight there was a happy lull while he played Mr. Potato Head with his dad, and I made the very grave error of allowing him to stay up much too late. As a result, bedtime was a dreary mess of tears, sobs, snot, kicking, scripting and pleas that made very little sense: \"No, Mama, No! What are you doing?! Stop it, Mama! Waitwaitwaitwaitwaitwaitmama! Mama, no!\" I'm sure if the neighbors could hear him they'd think I was beating him, and not sitting next to him trying to read Curious George. I piled him into his swing to try to get some sensory regulation going, but he kept the monologue running: \"Oh no no no! Mama, I need something bigger! I need something bigger! PLEASE, Mama!\" The poor kid just spiraled out of control until he finally wore himself out. I've been scratching my head all evening. Did I accidentally give him the wrong dose of Adderall? But I didn't. I know I didn't. I think that Charlie's mom is on to something.

Today we spent the day at the ocean, and for Bud the experience was lake- times-ten. He exuded joy from every pore as he jumped the waves and submerged himself in the cold Atlantic waters. The beach was packed today; there were kids everywhere. I watched the other children. They had fun. But they didn't seem to be having the same sort of experience as Bud. For Bud, being in the ocean is like coming home; in the water he is, quite literally, in his element. I've seen similar sentiments written by lots of parents of ASD kids. Intuitively I think there must be something to this - something that is also related to the fact that our kids appear to be some sort of  human barometer .

I'm growing increasingly convinced that he doesn't have ADHD, and that stimulants act as stimulants to him. Even at the decreased dose of 7.5 mg of Adderall, Bud is just a constant stream of sound. He's either scripting, humming, making percussion noises, or talking from the moment he wakes up until he falls asleep. The positive effects of Strattera are still clear, though. He is much more focused (so when he's doing his one-man percussion session and I say \"Bud, what song is that?\") he'll stop and tell me before he launches back into it. And his language ability is better than it's ever been. So we're tweaking again - staying with 10 mg Strattera, but dropping to 5 mg Adderall. My guess is that over time we'll drop Adderall altogether and perhaps bump up the Strattera. I find this whole process very overwhelming. It's so hard to know what is the effect of medication and what is just a bad (or good) day. A question for anyone out there who uses the vitamin supplement Super Nu-Thera.

So when he asked what I was buying I told him it was something to \"do my hair.\" I could see him puzzling over what it was that I was going to do to my hair, then he asked \"To dry your hair?\" \"No, to color my hair.\" \"No!\" he shrieked. \"Don't color your hair!

{"date": "Monday, June 20, 2005", "body": "\n\"Mama, I want to see Palmer Live.\" \"Palmer? Who's that, Bud? Palmer Who?\" \"Palmer Cartney.\" Bud has inherited my passion for  Paul McCartney . It's not at my insistence; if I had that kind of power, he'd have abandoned Teletubbies for Arthur or Finding Nemo years ago. My mom thinks it was the influence of hearing it in utero. I think it's genetic. But whatever the reason, it's there and I love it. Bud watches McCartney's  Back in the USA  concert DVD and listens to the concert CD for hours on end. He knows every nuance of it: every whoa-whoa, every audience sound, everything. He especially enjoys our duets - me on vocal, and Bud on bass and percussion. He starts the backbeat - \"boom-ch-ch-boom-boom-ch\" - and I'm supposed to know which song we're doing and jump in with the vocals at precisely the right time. Luckily, he is very forgiving and prompts me with the lyrics when I need them. He frequently does after-dinner performances for us, \"playing\" his guitar, belting out his favorite McCartney songs, and taking long bows as he revels in the roar of the crowd. Despite the fact that Bud is right handed, he plays his guitar upside down and lefty - just like Paul. We've never said anything about it, and he's never mentioned it; it's just how it is. He also pulls some McCartney moves during these impromptu performances. One favorite - holding the guitar by the neck and lifting it high above his head as we applaud and cheer for more. One of my very favorite \"Palmer\" moments happened at church. During one Sunday service as our tiny little congregation (there were probably 25 of us there) began the opening hymn, Bud decided to join in. Only as we started singing \"Morning Has Broken,\" Bud - at the top of his voice - launched into Band on the Run:  \"Well the rain exploded with a might WHASH!...\" Saturday was McCartney's birthday, so in celebration we watched his latest concert DVD,  Live in Red Square . It is a terrific documentary of a remarkable concert. The music, of course, is outstanding. But the simple fact that the event could happen -  McCartney in   Red Square , for goodness sake! -  makes the film a goosebump-producer. From the amazon.com review: For the Russian audience, McCartney's appearance in Moscow is little short of a miracle. The Beatles were banned for decades by the Soviet government, which regarded their music as the epitome of Western decadence and propaganda, and the fans' only access to the group was through the occasional photo or black market album. Their reaction to his 2003 visit is a mixture of frenzy and rapture; in interview after interview, what one fan calls the Beatles' \"gentle intervention\" is credited with helping to bring down the whole Soviet system, simply because they represented a creativity and freedom that had been almost totally silenced. And that's all before McCartney plays \"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\" which inspires a response that simply must be seen and heard to be believed. Of course, the cultural context was of no consequence to Bud, but he loved every minute of the show. So hats off and happy birthday to Palmer, from two of his biggest fans.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.paulmccartney.com", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007QJ1ES/qid=1119929509/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_ur_1/102-6819687-9694531?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/06/cheers-macca.html", "title": "\nCheers, Macca!\n"},

{"date": "Monday, June 27, 2005", "body": "\nI think I'm in love. I've just finished  Charlotte Moore's  book  George and Sam   and have fallen hard for it's heroes. Moore gives an honest, no-nonsense account of life as a single mother of three sons - George and Sam, who have autism, and Jake, who does not. This book is moving, heartbreaking, and - as any parent who has lived with a child with autism will surely understand - laugh-out-loud funny. Moore is in a unique position to be able to describe the \"autism spectrum.\" George and Sam, though both deeply affected by autism, are very different from each other. And because she also has Jake - the youngest of the three - she has a standard by which to compare the boys' development. She guides us through each boy's early years, when things seemed normal... then confusing... then disconcerting... and straight through each diagnosis and the range of interventions she's tried. Moore does not pretend to have all the answers; to the contrary, her experience confirms that there is no right answer: interventions that worked wonders for Sam had no effect on George, and vice versa. She is also somehow able to avoid wallowing in the negative without glossing over the mayhem that is daily life in her house: striking the right balance of keeping the bathroom door locked so that it is not so accessible that Sam is free to flush his belongings at will but not so inaccessible that he pees in any other receptacle-looking thing he can find; making food for George but pretending it's for Sam, because George insists that he does not eat; putting Sam to bed in his school clothes to avoid the two-hour getting-dressed battle in the morning; indulging George's need to wear only his huge leopard-shaped slippers on his feet - in the snow, out to school, everywhere. In the end, I get the sense that though life in their house will never be \"normal,\" they have struck a normalcy that works for them. It's always interesting to me to read memoirs about other children with autism so that I can compare them with Bud. Bud and Sam have little in common; Sam is clearly more profoundly affected by autism than Bud. George, however, was very familiar. His echolalic speech patterns, his mastery of using the scripts he's memorized from movies to approximate conversation, and his habit of clamping his hands over his ears in challenging social situations are eerily similar to Bud. And yet, there are significant differences, too. Moore talks about the challenge that Christmas presents to her boys: Never is the difference between the autistic and the neurotypical child more pronounced than at Christmas...By four, all neurotypical children understand presents. They enjoy the expectation, the novelty, the surprise; the act of unwrapping is in itself a pleasure...They are just old enough to enjoy giving something in return, and they are gratified by the expressions of delight on the part of the recipients. Autistic four-year-olds have very different reactions to presents...They won't like the element of surprise. They won't see the point of wrapping paper, unless they enjoy the physical sensation of tearing it off...And if they understand the connection between present and donor at all, they'll be bothered by the pressure of expectation. Some sort of social response is expected of them. They don't understand which response, or why. The whole business makes them agitated and confused.  This couldn't be more inaccurate when it comes to Bud. Bud delights in both receiving and giving presents. He loves the unwrapping and the element of surprise. He is downright effusive in his gratitude - even if the \"present\" is a tube of Little Bear toothpaste we've picked up at the pharmacy. \"Oh, thank you, Mama! I love this toothpaste you give to me! You give me this - what? Toothpaste! I love my present of Bear Toothpaste you give to me. Look, Daddy - I have a present of Bear Toothpaste!\" (And yes, this is an actual account of a recent event.) He's equally ebullient when giving a present - eyes shining and body wiggling with anticipation. What does this mean? How can two children on the spectrum be so startling similar and strikingly different all at the same time? George and Sam  may not provide the answers, but it is a wonderful book that is bursting with heart. Frustratingly, it is not currently published in the U.S., but can easily be ordered from  amazon.uk  and is well worth the overseas shipping costs. I've just discovered that it's now out in paperback as well, which brings down the cost considerably.

It's easy to see why  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  was awarded the Pulitzer; it is an extraordinary novel, with characters so real that though I finished the books weeks ago I often find myself wondering what they're doing now. It is a book about escape and the many ways that people attempt - with varied success - escape from poverty, from oppression, from reality, from themselves. And it is about the superheroes that exist within us all, suggesting that though most of us lead simple unassuming lives, there are extraordinary powers lurking just below the surface. Because I read them back-to-back,  Carter Beats the Devil  never had a fair chance. It was a good book, but was recommended to me twice - once by someone who knew I'd liked Katherine Neville's  The Eight  and again by someone who knew I liked  Kavalier and Clay -  so my expectations were probably unreasonable. That being said, I enjoyed the book a great deal. Like both  Kavalier and C lay and  The Eight , some of the characters - including Carter The Great himself - were real-life people (others include Warren G. Harding, Groucho Marx, and Philo T. Farnsworth), though the book is a novel about Carter's life as a magician. The blend of reality and fiction in  Carter Beats the Devil  is like magic itself; it was difficult to know what was fact, what was based on fact, and what was complete illusion. Very early on I decided to read the book as though it were a magic show, suspend my disbelief, and prepare to be mystefied. And despite some visible wires and a couple of tricks that fell flat, it was a very good show. The toilet training book was a utilitarian read, as Bud has been struggling in that area. Training has been two-steps-forward-one-step-back when it's going well, and one-step-forward-two-steps-back when it's not. The book had some good ideas, and was a good reality-check. There is no quick fix here; this is a long-range project. I got the two ABA books because I had heard enough about ABA to think that it might be a good option for Bud. Unfortunately, I read the Harris and Weiss book first and it turned me off completely. It is a short book with a simple message: ABA is the only effective intervention for autism, and must be implemented in the preschool years for 30-40 hours per week with a one-to-one teacher to child ratio. The end. I admit that I am inherently skeptical of absolutes, and of anyone who purports to have found The One Right Answer and tries to spread The Truth. (I don't even practice a  religion  that promotes a single Truth; I'm certainly not looking for that in my pursuit of autism treatment.) The authors' approach is far too prescriptive for me. I also take issue with the underlying assumption that by pursuing options other than ABA parents are failing their children. Chapter One has a section with the subheading \"Who Needs Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention Services?\" which reads,  \"Every young child who is diagnosed with a pervasive developmental disorder including autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (sometimes called atypical autism) should receive early and intensive behavioral intervention services... As discussed in the next chapter, the research documenting the benefits of these treatments is substantial, and the risks of failing to intervene before school age are very serious.\" I tried to look past the dogma, but I'm afraid the damage was already done and I found it difficult to acknowledge the small-t truths in what they had to say. I had lost all interest by the time I started Shira Richman's book, and though she is much more balanced in her approach and offers some good approaches that can be adapted for individual children, I just couldn't stay with it. I'll go back to it once I've had a chance to mellow out about it. In the meantime, I'm reading Nick Hornby's  Fever Pitch . I enjoyed  The Polysyllabic Spree  so much that it resparked my enthusiasm for Hornby. Fever Pitch is one of the two of his books that I hadn't read previously (the other, currently residing on my bookshelf, is  Songbook ). I enjoyed the Colin Firth movie based on the book, but never felt drawn to a book about football. I was robbing myself. Yes, it's a book about football, but mostly it's a book about football as the content, context and metaphor for Hornby's life. Anyone who has had... unusual connections (I'm going to resist saying obsessions, because that's just too pathological)... to someone or something in popular culture (for me, it's Paul McCartney) will see themselves in this book and will find in it's author someone who  gets  it in a way that most of the people we encouter in everyday life never will. Coinicidentally, Nick Hornby's latest novel,  A Long Way Down , will be released in the U.S. tomorrow, and will soon be in the stack of books on my bedside table.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/06/books-bought-and-read-april-and-may.html", "title": "\nBooks Bought and Read, April and May\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 23, 2005", "body": "\nOne of the most fascinating concepts I've encountered on this journey with autism is the idea of the \" theory of mind .\" In short: people with autism struggle with being able to look at things from another person's perspective. One of the classic tests of theory of mind goes something like this: Sally and Anne have a marble, a basket, and a box. Sally puts the marble in the basket, then leaves the room. While she is gone, Anne moves the marble and puts it in the box. Sally comes back into the room. Where does Sally look for the marble? Most typically developing three-year-olds will know that Sally will look in the basket, because she thinks that's where the marble is even though  we  know that Anne moved it. Most childrens with Down Syndrome will look in the basket as well. But children with autism will look in the box: \" for goodness sake, we just saw Anne put the marble in the box, people!\"  It will not occur to the child with autism that Sally doesn't know what we know, that Sally's thoughts are different from our thoughts. I tried this experiment with Bud. We acted it out with Ernie and Bert dolls. Ernie - that prankster - moved the marble while Bert was away, and I made a big deal about Ernie thinking it was very funny to play a joke on Bert. Bert came back and I asked Bud where Bert thought the marble was. With a big grin, Bud went straight for the box and produced the marble. I also made the connection recently that the answers Bud often gives to \"why\" questions may have to do with theory of mind. Bud has always struggled with why questions, and it's something we've been working on. We've also been working on empathy. So, often, when we see someone exhibiting an emotion - in a book, in a store, on tv - I'll ask Bud to name the emotion, and he usually does it pretty well. We were in a bookstore and a littel girl fell down and was crying. I asked Bud, \"How does she feel?\" He said, \"She's sad.\" \"Yes, she feels sad. Why is she sad?\" \"She's tears.\" Aaahhhh. He hears \"why is she sad\"  not  as \"what makes her feel sad?\" but as \"why was sad the right word for you to choose?\" (answer: because I see tears, and tears mean she's sad.) His answer was from his own perspective; no theory of mind. But it's not that simple. There are other times, in other situations, where it is clear that Bud knows I'm thinking something different from what he's thinking. This often happens when I'm angry - or, more frequently, when he does something that he thinks might  make  me angry. I usually know that this has occurred when he comes up to me and says \"Mama, you not angry face, you happy face!\" And since I'm not sure what has happened and clearly have no face at all yet, it's clear that Bud is projecting for me how he thinks I  might  feel, and how he wishes I  would  feel. That's theory of mind, right? A few weeks ago we had some cognitive testing done with a psychologist who works a lot with autism spectrum disorders. It was very difficult to get an accurate assessment of his abilities for a variety of reasons, but let me give you one example: The task the doctor presented looked like this. There were four pictures: a head, a foot, a hand, and a nose. The doctor handed Bud a card with a sock on it. Bud was instructed to put the card on the picture that went with it. The activity was designed so that each successive set was more challenging than the last. Bud was delighted. This was just like the Zoboomafoo computer game he loves to play, and he decided he would play it exactly the same way - except, since these pictures wouldn't talk, he would have to do the talking for them. He picked up the picture of the sock, plopped it down on the head and announced \"No, that's not right. Try again!\" He picked it up again, plopped it onto the hand and said \"No, that's not right. Try again!\" He picked it up again, plopped it onto the nose and said \"No, that's not right. Try again!\" Then, finally, he plopped it onto the foot and squealed \"Mangatsika! You're great at this!\" For Bud, getting the  right  answer in a computer game - or, clearly, in an intelligence test - is irrelevant. It is as much fun to see what happens when you get the wrong answer as it is when you get the right answer. And if you choose the right answer first, you only get to play once on this screen; if you choose the wrong answers first, you get to play four times. But you can imagine how tedious it was to the psychologist doing the testing. The four \"warm up\" questions took about 15 minutes, and unless we were prepared to spend the rest of Bud's childhood in the testing room we were going to have to move things along. I gently suggested to Bud that he try to get the right answer first on the next question. He did, and then promptly lost interest in the game and disengaged from it completely. The psychologist characterized this (in so many words) as a theory of mind issue: Bud didn't understand that the psychologist had an agenda, and that he had expectations for what Bud should do. He said that most children want to please the tester, and are excited about showing that they can get the right answers. Maybe. Maybe not. It might be a \"theory of mind\" issue. Or it might be a \"mind of my own\" issue. It might be that Bud had discovered a fun, exciting game and the psychologist turned it into a boring, dull game. Regardless of what expectations the psychologist had, for Bud dull and boring is a waste of time. I've been watching Bud since that testing to see if I can find other examples of Bud utilizing a theory of mind perspective. Last night, 30 minutes after bedtime I could still hear singing coming from his room, followed by a very distinctive thump-thump-thump that told me the singing was accompanied by a little soft shoe routine. I started up the stairs, and just as I came into view I saw his little body hurl through the air in his room as he dove head-first into his pillow. By the time I walked through the door he was tucked in his bed, snugly under the covers, and he looked up at me and did a classic Vinnie Barbarino \"What?\" Theory of Mind  meets  Mind of My Own  meets  Mind Your Own Business, Mom .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autism.org/mind.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/05/theory-of-mind-of-my-own.html", "title": "\nTheory of mind of my own\n"},

As I've mentioned previously, I am always working with Bud on \"theory of mind\" issues: \"how does that child feel, and why?\" sorts of things. He has gotten very good at identifying another's emotion, but not at understanding another's motivation. Then, last night we were reading a book called \"Ricardo's Day,\" which is a picture book that walks us through Ricardo's day at school. Ricardo's mom brings him to school and stays in the classroom to get him settled, then leaves for work. We see a very forlorn Ricardo gazing out the window after his mother. Bud spent a long time looking at the picture, then said \"Mom, he's sad.\" I said, \"You're right; he is sad. Why is he sad?\" I expected \"he's frown,\" or \"he's sad face,\" or some other statement from Bud's own perspective: \"this is what I see that tells me he's sad.\" But Bud was quiet for a minute, and I could tell he was struggling to find the right words. Then he said, \"He's love her mom.\" I just about melted. Forget syntax. Forget the mismatched gender-specific pronouns.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2005", "body": "\nDo you remember the old  Coneheads  skit on Saturday Night Live? It involved a family of aliens from another planet who were trying to assimilate on Earth. Whenever they did something that was clearly not typical human behavior (like, drink battery acid) and were met with puzzlement from their human neighbors, they would explain it away by saying \"We are from France,\" as though any American would instantly understand that the French are just  different  and no further explanation would be needed. And it never was. Well, \"France\" has been shorthand in our house for \"autism spectrum disorders and related syndromes, and other autistic-like behavior\" for a long time - before, in fact, Bud had a diagnosis. For example, when he was just a toddler and we'd have an adult friend over to visit whom Bud liked, he would take them by the hand to the floor in front of the couch, where he would have lined up his Teletubbies dolls, face down (because they were sleeping, we think), and (without using any words) pull our guest down until he or she was prone on the floor next to Bud, both of their faces buried in the Tubbies. It was a rite of passage clearly reserved for his inner circle, and it left our friends amused but bewildered. It was at times like those that one of us would look at the other and say, \"He's from France.\" It is now a part of our everyday vocabulary and on several occassions I've found myself making similar references in this blog that I've had to edit out. I think it's just easier to set the context and free myself from needless editing. It's honestly gone far beyond \"He's from France.\" Actual conversations in our home include statements like this: \"Bud met a fellow Frenchman at the park today.\" \"I think their daughter might be from France. Or maybe southern France. Or at least an island off the coast of France.\" \"Bud had a really French day at school.\" \"Wouldn't it be nice if the people moving in across the street had a child from France? Or, at least, one who was fluent in French? Or even interested in foreign exchange?\" So, you see how this gets pervasive (and then we wonder where Bud gets the perseverative stuff... actually my husband is quite sure he's got a lot of French blood himself.) I do need to say that these comments are  never  made in a mocking sort of way. We embrace Bud's French heritage; we admire his panache; we revel in his joi de vivre; and we always have the utmost respect for his je ne sais quois.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coneheads"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/06/vive-le-difference.html", "title": "\nVive le difference!\n"},

This week we switched to Adderall, but started back at 5 mg. (And though my friend  Moi  suggests we should try Strattera, Bud's doctor wants to try the medications with a longer track record with younger children first.) It has been difficult to gauge the results, however, because Bud has not been sleeping and it is taking a terrible toll on him. Ever since the Daylight Savings time switch Bud has had trouble falling asleep at night, a  phenomenon that is very common in kids with autism . Though we've blocked all light from his windows and he is physically exhausted, he simply can't wind down at the end of the day. We start the bedtime routine around 7:00 p.m. and it's usually sometime around 10:30 - 11:00 p.m. when he finally falls asleep. Then he's up bright and early in the morning, with dark purple circles under his eyes. Though this has been going on for weeks, Bud had been managing surprisingly well until it was time to make a transition at school. His preschool program ended, and his summer services began. As transitions go, this one was minor: same classroom, same staff, same daily routine... just a few new kids whom he doesn't know. But he's been completely unable to cope. When I picked him up yesterday, the staff looked heartbroken. He'd had a terrible day. He wouldn't let them come near him. He wouldn't talk, except to use perseverative scripting. He wouldn't engage with any people or activities. He wouldn't do any of the sensory activities that usually help focus him (swinging, stomping, bouncing, etc.) And he looked utterly exhausted. (But bless his heart, when I asked him how school was he told me he had fun.) I called his pediatrician in a panic. She had resisted giving him anything for sleep while we were trying out other medications, but I told her I'd rather suspend the Adderall trial to let this poor child get some rest. She told me to stick with the Adderall, and try giving Bud 1 mg of  Melatonin  before bed. It was magic. Bud was asleep by 7:45, and though he woke briefly a couple of times and called out to me, he slept until 7:00 a.m. And best of all, he had a  great  day at school today. So now the real trial with Adderall begins.

{"date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2005", "body": "\nLast week I brought Bud for cognitive testing, and the process was a real eye-opener for me. I learned some things about his cognitive challenges - there are concepts like \"except for\" and \"all of the\" that he just doesn't get. (When the tester laid out five toys and said \"Hand me everything but the car,\" Bud cheerfully picked up the car and handed it over.) More than that, though, I got real insight into Bud's attention deficit and genuine inability to focus. As soon as he was faced with a task or question to which he did not have an instant answer, he disengaged. It was impossible to gauge his comprehension or problem-solving ability because he couldn't focus long enough on the matter at hand to even attempt to solve the problem. It seems to me that there are multiple issues here (or, as the doctor said \"Just because your ankle is sprained, doesn't mean you don't have a headache,\") and if we want to give Bud a real chance to work on his cognitive challenges, then we need to help him focus long enough to have a fair shot. So, following several years of debating the issue, we've decided to do a trial run with Ritalin. In some ways, I feel like I'm walking around wearing a scarlet R because there appears to be a real social stigma associated with medicating young children. (Do a google search of \"Ritalin\" if you don't believe me; my favorite hit was titled \"Ritalin is Child Abuse.\") At the same time, my husband's ADHD was not diagnosed until he was in his 40's - after a lifetime of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and alcoholism - and medication has made an enormous difference for him. If we can make Bud's road easier than his Dad's was, we have to try. I'm picking up the prescription this afternoon, and we'll start him on it tomorrow.

BUT after school - after the medication had \"worn off\" - he spent the day with his grandmother, and was a total chatterbox! He accompanied her to a doctor's appointment and sat nicely while they did an ultrasound on her leg (long story), commenting all the while. Then he told the technician that he had a sore arm, so she offered to use the machine on him. He hopped up onto the exam table, let her put goo on his arm and give him an \"ultrasound.\" This is very, very atypical behavior! (See my  dentist post  for comparison.) Bud has recently been having MAJOR regression with potty training, and has been having 5-6 accidents a day for the past week or two. Today he was  completely  dry all day. He's also been going through a belligerent phase, particularly with his grandmother; everything has been a battle. Today he was as easy going as could be. By the time I got home (6:00 p.m.) he was still going strong. He told me all about his day and talked talked talked about everything he could think of. I started having visions of sitting up at 3:00 a.m. listening to him and trying to get him to go to sleep.

I'd run into some moms that I've gotten friendly with. (We occasionally get together for a mom's night out without kids - that sort of thing.) I was standing between Jack's Mom and Matt's Mom, and heard Matt's Mom say \"Matt is really excited about Jack's party. Any suggestion for presents?\" The question barely registered with me, but I happened to glance up at Jack's Mom and that's when I saw  the look .

The reality is that we probably would have made an excuse and not gone. But would it have killed her to invite him? Doesn't she see that it's hard enough for him to just  be  in this world, without having people go out of their way to exclude him? Can't she understand that Bud is the most amazing little person she is ever likely to know and she is wasting this opportunity and robbing her son of the experience of knowing him?

{"date": "Thursday, February 10, 2005", "body": "\nIt has taken four days, but I have solved The Great Tubbies Mystery. One of the most pervasive of Bud's developmental disorders is language - the construction of it and the pragmatic social use of it. He knows thousands of words. He understands eveything. He has memorized the script of every kids video he has ever seen, and can pull out snippets of language from them that just about fit the situation when he's trying to \"pass.\" But the back-and-forth flow of everyday conversation is an enormous challenge for him. For that reason, trying to figure out what message he is trying to convey (and he is ALWAYS trying to convey a message) is like stepping into an Agatha Christie Whodunit. He can answer some questions, sometimes. But his answers - though relevant in some way to the matter at hand - are not always predictable responses to the question that was asked. (In his book  Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism , author Paul Collins provides a great framework for thinking about this phenomenon. But more on that later.) Anyway, Bud's latest challenge was The Great Tubbies Mystery. I should tell you that Bud is FANATIC about the  Teletubbies . The Tubbies (or \"the guys,\" as he calls them) are geared toward one- and two-year-olds, but Bud is well into year five and still going strong. They are his security blanket, his obsession, and his best friends. We have Tubbie dolls of every variety (and aren't we lucky that every six months or so our friends at Ragdoll produce a new line of these characters that are just  slightly  different from those already on the market - and in our house.) Last Wednesday I picked Bud up at preschool and he greeted me at the door with a big smile and an announcement: \"I want The Sound of The Tubbies! Is that what's a good idea?\" I immediately checked with all of the teachers in the classroom to find out what in the world he was talking about. No one knew. He hadn't been talking about it at school. But the request continued for days, \"I want The Sound of the Tubbies.\" I asked him for more information. \"Is it a CD?\" \"It's just a toy one.\" \"Did you see it in a book?\" \"Okay.\" (loose translation: \"Wow! They have a book on that??? Yeah, I'd love to get it!\") \"What's the sound?\" \"Of The Tubbies! That's a great idea! Okay, Mama?\" \"Is it a doll?\" \"Okay.\" Hmm... maybe he doesn't think of them as dolls. He sometimes calls stuffed creatures \"soft ones,\" so I'll try that. \"Is it a soft one?\" \"It's just a loud one. The Sound of the Tubbies.\" \"I don't understand, Bud. I need more words.\" \"The speaker. And Dipsy. In his belly.\" This conversation becomes my life for days on end. It's clear that he  really  wants me to understand what he's talking about and is baffled that I can't follow him. And then yesterday, at Target, the clouds part and the mystery is solved. There is (surprise!) a new line of Teletubbies out - BUT, this time around each of their little tummy screens have four pictures, each with it's own unique sound. When four Tubbies are lined up next to each other and one industrious five-year-old starts pressing with his chubby little hands flying at top speed, there are sixteen asynchronous sounds and a cacophonous symphony of Tubbie tunes - The Sound of the Tubbies! He was not requesting an item; he was calling forth a  happening .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1582343675/qid=1108400929/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-4112864-9805705", "http://http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/teletubbies/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/02/great-tubbies-mystery-solved.html", "title": "\nThe Great Tubbies Mystery: Solved\n"},

There are so many treatments out there, and so many children with so many differences who all fall under the \"autism\" umbrella that it can be extraordinarily overwhemling. (If you have an autistic child, I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.) We've been using Occupational Therapy for Sensory Integration Dysfunction with Bud for over a year, with wonderful results. We've used the Wilbarger brushing protocol (and still do), he sees an OT at preschool, and he has a one-hour OT session outside of school each week. But we've just started a new therapy that I've seen some (but not a lot of) mention of in the autism literature -  CranioSacral Therapy . CST was developed by an Osteopathic doctor (I've always been a fan of DO's over MD's, though Bud's pediatrician is and MD - but I digress), and is practiced by a wide range of practitioners - PT's, OT's, massage therapists, etc. There are a number of reasons why CST seemed like a good match for Bud, and the more I investigated the more the road led back to it. So, we're giving it a try. It's pricey, and not covered by insurance, but if it has positive effects it will (of course) be worth it. He's had two sessions so far - too soon to make any assessment of it's efficacy, but he LOVES it. He mellows right out and just melts right into the therapist. Our first session was last week and when I asked today if he wanted to go back I got an immediate \"YES!\" I'll continue to post updates on how it's going, and would love to hear from anyone else who has used it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.upledger.com/clinic/autism.htm"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/02/craniosacral-therapy.html", "title": "\nCranioSacral Therapy\n"},

I have read it several times since, and find myself using it as a reference book: \"Let's see... what was Jeremy doing at this age?\" Then about a year ago, I read another of Kephart's books,  Seeing Past Z , and it almost took my breath away. There was Jeremy, now 14 years old. He's bright, creative, verbal, quirky, interesting, engaging, popular; he is, quite frankly, everything that I hope my son will be. Seeing Past Z is not  about  Jeremy, in the way that  A Slant of Sun  was. He plays a supporting role in this story, the focus of which is a writing group that the author runs for Jeremy and his classmates. What struck me most was that Kephart never made mention of Jeremy's beginnings, and anyone who read the book without having read  A Slant of Sun  would find him off-beat and colorful, but by and large a perfectly normal kid.  Dare I dream? I found myself trying to read between the lines - practically trying to pry apart each individual page - to figure out how he - how THEY - got where they are. What therapies, what interventions, what prayers, what path led them to this wonderful place? I even tried to e-mail Kephart, both to thank her and to plead for a little bit of guidance.

{"date": "Sunday, April 03, 2005", "body": "\nI'm about halfway through Nick Hornby's  The Polysyllabic Spree , which is a compilation of columns he's written for The Believer. Each month, Hornby lists the books he bought and the books he read - sometimes, the lists are even similar. I've been a Nick Hornby fan since  High Fidelity  was released. After  How to be Good , I lost track of him a bit, but was delighted to stumble back across him recently. Interestingly enough, he also has an autistic son, which for some reason only makes me like him more. I know that's irrational; I'm sure there are complete idiots out there who have autistic children (though, to be honest, I haven't met one yet.) It may have something to do with the extraordinary work he's done by founding  TreeHouse . The Polysyllabic Spree  has inspired me to start tracking the books I buy and read as well. Since I don't have the time, energy, or inclination to read as much as Hornby, this is likely to be a several-months-at-a-time endeavor. And in that spirit, here is the run-down of books bought and read, in order (to the best of my fuzzy recollection) for the past three months., January to March, 2005. Books Bought: Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism -  Paul Collins The Answer Is Yes: A Novel -  Sara Lewis Second Draft of My Life -  Sara Lewis Our Journey Through High Functioning Autism and Asperger Syndrome: A Roadmap  - Linda Andron (ed.) A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius -  Dave Eggers Sixpence House: Lost in a Town of Books -  Paul Collins Songbook -  Nick Hornby The Polysyllabic Spree -  Nick Hornby Banvard's Folly: Thirteen People Who Didn't Change the World -  Paul Collins Books Read: Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism -  Paul Collins The Answer is Yes -  Sara Lewis Sixpence House: Lost in a Town of Books -  Paul Collins A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius -  Dave Eggers Second Draft of My Life -  Sara Lewis Pervasive Developmental Disorder: Diagnosis, Options and Answers -  Mitzi Waltz Aspergers Syndrome, The Universe, and Everything -  Kenneth Hall Your Inner Physician and You: CranioSacral Therapy and Somatoemotional Release -  John Upledger Banvard's Folly: Thirteen People Who Didn't Change the World -  Paul Collins Thinking in Pictures -  Temple Grandin (unfinished) The Polysyllabic Spree -  Nick Hornby (unfinished) Starting in January with  Not Even Wrong  is actually appropriate, because many of the books I've read since then can actually be traced back to  Not Even Wrong . I've written about it in a previous post, but I just saw on amazon.com that it has been released in paperback with a different title,  Not Even Wrong: A Father's Journey Into the Lost History of Autism . I'm not sure if this is some publishing practice that I'm not up on, but Collins' first book,  Banvard's Folly , had a different subtitle in hardcover than it did in paperback. Anyway, I loved  Not Even Wrong  so much that I immediately bought  Sixpence House  and soon after,  Banvard's Folly . They are all very different from each other, but I would be hard-pressed to choose a favorite. Like Not Even Wrong, Sixpence House is a memoir of Collins and his family as they attempted to buy a house in Hay-on-Wye, a small Welsh town with 40 bookstores. The book introduces Collins' son Morgan before he is diagnosed with autism, though there are little glimpses that I recognized from Bud's early childhood - like taking him to a park with an acre of grass and watching him seek out the one strip of head-bashing asphalt on which to play. Sixpence House is delightful and engaging, and I was sorry when it was all over. Banvard's Folly  is an entirely different kind of great read. It is a historical journey through the lives of thirteen disparate people who have one thing in common: failure. They are people who, through circumstance, bad judgment, poor timing or ill repute sealed their fate as could-have-beens. Each story is compelling and fascinating, and though it is not the sort of book I would typically be drawn to, once I started reading I found it hard to put down. A google search of Paul Collins led me to McSweeney's, which led me to Dave Eggers, and boy am I glad it did. I was completely captivated by Eggers' memoir of raising his young brother after both of their parents died of cancer within months of each other. I was equally captivated by Eggers himself. His book captures the simultaneous self-aggrandizing \"I'm the King of the World\" and self-loathing \"I can do nothing right\" assessments that (apparently) exist in us all, but that we each think are ours alone. Interestingly, McSweeney's also led me to some old friends, including Nick Hornby and Ayelet Waldman (who was posting to a listserv at the same time as me for a while several years ago, and because of the personal nature of the listserv and some shared emotional trauma feels like an old friend. Long, long story that I will never go into, but that I'm sure she'd discuss at length should you ever have the opportunity.) Ayelet's husband, Michael Chabon, was also there at McSweeney's, and I was reminded that though I have given  Kavalier and Clay  as a gift several times, I've never gotten around to reading it myself. So, it's on the bedside table waiting... but more on that next time. A second but no less significant thread that resulted from  Not Even Wrong  was a renewed interest in reading autism-related books (I tend to go in waves with these) - thus,  Pervasive Developmental Disorders ,  Thinking in Pictures  (which I keep going back to but never stick with) and  Asperger's Syndrome, The Universe, and Everything . This last title was written by a young boy (ten or so, as I recall) with Aspergers, and is a terrific insight into the way he ticks. Though Bud doesn't have Aspergers I find that \"aspies\" are as close as relatives, so Kenneth Hall's world was strangely familiar. It is a great, quick read. The other books - Upledger and Lewis - were completley unrelated to these other threads and were sort of \"cleansing the palate\" reads. That's not an insult. They were great cleanses. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.treehouse.org.uk/", "https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/summary/edit.html/002-8953047-7815205?%5Fencoding=UTF8&orderID=102-1693400-3969746"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/04/books-bought-and-read.html", "title": "\nBooks Bought and Read\n"},

{"date": "Monday, July 11, 2005", "body": "\nLast week I attended a two-day workshop on  RDI , Relationship Development Intervention, an approach to working with people on the autism spectrum that was developed by a huband-and-wife team, Drs. Steve Gutstein and Rachelle Sheely. I still feel like I have a very basic, rudimentary understanding about the program, but I am very excited about it. As I've said before, I think that deciding which approaches will work with your child is a very intuitive process, and this one feels intuitively  right  for Bud. I'll try to explain it, with the caveat that 1) I may not be explaining it well, and 2) I may not be getting it all right. As Dr. Gutstein said as he opened his presentation, RDI begins with the basic assumption that people on the autism spectrum are human beings, by which he means that the fundamental processes of human development are the same for people on the autism spectrum as they are for neurotypical people. RDI breaks down neurotypical development in the first two years of life into 28 levels, and identifies for each person on the spectrum at which of those levels the breakdown in their development occurred. The focus of RDI is remediation, or going back to that level for a \"do-over,\" getting that skill, then moving on to the next one. Remediation is a radically different approach to ASD than many of the popular interventions which are focused on compensation; in other words, they identify which skills a child doesn't have and then train them in a very \"if this, then that\" rule-governed way to get by. The problem is that learning skills in such a rote manner doesn't really help children to function fully in the world. They may be able to learn that when someone says \"How are you?\" the right response is \"I'm fine. How are you?,\" but it won't make them care how you are. It's that caring element that is at the core of our humanity, and at the root of our genuine, meaningful interaction with other people. THAT is what I want for Bud. I use this analogy to help understand it: Pretend you're on your way to the wedding of two people you love. The wedding is in an unfamiliar area, and as you're driving there you get hopelessly lost. This is similar to what happens in the development of people with ASD during the first two years of life; they are on their way, and then suddenly they are hopelessly lost. Most interventions for ASD try to help them compensate for this loss; they find a side street and lead you to a different church with a different wedding going on. It might be a lovely wedding with nice music, but it probably won't have a lot of meaning for you. In contrast, RDI will help you retrace your steps and figure out where you took that first wrong turn, then will systematically lead you to the right church and the right wedding. You'll probably get there late; but you'll be there in time to see the happy couple kiss. And to me, THAT is the key element of RDI that I walked away with; as Dr. Gutstein said, \"This is a marathon, not a sprint.\" This is a long-term goal with a life-changing pay-off. So, rather than mix metaphors maybe we should imagine that you actually need to run the 26.4 miles to this wedding. You won't be able to do it without making short-term compensations along the way: you'll have to stop to rehydrate; you may have to go to the bathroom; you may need to stop and tie your shoe. But ultimately, you will know all along that the wedding is your destination. And so it is with RDI. Bud will need to learn write letters and color in the lines. He'll need to learn to tell us when he has to go to the bathroom. He'll need to be able to put his pants on, right side out and not backwards. And there are lots of great approaches we can use to help him learn how to do those things. But at the same time, every day in a multitude of small but thoughtful ways we need to work on remediation, on gaining the life skills he'll need to integrate, synthesize, adjust, and respond; and we always need to keep our eyes on the prize, the long-term end of the marathon: meaningful relationships with other people, a real job, the ability to live independently. These are the things I want for Bud, and ultimately, I believe that these are the things he will want for himself. Marathons are hard work; I know that. But it's time to start training.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rdiconnect.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/07/rdi.html", "title": "\nRDI\n"},

Blue Car is wearing glasses!\" I climbed into the back with him and asked what he was looking at and sure enough - the rounded rear-view mirrors sticking out from either side of the vehicle looked like little granny specs perched on the \"nose\" created by the hood of the car. ** A steady snow began falling last week while we were inside a building. As we walked through the parking lot and the car came into sight, we saw that it was covered with snow and Bud told me \"Mama, you need to shave Black Car.\" Well, of course - the snow looked just like shaving cream, and the scraper looked just like daddy's razor! It was time for a shave! ** Later, after 18 inches of snow had piled up and it was time for snow removal, Daddy was clearing off the roof of the van, and Bud told me \"Daddy is giving Blue Car's head a scratch.\" Once again, not even wrong.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/03/my-brother-car.html", "title": "\nMy Brother, The Car\n"},

Bud's echolalia has advanced to the point where he now adopts the form and syntax of memorized speech, but pulls out salient nouns, verbs, proper names, etc. to make what he's saying fit the situation he's in. Some of these constructs are exceedingly complex, so \"One day in Teletubbie land, all of the Teletubbies were very busy when suddenly a big raincloud appeared,\" becomes \"One day in Bud's house, Mama and Bud were very busy when suddenly Daddy appeared\" - this, instead of \"Daddy's home.\" Anyway, lately everything has been \"brought to us by\" or \"made possible by\" something.

{"date": "Sunday, July 31, 2005", "body": "\nWe knew from the start that we were going to be pushing it this weekend. We were doing a fly-in/fly-out for a family wedding, which meant a full day of air travel on Friday (two planes and a lengthy layover in between)followed by a late night big-crowd dinner, then a late-night wedding on Saturday and an early morning flight out on Sunday. We had the essentials at the ready: iPod loaded with Bud-friendly music, portable DVD player and all the favorite discs, toys, books, snacks. Bud was amazing all weekend long. With the exception of a few minor cranky moments (his and ours), he was a trooper and I think he even had a good time. So we were breathing a sigh of relief when, after only about six hours of sleep we were at the airport with plenty of time to spare for the first leg of our flight this morning. We shouldn't have exhaled quite so soon. The second leg of our flight was delayed, though not by a lot, so we were still in good spirits when we boarded and found our seats in the very last row of the plane. The seat in front of us was filled by an off-duty pilot being flown to his next assignment. A few minutes later, a flight attendant arrived to tell him there was a space in first class and he vacated that row, leaving room for another family in the back to redistribute themselves. Before I go any further, I should point out two important pieces of information about Bud: 1) Lately he has been reacting very poorly to other children who he believes are muscling in on his territory. If we are at the playground, or the train table at the toy store or a particular tidal pool at the beach and another child approaches, Bud loses it: \"No! That's mine! You go away, boy!\" I have learned that this is not a time for rationalizing or negotiation. This is a time to exit, and we do so quickly. 2) Bud rarely has a full-out meltdown. When he does, it is invariably because he is overtired and there is always a Point of No Return at which the meltdown becomes hysteria and is only resolved when he is so exhausted he passes out. Back to my story... though I know you can see where this is going. The new seat arrangement looked like this: Back row was Bud at the window, me in the middle, my husband on the aisle. In the row in front of us was boy (about 10) at window, boy (about 9) in middle, off-duty flight attendant trying to nap on aisle. Across the aisle from them was empty seat on aisle, boys' Mom in middle completely focused on boy (about 4) at window. In other words, the two boys in front of us were completely unsupervised. I believe it started with the window, though I didn't really pick up on what was going on until later. Bud was opening and closing the slider on the windows next to him, including the window just to the front of him, and just behind the boy in front of him. The boy changed the positon of the shade. Bud protested and put it back. It happened again. At this point, Middle Boy got interested in a \"what's up with the kid behind us\" sort of way, and started peering through the crack in the seats at Bud. This caused Bud distress and he again began to protest. I was still not clueing in on what was going on. I knew Bud was distressed, but I couldn't identify the source of the problem. I was also distracted because they kept making announcements telling us we would be delayed \"just a few minutes more,\" so I don't know if Middle Boy was doing anything other than peering. I do know, however, that distress turned rapidly into freak-out. I finally clued in and switched seats with Bud so that if Middle Boy peered through, he'd only see me. Unfortunately, Bud had passed the Point of No Return. He started shrieking \"No! Stop it! This is no place for boys!\" My husband and I tried frantically to calm Bud down, but every sound that came from the boys in front of us heightened Bud's hysteria. I quickly realized that the boys had recognized the cause-and-effect in action, and were playing it. The pattern went something like this. The boys would whisper-whisper-giggle, and Bud would shriek \"No! Stop it boys! No talking!\" and then, a bit louder, the boys would say to each other \"Blah, blah, blah...\" and Bud would go right over the edge of hysteria - blotchy-faced sobbing, head banging, screeching - until we could calm him down a little. As soon as he settled down, we'd hear \"la, la, la...\" from the seat in front of us, and it would all begin again. My husband and I looked at each other in desperation. I assume his head was pouding as hard as mine, and that he was feeling just about as helpless and incompetent. I just kept thinking that the plane would start moving any second, and the sound of the engine would drown out the boys, and the movement of the plane would lull Bud to sleep. At the very least, we'd be able to turn on the DVD player and provide a distraction. I thought about approaching the boys' mother, but what would I say?  Please ask your boys to be silent for the duration of the trip. Please ask them not to hum.  It occurred to me that I might be mis-assigning bad intent to these boys simply because I wanted to blame someone. Finally, I got up and climbed over the still-shrieking Bud and my harried-looking husband and approached the other Mom. \"My son is autistic,\" I said. \"And sometimes he gets triggered by other children. Would you mind switching seats with us?\" She began to agree to move, but a swarm of flight attendants arrived. Okay, two, but it felt like a swarm. \"Ma'am, you need to take your seat.\" \"Ma'am, you may switch seats once we are in the air.\" \"Ma'am, please get out of the aisle. \" I lumbered back into my seat while the giggle-hum-shriek fest continued. One of the flight attendants returned with a tiny airplane-packet of pretzels and offered them to the blotchy red mess that was my son. \"If you're good,\" he said, \"you can have these pretzels.\" \"He's autistic,\" I told him. \"Good luck. I don't think pretzels are going to do it.\" \"Don't worry,\" he assured me. \"Just take a deep breath. My daughter did this for an entire flight once. You're not bothering us. We're all just fine.\" I turned to face the window and burst into tears. Did he really think I gave a hoot that Bud might be disturbing him? What veteran of air travel doesn't recognize that putting up with screaming children is just part of the package? My son was in red-alert CRISIS. And worse, I believed he was being taunted right in front of me and I was completely at a loss as to how to stop it. It was as though all of the fears and anxieties that have been lurking just below the surface erupted in that moment: Bud is unable to cope with people and life and the unexpected and it is much, much worse than I thought. Other children will tease him for sport, just because they can. No one will come to his rescue. Other children can be calmed down with pretzels. We are totally, hopelessly, and eternally screwed. I stared out the window and sobbed and sobbed as the engines started and the plane lifted off, our 1:20 flight finally leaving the ground at 2:45 after an eternity in the Cramped and Stuffy Backseat of No Escape. My husband tapped me on the shoulder and I turned to see Bud sound asleep against his shoulder. I cried some more. The off-duty flight attendant brought me Kleenex. The mom across the aisle came over to see if we still wanted to switch seats. Bud continued to sleep through the rest of the flight, and woke when we touched down. After he had spoken a few sentences, the boys in front of us launched into a chorus of Hakuna Matata and the cycle was on the verge of starting again, but the other mom had finally keyed in and gave a stern word to her sons who were quiet until we got to the gate. The boys were in line in the rest room at the airport a few people in front of my husband. \"Is he behind us?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Does he look mad?\" \"Yeah.\" It wasn't all in my head. It was a game to them. My husband and I were quiet in the car on the way home, except for a lot of heavy sighing. \"We were right there,\" my husband said. \"What's going to happen when we're not?\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/07/air-bud.html", "title": "\nAir Bud\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 15, 2005", "body": "\nSimon Baron-Cohen's recent  research on prenatal testosterone levels  as they relate to autism has been  getting  a lot of press lately. I heard a brief interview with him on NPR's  Day to Day  yesterday. Baron-Cohen suggests that autism may be an extreme form of the typical \"male brain,\" which is predisposed to systemize rather than empathize. He writes, In my work I have summarized these differences by saying that males on average have a stronger drive to systemize, and females to empathize. Systemizing involves identifying the laws that govern how a system works. Once you know the laws, you can control the system or predict its behavior. Empathizing, on the other hand, involves recognizing what another person may be feeling or thinking, and responding to those feelings with an appropriate emotion of one's own. He talks about the obsessions of people with autism as \"very intense systemizing at work.\" I can certainly see this in Bud. Bud regards much of the world through a Teletubbies lens. When he encouters a new object, he considers how this object could be a part of the Teletubbies' world. So, anything that can be lowered or raised becomes the Tubbies' voice trumpet (which Bud calls \"speakers.\") Anything that makes a cranking sound becomes the \"controls.\" Colors are always selected in the same order: purple, green, yellow, red (because, of course, one always considers the Tubbies in order - Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa, Po.) Bud takes this systemizing much further, though. When he looks at photographs, he often scans the background to pick out the Teletubbies he can see. So, he looks at a picture of his Dad and says \"Look! A picture of Tinky Winky!\" because in the far background of the picture he can spot a stuffed Tinky Winky on a shelf. (I have to say, though, he does this much less than he used to, which I imagine must be a good sign.) My favorite example of this uber-Tubbies-systemizing, however, was the time he paused at the bottom of the stairs and looked at the end of the round eye fastener for the safety gate sticking out of the railing: \"Look, Mama!\" he said excitedly. \"It's Po!\" I have to admit, I could see the resemblance: Baron-Cohen further hypothesizes that autism is \"the genetic result of assortative mating,\" in which two systemizers mate to produce one hyper-systemizer. My immediate reaction was \"Well, then clearly we are the exception that proves the rule.\" My husband and I both score as  INFP  on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator; we are warm, loving, caring people. Of course we have empathy! Well, okay, I can see how my husband might be a systemizer. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of music. He can look at a stack of his many hundreds of CDs and instantly know which ones are missing. He has memorized lines and phrases from a multitude of television shows and movies, and can retrieve and quote one to fit virtually any conversation in which he finds himself... a more sophisticated version, in fact, of the way Bud  adapts his scripts  to fit his surroundings. And though my husband's natural inclination and preference is toward empathy, his ADHD can dramatically hamper his ability to read people accurately. So, okay, I can see how this might apply to him. But ME???? Never. I practically have empathy coming out of my pores. My professional career is  built  on a foundation of empathy. No, no, no. None of this came from me. Except. I am an introvert. There are lots of social situations that I avoid when I can. And, okay, I did score a 760 out of 800 on the analytical portion of the GRE. But that was just a fluke, right? And, while not technologically-minded in a civil engineering sort of way, I was online in the late 80's, in the days before the worldwide web, when you still had to type \"smtp%\" to send an e-mail, and when virtually no one else I knew had even heard of the Internet. And there is that tricky little McCartney obsession. I'm certain that without trying too hard I could connect that safety gate eye hook to something McCartney-related. There were the hours, days, months, and years I spent trading and collecting volumes of video and audio tape footage of McCartney interviews and appearances from around the world. And there were at least as many hours spent painstakingly cataloguing each individual clip to compile an accurate multi-page list, each entry alphabetized, dated, and timed down to the minute. And I guess I should include the charts that mark the time when the McCartney obsession gave way to the baby obsession; the daily records (in now-embarrassing detail) of my basal body temperature and other bodily functions that reflect my attempt to predict and control a process that was so unpredictable and uncontrollable it nearly made me crazy. And there's that wacky little notebook stashed up in the attic that records every morsel of nutrition that passed Bud's lips for the first several (I'm not even sure I want to know how many) months of his life. And this blog. Yeah, there is this blog. Are all bloggers systemizers, when you get right down to it? Assortative mating.

He's been having sessions just about once a week, usually for a half hour. The therapist we see is very respectful of Bud, so if he says \"I'm all done now\" after 20 minutes, then she stops. If he's really into it, she'll go as long as 45 minutes. It's hard to know exactly what effect it's having because 1) there is nothing to measure, and 2) CST is only one of the things we are doing with Bud, so we can't isolate the effects of it as compared to anything else. That being said, my gut instinct is that it's a good thing. First, Bud enjoys it and looks forward to it. He settles into it quickly, and gets very relaxed during every session. His therapist says that she notices his system responding much more quickly than it did when we first started, and says that he leans into the therapy right away. One thing that I have noticed, which we think is related to the therapy: I don't notice Bud grinding his teeth nearly as much as he did when we first started. He used to grind them so loudly it woke me up; these days I don't hear it at all.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/06/cranio-sacral-update.html", "title": "\nCranio-Sacral Update\n"},

He has full sets of his favorite casts - Blues Clues, Teletubbies, Sesame Street - and increasingly he uses these figures to create his own storylines, sometimes even concocting plots in which Clifford the Big Red Dog hangs out with Barney and Baby Bop. What he really loves, though, is recreating favorite scenes from treasured videos and tv shows. He's a skilled director - framing the shot, working out the blocking, and even doubling as dialogue coach. When he doesn't have a full set of characters or when he needs a guest star, he is happy to improvise and pretend - so the Fisher Price dollhouse mom and dad regularly fill in as the Kratt Brothers when he plays Zoboomafoo, but can also serve as Steve and Joe when both are needed for Blues Clues. This week he's been taken with a recent episode of Caillou, in which Caillou and his family take a trip on an airplane. Bud has figures of Caillou and his little sister Rosie, but the Fisher Price parents were called into action to play the roles of Caillou's Mom and Dad. The scene that got the most play was the one in which the family was invited to visit the cockpit (which, for some reason that most certainly exists but I haven't yet figured out, Bud insists on calling the \"plane-tent.\") In Bud's depiction of this scene, the players have consistently been Caillou, Rosie, their Mom and Dad, and a toy cow. Each time, the cow cheerfully greets Caillou and his family,  \"Good morning, young man! Would you like to visit the plane-tent?\"  and a tour of the cockpit ensues. It took a few viewings of Bud's cow-in-the-airplane scene for me to understand what was going on. At first I thought the cow was flying the plane. Then it hit me. The cow wasn't the main pilot.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 11, 2005", "body": "\nI recently read, and loved,  this essay  by Ann Bauer in which she recounts the story of a roadtrip to Fargo with her teenage son, who has autism. The essay prompted me to buy Bauer's first novel,  A Wild Ride Up the Cupboards , which tells the story of a woman who (like Bauer) has three children, the oldest of whom begins developing the symptoms of autism when he is about four years old. In  Finding Fargo , Bauer writes that the characters in the novels have similarities to her family, but are not her family. Therein, I believe, lies the problem. I really wish that Bauer had written a memoir. In one short essay, she captures so many moments that I recognize instantly - despite the fact that my autism journey has just begun and she is the second decade of hers. The novel, however, did not have that same resonance for me. I enjoyed it and it held my attention, but I did not  recognize  it. There is one plot point in particular - one very critical plot point upon which the novel turns - that simply seems artificial. I believe that Bauer used it as a vehicle to demonstrate the level of desperation that her characters felt; I understand the desperation, but I just think it was the wrong vehicle. On the other hand, I have to consider the possibility that this very artifical-feeling plot point is one that is a direct lift from Bauer's life. I reflect on the times in my own life when I've thought, \"if this all happened in a movie I'd think it was far-fetched and unrealistic.\" Life - and life with autism - can be like that. Bauer also uses a sub-plot that explores her main character's family history and the potential autism connections that may have been floating in the gene pool. Though both very engaging, the sub-plot and the main plot never quite come together. They continue to float, in search of a connection that is never really made. Perhaps that makes the novel itself a good metaphor for autism and parenting. We parents, driven by love and consumed with the mission to heal our children and create a safe haven for them in the world, search, seek, dig, divine, suppose, consider, react... and, in the process, travel a good many paths that lead to, as Bauer's character with autism dubs a stretch of road he's travelled, \"the Nowhere Place.\" And - when we're lucky - along the way, there are moments of clarity, moments of insight, moments of magic.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2005/07/19/fargo/index.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/10/wild-ride-up-cupboards.html", "title": "\nA Wild Ride Up the Cupboards\n"},

Autism is a World  is the story of Sue Rubin, a 26-year-old woman with autism so severe that for many years she was believed to be mentally retarded. She is mostly nonverbal, but through a communication device she is able to type words, sentences, paragraphs that are not only intelligible, but also profound. Through this technology, she communicates her insights about autism, her reflections on being autistic, and her frustrations with having her inner world of thoughts and ideas trapped under a shroud of disability. It supports - by irrefutable living example - the theory that inside every autistic person is a healthy non-autistic person waiting to come out. I don't think I have a place in my head to file this one. I haven't had enough time to process it. I don't know what it  means . And I don't know what to hope for. Do I hope that Bud is aware of his disability - that he has deep thoughts and feelings that he simply can't (but someday might) express? Or do I hope that he is blissfully unaware - that his perky, happy temperament is Bud through-and-through, and that there's no non-autistic Bud ready to be pulled to the surface? It's a tough question to ponder. I think this is why, as I read through other autism blogs that are out there, I feel so torn between the \"biomedical\" folks, who subscribe to the  DAN protocol  and other interventions focused on finding a cure, and the \" neurodiversity \" folks, who celebrate people with autism just as they are and who focus their energy in trying to break down barriers to create a world that is fair to and accepting of people on the spectrum. There is significant debate between the two camps, much of it mean-spirited and destructive. But there has also been some civil discourse. A couple of months ago, on his blog  Injecting Sense , biomedical proponent Wade Rankin got some healthy conversation going and created a few sturdy bridges. Despite that, this week another autism blogger, neurodiversity proponent Kevin Leitch announced on his blog  Left Brain/Right Brain  that because of the hostility he's encountered he is no longer comfortable posting about his daughter. Autism is a World  is a remarkable documentary, and it provides an important insight into one woman's experience. But I am reminded again, as I am reminded so often, that \"if you've met one person with autism, you've met one person with autism.\" There are no universals in this universe. Autism  is  a world - one in which we must each thoughtfully, carefully make our way. But as we sort out this world as it relates to our particular person with autism, we must also create a village in which it's safe to raise all our children.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.stateart.com/pressreleases/autismCNN.asp", "http://http://www.autismwebsite.com/ari/index.htm", "http://www.neurodiversity.com/", "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2005/08/trying-to-understand-neurodiversity.html", "http://http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=294"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/10/autism-is-world.html", "title": "\nAutism is a World\n"},

I knew that Bud was eager to return to school (and to a predictable schedule) following an  unsettling holiday weekend , but I was a little worried that he'd have a hard time settling in again. To my surprise, Nana reported that drop-off on Monday was a huge success. She typically hands Bud off to his aide at the front door, and he and the aide walk together down the long hallway to his classroom. On Monday, however, Bud entered the building with gusto, said a quick goodbye to Nana, threw back his shoulders, and strutted past his aide and toward the classroom. His aide raised her eyebrows and Nana, then followed Bud at a distance. Little Mr. Independent! On Tuesday evening, I was toweling Bud off after his bath and he seemed lost in thought. Then his eyes sparkled and he looked at me and said, \"Mama! I walk to Kindergarten ALL BY MYSELF!\" I almost fell over. He was proud... and he wanted to share his pride with me! \"You DID?\" I gushed. \"Wow! What a big kid you are!\" \"Yeah!\" he said. \"I walk to the classroom all by myself! Like this!\" He threw his towel to the floor, lifted his chin, puffed up his chest, and then - all grinning teeth, pumping elbows and poking ribcage - he marched across the bathroom floor to steal a glance of his big-boy self in the full-length mirror.

{"date": "Monday, November 28, 2005", "body": "\nI posted yesterday about my efforts to give Bud more processing time when I ask him questions. I neglected to mention, however, how hard I'm trying to ask him fewer questions to begin with. I've been working on integrating  RDI  into Bud's life, and one of the  goals in RDI  is to shift the way we speak to children on the spectrum to use 80% declarative language and 20% imperative language. Imperative language is the language that children on the spectrum tend to use most (99% of the time as opposed to 67% of the time for children with other types of developmental delays, according to one study.) Imperative language is that which is used for instrumental purposes like making requests, asking questions, and stating demands. It is the language of a black-and-white world in which there is One Correct Response. Declarative language, in contrast, does not have utilitarian functions; it's goal is experience-sharing. Declarative communication does not require a specific response; instead, it's intention is to promote interaction, and share thoughts, ideas, preferences, and emotions with another person. It is a form of communication that by it's very nature says \"I am interested in you, and I hope that you are interested in me, too.\" And it does not come easily to children on the spectrum. As we work with Bud and try to help him develop language, it is really declarative language that we're working toward. He knows how to ask for what he wants. He even knows how to say please and thank you. He will be able to \"get by\" in the world with that kind of language. But I want more than \"getting by\" for Bud; I want him to engage with and be curious about people, to develop deep friendships, to fall in love and have someone fall back. So right now, I have to help him build a solid foundation from which to make those leaps. I need to help him learn to ask \"how are you?\", yes; but more than that, I need to help him care how you are. And so, I try to role model declarative language for Bud, and give him small jumping-off points for experience-sharing conversation. Instead of \"Bud, it's time for bed,\" or \"Are you tired, Bud?\" I try \"You look a little sleepy,\" or \"I'm feeling tired.\" Instead of \"What did you do in school?\" I try \"I love the picture you brought home in your backpack.\" Instead of \"Bud, put on your shoes so we can go,\" I try \"It's almost time to go; I wonder what we should do next.\" It sounds easy, but I find that 80% is a real challenge. Imperatives roll off the tongue; declaratives take thoughtful intentionality. And that, I think, is the point.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rdiconnect.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/i-do-declare.html", "title": "\nI do declare\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, December 28, 2005", "body": "\nBud has done extraordinarily well through the holiday, despite the unpredictability and irregularity of our schedule. I'm off from work this week, so we've had one fun-filled day of adventure after another - a trip to the swimming pool at the local college, time on the computer at my empty office, a trip to the toy store to exchange a duplicate and pick out  anything  he wanted, a long car ride to a fun children's museum. They've all been good things, but in  Autismland  sometimes even too much of a good thing can be dysregulating. And it  has  been, to some extent. But Bud has recognized it and has zeroed in on the coping mechanisms he needs to keep himself balanced and well regulated. When I'm dysregulated and need to find a way to cope, I turn to  coffee , or Paul McCartney's music, or a really good book. Bud turns to his old friends. So this week, in the midst of new toys and new drumming talent and new computer games and new adventures, we're experiencing the renaissance of  Goodnight Moon ,  the lovely video made by the folks at HBO .  The video had been one of Bud's favorites for several years beginning when he was a toddler, but for many months it has been relegated to the back of the video shelf, unwatched and gathering dust. Since Christmas, though, we've seen it repeatedly and heard many, many scripts from it. The  book  itself is also enjoying a comeback, and Bud has been \"reading\" it to us over and over again:  \"In the great green room there was a telephone, and a red balloon, and picture of...\" It makes a lot of sense to me. The new stuff is exciting and he really wants to throw himself into it. But it's the  old  stuff - the tried and true stuff, the predictable, recitable, entirely known-inside-out stuff - that provides a touchstone, a point of reference, and a jumping-off point. And he's ready to jump again - tomorrow he wants to cash in his bookstore gift certificate to search out two other books from the  Goodnight Moon  video that he doesn't have, Faith Ringold's  Tar Beach  and Mercer Mayer's  There's a Nightmare in my Closet . He's ready to branch out and add them to the repertoire, secure in the knowledge that he can always return to the great green room.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2005/12/autismland_101_.html", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0783116640/qid=1135821326/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-6062778-8171156?v=glance&s=video", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0694003611/qid=1135822024/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6062778-8171156?n=507846&s=books&v=glance", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0517885441/qid=1135822858/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-3317162-9607065?n=507846&s=books&v=glance", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140547126/qid=1135822904/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-3317162-9607065?s=books&amp;amp;amp;amp;v=glance&n=283155"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/12/comfort-and-joy.html", "title": "\nComfort and joy\n"},

{"date": "Monday, January 16, 2006", "body": "\nI never thought about how much I had in common with penguins until I read a post by MothersVox on Autism's Edges and enrolled Bud in a gymnastics class that is designed for children with diagnosed  disabilities . We live in a fairly rural area where there are not many opportunities like the one presented by this gymnastics class, so despite the fact that the class is some distance away I did not hesitate to register Bud for it. When we arrived at the class I gave the teacher our address. \"But that's 45 minutes each way,\" she said, incredulously. \"And the class is only 45 minutes long!\" \"Yes,\" I said, considering for the first time that perhaps this had been a foolish decision. \"But I really think he's going to like it.\" \"Wow,\" she said. \"I'm impressed.\" And Bud did enjoy it; in fact, he loved it. There are only three other boys in the class and though we didn't play \"Name That Diagnosis,\" it was pretty clear that they were all on the spectrum. Throughout the class, though, the teacher made at least four more references to the fact that I had traveled so far to attend, calling it to the attention of others, and suggesting that perhaps I should sign up for the class right before it as well, to at least make the trip \"worthwhile.\" I started chatting with the teacher about the classes - there are three 45-minute classes being held each week for eight weeks, all of them for children with disabilities. I asked her if this was the first time they'd run a class like this, and she explained that she had approached the gymnastics center with a proposal for them. Her son is one of the boys in the class, and she was tired of enrolling him in activities only to have to withdraw after the first session because he couldn't manage it. She wanted to create a safe space for him, where he could be himself and where she didn't have to worry what other parents were thinking. So she created, and is teaching, these three classes so that he will have three opportunities each week to interact with peers outside of school. And she thought *I* was going above and beyond by driving 45 minutes to be there. I thought about it all the way home (and since I had a 45-minute drive, there was plenty of time to think) and was reminded of  MothersVox's post , in which she draws the parallel between parents of children on the autism spectrum and the stars of  March of the Penguins  who withstand cruel conditions and overcome tremendous odds simply to give life to their young. As I drove I began thinking about the fiercely determined yet gently-dispositioned penguins I'd seen in the movie just a few weeks earlier, and I began to imagine the conversations they had as they huddled together for warmth, turning their backs to the blinding snow. \"I just can't believe you walked the whole 70 miles to be here.\" \"Oh, that? That's nothing. What about you and that incident with the seal - that must have been terrifying!\" Why does that sound so familiar? Why are so many of us so quick to applaud the insight, determination, and plain old hard work of other parents, but just as quick to downplay our own? The penguins spend eight months every year enduring unthinkably harsh conditions; do they spend any time during the other four months just being proud of what they've accomplished? Unlike the penguins, we don't spend eight months on and four months off. Autism is an all day, every day, every week, every month, every year, pervasive and all-consuming condition. Most of us will never arrive at the day when we can say we \"beat it.\" For most of us, there will always be more to learn, more to try, more to consider, more to do, do, do. Despite that -  because  of that - we have to find the opportunities to celebrate our moments of determination and triumph: the times we work for hours to fill  15 minutes , the times we hurl ourselves between our children and the  cruel comments  from people who should know better, the times we  challenge our thinking  and stretch ourselves to truly meet our children's needs, and, yes, even the times we drive 90 minutes so that our children can participate in 45 minutes of gymnastics.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/01/community_helpe.html#more", "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/01/not-so-polar-opposites.html", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/01/191.html#comments", "http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=15324357&postID=113639507028579803", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/01/im_having_a_bal.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/01/march-of-parents.html", "title": "\nMarch of the Parents\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, January 29, 2006", "body": "\nToday during the coffee hour after our  church  service, an older man I'm very fond of approached me and said, \"I was watching you during the service. I'm going to give you the same advice I give to my daughters when they need it: it's time to take a deep breath.\" He didn't elaborate, and I didn't ask him to. I thanked him for the advice, and acknowledged its wisdom and timeliness. He told me it was the sort of wisdom that comes with age, and he smiled and walked away as my throat tightened and my eyes pooled with tears. So there it was. I'd wondered where it was. I'd been fooling myself for the past few days into thinking that it must be packed away in a box marked \"The Past,\" but apparently I'd been carrying it right out in the open the whole time. I call it \"stealth grief.\" It's the phase of grieving that gets the least amount of attention and airtime. It's what happens when the grief is no longer a gaping open wound that you couldn't hide if you wanted to, when you have gotten through the aching, screaming pain, and when the good days finally - and by far - outnumber the bad. It's stealthy because you don't always see it coming, and because it emerges in new and different ways that you don't always recognize. At least that's how it happens for me. Sometimes I don't see it coming because it pops up out of the blue - like when I hear that Julia Roberts has given birth to healthy twins, or when a woman in her blissful first pregnancy asks me if an amniocentesis hurts, or when people talk about their children's bond as siblings. Other times, I know it might be coming because of a date on the calendar - Mother's Day, for example. Or January 27. Eight years ago on January 27 I had a baby girl. She was born with severe spina bifida and hydrocephalus when I was about 18 weeks pregnant and she was too small to survive outside my body. Seven years ago on January 27 I found out that I was pregnant again. I later found out that I was carrying twins, later that one of the twins had mild spina bifida and hydrocephalus, later that the affected twin had died at full-term in utero, and later that the surviving twin had autism. As you might imagine, for the past eight years January has been a difficult month. At first, the grief was right there on the surface, easy to identify and impossible to conceal. I talked, I cried, I wrote, I read, and grieved and grieved and grieved until some time had passed and the open wound began to heal. But the subsequent Januaries have been trickier: I spend the better part of the month each year wondering how the anniversary will affect me  this  time. Will this be a wracking-sob year? Or a reflective-but-peaceful year? Or will this be a stealth year, when grief slips on a disguise and makes me think it's passed me by, only to jump out and grab me when I least expect it? I never grieved Bud's autism in the way that I read about people grieving after getting a diagnosis. I understand what people experience - the \"death\" of the dream of the neurotypical child you thought you had, and the adjustment to the reality of the wonderfully complex child you actually have. Maybe it's because there was not a startling \"moment of diagnosis\" for Bud, but rather a slow-paced, evolutionary unfolding of it.  I'm not sure.  Whatever the reason, the autism itself has never been a source of grief for me. Bud's diagnosis did affect me in a different way, though; it affected me in a three-strikes-and-you're-out-of-the-baby-making-business sort of way. When Bud's brother died, the fear of spina bifida was daunting. We suddenly went from having a 1 in 1000 risk of having a subsequent pregnancy affected by it to a 1 in 20 risk. The idea that the risk was too great to ever try again was overwhelming. For a while. But somewhere, on some level, there was a competing thought:  1 in 20 means that there is a 19 in 20 chance that a subsequent baby would  not  have spina bifida . That thought floated around through Bud's toddler years, and I imagined that a day would come when I would pull it down and have a good look at it. Before that day arrived, we discovered that Bud had autism. Since then, the reality has set in: a subsequent baby has an increased risk of spina bifida and of autism. Bud needs all of the time and attention and care that we can muster already. We would struggle to have time and attention for another child, even if that child were healthy and neurotypical. And the chances are great that the child would not be. Bud will be our only living child. I have known that for quite some time.  Known  it. But, it seems, that stealthy creature grief has been lurking in the shadows for a while, getting caught in my peripheral vision but ducking around corners right before I've turned around to get a better look, making me wonder if my imagination was getting the best of me and there was nothing out there after all, slowly getting closer until - WHAM. Wham. Out of nowhere, someone in church calls to my attention the things I have chosen not to see, and I suddenly understand why the blogs that have resonated most with me recently have been the sad ones; I recognize that the tightness and ache in my neck and shoulders is probably not bursitis after all; I become aware of the sensation in my body I had not even acknowledged - the one that starts somewhere behind my eyes and travels down to about my navel and feels like a blend of being bone-weary tired and of getting stuck in mid-sigh, unable to take it back and unable to complete it. It seems that in this stealth year - the one in which my 40th birthday looms large on the horizon - grief has slipped on a new identity. I am not specifically grieving the loss of my daughter or the loss of my son. Instead, I am grieving my long-imagined idea of family, the one in which I have a gaggle of children whom I adore, and who adore each other. I am grieving the relationship that Bud will never have with a sibling. I am grieving the presence of the one person who will always be there for him, even when his father and I can no longer be. And yet, even as I grieve, I can find the pockets of comfort. I can see the ways that the babies I knew so briefly have shaped my life so completely. I recognize the role they play in making me a better mother to Bud, in helping me to appreciate things about him that I might otherwise forget to notice. And I experience more frequently and more acutely, in those fuzzy moments between awake and asleep as I huddle together with my  wolf pack , the comfort that comes from the absolute certainty that one-plus-one-plus-one equals five, that there is a warmth we have generated that extends far beyond us, that there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. And so, I take the advice of my wise friend at church, and I breathe, in, and out, my inhales and exhales in harmony and counter-point with the rest of my wolf pack. My family. We breathe, together and apart, and we huddle closer as time passes and the calendar, once again, allows us to move forward into February.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.uua.org/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/01/stealth-grief.html", "title": "\nStealth grief\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 10, 2006", "body": "\nI'm finished with Simon Baron-Cohen, et al 's  Teaching Children with Autism to Mind-Read . I haven't read the whole thing, but I'm done with it. As I described in a  previous post , the book outlines a very structured technique for helping children identify emotions in other people. It's a systematic approach, and I'm certain that it works. But it left me with one question: So what? So what if my son can tell that you are happy/sad/angry/afraid? So what if he knows  why  you are happy/sad/angry/afraid? So what if he can predict that a particular set of circumstances will  make  you happy/sad/angry/afraid? What does any of that matter if, ultimately, he doesn't  care  that you are happy/sad/angry/afraid? It seems to me that this very structured (and, to me, rigid and inflexible) approach is a very \"autistic\" way to teach about human emotion. The model suggests that solving problems like the following will help children with autism understand \"desire-based\" emotion:  James wants chocolate ice cream. His mom gives him vanilla ice cream. How does James feel? (Choose one: happy or sad.) It makes me want to scream. Perhaps James feels  neither  happy nor sad. Perhaps he feels vaguely unsatisfied. Perhaps he first feels disappointed, but then feels the excitement of discovery as he experiences vanilla for the first time and finds he likes it even  more  than he likes chocolate. Or - gasp! - perhaps he won't perseverate on the ice cream; perhaps, instead, James will say to himself \"It is a beautiful sunny day, and while I don't really care for vanilla ice cream it doesn't matter all that much in the broad scheme of things. I think I'll just skip the ice cream and play on the swings instead.\" If I want Bud to be successful in the world, I need to help him understand and make sense of the flexible, evolutionary, constantly changing world of human emotion. I am doing him a disservice if I set low expectations and define success as a rigid understanding of a series of \"if this, then that\" scenarios. I need to help him become a  broadband communicator  - to read, interpret, and respond to multiple cues simultaneously and automatically. Since that's my goal, I need to choose the  educational pedagogies and intervention models  that are best able to help him get there; and for that reason, mind-reading won't be included in Bud's curriculum.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/02/mind-reading-and-illusion-of.html", "title": "\nMind-reading and the illusion of understanding\n"},

I am so delighted with Bud's  current teacher  that I am maintaining a low level of (I realize, irrational) panic that his educational experience will all be downhill from here. So I've started thinking about what makes Mrs. H such a great fit for Bud, and what qualities I should be seeking in his next teacher. An off-handed comment Mrs. H made a few weeks ago has gotten me thinking. She was telling me about the teachers' recent professional development day. In one of their workshops, they assessed their own  learning styles . The model they used for the assessment is one developed by Anthong F. Gregorc, and my admittedly very limited understanding of it was gleaned from a one-hour workshop that the school principal gave for parents last year. Briefly, the model looks at two key factors: perception and ordering. There are two types of perception in the model - concrete and abstract - and people usually show a preference for one or the other. Concrete perception is based on the information we take in with the five senses, the things we can see, hear, taste, touch, and smell. It is the literal, actual, reality of what is right here right now, and people who use it tend to think \"It is what it is.\" By contrast, abstract perception happens when we take in information by looking for themes and patterns, looking beyond what is actual to imagine the more subtle implications of what is possible, using intuition to form our ideas about what we are experiencing. People who use abstract perception tend to think, \"It's not always what it seems.\" The model also presents two styles of ordering - sequential and random - and, as with perception, people tend to prefer one over the other. People who use sequential ordering tend to prefer organizing information in a linear, step-by-step manner, follow a logical progression, and take a traditional approach to problem-solving. People who prefer random ordering tend to organize information by \"chunks\" in no particular order. They tend to leap into the middle of the problem they are solving instead of starting at a clearly defined beginning, and they jump around as they work, skipping steps when the step is not needed to get to the goal. When people assess their preferences and abilities in these two areas, they typically discover that they fall clearly into one of four preferred learning styles: Concrete Sequential Abstract Random Abstract Sequential Concrete Random When I did the assessment a year ago, I was not surprised to discover that my learning style is Abstract Random. I have worked a great deal with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, and my clear preference for  INFP  suggests the same sorts of attributes. I  was  interested to learn, however, that Mrs. H is also Abstract Random. Even  more  interesting was the fact that  so is  nearly every member of the team who works so well with Bud. Fascinating. As I read through the descriptions of each of the learning styles, it seems to me that Bud (and perhaps many others on the spectrum) is uber-Concrete Sequential. Some parts of the description that resonated most (thoughts in parentheses are my own): What makes sense to them: Working  systematically , step by step Paying close attention to details (that are  important  to him) Having a (visual)  schedule  to follow Literal  interpretations Knowing what's expected of them Routines, established ways of doing things What's hard for them: Working in groups Discussions that seem to have no specific point (that are of a particular interest to him) Working in an unorganized (overstimulating) environment Following incomplete or unclear directions Working with  unpredictable people Dealing with abstract ideas Demands to \"use your imagination\" Questions with no right or wrong answers Sound familiar to anyone else? What is most interesting to me is that although Bud has such a strong (overwhelming?) preference for Concrete Sequential learning, he responds  least  to the educators and  methodologies  that are also Concrete Sequential. I suppose it makes sense. If Concrete Sequential educators are concerned with finding and teaching the  Right Answers , it would be difficult for them to comprehend - never mind appreciate - the answers that are  Not Even Wrong . For most Concrete Sequentials, the \"correct\" approaches, responses, and products are the conventional ones. But Bud's concrete reality enters his consciousness through a  different filter ; his  sequence  is always logical, but it is rarely traditional. So, as I think about the teachers and classrooms in which Bud will thrive, I realize that he needs to be in an environment in which he is guided, challenged, and supported by Abstract Randoms: What they do best: Listen to others Understand feelings and emotions Focus on themes and ideas Bring harmony to group situations Establish positive relationships with everybody Recognize and meet the emotional needs of others What makes sense to them: Personalized learning Broad, general guidelines Maintaining friendly relationships Enthusiastic participation in projects they believe in Decisions made with the heart instead of the head  The primary question they ask while learning: \"How can I make a difference?\" It seems to me that it is the Abstract Random teacher who best understands the difference between consistency and sameness; who sees that while Bud needs consistency and predictability, it is the consistency of  philosophy  and the predictability of  relationship , and not the routine of activity or behavior, that will yield success. He can deal with change; in many ways he thrives on change. But he deals with change best when he has an Abstract Random guide who can help shape his understanding of the change and help him to know that even in transition he is safe and life is stable. Last year Bud had some testing with a wonderful  child psychologist . As we were wrapping up, I asked him what I should be looking for in a classroom environment for Bud. He gave me a few concrete suggestions, then paused. \"The most important thing,\" he said, \"is that Bud needs to be with people who love him.\" I knew that he was right. The teachers, the specialists, the paraprofessionals who are best suited to Bud are the ones who are primarily concerned with making a difference in his life, who believe in him and in the transformative power of education, who can hear the responses he gives that are  not even wrong  and without hesitation hone in on the parts that are so very right, who try new things and respond and adapt and change, change, change while always maintaining a centered, rooted, immutable Bud-focused philosophy. Now how do I explain all that to a potential first-grade teacher?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.csrnet.org/csrnet/articles/student-learning-styles.html", "http://www.csrnet.org/csrnet/articles/learning-styles-CS.html", "http://www.csrnet.org/csrnet/articles/learning-styles-AR.html", "http://www.csrnet.org/csrnet/articles/learning-styles-AS.html", "http://www.csrnet.org/csrnet/articles/learing-styles-CR.html", "http://www.personalitypage.com/INFP.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/02/abstract-random.html", "title": "\nAbstract Random\n"},

You see,  he  was thinking through the implications of the play date much more thoroughly than I was. I was thinking about Hayden and Hannah. Bud was thinking about their baby sister. Bud does not care for babies. He never has. I think it's because they are too much like  dogs  - noisy, unpredictable, confusing, quick-moving and, perhaps worst, attention-grabbing. And it's not just  any  attention they grab - it's  my  attention. For as long as I can remember I have been a baby magnet. I am drawn to babies - all babies, any babies - and they are drawn to me. And Bud knows it. In  yesterday's post  I proposed that Bud was scared because he didn't know what to expect from the play date. I was wrong. I think he was scared because he knew  exactly  what to expect:  If we have a play date, they will bring the baby. I will not enjoy the baby. The baby will try to be with Mom. This will bother me. I will seek comfort from Mom. The baby will be near Mom. I do not want to be near the baby. I do not want Mom to be near the baby. I will be scared. The script he was using last night to talk about it -  \"It's going to get me! It's going to get me!\"  -now suddenly makes sense. Luckily, we were only seconds into the play date when I figured it out. I kept my distance from the baby, but it was just not meant to be. The deceptively sunny playground had an icy cold wind blasting through it (a real one, not a metaphorical one). We moved indoors, but that put us in closer proximity to the baby, who got tangled in her sister's legs and started crying. She calmed down, but then Hayden bumped his head and  he  started crying. It didn't take long for Bud to walk up to me, coat in hand, and say \"We have to get going. Put on your coat, Mom.\" Then to his friends, he added, \"Good luck with the games, everyone!\" Good language, good self-advocacy, good problem-solving.

{"date": "Saturday, March 18, 2006", "body": "\nIt seems we may not be having a goldfish funeral this weekend after all. This morning,  Dorothy  was upgraded from critical to serious condition. She remains in her isolated bowl, which is now just a watery ICU, but she's perky, she's eating, and her eyes don't seem as filmy as they were. Maybe she just needed a break from crazy little Stevie. Whatever the case, Bud has not made mention of Dorothy since yesterday's promise that she'd \"feel better soon.\" She is not on his radar, and he is not at all concerned about her. So, my preparations for the possibility of her passing have all been internal. I'd left a question about it for  Mrs. H  in Bud's school-home notebook, and she wisely suggested that it will be important to read Bud's feelings about it in the moment:  \"Quite often, kids can be matter-of-fact and have an \"oh well\" attitude. Sometimes they say \"oh well,\" but are truly distressed about it. And sometimes they say \"oh well\" today, but three weeks later it may come back as nightmares or random sadness.\"  So perhaps there is a danger in being too prepared as well, as it might lead to imbuing the moment with too much unnecessary fanfare. I do think we'll avoid the ceremonial flushing of the carcass when the time comes, however. Bud already has enough tricky issues associated with toileting; we just don't need to complicate that any further. But I don't have a plan beyond that - a burial? a private flush? I'll just have to figure it out when the time comes. Since we didn't need to spend any time last night talking about Dorothy, I spent the evening badgering poor Bud about today's activities instead. Bud and I are both fans of the  Curious George  books. We both adore Jack Johnson's latest single  Upside Down , which comes from the  Curious George  soundtrack (in fact, now that we've downloaded it from Itunes it is the  only  song that Bud wants to hear when we are in the car). So, I thought, what could be better than a Saturday trip to see the  Curious George  movie? Bud did not agree. He adamantly refuses to see it. We've seen movies in the past and he has enjoyed it, but the last time we tried to see one we had to leave the theater (in tears) during the previews. (What rocket scientist thought it was a good idea to show a dark  Harry Potter  preview before a movie with a G rating?) And, it seems, that was that for Bud. He's through with the movie-going experience. I really would like to see  Curious George , though, so I pushed a little harder than I normally would and continued to bring it up throughout the evening. \"Come on, Bud,\" I said, finally. \"Let's see  Curious George  tomorrow. I know that it would be fun.\" Apparently that was what it took to fray Bud's very last nerve. He spun around to face me, and with a mix of exasperation and anger he shouted \"I DON'T HAVE TO BE FUN!\" Point taken. So I'm not sure what we'll be doing this fine Saturday. I don't think we'll be trying to dig in the frozen ground of the backyard to bury a lost goldfish. There's not much chance that we'll be seeing any movies. But there's one thing for certain: we will definitely  not  be having fun.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/on-goldfish-monkeys-and-right-to-be.html", "title": "\nOn goldfish, monkeys, and the right to be boring\n"},

{"date": "Monday, April 17, 2006", "body": "\nI'm finding that making judgments about the interventions we use with Bud can be sort of like going out to eat at a fantastic restaurant: the first bite is so good and so satisfying that my brain makes the leap that if some of this is  good , then more of it will be  better . I dive in and begin to devour what's in front of me, and before I know it I discover that I am so full it hurts and that, in retrospect,  more   good  has turned out to be  not-so-good . I suppose that in the midst of these feeding frenzies my body tries to send cues to my brain  (\"For the love of God, stop eating!\") , but I am so swept up in the moment that I don't (or I choose not to) interpret the cues correctly. I'm afraid I've done the same thing with Bud's \"therapies.\" Last year, Bud saw a massage therapist who did  Cranio-Sacral Therapy . At first, he loved the sessions. They relaxed him, and he looked forward to them. As time passed, he began to have mixed reactions to the therapy. He had one session that was particularly intense; he was more fully engaged and \"into\" it than he had ever been, and because of that it was the longest session he'd ever had. Following that session, Bud did a complete turn-around. He didn't want the therapist to touch him the next week. Or the week after that. Or the week after that. I don't know if that last session was too intense, if it kicked up emotion, or if it was unsettling to him, and he didn't have the language to talk about his reaction. Each week he said he wanted to go, but then when we got to the office he'd say he wanted to leave. It took me several weeks of making attempts, giving him encouragement, and asking him for words and explanations to realize that he was telling me what he needed, but I wasn't listening. He needed to be done. We've just had a similar experience with Bud's occupational therapy sessions, but this time it took me even longer to get it. Bud's been having one-on-one OT sessions for more than a year, and for a long time he really enjoyed them. They helped with some of his sensory integration difficulties and helped improve his fine motor skills. But in recent months, Bud has been having out-of-character reactions to his OT. He has been bossy, belligerent, defiant, stubborn, rude - in other words, none of the things that we know him to be. I spoke to his OT about it  (\"We never see this from him...\") , but of course this was all she was seeing of him, so perhaps I sounded like a mom in denial. I chalked it up to a developmental phase, to him testing boundaries, and I convinced myself that it would pass.  OT has always been good for him,  I reasoned,  and so of course it will continue to get better .  More is better, more is better, more is better. I'm usually at work when Bud has his OT sessions, but two weeks ago I was running late and the OT was running early and I was home to hear the session from downstairs. Bud, who had spent the morning happy and cheerful and easy-going, changed in an instant and began engaging in battle. The OT stood her ground, and the situation escalated. I stood at the bottom of the stairs with indecision rooting me to the spot. Should I intervene? Does he need me? Will I be undermining the work that she's doing? I started up the stairs slowly, then broke into a run as I heard Bud start to cry. I dropped down next to him on the floor and he buried his face in me and sobbed. I rocked him and whispered to him. The OT was frustrated, probably with me. I could  feel  her tension and aggravation as she spoke to Bud and asked if he was angry. I'm sure that he could feel it, too. She told me that she had some information for me about  mercury . I told her I had a lot of information about mercury. She said it was brand new research. Bud sobbed some more, and we rocked together. He needed to be done. So we're taking a break from OT. Maybe a short break, maybe a permanent break. I'm upset with myself for not reading Bud's cues better and earlier, for making him continue when he was clearly ready to stop, for pushing for more, more, more instead of walking away at \"just enough.\" It's  hard  to know how much is \"just enough.\" It's hard to walk away from a once-good thing when there is still more available. But I need to learn to recognize the signs that  good  has gone past  better  and is cycling back toward  bad . I need to learn when to say \"when,\" and then walk away from the table with the satisfaction of moderation and good judgment instead of the pain of over-indulgence. Because let's face it: when I over-indulge, it's really Bud who feels the pain.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/04/learning-when-to-say-when.html", "title": "\nLearning when to say \"when\"\n"},

I have loved the show since I was three-years-old. I'm delighted that it's one of Bud's favorites. But why does Sesame Street, the pioneering leader in educational television for young children, feature characters who role model poor speech patterns? There are two factors that have made the role modeling a problem for Bud: 1) Bud is an  echolalic speaker , so almost all of his early speech and a great deal of his current speech is comprised of phrases he has memorized from television and videos, and 2) Since he began using spontaneous language, one of the areas that has been most problematic for him is the use of pronouns  (\"Look, Mama, it's a picture of me!\"; \"No, honey, that's not you. That's a picture of me.\"; \"Yes, it's a picture of me!\").  For both of these reasons, I've been frustrated by the confusion that Sesame Street's much-loved characters have created for Bud with their improper use of grammar. There are really only two main culprits: Elmo, who uses the third person exclusively  (\"Elmo is so happy to see you!\")  and Cookie Monster, who uses objective pronouns in place of subjective pronouns  (\"Me love cookies!\")  But for a boy who has continually struggled with pronomial reversals (initially first-person and second person, or I/you, and currently with gender-specific pronouns, like she/he and him/her), it adds an unnecessary layer of confusion to an already complicated learning process. My current frustration is actually not with grammar per se. Bud's favorite Sesame Street segments these days are claymation shorts that feature two caveman-type characters (Bud tells me their names are Marty and Susie, but I have a hunch he made that up), who clash when they try to do things at the same time (sit in a chair, play basketball) but ultimately achieve success when they learn to cooperate. The shorts are well made and have a lovely little message about sharing. Unfortunately, the two characters communicate with each other by grunting, shrieking, babbling and using gibberish, all while engaged in fast-paced frenetic movement. Bud is captivated by these two characters, and he often reenacts their routines. Unfortunately, when he is around other people who lack context for this type of play, his behavior seems inappropriate and problematic. Of course, it doesn't occur to Bud to give people context for it and I can't always be there to provide it. I'm not  really  being critical of Sesame Street. I understand that Elmo and Cookie Monster and Marty and Susie are simply entertaining and are not at all confusing for most children.

It's also had a  Warholesque  quality to it, as Bud's been creating art from the things he loves, in multiples and variations. For weeks Bud created a recurring montage that appeared several times a day in various locations around the house, which I titled  Still Life With String Cheese . This work was comprised of four unique elements - a pear, an orange juicebox, half a blueberry bagel, and a stick of string cheese. Each particular art display had a twist that gave it it's own unique flair: the elements appeared in different orders, sometimes touching and sometimes not. The visual focus shifted as well: sometimes the bagel seemed to be at the center of the work; at other times, it was the pear. Sometimes Bud added a surreal quality to the work by taking a bite of the bagel, drinking the juice, or eating the string cheese and leaving only the wrapper. This week, Bud's artistic license drove him to abandon  Still Life With String Cheese  and devote his energy to a new work.

Most of the other kids in class chose to bring their dogs to the school playground for the last 20 minutes of the day. I also decided to show up for the canine finale, anticipating that it might not be Bud's favorite activity and that he might need some  extra support . I wasn't sure what to expect, honestly. Bud's negative reaction to dogs barking in the neighborhood has been as strong as ever. But he did have a breakthrough recently with Sophie's dog. Sophie is Bud's favorite child at school; when given a choice to pick a partner for an activity, he always chooses Sophie. Sophie seems to be a fan of Bud as well. At pick up time, she always has a flurry of questions for me:  When is Bud's birthday? Does Bud have anything purple  (their mutual favorite color)  in his room at home? What is Bud's favorite tv show? Does he like to watch High School Musical? Does Bud have any pets? Does he have brothers or sisters? What is Bud doing this weekend?  I refer Sophie directly to Bud when 1) she's asking a question he can answer and 2) he seems to be in a frame of mind in which he is receptive to questions. Otherwise, I answer her and point out the things that she and Bud have in common. Sophie has a new puppy, Teddy, a sweet and quiet Lhasa Apso she can carry in her arms. Teddy has come into the classroom with Sophie at pick-up time twice before. The first time she sought me out and asked,  \"Do you think Bud would like to pat Teddy?\"  I told her I wasn't sure, but that we could ask him. Sophie approached Bud, holding the dog tightly, and asked if he'd like to meet Teddy. Bud approached slowly and stood calmly right beside Sophie and me, as Sophie held the dog and I patted him. Bud reached out his hand and touched Teddy gently with one finger. I was astounded, until the following week when Sophie brought Teddy in again. This time, Bud stood by Sophie and patted Teddy, saying \"He's very soft!\" As we left the classroom, Bud crowed, \"Mama, what did I did?\" \"You patted Teddy, Bud. Teddy likes you.\" \"I talk it to Gracie and Coco and my dog guys,\" he said, letting me know that he'd be informing my sister's dogs of this remarkable achievement - interesting, since he won't let them into our house, but apparently sees them as members of his posse. I told him I was sure they'd be happy to hear it. So, as Pet Day approached Bud and I talked about the dogs that might be on the playground, and the fact that he didn't have to go near them unless he wanted to. And we talked about Teddy, who would surely be there. When the moment arrived, Bud and I sat across the road from the playground and watched the kids and moms and teachers and dogs mix and mingle. Bud was not interested in joining them, but wanted very much to get past them to the playground area that was beyond the fence. We circled the edge of the group, staying away from the animals, so that Bud could play on the slide. After a few minutes I looked up and saw Sophie approaching us. She spoke to me first. \"Is Bud afraid of dogs?\" \"Yes, he is a little afraid of dogs. But, you know, Teddy is his very favorite dog.\" \"Do you think he'd like to come see Teddy? He's back in our car now.\" \"Well, I'm not sure. You could ask him, but he might not want to.\" Sophie walked over to Bud and said \"Bud, do you want to go see Teddy? He's in the car.\" Bud blinked at her, clearly conflicted about what to do next. Sophie took his hand and said, \"Come on, it will be okay.\" And hand in hand they walked to Sophie's car to greet Teddy while I followed along behind them, very obviously an extraneous third wheel. I don't know whether or not Bud will ever become a dog-lover. But one things is certain: I know already that he has excellent taste in  friends .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/05/puppy-love.html", "title": "\nPuppy love\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, June 20, 2006", "body": "\nAfter much consideration, we've decided to roll out those lazy, hazy, crazy days of summer for Bud. He won't be attending summer school. He's eligible for the school district's summer session: a wonderful program for the month of July, four mornings a week in a small class with a low teacher-to-student ratio. Initially I jumped at the opportunity to enroll Bud in it. Then I watched Bud struggle through the  last days of the school , and I started to consider the transition to the summer program from his perspective: an unfamiliar (and long) commute to an unfamiliar classroom in an unfamiliar school building with unfamiliar teachers and unfamiliar routines with unfamiliar children for a month. Then a farewell to everything and everybody involved in the summer program and a month off before making the transition to first grade and a new classroom in his old school with a new teacher and mostly new routines with some familiar kids and some unfamiliar ones. He could do it; I know he could do it. It would be a difficult transition at first; he would be resistant, he'd cry a bit, he'd spend a good deal of time reciting scripts and pacing, but eventually he would settle in and make the best of it. But to what end? I'm not concerned that he'll \"regress\" during the summer. I'm not concerned that he'll be bored if he's not in school; Bud does not get bored easily. I'm not concerned that the lack of routine will be dysregulating for him. In fact, on the contrary, I think Bud could use some down-time. I think that having a fun, lazy summer will recharge Bud's battery and help him to fully engage in making a successful transition to first grade in the fall. So instead of going to school, Bud will spend four days a week with Nana, who says she's up for the adventure. We've arranged for two hours a week of private tutoring in reading with a teacher who knows and loves him, which will give him a chance to focus his energy on an area of strength and not just on areas of deficit. We'll continue to do RDI at home. We'll take advantage of programs at the library. We'll seek out opportunities to play with - or at least near - other children. And other than that, Bud will spend his time splashing in the inflatable pool we set up in the backyard, making trips to the lake to float on his orange tube and catch minnows in his net, tending to the pumpkin seed he planted in the garden, exploring the woods around our house, visiting the children's science museum, going to the park to toss rocks into the stream, eating popsicles and ice cream, creating elaborate pretend-play scenarios that involve sending beach balls and soccer balls and basketballs up and down the slide at the playground, playing hard, getting dirty, and sleeping well. This summer Bud's just going to be a kid.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/06/boy-of-summer.html", "title": "\nBoy of summer\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, June 25, 2006", "body": "\nI realized yesterday why it's been over a year since I spent any time with my friend Kay. Kay and I live more than two hours away from each other. We both work full-time, which makes getting together during the week exceedingly difficult. That leaves weekends. But Kay has a son, Sam, who is 18 months younger than Bud, so getting together on weekends means that we have to make a choice: get together  without  our boys and give up one of the only days each week that we have to spend with them, or get together  with  our boys and hope for the best. When Bud was a toddler/preschooler and Sam was a baby/toddler, our time together was strained because of Bud's strong  negative reaction to babies , and therefore to Sam. As they've gotten older, that dynamic has changed - and yet, no matter how we structure our playdates they never quite seem to work out. We've tried playdates at one house or the other, which were okay when Sam was at the developmental stage in which he enjoyed parallel play and preschool television shows. But Sam has passed those stages, and prefers play-acting scenes from Star Wars to reciting scripts from Teletubbies. And though Sam is a sweet, good-natured boy he is also a high-energy, fast-talking, quick-moving one, so the intensity of one-on-one playdates in small spaces with him is just too overwhelming for Bud. We've tried to meet for lunch - which was once okay, but is difficult these days because Bud has developed an aversion to restaurants and prefers to get meals that can be eaten in the car or taken home. So this time we decided to meet in a place that was familiar to Bud - a science museum that he loves. He has spent a lot of time there, and it's a comfortable environment for him. It meant a three-hour road trip for Kay and Sam, but Kay said that if it increased the likelihood of success she was up for the journey. I prepared Bud for a couple of days leading up to our museum playdate. He seemed fine with the plan, and even appeared to be looking forward to it. I had high hopes because the atmosphere in the museum would allow Sam to play and engage with other kids even if Bud was not interested in engaging, and it might even allow for some non-threatening parallel play for Bud. But the moment we arrived at the museum, Bud turned into a Teletubby. He talked like a Teletubby, made noises like a Teletubby, moved like a Teletubby - and disengaged from the bulk of the museum experience. I found private moments to ask Bud if he could talk like Bud for a while. Several times he said that yes, he could do that, and he used his loud, clear Bud voice to communicate a variety of things: \"I'm all done now!\"; \"Can we leave?\"; \"Can they go home?\"; \"It's time to go!\" As Kay and Sam had spent three hours in the car to be with us, and as my opportunities to be with Kay have been so few, I was reluctant to leave after such a brief stay, so each time I explained to Bud that we would be staying for a little while longer, and without fanfare Bud returned to Teletubbyland. As a result, Kay and I spent the afternoon engaging with our own sons, often on opposite ends of the museum, trying to fit in conversation in 30-second increments. Kay asked how Bud was doing in school and I tried to imagine how he must seem to her - this boy whom she only ever sees at his  dysregulated  worst. I wondered if the disconnect between the stories I told and the boy she saw was striking to her, and I wondered what conclusions that made her draw. For his part, Sam simply seemed confused by Bud, and at one point when we left for the bathroom, he said to his mom \"I guess Bud is still just a little shy.\" So he gave Bud space and focused on all that the museum had to offer. Toward the end of our afternoon, Kay and I found ourselves with a rare opportunity to chat, as our boys were engaged in activities in relative proximity to each other. She started filling me in on her life and for a few glorious moments we were having a real conversation, until in my peripheral vision I picked up a whirl of Bud and I heard a loud, unfamiliar cry. I spun around as a stunned Bud flew toward me, and in his wake I saw a small toddler, his arm in a sling, sprawled on the ground and wailing. His flustered mother was comforting him, and I looked to his grandmother: \"Did he do that?\" I asked pointing to Bud. She nodded, as the toddler's family gathered around him to make sure that his arm was okay, and that the damage was not critical. I offered a lame \"I'm sorry,\" then turned to a still-stunned Bud who buried his face in my neck and whispered, \"I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry.\" When the wailing had ceased and the boy was pronounced unharmed, the boy's father approached us, put his hand on Bud's shoulder and said \"It's okay. He's fine. He's not hurt.\" Though I appreciated his reassurance, Bud and I both remained shaken. When we finally climbed into the car at the end of the day, Bud devoured the picnic lunch that he'd refused to eat with our friends, then fell into a hard, deep sleep. I spent the ride home reviewing the day:  What should I have done? What shouldn't I have done? Where do we go from here?  Bud was in better spirits when we got home and the rest of the day passed quietly. At bedtime, after stories were read and lights were out, I cuddled next to Bud and he threw his arm around me and put his smiling face nose-to-nose with mine. \"Was today a hard day or an easy day?\" I asked him. \"A hard day.\" \"How did today make you feel?\" \"Sad.\" \"What made you feel sad?\" \"My friends.\" \"Because...?\" I asked tentatively, not even sure what kind of response I was looking for. Bud was quiet for a minute as he thought about the question. Then he said: \"I'm lonely of you.\" It stung my heart. I'm lonely of you.  It wasn't Kay and Sam who bothered Bud. It was  me . It was the way that I was because they were there. I'm lonely of you.   I don't want to share you. I don't want your attention focused on someone else. I want our time to be us. Just us. Just you and me.  I've been thinking about it all day. It explains so many difficult times - including his  final days of school . Those days were not just dysregulating because the routine was different; they were difficult because I was there. Bud is always understanding of the commitments that take me away from him - I have to work, I have to go to a meeting, I have to be away from you but I will be back and then we will be together again. But my appearance at school made no sense to him -  Here you are, at the place where you come when it's time to take me away. You do not have to be at work. You and I could climb into the car together and be off on a great adventure - but you are choosing not to do that. You are staying in this place where we don't have to stay. You are choosing to do something that is Not Right.  It also explains why he has done so well at the social functions that I knew from the start would be difficult for him - the weddings, the graduation parties, the family functions - when my full attention was focused on him; when all of my energy went into making sure he would be okay; when I didn't try to participate in the ongoing activity but just sat huddled with Bud on the sidelines - just as we do in church each week, sitting far in the back, away from everyone else, so that we can \"Just watch.\" Conversely, it explains why he has done \"well\" during those events when I've engaged with other people but allowed him to overdose on screen time - when I've chatted and visited and laughed with other people while Bud has slipped deeper into a fantasy world; when I've stepped aside and allowed the computer, the television, the portable DVD player to do the parenting. So now that I have this information, now that I can understand his perspective in a different way, what do I do with it? It's the same push-me/pull-you dilemma I encounter so often. If I choose the route that is easiest for Bud, the one that doesn't challenge him to manage through the social engagements and play dates, they will never become familiar or seem less frightening. But if I force him into them when he's not ready, it may feel to him like I'm turning my back on him, leaving him on his own - alone and lonely of me. And what about me? I adore the time that I spend with Bud. But what of my need to have real, genuine, adult interaction that is not about my work - to have friends? It's extraordinarily difficult for Kay and me to find moments to spend in each other's company, but I need them. I'm lonely of them. I'm lonely of her. I know there has got to be a point of balance. There must be a line at which I can give Bud the right amount of time and attention - at which I can be the sort of parent he needs - and still have some time and attention left for myself. There must also be another line at which I strike the right balance between pushing Bud beyond his comfort zone and shielding him from extreme discomfort. And there must be a point at which these two lines intersect. But it's a moving target, shifting constantly as Bud's needs and my needs change and evolve, making it more and more difficult to find. Maybe it means that achieving balance is not really possible. Maybe I should be striving for a reasonable, livable level of imbalance. But if that's the case, on which side of the imbalance is it better to err? And who pays the cost if I don't choose well? It seems that all I can do is make my best guesses, take calculated risks, and engage constantly in assessment and revision. Sometimes things work out even better than I'd hoped, and Bud and I have moments of triumph; other times - like yesterday - we fall face-first in the dirt and both end up a little bruised, then have to spend some time brushing ourselves - and each other - off. I'm glad that Bud was able to find the words to tell me why yesterday was so difficult for him. As painful as it is, I  want  to know when he is lonely of me. But what to do with those words - how to reassure him - how to help him - what to do next - I'm afraid those are all matters that remain in imbalance, and will need a lot more assessment and revision.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/06/in-imbalance.html", "title": "\nIn the imbalance\n"},

We'd been trying to teach him the doggie-paddle -  dig the water with your hands, kick with your feet  - and while he had the basic mechanics mastered, he seemed a bit confused by the coordination of them. The visual element of swimming seemed distracting to him as well - should he watch the water? watch his hands? watch the kids playing in the water nearby? watch us watching him? So this weekend, Bud did what he always does: he  figured out how to do it his own way . And it's interesting that when I saw him start to swim I remembered that I first swam the exact same way. Instead of focusing on memorized steps and procedures and first-this-then-that, Bud swam by intuition: He put his face under water, pushed off with his feet and started gliding, his kicking legs propelling him forward, his outstretched arms slicing the water and reaching for his destination. And so he swam, again and again: from Nana to me, from me to Nana. Push, glide, kick, reach. Push, glide, kick, reach. Bud just keeps teaching me the same lesson over and over: there is more than one right way to get where you're going.

{"date": "Sunday, August 06, 2006", "body": "\nCreative. Flexible. Willing to improvise. They're not the first descriptors that come to mind when you think about autism, are they? And yet, Bud is all these things. He has always had great pretend play skills and an active imagination. He rarely tires of toys because he continually finds new ways to play with them. When he wants to play-act a particular scenario and he doesn't have the right equipment, he will happily find a way to use  whatever he's got . Want to play Little Bo Peep but find yourself short on sheep? No worry: toy dogs and elephants can fill the roles and learn to say \"Baaa.\" What? No Bo Peep doll? The Fisher Price farmer would be happy to step in. At the beach with no toys on hand? This big rock can be Bo Peep; these twigs can be the sheep. I was surprised, then, when Bud approached me the other day and asked me to help him make the dancing bear from a favorite Teletubbies segment. I knew that if he wasn't content just swapping out a different toy to create the scene, then he must have had a particular image in his head and he was certain that I could deliver. I, on the other hand, was less certain of my abilities. I was familiar with the segment, of course. In it, a cylindrical circus-tent looking object drops from the sky into Teletubbyland: The Tubbies gather around to watch as the sides of the tent part and a little bear emerges wearing a hat and vest, carrying a cane, and dancing a soft-shoe: \"I need the dancing bear and the tent,\" Bud told me. \"Can you help me make it, Mom?\" \"I'm not sure  how  to make it, Bud,\" I said. \"With paper,\" he said. I was resistant and could not imagine what he was envisioning. I found a little toy bear among his collection and hoped that it would be enough to satisfy him. It wasn't. He clearly had something else in mind. \"Okay, Bud,\" I said. \"Tell me what you want me to do.\" And he did. One step at a time, he told me what we needed to turn this plastic bear into the magical dancing bear and I scoured the kitchen drawers to find supplies that would do the job. Twist-ties from the bread became the requested hat and cane. A torn paper towel became a vest. \"He needs shoes, Mom,\" Bud said. I ripped tiny pieces of blue painters tape and stuck them to the bear's feet. Bud thought it was a perfect solution. \"Now the tent, Mom,\" he said, once again walking me through the stages. We didn't have a picture in front of us, so I just followed his directions about what it was supposed to look like. I don't know what sort of picture he had in his mind when we began, but he grew more and more delighted with each completed phase of construction. In the end, our collaboration yielded this:  Bud is thrilled, and has had the bear performing all weekend. I don't know for sure, of course, but with this sort of innovative vision, eye for detail, and collaborative work style I'd say that Bud's got a promising future in the film industry; I'm guessing Production Design.

He's got glow-in-the-dark planets hanging from his ceiling, with little Pluto far away in the dark corner of his room. He's got a full-color, beautifully laminated solar system poster on his wall. We frequently sit in his dark room, watching his glowing planets, belting out a mean duet of the planet song from Blues Clues: Well, the sun's a hot star; Mercury's hot too! Venus is the brightest planet; Earth's home to me and you. Mars is the red one And Jupiter's most wide. Saturn's got those icy rings and Uranus spins on its side. Neptune's really windy and Pluto's really small. Well, we wanted to name the planets, And now we've named them all. Pluto's really small. Too small, it seems. A couple of weeks ago, when things looked a lot less bleak for The Pluto Formerly Known As Planet, I explained to Bud that there might be  three new planets  in the solar system. \"New planets, Mom?\" he asked. \"On Blues Clues?\" \"Well, I guess they  will  have to write a new song,\" I replied. \"How about Teletubbies?\" he said. \"I guess they'll have the new planets, too.\" But, no. I haven't broken the news to Bud yet, but there will be no new planets for the Teletubbies. Just one fewer planet for Bud. I suppose Blues Clues will still need a new song, though. And Mary's Violet Eyes will still Make John Stay Up Nightly. But even religion takes a hit now that John has stopped Praying. Sigh. Well. Here's to you, Pluto. We'll miss you, old friend. But I just want you to know this: If it had been up to me, I'd have lobbied for keeping you and getting rid of Uranus.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060824/ap_on_sc/planet_mutiny_12", "http://www.newscientistspace.com/article/dn9761-three-new-planets-may-join-solar-system.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/08/pluto-we-hardly-knew-ye.html", "title": "\nPluto, we hardly knew ye\n"},

{"date": "Monday, August 28, 2006", "body": "\nSo I'm turning 40 this week. It doesn't sound right, 40. It's just not an age that  goes  with me. I'm navy stripes; 40 is orange plaid. This birthday angst is a whole new experience for me. I've always enjoyed my birthday, or at least been too busy to notice as it zipped by. Turning 30 was actually a relief; I had recently started a new job in which all of my colleagues were in their 30's and 40's, and turning 30 made me feel more legitimate somehow. But now I've been legitimate for ten years. Now I have colleagues who were born when I was in high school. But it's a number, right? Just a number. It's not just a number. Those of you who have been here, you know it's not. For those who have yet to be here, let me explain how it happens: You spend your twenties being young, pursuing your career, falling in love, la, la, la. You spend a decade glancing in the mirror and seeing yourself smiling back at you. Then you enter your thirties and have a young child in your life. You may have a young child who is autistic, who doesn't sleep much, who keeps you running at a frenetic pace through most of your waking hours. You try to sleep when you can, but you subsist mostly on five or six broken hours of sleep a night. In these years when you remember to look in the mirror you see a different version of yourself peering back. This you is more puffy than the real you, and has darker circles under her eyes. She often has sweet potatoes in her hair, or blue magic marker streaks on her face. She seems happy, but tired. You hope that she gets a good night's sleep soon. After several years of looking at this person in the mirror, the day finally comes and you get a spectacular night's sleep. You wake feeling rested and refreshed and ready to take on the world. You bound out of bed and rush to the bathroom mirror, eager to welcome back your old twenties face. And then it happens. Refreshed, rested, twenty-something you looks in the mirror and puffy, saggy almost-forty you looks back, and you realize for the very first time that it's not just that you've been tired. This is   what you look like now. And the surprises keep coming. You start to read a column in a parenting magazine. You trust this article, because there next to the byline is a picture of its middle-aged author, an older, more experienced mom who is going to share years of accumulated wisdom with you. You start reading, and one paragraph into the article you discover that she is four years younger than you. They are everywhere, these old-looking younger people. And, it seems, there are more of them every day. This aging thing is confusing. It's a big blurry mess of flash-forward/flash-back. And here's the greatest irony of the whole thing: I've got less than 48 hours left of my thirties, and instead of enjoying it while it's here I keep studying pictures of my current face, examining the new crinkles around my eyes, the extra skin that seems to be growing on my neck. And I imagine myself ten years hence, stumbling across these pictures and examining them again, startled by what I see: My god,  I'll think.  I can't believe how young I looked. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/08/four-ohmygod.html", "title": "\nFour-ohmygod\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 15, 2006", "body": "\nThere has been a great deal of controversy in recent months regarding the video released by Autism Speaks, titled Autism Every Day. This week saw the release of an  article written by Jennifer Liss of WireTap  which includes an  interview with the filmmaker , Lauren Thierry, which is nicely  deconstructed by Kevin Leitch  on Left Brain/Right Brain. In the interview, Thierry defends the controversial comment made in Autism Every Day by Alison Tepper Singer, the mother of an autistic child, who says that she would have driven herself and her autistic child off a bridge had it not been for her neurotypical child, who needed her. The article quotes Thierry this way: \"If most mothers of autistic children, Thierry responds, look hard enough within themselves they will find that they have played out a similar scenario in their minds. 'If this is not your reality, then God bless you,' she says.\" I am absolutely horrified. I have been the mother of an autistic child for almost seven years. I have never once, not for a single, fleeting, fraction of a moment, thought about harming either him or myself. If I ever  do  experience such a thought - even if it is a brief flash of a half-thought - if the idea of doing harm to Bud or to myself in any way enters my mind - I will pick up the phone instantly, and I will get help. I will book an appointment with a counselor. I will acknowledge that something is wrong, and that thinking about hurting a child - ANY child - is a sign that a person can no longer manage on her own. I will not write it off as just the sort of thing that happens when you're living with Autism Every Day. Let me be clear. I do not take issue with Ms. Singer's statement, which I imagine was a hard and painful personal truth - though I do question the wisdom of revealing it in the presence of her child. I do, however, take issue with the extrapolation of the director, Ms. Thierry, who universalizes Singer's personal truth and paints it as the rule and not the exception. Ms. Thierry's comment is not just inaccurate and offensive; it's also reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous. If an autism mother so desperate as to have homicidal and/or suicidal thoughts were to read it, she would see her deepest fears realized in its message: your desperation is born of autism; it is part of the package; we all feel it; it will never get better. I would imagine that this sort of bleak perspective on the future might make a desperate person take otherwise unthinkable action. I am not being dramatic here. Sometimes  it happens . And then  it happens again . Some autism bloggers, among them  Kev  and  Ballastexistenz , have suggested that Ms. Thierry deliberately staged the interviews she did with the mothers who appear in Autism Every Day so that their lives would appear as bleak and hopeless as possible. The  article  reports: \"Thierry told her subjects not to do their hair, vacuum or bring in the therapists. She showed up with her crew at their homes sight unseen and kept the cameras rolling as a mom literally wrestled with her son to get him to brush his teeth, as a 9-year-old had a public meltdown, as a 5-year-old had his diaper changed. And, as moms revealed dark and uncomfortable truths about living with autism. The result is a window into an exhausting world of interminable work.\" In other words, let's take everything we know about what will help a child with autism to be well-regulated, and then let's do the opposite. Had Ms. Thierry filmed us, Bud would have been  dysregulated  by the very  presence of strangers in our house  without warning - never mind the  video cameras , or my being in the room with him but  giving my full attention to someone else , and saying things that were  making me distressed . And if I were saying in front of him that HE was what made me distressed? I can't begin to imagine how that would affect him. So I encourage Ms. Thierry to film a sequel, using hidden cameras, and I volunteer to appear in it. She can follow us around on a typical day as long as she agrees that in the editing she will show the whole day, and not just the worst bits. Yesterday was a pretty typical Mom-and-Bud day; it would have been the perfect day for her to film. She'd have gotten the footage she was after: me bleary-eyed after waking up much earlier than I'd hoped, a few battles of wills, some difficult transitions, a bathroom accident or two. She'd have gotten some beautiful footage as well: Bud and me at the lake, holding hands and counting \"one-two-three,\" then him diving under and surfacing, his eyes glued to mine waiting for me to ask if he was okay; Bud sitting nose-to-antenna with a beautiful yellow butterfly; Bud lounging in his beach chair, singing and eating an ice cream cone and getting more ice cream on his face than in his belly; Bud and me burying each other in the sand and giggling, then me building a sand castle as Bud looked for rocks to play the roles of King, Queen, Knight, Dragon, Princess and Bud; Bud and me making up a song to the tune of the musical meadow instrumental from his Reader Rabbit game; Bud smashing water balloons on the driveway - first against the garage door, then by throwing them up in the air, then by tossing them two at a time, each new smash a little different from the last as Bud continued to discover that sometimes  new  is even better than  familiar ; Bud and me cuddling up at bedtime, as through heavy lids he smiled at me and told me it had been an  easy day . You see, around here,  this  is autism every day. There are challenges, there are difficulties, there are struggles. But at the end of the day, when the tallies are totalled, there is more joy, there is more beauty, there is more love. Even with autism. Every day. My hair is not done. My house is not vacuumed. There are no therapists in sight. We're ready for our close-up, Ms. Thierry.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.alternet.org/wiretap/38631/", "http://www.autismvox.com/karen-mccarron-alison-tepper-singer-and-misplaced-compassion/", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=396", "http://www.autismvox.com/autism-father-kills-himself-and-his-son/", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php?p=396", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=159", "http://www.alternet.org/wiretap/38631/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/07/alternate-view-of-autism-every-day.html", "title": "\nAn alternate view of Autism Every Day\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 04, 2006", "body": "\nBud is a boy who loves what he loves. Among his favorite things:  Teletubbies ,  elephants ,  planets ,  hats  of  all description ,  balloons , and pumpkins. Apparently, in Bud's mind, the  first day of school  signals the official start of Pumpkin Season, and each day last week when I picked him up at school he asked if I had a pumpkin waiting for him in the car. (I'd surprised him with one early in his Kindergarten career and, like his beloved elephants, Bud  never forgets .) After the first day of school we tried to find one at the local supermarket but were told we were too early. Bud settled for  Twizzlers  instead. But he didn't stop asking for a pumpkin. One of his  summer projects  had been lovingly caring for the pumpkin plant that he'd started as a seedling in his Kindergarten classroom, and that bloomed during the summer: Unfortunately, thanks to our woodland neighbors who have taken to snacking in our yard, I don't think this particular plant is going to yield any fruit. Bud doesn't seem at all disappointed. To him, pumpkins aren't something that you grow in the yard; they're something you buy at supermarkets and farm stands. So once the air got crisp, the Macintosh apples showed up in the refrigerator, and I started bundling him off to school in the morning, he knew it was time to start trumpeting the arrival of pumpkin season. Each time he spotted a leaf on the ground he picked it up and announced: \"The leaves are falling! Time to get a pumpkin!\" Each day on the way to school he said, \"Summer's over. Now it's fall. Let's get a pumpkin!\" So, I promised him that on Saturday we would set out in search of a pumpkin. September second is early, I reasoned, but the state fairs have already begun, and you can't have a state fair without pumpkins. They had to be out there somewhere. We kissed Daddy goodbye in the morning and set out, telling him that if we weren't home by dark it was because we'd continued driving north and were searching for pumpkins somewhere in Canada. I wasn't far off. Bud set the early agenda, and we scoured his favorite local farm stand with no luck. I ventured further north visiting every roadside farm stand and grocer's market I could find, but they were all pumpkin-free. Bud briefly toyed with the idea of picking up a watermelon instead. \"Maybe this watermelon will turn into a pumpkin!\" he said. I appreciated his optimism, but I just couldn't bear to give him any more false hope, so we carried on. We traveled into the next state to visit a big open-air farmer's market that I was sure would pay off. It was pumpkinless. While we were in the neighborhood, Bud suggested that we visit a nearby children's museum, which seemed like a great alternative and a possible way to salvage the day. We spent a couple of hours hiking on their lovely, well-groomed trails through the woods and having a wonderful fresh-air-and-exercise afternoon. When we finally flopped back into the car, happy and tired, Bud said, \"Now let's go get a pumpkin, Mom!\" And we were off again. After coming up empty at the next supermarket we tried I told Bud that I was afraid we might just be too early. I suggested that we try to find a  toy  pumpkin instead. He agreed, and we headed to a nearby party store that was full of Halloween decorations - but no toy pumpkin that would fit the bill.  Bud was a good sport. No tears, no tantrums; not even a heavy sigh. But I was crushed on his behalf. We made the long drive home quietly, both of us lost in our own thoughts. And then: success. Fifteen minutes from home, as we drove by a little home-grown vegetable shack in someone's driveway I spotted a box with telltale stems sticking out the top. I pulled over and made a u-turn in the road. \"What are you doing, Mom?\" Bud asked. \"Wait till you see,\" I said. We pulled into the driveway and Bud saw them immediately. \"Pumpkins!\" he shouted. \"You did it, Mom!\" I have never felt more like a hero. Bud chose a pumpkin, for which we paid a single dollar, and he carried it home on his lap. It sat next to him through dinner, waited patiently at the sink while he had a bath, then spent the night sleeping on his bedside table until it was time to join him for breakfast in the morning. All weekend, the pumpkin has been Bud's constant companion, riding with us in the car, joining in on every adventure. Today Bud took the pumpkin outside to decorate it, just as the Teletubbies' pumpkin is decorated in the live-action classic  The Magic Pumpkin . It was just dashing:  This evening, Nana and Papa arrived at the house. They'd known that we'd planned on undertaking The Great Pumpkin Hunt on Saturday, but had not heard the outcome. So, just in case, they brought along two more pumpkins. Bud was beside himself with joy. All three pumpkins had a merry reunion on the kitchen table while Bud, unable to contain his delight for another moment leaped into the middle of the room, threw his arms in the air and shouted, \"HAPPY PUMPKIN SEASON, EVERYONE!!!\" Let the celebration begin! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5496/842/1600/100_1018.jpg"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/09/pumpkinquest-2006.html", "title": "\nPumpkinQuest 2006\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 01, 2006", "body": "\nI've been  tagged .  Twice . This was a tough one for me. There are so many books that I love; it was hard to choose just one in each category. One book that changed your life? The Baby Book  by Sears & Sears. This book sold me on attachment parenting, and taught me to approach issues and concerns by focusing on  connecting with Bud . I decided that attachment parenting was the right philosophy for us long before I knew that Bud was autistic, and I think it would have been a good decision even if Bud was neurotypical. In retrospect, though, I can see that autism has made this philosophy, and this book, invaluable to me. One book you have read more than once? The Westing Game  by Ellen Raskin. I'm a fan of \"juvenile fiction\" in general. Many of my favorite books were written for the 9-to-12-year-old market. But  The Westing Game!  Oh, how I love this book. I first read it shortly after it was released in 1978. I've read it many times since. And I'm  really  looking forward to sharing with Bud in a few years. One book you would want on a desert island? Gah! I've been sitting here staring at a blinking cursor for 20 minutes. This is an impossible question. Am I going to be on the desert island for the rest of my life? Am I all alone? Do I have only one book? I can think of only one way to answer this question: \"I don't know. Surprise me!\" One book that made you laugh? Operating Instructions  by Anne Lamott. Somebody gave me this book right after Bud was born and I read it while I nursed him, which was no easy feat because 1) he had an impossibly large head and I needed both arms and a couch full of pillows to hold it in place, and 2) he had trouble latching on, so once I had him in place I needed to stay as still as I could or risk disrupting the whole business. I spent most of our nursing time wondering how it was that other women made it look so  easy , bemoaning the fact that I wasn't finding it easy  at all , and thanking heaven for Anne Lamott, who made me feel normal, couch full of pillows and all. One book that made you cry? A Prayer for Owen Meany  by John Irving. One of my favorite books of all time. One book you wish had never been written? The Starr Report: The Findings of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr on President Clinton and the Lewinsky Affair  by Kenneth Starr. Perhaps if Congress had not wasted 8 years and 40 billion dollars waging a personal attack on Bill Clinton, we would not be where we are today. One book you are currently reading? Eye Contact  by Cammie McGovern. More on that when I've finished. One book you have been meaning to read? The Catcher in the Rye  by J.D. Salinger. Can you believe I've never read it? I was around  Catcher in the Rye  age when John Lennon was murdered, and it was revealed that his murderer was obsessed with the book and had a copy in his possession when he was arrested. I have tried to read it several times since then, but as a  Beatles fan  I just find that  the association  is too powerful and I can't get past the first page. One book you wish you had written?

By Tuesday morning, he had decided that he wouldn't be returning to school. It started slow - \"I'm not going to school today\" - and then, over the course of 90 minutes, it built to a loud and emotional crescendo: \"I AM NOT GOING! I AM GOING TO  EAT  YOU! I DON'T WANT TO GO! NO MORE SCHOOL!\" Bud resisted physically, digging in his heels, hiding behind the couch, and pulling away forcefully as we tried to pry him out, as the clock ticked and we got later and later for school. Enter Monster Mom. I loaded our bags into the car, then marched back into the house and bellowed loud enough to be heard several states away, \"BUD-NOS! GET IN THE CAR!\" He stopped in mid-screech and walked to the car with me, dazed and rattled, then dissolved into tears of abject misery. \"You're mad at me! You yelled at me!\" he wailed, as my anger was quickly replaced by guilt. His tears flowed, his nose ran, and his anguish grew. \"You took my iPod! Give it back, Mama! Give it BACK to me!\" Though we were already late, I slunk back into the house to retrieve his iPod, thinking that it might help him get regulated on the drive to school. I grabbed an orange juice box on my way back out as well, hoping that perhaps a little bribery might assuage my guilt. We drove to school in silence while Bud sulked, listening to his music and drinking his juice, and I silently beat myself up for reacting so ferociously. We arrived late and I delivered him to an already-settled classroom with a murmured \"we had a hard morning...\" I spent the day at work wondering if Bud would be speaking to me by the time I got home, and was relieved when I walked in at dinner time and he said, \"Hi, Mom! What's up?\" I held my breath this morning wondering if now Bud would now see tantrum-throwing as a regular part of his morning routine. He tested the waters half-heartedly as he got dressed: \"I'm not going to school today.\" \"You need to try again, Bud. We don't want to do  that  again.\" Bud considered his options for a minute, then decided not to risk a re-reun of yesterday. He finished getting ready for school and climbed into the car right on schedule.

{"date": "Saturday, September 16, 2006", "body": "\nIt has been a dark week at our house, both literally and figuratively. The skies have been overcast and dreary, and Bud has been unable to rebound from last weekend's bone-rattling  thunderstorm incident . He has spent the week with his eyes riveted to the skies, watching for signs of an imminent storm and perseverating on the possibility. All day every day this week - and I am not exaggerating here - ALL day, EVERY day, ALL week - from the time he woke until the time he fell asleep, Bud verbalized the rollercoaster of anxiety he was experiencing: There's no storm. Is the storm is all gone? There is no thunder. Just clouds. Just dark clouds. Is the storm coming? There's no storm. The storm will not come. Just what? Just cloudy day. There's no what, Mama? There's no storm. This stream of reporting, with just a hint of anxiety, would continue for hours, building slowly in magnitude, it's force swirling below the surface, until suddenly and without warning the levee would break: MAKE THE CLOUDS GO! NO DARK CLOUDS! MAKE THEM STOP, MAMA! MAKE THE STORM STOP! MAKE THE CLOUDS GO AWAY! MAKE THE YUCKY STOP, MAMA! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! Then he would cry, sometimes loudly, sometimes quietly, but always with a heartbreaking intensity. After some time, that phase would pass and Bud's anxiety would return to a slow rumble: There's just clouds. There's no storm today... As the week progressed Bud became increasingly nervous and tuned-in to sounds and sights. The washing machine. A light flicking on. My husband's footsteps. The flutter of fluorescent lighting. A door closing. The flicker of the computer screen. A truck rolling by. The everyday sounds we hear all day long; the shadows of sights we usually filter out. Every single one of them triggered Bud's startle reflex -  \"WHAT WAS THAT?\" By the end of the week, we were all exhausted - without question, Bud most of all. On Thursday he started coming down with a cold and the combination of feeling sick and living on an emotional edge resulted in a hard day at school. Thursday evening was very difficult, with Bud's perseveration and anxiety at full-tilt. It was no better when we woke on Friday. There was mist and fog outside, and Bud sobbed and pleaded with me to make it go away. Instead, I called the school to let them know he wouldn't be coming in, then bundled on his raincoat and boots over his pajamas and took him for a walk through the neighborhood. As I had hoped, the quiet misty neighborhood was quite lovely at 6:30 a.m. and the long walk temporarily calmed Bud's anxiety. I brought him to work with me for a few hours, but the fluorescent lights and copy machine/printer/co-worker noises were just too much for him. In the afternoon I called the doctor's office. I knew Bud's pediatrician would be out of town until next Tuesday, but hoped maybe somebody else could talk to me and give me some shred of helpful advice. I ended up with a nurse, who chided me for calling at the end of a Friday afternoon, when no one was available to talk with me. \"Maybe you could distract him with a favorite book or some music,\" she suggested. She asked if I could \"make it\" until Bud's doctor was back on Tuesday. I couldn't even answer her (define \"make it.\") She told me to bring him to the ER if it got too bad. I told her to leave a note for the doctor in red ink with a lot of exclamation points. She hedged a bit at this directive (\"Well, I'm not sure what else the doctor will have on her schedule when she returns...if you don't hear from us by Wednesday...\"), so I'm composing an e-mail myself. I'm concerned about this specific round of anxiety, of course. And I want to be prepared for future incidents of bad weather. But, more than that, I want to investigate what this means. This is brand new. This is not something we've ever seen from Bud before. So what is it? Is this what OCD looks like in a young child? Is this an anxiety disorder? Is this an indication that his Strattera dose is too high? (If Strattera is helping him focus, would too much make him hyper-focus on the wrong things?) The sun came out today, and Bud's internal storm waned as the external one departed. We've been awake for three hours and Bud has only asked about a storm five times, each time with decreasing intensity. He has shifted his focus to his birthday party, which we'll be having this afternoon, and I have spent the morning thanking God and the universe and  the angels who watch him  for letting him celebrate his birthday under sunny skies. We've got a reprieve, and we plan to infuse it with a mega-dose of joy. Maybe we can somehow build our emotional reserves - squirrel away as much of the happiness and the calm and the carefree spirit as we possibly can - and save it for a rainy day.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/09/dark-days.html", "title": "\nDark days\n"},

In a  previous post , I wrote about the concept of \"local coherence\" as described by Kamran Nazeer in  Send in the Idiots . Nazeer talks about local coherence as the propensity to focus on a small, manageable thing when faced with a large, overwhelming situation. As I've already mentioned,  Eye Contact  was large and overwhelming for me. It was also gripping, and kept me reading furiously. However, as I sped through the climactic denouement of the story, I crashed headlong into something that completely stopped my momentum. It was a typo. Right there in the final, big moment, a main character is supposed to shout, \"DON'T BE SCARED!\" Instead, in the poorly-edited edition I'm reading, the character shouts \"DON'T BE SACRED!\" I stopped reading instantly.  Sacred? Did this character really say \"Don't be sacred?\" Why sacred? It can't be sacred. It has to be scared. Who edited this book? This particular scene - this particular  sentence  - is critical to the plot. How could they have missed this? I've been interested in my own reaction. Did I stop reading and focus entirely on the typo to regain my own local coherence? The plot was certainly overwhelming, and I knew that it was about to head into some action that would be hard to read. Did \"sacred\" provide the escape that I needed? Or was it even more than that? Did this typo - this critical typo in the middle of this critical scene - allow me to give less credence to the book itself, and therefore to the  warnings I inferred  from its subtext? Eye don't no, but it gives me paws.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Eye-Contact-Cammie-McGovern/dp/0670037656/sr=1-1/qid=1157282982/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0470076-8180737?ie=UTF8&s=books", "http://www.amazon.com/Send-Idiots-Stories-Other-Autism/dp/1582346194/sr=1-1/qid=1157283014/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-0470076-8180737?ie=UTF8&s=books"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/09/local-incoherence.html", "title": "\nLocal incoherence\n"},

My attempts at writing about them have made Bud sound like a lab rat, which is not fair to him. So we'll be weathering (groan) this challenge  privately  for a while. The good news is that it hasn't all been bad. Bud has the delightful tendency to balance tough times by throwing himself wholeheartedly into fun times when those opportunities arise. And these days if the opportunities haven't arisen on their own, he's worked hard to create them. So it was one evening this week when he suggested that it was time to take a train ride. I am starting to learn to ignore the initial negative parental responses that pop into my head at suggestions like this:  \"Honey, we don't have a train... It's almost bedtime... You're being silly,\"  and instead we put on our jackets and waited to find out what kind of adventure was in store. Bud was delighted. He gathered engineer hats for each of us and ran to find his slide whistle, then we all headed into the moonlit yard. The set-up was surprisingly easy, and after the sidewalk chalk train tracks and beach chair engines were in place we were ready for our trip. My husband and I were in charge of the chugga-chuggas, and Bud - our faithful caboose pulling up the rear - was responsible for the choo-choos, with occasional slide whistle toots thrown in for effect. As neighbors drove by slowly (we could imagine, but not see, their bewildered faces), my husband called out cheerfully \"Just playing train!\" Bud played tour guide from the back, letting us know where we were headed and calling our attention to the sites as we passed them. It was a lovely trip through the neighborhood (where we saw moose, deer, and snakes), the jungle (where we saw monkeys and an elephant), the North Pole (where we saw a polar bear), and even the ocean (where we saw a whale). Our last stop was Dunkin' Donuts, conveniently located by our mailbox, where we gobbled Munchkins greedily and refreshed our weary-traveler bodies with delicious beverages - coffee for me, a Coolatta for my husband, and apple juice for Bud. Then it was back on board for the long journey home. As we settled into a comfortable rhythm, our bellies heavy with imaginary donuts and our spirits high from the thrill of adventure and the crisp night air, our chugga-chuggas gave way to melody as my husband and I channeled the Grateful Dead and sang home our little-engine-that-could: Driving that train, high on cocaine, Casey Jones, you better watch your speed. Trouble ahead, trouble behind, And you know that notion just crossed my mind... Trouble behind? Most definitely. Trouble ahead? Most likely. But somehow I think we're on the right track. We're sure to reach the station eventually, just as long as we keep chugging along together and following the lead of our intoxicating little boy. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/09/trouble-ahead-trouble-behind.html", "title": "\nTrouble ahead, trouble behind\n"},

I was tentative because I wasn't sure what to expect from a benefit show with a cast that drew heavily from the ranks of Saturday Night Live.  I've also become skeptical  of autism benefits in general, and I feared that I'd see a lot of bathroom humor mixed in with \"public service announcements\" that featured distraught and hopeless parents sending desperate messages about the crisis of this devastating epidemic that is stealing our children. I expected to hear about the race for a cure, and to see solemn-faced comedians telling me that every minute that passed without a cure was another minute lost for my son. But I was very pleasantly surprised. Okay, I admit, there was a bit of bathroom humor. But there was also Jerry Seinfeld. And  Stephen Colbert . And - of course - the  host who should be President , Jon Stewart. There was even a performance by one of my musical heroes, Elvis Costello. But better than all of that, there were clips of children and adults with autism. There were interviews with parents and teachers. The children smiled. The parents smiled. The teachers smiled. Parents talked about their children with pride. They reflected on how far their kids have come and talked eagerly about their hopes for a very bright future. The focus wasn't on fear, or devastation, or desperation, or even cure. The focus of the benefit was on the transformative power of education in the lives of people with autism. It was a good two hours. There was a lot of money raised. There were some pretty good laughs.

Today he was surprised to find a small number of coworkers when we arrived. He was characteristically shy at first, avoiding their eyes and hiding behind my back as they said hello to him, but as the day wore on he grew increasingly more comfortable. A safety officer whom Bud had never met stopped by on rounds. \"Hey there, Big Guy!\" he boomed. \"Hi,\" said Bud. \"How ya doin'?\" \"I'm good. How are you?\" Wow. Later in the day, another coworker whom Bud doesn't know well stopped by to say she was leaving for the day. Bud was at the computer in the room next door to me, and I heard her say as she walked down the hallway, \"Goodbye, Bud! Have a nice holiday tomorrow!\" There were a few silent beats, then I heard Bud's voice ring out down the hallway after her, \"Bye!

He is  terrified  by thunderstorms. His  anxiety  has been building all summer, and it has gotten a little worse with each storm we've experienced. For the past month, his anxiety has started surfacing at the sight of dark clouds. In the face of actual lightning and thunder, his anxiety turns to outright terror. We had a thunderstorm yesterday, and Bud worried and obsessed as the sky darkened. He pleaded with me to tell him that night was coming, and that there would be no storm. The rain followed and we could hear thunder in the distance. Bud started to cry. As the storm moved closer, Bud's fear grew. By the time the lighting and thunder and pouring rain were outside our house, Bud was in a raging panic - sweating, crying, shrieking, shaking. His heart was pumping so hard and racing so fast I was afraid he might pass out or go into cardiac arrest. After each crash of thunder he pleaded with me to tell him that the storm was over. \"MAKE THE STORM  GO , MOM! THE STORM IS GONE NOW! IS THE STORM IS GONE NOW? PLEASE MAMA,  PLEASE  THE STORM IS GONE!\" I wanted desperately to tell him that the storm was gone. But I couldn't. It wasn't. It would be worse if I lied to him. \"I think it's almost over, Bud. I think it will be gone soon.\" \" NOT  SOON!  NOT  ALMOST OVER! I DON'T  WANT  THE STORM! I DON'T  LIKE  IT! IT'S ALL GONE  NOW , MAMA!  MAKE IT GO! \" I think Bud thought I was making a choice - that I  could  make the storm stop, but I wouldn't. Or maybe he realized that I was as helpless as he was and that terrified him even more. All I know is that with each round of thunder, with each failure to receive reassurance that the storm had stopped, Bud's fear escalated. He trembled, he gasped, he screamed, he sobbed. It was terrifying to watch. It was heartbreaking to experience. We did the only thing we could think to do. Nana, Papa, Daddy and I formed a tight huddle around Bud. I dropped to my knees and put my face near his, and while he shrieked and wailed I talked softly, trying to comfort him, hoping that he would focus on my voice as we waited for the storm to end. My husband got a pillow and we wrapped it around Bud's ears as we sheltered him. Nothing seemed to help. The storm finally passed, and Bud slowly calmed down. The rest of us continued trembling for several hours. Since then, we've been trying to come up with a plan for next time. We haven't thought of one. My only plan is to pray for good weather. But I'm really afraid of thunderstorms.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/09/thunder-is-dogs-times-ten.html", "title": "\nThunder is dogs times ten\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 26, 2006", "body": "\nAs  I've mentioned before , Bud often uses echolalia when he speaks. But he doesn't just quote short statements. He recites entire video scripts from start to finish, adopting accents and dialects as appropriate and even including sound effects and background music. He has a future in television or theater if he wants one. He does the same thing with music. He learns songs thoroughly. He learns the drum beat, the bass line, the guitar solo, the pauses, and the background vocals, but mostly he learns the lyrics. At three years old, Bud could not sustain a back-and-forth conversation beyond Me:  Do you want juice?,  Bud:  Okay,  but he could sing  Paul McCartney 's  Band on the Run  from the first note through the last without missing a beat. Some of his favorite music these days comes from the children's channel Noggin, whose host - the very talented Moose A. Moose - appears between programs to perform a wide array of musical numbers. The  Noggin songs  are terrifically complex, and they never underestimate a child's capacity to sustain interest in music with complicated melodies, syncopation, or lyrics. Bud adores them all. Yesterday at school, the spirit moved Bud and he burst forth into song. His teacher,  Mrs. Parker , had heard him perform this particular number before, but he'd never sung it with the full class as audience. She seized the moment, set aside the current lesson plan, yielded the floor, and let Bud take center stage as he performed for them all, singing at full voice, with complete note-for-note and word-for-word accuracy: Days are the sunniest Jokes are the funniest Rabbits are the bunny-est Hives are the honey-est Elephants the ton-iest Troubles - they're the none-iest Everywhere I go!

The other children in the class were delighted. Some of them knew the song and joined in on the lyrics they remembered. But Bud was the only person in the whole class who could sing every word. And he knew it. He tried to downplay his achievement last night, acting as though it was no big thing... but he couldn't keep the smile from crossing his lips as Nana recounted the story of his performance to Daddy. Bud was proud. And so, in his honor, I offer you this final verse, penned by me: Bud is the the song-iest His teacher's cheers are strong-iest The kids are sing-along-iest And worries are so-long-iest Cause school is can't-go-wrong-iest When Bud feels the belong-iest Everywhere he goes! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.noggin.com/shows/movemusic.php"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/10/effects-are-lifelong-iest.html", "title": "\nEffects are the lifelong-iest\n"},

Bud flipped on the outside light, looked into our backyard, and squealed \"Mama! It's snowing! It's snowing, Mama!\" Sure enough, big, juicy snowflakes were plopping against our deck. Within minutes, a light dust began to gather on the grass, and soon every tree branch we could see had a coating of wet snow clinging to it. \"It's snowing! It's snowing! It's snowing!\" Bud sang, as he danced through the house from window to window. He glided over to the kitchen table, where I sat willing my coffee to make its way quickly to all my extremities, and he put his face close enough to mine that the glint in his eye reflected off my glasses. \"It's snowing, Mama. Is it getting to be  Christmas time ?\" Ah, yes. It all comes back to me now. I remember this from  last year : for Bud, the end of Halloween marks the start of Christmas. Add in a snowfall and it's practically December 23rd. One moment at a time, though. \"No, Bud. It's still a long time until Christmas.\" \"It's getting to be what, Mama?\" \"I don't know - what, Bud?\" \"It's getting to be Snow Time.\" \"Yes, it sure is. It's getting to be Snow Time.\" And Snow Time is, in itself, a cause for celebration. Just ask Bud.

Each child in class has one submission, and each submission includes a picture drawn by the child and the typed text of a story written by the child. Most of the submissions are first-person narratives, and most are variations on a couple of themes. For example, it seems that many first-grade journalists subscribe to the philosophy \"if it bleeds, it leads,\" and the magazine is rife with tales of injury and bloodshed. Jennifer writes of getting a bandaid after cutting herself while jumping on a wet log. Sophie writes of a curling iron burn. Lily writes about her dog's almost-broken leg. Most of the others are \"slice of life\" pieces which offer a bit of insight into the child's world beyond the classroom: \"I was in the tree. Dad put a ladder up.\" \"I got out of the car and went to the apple festival.\" \"I saw some fire crackers outside my house. My mom was scared. My dad was happy.\" \"My cat was fighting with my dog. Then my cat just ran down into the cellar.\" \"I saw a rainbow. I was in Nana's house. It was raining. Then it cleared.\" And then there's Bud - not just the only child who opted to write his story in third person, but also the only one who opted for fiction over personal narrative: One day Bud woke up.

There are nine different flavors available: French vanilla, toasted almond, raspberry, hazelnut, coconut, chocolate, cinnamon, caramel, blueberry. I've not yet tried them all because as I was making my way through the list - coconut (yum), chocolate (not bad), caramel (ooo!) - it occurred to me that I was probably adding 600 calories of fat to my daily caffeine intake. So I asked a worker for some more information about them, and she told me that they were sugar-free and added a mere 20 calories per cup. (The bad news is that there is probably not a single ingredient in them that actually occurs in nature. But, you know -  whatever .) And here's where I get to the good part. In addition to answering my questions, the worker gave me a life-changing piece of information: the flavors can be combined. \"Try the Almond Joy,\" she said. \"The Almond Joy?\" I asked. \"A three-way combo of chocolate, toasted almond, and coconut.\" \"Really? It's good?\" \"Trust me on this one.\" Luckily, I am, by nature, a trusting soul. I'm trying to pace myself. I'm trying to limit myself to one (or two) a week, so I don't flame out too fast.

{"date": "Sunday, November 19, 2006", "body": "\nIt's hard to say out loud that I give medication to my young child. It's hard to say it out loud because I imagine that I'm often saying it to people who regard  medicating young children  as a cop-out, an attempt at a quick-fix, and the result of an unwillingness to do the hard work of actual  parenting . In other words, people who think the same way I used to think about the issue. When Bud was three-years-old, I brought him for his annual visit with the developmental pediatrician who initially diagnosed his autism, the director of a child development clinic at a nationally-recognized teaching hospital. In our debrief meeting at the end of the hours-long visit, Dr. K explained that he is extremely conservative about recommending medication for young children, and that he always errs on the side of withholding it. That being said, though, he recommended that I meet with a child psychiatrist who specializes in autism to discuss the possibility of using an anxiety medication with Bud. I was reluctant to follow his advice, so I spoke privately with the Speech and Language Pathologist who had been involved in the meeting, and who worked very closely with Dr. K. She said that he was not exaggerating when he said that he was extremely conservative, and that she'd rarely heard him recommend medication in a child so young. I agreed to meet with the psychiatrist, but when I called his office I learned that I'd need to wait at least a year for an appointment. I contacted Dr. K to let him know, and he had us booked for an appointment the following week. The appointment with the psychiatrist was helpful. He was willing to write a prescription for Bud, but also said that he didn't think we'd be taking a significant risk by taking a \"wait and see\" approach. We decided to hold off on medication and we booked another appointment in a year's time. We had a similar meeting when Bud was four, and once again we decided to wait. Then, the summer before Bud turned six and just before he started Kindergarten,  we took him to a child psychologist  for testing and decided that the time was right for something. Instead of focusing on Bud's anxiety, we focused on his attention and distractibility and we ultimately landed on Strattera, which has helped significantly with his focus and his ability to engage with people and tasks. Then, this fall,  Bud's anxiety  level reached an all-time high. His anxiety transformed him emotionally and physically - he worried incessantly; he perseverated about the weather; he was anxious about leaving the house; he grew pale and sallow; the circles under his eyes deepened into a bruisy purple; he didn't eat very much; his face became gaunt. In desperation, I called his pediatrician and told her we were ready to try a medication for anxiety with him. She prescribed Zoloft - a half dose for the first week, then a full dose after that. Within days, Bud's disposition started to change. The color came back to his cheeks. His appetite returned. He started to think about things besides the condition of the sky and his calculations about the likelihood of a storm.  He started to play again , and to rediscover the things that brought him joy. With each day that passed, he worried about the weather a little less. Then the worry subsided into simple conversation about the weather. Simple conversation. Conversation. Remarkably, since he started taking Zoloft, Bud has started having more actual, engaged, back-and-forth conversation. He's using more language, more effectively. His grammatical structure has gotten more complex; he's even started correcting himself. I was goofing with him the other day, and said, \"Look! I'm a monkey!\" He laughed and said \"No, you not...\" but his sentence trailed of and he caught himself, thought for a minute, and said \"No, you... isn't.\" \"I'm not?\" I asked. \"No, you're not!\" he laughed. Conversations that used to end at Question-Answer now take several turns. I put Bud's sandwich down on the table yesterday and he asked, \"Mama, can I have potato chips with it?\" \"We don't have any potato chips, hon,\" I said dismissively, expecting that he'd either drop the request or shift it to pretzels. \"They  taked  them?\" he asked, indignantly. (I'm not sure who \"they\" were...) \"No, nobody took them.\" \"I ate them all,\" he said, suggesting what seemed the only plausible conclusion. \"Yes, you did.\" \"That's okay. We can buy some more.\" His experience-sharing language has also grown exponentially. When I ask about his favorite part of his school day, I no longer get the same one-word answer: \"Recess.\" Now I hear about Writer's Workshop and counting in math and the painting he did in art. The other day he named all of the children who go to \"Word Study\" (the special ed group) with him, and he taught my husband and me one of their exercises. He held up a word card, and we had to say \"letter-word-sound\" - \"B. Bell. Ba. K. Kite. Ka.\" He corrected us gently when we mixed up the order, by stating it correctly and looking at us intently until we repeated him. When we got through the stack, he said \"45 seconds! Great work! And you're doing very good sitting, Mama.\" He's calmer. He's more engaged. He's more interested in other children. He's using lots and lots of spontaneous, conversational language. All since he started taking Zoloft. Of course, for every  positive  thought I have about Zoloft, I have two nagging thoughts: What are the long-term effects of a powerful medication on a developing little body?  and, conversely, What would his development be like now if I'd followed the doctor's suggestion and started him on anxiety medication four years ago? I know that dwelling on the \"what ifs\" is rarely helpful or productive. I really do know that. But the fact remains: Zoloft has had a significant effect on reducing Bud's anxiety, but it's left me stranded with a whole lot of my own.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/magazine/30lives.html&OQ=_rQ3D1Q26exQ3D1153886400Q26enQ3D64e277aeabcada70Q26eiQ3D5070&OP=2ec0da4Q2FYujQ7BY-CrpdCCGlYlSSQ5DYQ2ASYQ7DSYQ5B_0_mPQ2BjYQ7DSbPqjpfQ3CGQ5Bb"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/11/anxiety-medication-and-medication.html", "title": "\nAnxiety medication and medication anxiety\n"},

I think the planning gets us both through our weeks. Today's Mom and Bud day involved: 1. A visit to the library so that Bud could fix all the clocks (a la  Curious George ). 2. A stop at Dunkin Donuts for munchkins (him) and medium-coffee-skim-milk-one-sugar-and-a- caramel-flavor-shot  (me). 3. Playtime at the park. We were having a lovely time at the park when a family of four arrived with their  dog . Bud was nervous as they unpacked the car, and became visibly agitated as their dog frolicked near them. \"Don't worry, honey,\" I said, loud enough for the family to hear. \"That doggie won't come near you.\" \"It's okay - he's friendly,\" the dad shouted over to us. \"We have a dog phobia here,\" I shouted back, in as kind a tone as I could muster. The dog barrelled toward us, as if to prove just how friendly he was. Bud darted away with his hands on his ears, shouting \"No doggie! Go away!\" \"A very, very, severe phobia!\" I shouted over my shoulder, a bit less kindly, as I chased after Bud spewing comforting words. The dad moved to catch his dog and said, in an attempt to reassure Bud, \"Yeah, but - he's  very  friendly.\" I stopped when I caught up to Bud, then turned to the dad and said, \"Yeah, but -  he's  autistic.\" \"We'll keep him on a leash,\" the dad assured us. I thanked him, and the family moved to a different area of the park. Bud and I continued playing on the slide, climbing inside the big plastic tube together and copying each other as we drummed out rhythms on the sides. Later we went for a walk. Bud stopped at every hole in the ground to check for prairie dogs. Then he headed for his favorite stream so he could \"skip some stones\" (or, more accurately, hurl stones into the water.) All things considered, it was a very good day. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger2/8178/1309/1600/898527/stream.jpg"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/11/saturday-in-park.html", "title": "\nSaturday in the park\n"},

When it was all over and we were safe at home and ready for bed, we decided to write the story down. Bud dictated and I wrote, doing my best to refrain from prompting or editing. Unfortunately, we started writing after the evening dose of  melatonin  so, by the end, our sleepy narrator began to wander and became a bit script-dependent. I like to think it gives the story a kind of Kerouac  On the Road  vibe. See what you think: We rowed our boat. Then we saw a dolphin. The boat has a hole in it. We put some tape on it. Then we saw a big ship coming at us. And it bump into us. \"Hurry!\" shouted Bud. He was so scared and he eat it. \"No, ship!\" said Bud. \"I said 'need it', not 'eat it'!\" shouted Mom. He was so mad because a ship was coming up. Because Mom is alright. Bud is new here. The big upside down cap!  We heard someone calling. \"Bud? Mom? Bud? Mom?\" It sound like Sumbah.

He is a retired firefighter, and his responsibilities include running fire drills in the residence halls and then, when he has the group of residents gathered together, doing a post-drill reminder about fire safety protocol. He always uses the opportunity to tell students about another issue he encountered frequently in the line of duty - responding to motor vehicle accidents that involved moose. We live in a rural area, and it's not uncommon to be driving down a dark country road and suddenly see a moose looming in your headlights. If you are moving fast and the animal is standing still, it often becomes a contest of moose vs. metal - and let's just say the metal doesn't always fare very well. And, often, neither do the people riding in the car. So Officer Brock offers an important safety tip to students every time he does a fire drill. Ask any student on our campus what to do if you think you're going to hit a moose, and they'll do their best Officer Brock impersonation, admonishing you with a growl: \"Aim for the ass. Moose don't back up.\" It's a running joke on our campus. But two weeks ago, a shaken student arrived at the Campus Safety office looking for Officer Brock. He'd just been on the road and found himself headed straight for a moose. Officer Brock's words rang in his ears and he swerved for the moose's backside. He walked away rattled, but unharmed. I don't know if you're likely to see moose where you live. But someday you may be on vacation, and you may find your car speeding toward a hulking mass of animal. And if you do, just remember Officer Brock and these words that could save your life: Moose don't back up.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/11/butt-seriously.html", "title": "\nButt seriously\n"},
{"date": "Friday, December 29, 2006", "body": "\nWe had a wonderful Christmas. Bud woke us early, but not too early, and made his way downstairs, excited but not frenzied. He read the tags before he opened each present, and he was delighted with each gift he opened. He got lots of things he loved - a Fisher Price camera, a new mini-trampoline, a \"banana farm\" that grows real bananas, a bevy of Curious George books and toys - but his favorite present was a low-tech stuffed  Roly Mo , a BBC character he knows from the  CBeebies  website. (He quickly recruited several of his  stuffed Boohbahs  to  play the roles  of Roly Mo's friends.) I waited all day for the Holiday Letdown, the big crash of emotion that tends to follow holidays with big build-ups, but it never came. Bud stayed upbeat and well-regulated all day. As the day wound down, Bud opened the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVD that Santa had tossed in his bag as a last minute add-on. (Santa had heard a rumor that Bud developed an intense Mickey Mouse fascination after all the Christmas shopping was done.) Inside the DVD case, Bud found an advertisement for the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse toy - a replica of the house from the show, complete with all of his newly-beloved character friends (in other words, EXACTLY the sort of toy that Bud loves best of all) - and Bud realized that he'd missed his opportunity to request the toy from Santa. Calmly, he brought the ad to me and said, \"I want this for my birthday.\" As the evening wore on, Bud must have done the math and realized he'd be in for a long wait for his September birthday. He called me from his bed long after I thought he was asleep, and asked, \"Mama, can I have a sticker chart?\" Sticker charts are a  technique we've used  as an incentive for Bud to do things that are difficult - going to sleep by himself, remembering to use the toilet, swallowing pills. Bud earns a sticker each time he successfully completes the designated task, and after a predetermined number of stickers he earns a much-coveted prize. Bud desperately wanted the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse without waiting until his birthday, and he guessed that a sticker chart would be the most likely route to getting it. I told Bud that we'd talk about it in the morning, then set about considering our options. Bud's motivation for this toy would be high, and I knew it provided an opportunity to work on a particularly daunting challenge. Two things came to mind: nighttime pull-ups and vegetables. I ruled out pull-ups after only a few minutes' consideration. We use sticker charts for behaviors over which Bud has control. Sticker charts allow him to make choices - do the thing and get a sticker, or don't do the thing right now with the knowledge that you can do it and get a sticker some other time. No pressure. Low stakes. All in your own time. But I'm not sure that staying dry at night is a choice that Bud would be  able  to make, even if he wanted to. Lots of seven-year-olds - even those without autism - use pull-ups at night. Bud may not be biologically ready yet, and I didn't want to risk setting him up for failure or, perhaps worse, making him feel self-conscious or ashamed. So veggies it was. Bud has always been good about eating vegetables, as long as they're pureed and in a jar marked \"Gerbers.\" He likes the taste of vegetables, but he balks at chunks of them. Maybe it's the texture. Maybe it's just the idea. Either way, Bud has refused to let a solid vegetable pass his lips for years. In the morning, when Bud asked again about a sticker chart, I pitched the vegetable idea - and, eager to do whatever it took, Bud signed on happily. We put together a sticker chart with 32 boxes for stickers followed by a picture of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, and we hung it on the refrigerator. At lunchtime, when it was time to start trying to earn stickers, Bud balked again. I'd started with green beans - one of his favorites - but he could barely get past licking them. He finally choked one down by tossing it back with milk, like he was swallowing a pill, then suggested that we start with celery instead. He munched a celery stalk and a raw carrot (I have a hunch he's been eating these at school), and earned three stickers - one for each kind of veggie he'd eaten. We were off to a good start. At dinner, it was time to try again, but Bud was in the mood for negotiation. He would eat a vegetable, he said, if he could have ALL of his stickers in exchange for it. He whined and wheedled, but I stayed firm as the veggies on his plate grew cold. Finally, he tried another green bean, and he gagged. Maybe this is too much for him,  I thought.  Maybe he really can't do this. I suggested to Bud that for this sticker he could go back to baby food, but that he would need to feed himself. (Another veggie quirk of Bud's is that, although he feeds himself everything else, he will only eat his pureed veggies if they are fed  to  him - but then he eats them happily.) Bud sat at the table with his pureed green beans untouched in front of him as he continued to negotiate and complain (\"How about cake? Cake could be vegetables!\"). Slowly, the rest of the dinner dishes were cleared and Bud wandered away from the table. The green beans sat cold and menacing like something out of a scene in  Mommy Dearest . I picked them up and told Bud that dinner was over, and that he could try again tomorrow.  And then, the post-Christmas crash I'd been expecting the previous day descended on Bud as he wailed and cried and shouted and, finally, dissolved. I hustled him into his pajamas and he fell into bed, dejected and discouraged. \"It's okay, Bud,\" I said. \"You don't have to worry. You'll get all the stickers. We'll do it together.\" \"You will take care of me, Mama?\" \"Of course I will.\" \"It will be okay?\" \"It will be okay. I promise. But now it's sleeping time. Do you want me to read a book to you?\" \"I just want  mumblemumblemumble. ..\" \"What's that, Bud?\" \"I just want you to be my friend.\" \"Oh, sweetie,\" I said, climbing up beside him, \"I am  always  your friend.\" Bud slid over and put his head on my chest. I clicked off the light, and he fell into a deep sleep. The next morning, I woke to Bud's calm, clear voice in my ear: \"Mama, may I try again?\" I assured him he could try again - and try he has. We're keeping the portions small. We're celebrating the small successes. We're working through a few gags here and there. He's spit out a mouthful or two. But he's eaten corn, carrots (raw and cooked), celery, peas, and even green beans. He's earned seventeen stickers and one big sense of accomplishment. The Fed Ex truck should deliver the Clubhouse tomorrow, right about the time we're posting sticker number 32. Maybe we'll celebrate with some broccoli. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/rolymo/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/12/veggie-tales.html", "title": "\nVeggie tales\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 04, 2007", "body": "\nIn a  recent comment , VTBudFan asked my opinion of the latest addition to the Beatles' catalog, the CD titled  Love . For the uninitiated, let me give you this brief overview:  Love  is the handiwork of longtime Beatles' producer George Martin and his son Giles. On the album, which was developed as a soundtrack for the  Cirque du Soleil show  of the same name, the Martins mine the archives of outtakes and alternate takes from the original Beatles recording sessions to remix and enhance some classic songs. More significantly, they also take well-known and lesser-known Beatles album tracks and create  mash-ups  by melding them together. I have to admit, when I first heard about the project I was skeptical. I'm not sure why, because I tend to like mash-ups in general (my current favorite blends Oasis and Green Day in a track called  Wonderwall of Broken Dreams .) And, I've long believed that my friend Ric invented the mash-up when he created the game \"Maggie Mae,\" which is based on the theory that Rod Stewart's  Maggie Mae  can be sung as a counter-melody to any other Rod Stewart song. The game took off when we expanded the rules so that players could sing any song by an artist as a counter-melody while any other song by the same artist was playing. Yes, folks, this is how I spent my college years. But I digress. Back to  Love . As I was saying, I was skeptical. I thought it would be too unsettling, too modern, too not-the-original, too not-the-Beatles. I was wrong. It's amazing. These mash-ups are masterful. They add texture and dimension where I never realized that texture and dimension were missing.  Love  takes songs like  Drive My Car  and  What You're Doing , which I never really liked as stand-alones, and brings them together to create an entirely new song that's superior to either of the originals. It even tosses in a little of  The Word  for a little extra something-something surprise at the end. The album continues to work the same magic again and again and again. Some of the mash-ups are predictable -  Strawberry Fields Forever  with  Penny Lane ;  Tomorrow Never Knows  with  Within You, Without You ... no stretches there. But  Lady Madonna  with  Hey Bulldog ?  Helter Skelter  with  I Want You (She's So Heavy)  and  Being for the Benefit of Mister Kite ?  Get Back  with elements from  Help  and  The End ? Just brilliant. It even stays true to the Beatles' unofficial and unspoken credo, which is that the weakest track on the album must be the one sung by Ringo. In the case of  Love , it's  Octopus's Garden  with a dash of  Good Night  and a few other things I can't place ( Yellow Submarine , maybe? Anyone?). Despite the occasional weaker moment (and who among us is free from those?),  Love  is just fantastic. It's not just a great tribute; it's also a great album, all on its own. This closing begs to be written. I know it's trite and obvious and not at all clever. I know it's going to make you groan, but I just can't resist. I have to say it: All you need is  Love .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www2.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10731506&postID=7202089728808737639", "http://www.amazon.com/Love-Beatles/dp/B000JK8OYU/sr=1-1/qid=1167926447/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3584129-9809665?ie=UTF8&s=music", "http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/love/intro/intro.htm?sa_campaign=internal_click/redirect/love", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_pop", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5xPh0M2Egs&mode=related&search="], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/01/love-love-me-do.html", "title": "\nLove, love me do\n"},

But sometimes, like this holiday weekend, it means he's far more polite that the average seven-year-old boy - even when he's disagreeing with us.

I'd been planning on easing into the season, to downplay the merriment and put off the decorations until mid-month, but the fact is that I'm just as big a sucker for the holiday as Bud is.

Bud woke early this morning - not as early as  some mornings , I'll grant you, but 3:00 a.m. nonetheless - not asking for breakfast, not asking to turn on the television, but simply requesting that we head downstairs to watch the tree. It promises to be a long month, but a lovely one. Bud also took some time yesterday to compose a letter to Santa.

This evening at bedtime, Bud put on his jammies  all by himself  (and only the bottoms were on backwards), then dashed back into his room to put on his bathrobe. He came back out with the bathrobe on and his hands fumbling with its belt. \"How I tie it?\" he asked. \"Come here and I'll show you,\" I said. \"I can do it,\" he said. \"I won't do it for you, Bud,\" I said. \"I'll just show you  how  to do it.\" \"No,\" he said. \"I'll do it.\" He went back into his room and closed the door. My husband and I started chatting in the hallway, and as time passed I assumed that Bud had gotten distracted and was in his room playing. Of course, I have  learned my lesson  about barging in on him when his door is closed, so I put my ear to the door and heard his sing-song voice in what I guessed was a quote from a video: \"Over... under... and make a loop!\" \"Over... under... and make a loop!\" \"Over... under... and make a loop!\" His voice was even and calm, but he was clearly focused on the task at hand. I backed away slowly and whispered to my husband to let him know what was going on. We sat patiently as the minutes ticked by. We'd never tried to teach Bud how to tie a knot. This was brand new territory for him. I hoped he wouldn't get too frustrated. I hoped he wouldn't be too disappointed. Then the bedroom door burst open and Bud flew out, his mouth in a great big grin and his belt in a great big knot. A raucous celebration ensued. He did it. Not  as young as some other children. Not  as quickly as many other children. Not  the same way as most other children. He did it in his own time, at his own pace, by capitalizing on  his own strengths . And would I have it any other way? Knot  a chance.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/01/knot-even-wrong.html", "title": "\nKnot even wrong\n"},

He was still singing when we got home, and before the pizza was on the table he asked if he could use the computer, \"to write  words , Mama.\" I told him that we were done with the computer for the day, and that it was time to eat pizza.

The article opens with this sentence: The horror films on display at the Sundance Film Festival are nothing compared to every parent's fear that their child could be diagnosed with the mysterious developmental disability called autism. The statement is so horrifying that I had to read it several times before I could fully grasp its meaning: Was the author really comparing our lives - our  children  - to a horror movie? Was she honestly asserting that our lives - our  children  - are \"every parent's fear?\" Maybe this sentence blows me away because I've been working so hard to  keep an open mind  about the \"new\"  Autism Every Day . Or maybe it blows me away because this time of year  tends to be difficult  for me anyway. Either way, I'll say this: Parents, don't waste your fear on autism.

{"date": "Monday, January 22, 2007", "body": "\nI've had problem-solving on the brain today. This afternoon I participated in a telephone conference with two professionals who will be involved in Bud's  developmental assessment  next month. They asked a lot of questions to try to get a sense of who Bud is, and they asked me about his problem-solving skills. We talked about him teaching himself to  tie a knot , and about his creative problem-solving when  improvising characters  for his pretend play. I also told them about Bud's struggle with this week's school homework. The exercise involved a grid with the numbers 1 - 100. I was instructed to choose two numbers and say, for example, \"I'm thinking of a number between 10 and 20.\" Bud would guess a number and if it wasn't my number I would instruct him that my number was \"higher\" or \"lower\" until he guessed it correctly. Bud was baffled by the activity. I started small: \"I'm thinking of a number between 7 and 9.\" Bud's first guess was 15. His second guess was 9. I tried to show him visually, pointing to 7 and sliding my finger to the right as I said \"hiiiiiigher than 7,\" then pointing to 9 and sliding my finger to the left as I said \"looooooower than 9.\" Both times I left my finger on the number 8. Bud guessed 5. I tried to reframe the problem, using different terms - more than/less than, bigger than/smaller than - but it wasn't happening. We moved on to spelling words, and Bud was much more successful. After I recounted the homework experience to the clinic professionals, I found myself thinking about it and wondering what problem was at its core. Was Bud having trouble  responding to questions  under pressure? Or was it the conceptualizing of the question that he found challenging? So tonight I tried another problem-solving experiment. Earlier in the day, I'd purchased a toy harmonica for him (he's been wanting one because Curious George plays one in a favorite episode.) I entered the room with the toy behind my back and said, \"I bought something for you today.\" \"What?\" Bud asked. \"See if you can guess,\" I said. \"It's something you use your mouth for.\" \"Twizzlers,\" he said, almost immediately. \"That's a good guess,\" I said, \"But it's not Twizzlers.\" \"Cookies?\" he asked. \"Nope,\" I said. \"It's not something you eat.\" \"It's what?\" he asked. \"Snacks.\" \"It's something you use your mouth for, but you  don't  eat it.\" Bud thought for a second, then guessed, \"Juice?\" (Clever boy! You  drink  juice; you don't  eat  it.) \"Good guess, Bud! But this is something you don't eat, you use your mouth for, and you  blow .\" \"Balloons!\" he guessed. \"Great guess!\" I said. \"But it's something you don't eat, you use your mouth and blow and  make   music .\" Bud thought again, then smiled and said, \"Harmonica!\" He was delighted to learn that he was correct, and immediately set about trying to figure out how to play Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, which I taught him to play on the  glockenspiel , and he taught himself to play on the  xylophone , keyboard, and toy clarinet. So, I think it's the  concept  of the homework that is baffling to Bud. Quite frankly, he probably inherited his aptitude for math problems from his mom. The problem-solving, on the other hand... the problem-solving is not a problem.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kindermusik.com/store/trans/productDetailForm.asp?maxItems=1&imgid=463&Seq=1&CatID=0&Search=GLOCKENSPIEL", "http://larkinthemorning.com/product.asp?pn=MAR070&Wooden+Xylophone=&bhcd2=1169518269"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/01/solving-worlds-problems.html", "title": "\nSolving the world's problems\n"},

My family has not experienced those particular issues, so I had two pieces of advice for her: 1) Send the same e-mail to  Susan Senator , who has been there (and read her book  Making Peace with Autism ), and 2) Let me toss this out to the wise folks in the autism blogosphere.

{"date": "Thursday, February 08, 2007", "body": "\nI pay a lot of attention to  the evolution of Bud's language , not just because language acquisition has been one of his greatest challenges and not just because his language skills seem to be an indicator of his development overall, but also because, when you come right down to it, I'm just a big old grammar geek. I've  written previously  about Bud's use of the phrase \"What did I did?\" to call our attention to something he's done. As has sometimes happened with  other phrases , \"What did I did?\" has come to have a  variety of meanings  for Bud. Sometimes \"What did I did?\" means  \"Do you recognize my achievement, and will you shower me with praise?\"  Other times \"What did I did?\" means  \"Can you tell me the words I should use to describe the thing that I just did?\"  Still other times \"What did I did?\" means  \"Are you aware of this thing that I did... and am I going to be in trouble for it?\" \"What did I did?\" is a question in the simple past tense: it indicates that his activity has been completed. However, in recent months, as Bud's language has continued to develop, he's started playing with tenses and we've been hearing the question earlier, while the activity is still in progress: \"What I'm doing?\" Fittingly, with questions like \"What I'm doing?,\" Bud is moving his language forward by using the \"present progressive\" tense. In the past week or so, he's been playing with a new tense by using the helping verb  have , or, more accurately, the contraction  've , as he did on Monday when he asked me, \" What you've got ?\" and this morning when he tried a new form of \"What did I did?\" and asked me \"What I've did?\" As I drove to work this morning I tried to remember the name of the tense that uses \"have,\" but I couldn't come up with it. So, this afternoon I pulled out my  handy reference guide  and looked it up: What I've did?  = past perfect tense What you've got?  = present perfect tense Past perfect. Present perfect. My hunch is that pretty soon   he  will have mastered  it all. And for those keeping score at home: that makes the future perfect, too.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/English-Grammar-Dummies-Geraldine-Woods/dp/0764553224/sr=8-1/qid=1170974372/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3584129-9809665?ie=UTF8&s=books"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/02/tense-moments.html", "title": "\nTense moments\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 01, 2007", "body": "\nI've done some interesting reading this week, and it's gotten me thinking. I've been thinking about  this fantastic post  by abfh on  Whose Planet Is It Anyway? . It deconstructs the \"Sally-Anne\" marble experiment that is often pointed to as evidence that people with autism are deficient in \"theory of mind\" skills, or the ability to adopt the perspective of another person. (I  wrote about the theory  quite some time ago, but have long since dismissed it as an issue for Bud: it wouldn't occur to him  to be sneaky  if he couldn't imagine how I might respond to his activity.) The post is brilliant and it suggests a reasonable, and much more plausible, language-based explanation for why kids with autism struggle with the \"Sally-Anne\" experiment. I've also been thinking about  this essay  by Ellen Notbohm, which reinforces  my thinking about video games  and reaffirms my decision to keep them outside Bud's experience. And I've been thinking a lot about  this post  about the recent  autism special on  The View  and  this post  about correlation vs. causation, both from Kristina at  AutismVox , which pointed me to  this post from Kim Stagliano  and  this post from Barbara Fischkin , both from The Huffington Post. I actually wrote a long post about my thoughts on these pieces and these issues. Unfortunately, after an extraordinary amount of writing and editing and rewriting and tweaking and rephrasing, I hit the \"Publish\" button and got an error message telling me that Blogger was down for repair. When it came back up, my post - the one I'd labored to word  just the right way  - had vanished. I'm taking it as a sign. You can read the Huffington posts, and if you've been reading my blog for any length of time you can probably guess my reaction to them. If not, I'll just mention two philosophies that shape my thinking, my actions and, most importantly, my parenting, which might give you a general idea. The first philosophy is this: I believe that we move in the direction of our dominant thought. Think \"I hope I don't forget my keys,\" and \"forget\" becomes your dominant thought. By focusing on \"forget,\" you increase the likelihood that you'll leave the house with your keys still on the counter. But shift your focus and think \"I want to remember my keys\" and you change your dominant thought to \"remember,\" making it more likely that you'll leave the house with your keys in hand. Think \"I hate autism\" (or \"I fear autism\" or \"I am exhausted by autism\" or \"I resent autism\") and you move, psychologically and emotionally, toward those dominant thoughts - toward hate, toward fear, toward exhaustion, toward resentment. Think instead \"I love my child\" and you move toward love. You move toward your child. It's clear to me that both Huffington bloggers are smart, insightful writers and mothers who love their children. But I fear that there's an unspoken code in the blogosphere that says that the  best  bloggers are the ones who make their points with acerbic humor - the ones whose writing is engaging because its tone has an undercurrent that is sarcastic, snide, and derisive. That may be fine when you're writing about George Bush or Bill Clinton: they can take it. It's entirely different when you're writing about your child. Because you move in the direction of your dominant thought. I'm not a naive Pollyanna. And I'm tired of reading that I don't understand \"real\" autism because I have a \" high functioning \" child. There are  some challenges  that I avoid discussing on my blog, not because I am trying to sugar-coat the picture I paint of life with an autistic child and not because those issues don't exist, but because my responsibility - first and foremost - is not to my readers, not to my writing, and not to autism advocacy, but to my son: my son, the full, complete, human being who, despite his young age and autism, has a  right to privacy  and dignity and respect. Which brings me to my second philosophical belief, which is actually a quote from Anais Nin: \"We don't see things as they are. We see them as we are.\" It's all about the filters we choose. We let some things in; we leave other things out. The world - autism - our children - writing: it's boundless. We choose to  frame it  with artificial borders of our own making. The frames are not about the world, or autism, or our children, or writing. They are about ourselves. So I'm thinking about my filters and frames and I'm continuing to move in the direction of my dominant thought: I'm moving toward my child.

He does it on purpose, in that way that good friends do - he knows what will make me laugh and he seizes opportunities to do it. And he laughs at my jokes, too. Bud is genuine. He never leads with pretense. He puts his cards on the table every day, he makes himself vulnerable, and he trusts that his vulnerability will be safe with me. Bud is forgiving. He gets angry at me, but after some cooling down, he is always willing to re-engage, to work it out, and to make it better.

Bud lets me be who I am, without imposing a lot of expectations about how I should act, what I should say, or who I should  be  in this world. Who I am already is just fine with him - and, because of that, Bud makes me feel good about myself. Bud's enthusiasm for life is infectious. He experiences joy with his whole being - inside and out - and his joy radiates from him. I could go on all day, but I won't - I've got even bigger things planned.

{"date": "Monday, February 19, 2007", "body": "\nSaturday was an \"aloha\" kind of day. Bud had a great time at  Carla's Hawaiian-themed birthday party , and I could just leave the story there - \"He had a great time.\" But, really, it was so much more than just a great time. It was aloha. According to  Wikipedia , The word aloha derives from the Hawaiian words alo, meaning \"presence,\" \"front,\" \"face,\" or \"share\"; and ha, meaning \"breath of life\" or \"essence  of life.\"... Over the decades the word aloha has been used in reference to a complex state of mind called the Aloha Spirit or sense of aloha. The Aloha Spirit is often described as a sense of care and hospitality to those around as well as respect for their personhood, even in the face of stressful environments, occasions or people. Bud negotiated the crowded party beautifully, connecting with children and separating from them as he needed - eating pizza with his friends, but standing at the counter instead of crowding around the table; joining the hula activity by taking pictures with his digital camera instead of dancing; stepping into the kitchen when the living room got too busy, and into the living room when the kitchen got too busy. Bud's friends were terrific. They engaged with him but gave him space, having already figured out that they will be most successful if they initiate brief, concrete opportunities for interaction - \"Bud, will you take my picture?\"; \"Bud, can I take your picture?\" Carla herself was remarkable. Despite the fact that it was her day to be center of attention, she went out of her way to make Bud feel special, too. She chose his present to open first, and ooh-ed and aah-ed with the other girls about the Polly Pockets and Littlest Pet Shop toys inside. Later, when everyone moved into the kitchen for cake, she sought us out and said to me \"I really like the present Bud gave me.\" \"I'm so glad,\" I said. \"Bud picked it out himself.\" \"He's a really good present-picker,\" she said. Then she walked past me and over to where Bud was taking pictures, and said \"You're a really good present-picker, Bud.\" \"Yeah!\" he said from behind the camera. As the party was wrapping up, I had a chance to chat for a minute with  Carla's mom , who, it turns out, is an as-yet-unpublished  writer  working on her MFA in creative writing. We discovered quickly that we have a mutual writer-friend. She told me about  a book  that she thought might interest me. And she explained that she's in the process of opening a \"writer's studio,\" the plans for which are still evolving - perhaps a writer's workshop series, some seminars and writing groups, a space for people to come and write in a conducive environment. Perhaps, in other words, exactly  what I might be looking for . A short time later, with ten minutes to go before the party's scheduled end, Bud came to me and said \"It's time to go home now.\" I told him we could go, but that we'd need to say \"thank you\" to Carla first. Bud walked directly to Carla and said, \"Thank you, Carla. I had a great time at the party.\" I explained to the room that it was time for us to go, and we exited to a chorus of \"Bye, Bud!\" As we pulled out of Carla's driveway, I asked Bud, as I often do, if he'd had a hard day or an easy day, and without hesitation he replied that the day had been easy. When we got home from the party, I downloaded the pictures from Bud's camera. I found a number that captured the spirit of Carla's party as I experienced it.   But there was  another  series of pictures that Bud took at the party - a series striking in its artistry, capturing aspects of the party that only Bud saw, that only Bud appreciated, with imagery that simply takes my breath away.

We were hours from dawn on what must have been a moonless night, and without the artificial glow from the alarm clocks and nightlights, the bedroom was solid blackness. \"The power went out,\" I said. \"I can't see,\" he repeated. \"I know, Bud,\" I said. \"The power went out.\" Bud was quiet for a minute, then asked, \"Can you fix my eyes?\" My husband reached over to his bedside table, picked up his digital watch, and pressed a button, illuminating its face. \"Its Daddy's watch!\" Bud said excitedly. \"That's right, Bud,\" I said. \"Your eyes are fine. It's very dark because the power went out.\" We laid in the darkness and tried to go back to sleep, though I'm sure Bud and I both knew that we were awake for the day. As he tossed and turned next to me I thought about his reaction to the darkness: In the absence of information about what was happening, Bud assumed that the challenge he was experiencing was caused by some kind of internal malfunction (his eyes not functioning properly) as opposed to external conditions beyond his control (the power going out). How often does that happen? How often does he assume that things are difficult because of some failing in  him , and not because he is being subjected to overwhelming circumstances or unreasonable expectations? How often do I assume the same thing about him? I'll need to pay attention to that. I'll need to remember his response to the power failure. And I'll need to be careful that I'm not undertaking delicate eye surgery when all I really have to do is cast a little light.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/04/light-in-darkness.html", "title": "\nA light in the darkness\n"},

Severe weather that kept Bud's school closed for the better part of the week.  Grandparents  out of town, necessitating some scrambling to cover Bud's schedule shift while juggling a very heavy work load at the office. Resulting  dysregulation  for all concerned. And on top of it all, ongoing issues with our septic system that have created unlivable conditions and will be expensive to rectify. We are - quite literally - up to our ears in it these days. And then - in keeping with  the pattern of the last almost-thirty years  - it's Paul McCartney to the rescue. His upcoming album,  Memory Almost Full , won't be released until June 5. Despite persistent and pervasive rumors in Macca-circles on the Web that the first single, \"Ever Present Past,\" would be released to radio stations yesterday, I've yet to read any confirmation that the song has actually hit the airwaves. But today, I discovered that the song has surfaced on the Web - you can listen to it  here . It's terrific. Actually, I don't know if you'll like it or not - I lost all perspective on that sort of thing a long time ago. But I'll tell you this - it is, without question, just the thing I needed today. For those surfing in from Google who are looking for more information, the lyrics appear below. They suggest the difficulty of living life and moving forward with a very public, and therefore always present, past. I get it. I do. And I wish Paul nothing but peace and happiness in his here-and-now. But I have to admit that I'm comforted by the knowledge that  much  of his past can remain ever-present for me. Ever Present Past   (McCartney) I\u2019ve got too much on my plate Don\u2019t have no time to be a decent lover I hope it isn\u2019t too late Searching for the time that has gone so fast The time that I thought would last My ever present past I\u2019ve got too much on my mind I think of everything to be discovered I hope there\u2019s something to find Searching for the time that has gone so fast The time that I thought would last My ever present past The things I think I did I do, I think I did The things I think I did When I was a kid I couldn\u2019t understand a word that they were saying But still I hung around and took it all in I wouldn\u2019t join in with the games that they were playing It went by, it went by, in a flash It flew by, it flew by, in a flash There\u2019s far too much on my plate Don\u2019t have no time to be a decent lover I hope it\u2019s never too late Searching for the time that has gone so fast The time that I thought would last My ever present past The things I think I did I do, I think I did The things I think I did When I was a kid When I was a kid \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://jack_benny.podomatic.com/entry/2007-04-20T21_16_01-07_00"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/04/ever-present-past.html", "title": "\nEver Present Past\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, June 03, 2007", "body": "\nAs you may know, I've been a bit absent from the blogosphere lately. Apparently, I've been even more absent than I realized, as I discovered when I read  Joe's latest post  over at Club 166, and read his opening sentence: For followers of the blogs on the  Autism Hub , one would have to have been asleep over the last several days to have missed it's mini identity crisis.  It seems I've been catching some Z's. I followed the links from Joe's blog and more links from there and caught myself up on the conversation that has taken over the Hub, the crux of which seems to be this: it is time to clarify the mission and, perhaps, the membership of Autism Hub. I'm all for it. To be honest, I've never really been sure if I was a good \"fit\" for the Hub. (This is not a veiled request for reassurance, so no comments that stroke my ego are necessary here.) When I became aware of the Hub in March, 2006, I sent two e-mails in rapid succession. The first was a request to join. The second was an apology and a request to rescind my previous request. After sending the first request, I'd spent more time reading the blogs affiliated with the Hub and noticed that most of them had an activist focus - and while I believe in the power and importance of autism activism, while I may tip-toe into it from time to time, it does not tend to be the focus of my blog. A short time after sending my second e-mail, I got a reply from  then-scary-to-me Kevin Leitch . I explained my dilemma to Kev - that it seemed to me that the Hub was designed for autism activism, and that I mostly posted cute stories about my delightful son. Kev said there was room at the Hub for cute stories and he welcomed me into the fold. For over a year now, I've been delighted to be in such wonderful company - but I have to admit that I've continued to wonder if I'm just a bit out of place. So, this current Hub-identity conversation is, I think, a good (if difficult) one that will address important issues as the Hub continues to evolve: Should the Hub only include blogs that focus primarily on autism advocacy and activism? And, if so, should its primary emphasis be on bloggers who are themselves autistic? Good questions. Important questions. I'm glad that people are taking them on. But, in contrast to my fellow Hub bloggers who are asking the hard questions and engaging in a powerful discourse, I will continue watching from the sidelines. I thought a lot about the ongoing Hub debate yesterday while I was mowing the lawn. I thought a lot about my own inactivism - both my recent absence from the blogosphere and my tendency to blog more about Bud's sweetness than about the politics of autism. I thought about how I make decisions about where to put my energy - about why I am not more drawn to activism. As I thought, I pushed the mower, its motor buzzing loudly, while Bud walked alongside me with his own Fisher Price mower in front of him, his shoulders hunched as he tried to muffle the noise from my machine. I turned toward Bud and saw his lips moving. I could tell he was asking me something, but I couldn't hear his words. I leaned down and put my ear next to his mouth, and he shouted his question to me: \"Can I hold your hand?\" Bud was frightened by the sound of the lawn mower, but his desire to be part of the process was greater than his fear. Just the same, he needed some tangible, physical reassurance from me to know that he was safe. So I reached out my left hand and he grasped it tightly, and together we continued to mow the lawn. My right hand gripped the mower's handle and squeezed the power bar. I propelled the mower - uphill in the beating sun - with the power from my right arm and some heavy support from my abdomen, and we moved together, back and forth, uphill and down, cutting a little bit of grass and building a great deal of unspoken connection. I thought about the parallel between autism advocacy and my unmown lawn. I need to think about both - I need to address both - for Bud's sake. He will always be an autistic person in a largely neurotypical world, and I need to do what I can in the world of activism to help create an environment that will both challenge him and support him, just as he will continue to be a child who wants to play in the yard, and who needs an environment free from the tall grasses that harbor deer ticks and other disease-carrying critters. He needs me to do my part with these things. In the big picture, over time, I need to make sure these things get my attention and my energy. I also need to make sure that I help him learn how to mow the lawn on his own, and how to become an effective self-advocate and, if he chooses, activist. But in the moment, in the right-here-right-now, Bud needs  me . He needs me to be his parent. He needs me to hold his hand. And so, for now, it is parenting and not activism that will continue to be my primary focus. Parenting will win out over blogging. Blogging about parenting will win out over blogging about the politics of autism. That might make me a poor fit for the Autism Hub, depending on where the Hub goes from here. And I'm okay with that. I'll continue to support the Hub and I'll continue to read the bloggers who post there, whether or not I'm among them. Right now, my lawn is one-quarter mowed. I couldn't sustain the physical exertion to do any more of it. If the rain holds off, Bud and I will do a little more mowing today - probably just a few square feet, possibly even blade by blade, but, almost certainly, hand in hand.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://club166.blogspot.com/2007/06/censorship.html", "http://autism-hub.co.uk/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/06/inactivism-and-art-of-one-handed-mow.html", "title": "\nInactivism and the art of the one-handed mow\n"},

In fact, his fondness for underwriting announcements is one of the things that prevents us from exposing him to any commercial television at all, lest our days become filled with catchy jingles and advertising copy. It doesn't bother Bud, though - he's perfectly happy with the underwriting announcements he's adopted from PBS Kids. One of his favorite activities these days is walking through the house, happily gathering videos, books and CDs from PBS shows, then lining them up and moving down the row, announcing each in turn: \"Clifford the Big Red Dog is sponsored in part by the U.S. Department of Education...\" \"Curious George is brought to you today by Shea Homes, Caring since 1881...\" \"Funding for Arthur was provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting...\" \"Between the Lions was made possible by a Ready to Learn Grant...\" He's got a million of 'em. I've just discovered that he plays a similar game on the computer, where he can now do underwriting announcements for shows he doesn't watch or shows that are not carried by our local PBS affiliate. He goes to the PBS Kids website, clicks onto the show's individual page, then scrolls to the bottom to look for logos. Now that he can read, he's able to improvise and create underwriting announcements of his own: \"Major funding for Cyberchase is provided by the National Science Foundation...\" \"Fetch with Ruff Ruffman is sponsored in part by the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations...\" And, of course, every single one of his underwriting announcements ends the same way: \"And by contributions to your PBS station from viewers like you. Thank you.\" Until a few days ago, I was not aware of Bud's high-tech computerized version of the underwriting game, so I was confused when he jumped up from the row of videos he'd been announcing on the floor and ran over to the kitchen table, where my husband and I were finishing breakfast. \"Mama,\" he said. \"I want to do my contributions to my PBS stations.\" \"Yes, I know, Bud,\" I said. \"You're doing them. And you're doing a great job.\" \" No ,\" he said emphatically. \"I want to do my contri BU tions to my PBS  STA tions!\" \"I don't understand, Bud,\" I said. \"I want to DO. MY. CONTRIBUTIONS. To my PBS STATIONS!\" I wondered if my son was suddenly becoming philanthropic, so I asked tentatively, \"You want to make a contribution to your PBS station?\" \"YES!\" he replied, relieved that I was finally getting it. \"Do you know what a contribution is, Bud?\" I asked. \"What?\" he replied. \"It means you give money to PBS so they can make the shows you like to watch.\" \"Okay.\" \"You want to give your money to PBS so they can make the shows you like to watch?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay,\" I said, \"Then you need to go upstairs and get your tooth fairy money, and we'll say  'Here, PBS Kids, you can have my tooth fairy money to make the shows I like to watch.'  Okay?\" \"NO!\" Bud shrieked, clearly aghast at the suggestion that he'd fork over the money he's been saving to buy the Teletubbies DVD due to be released on May 1st. My husband lowered his newspaper and looked across the table at us. \"Unfortunately, son,\" he said, \"I'm afraid most of the country feels the same way about it.\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/04/give-till-it-hurts.html", "title": "\nGive till it hurts\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 26, 2007", "body": "\nBlogging continues to fall to the bottom of the priority list these days, and for that I apologize. I have been thinking about you, though, and my mental list of  Things to Blog  is ever-growing. In the interest of actually hoping to get any of them to the \"publish\" stage, I'm foregoing the exposition and posting some thumbnails instead. Here, then, is a run-down of what's capturing my attention lately: 1. Paul McCartney's upcoming album,  Memory Almost Full : If  early press  is reliable, this album promises to be one of the highlights of McCartney's career. (I speculated in an  earlier post  that this might be the case, as there tends to be an inverse relationship between calm happiness in Paul's personal life and the quality of the albums he produces.) I simply can't wait to hear it. You can view the video for \"Dance Tonight,\" the album's opening track,  here  and the Electronic Press Kit for the album  here . Oh my, oh my, oh my. 2. Tuesday, June 5: This is a red-letter day because of the release of (see above)  Memory Almost Full . It will be McCartney's first release available on iTunes (and is currently available for preorder), and it will be his first release on Starbucks' Hear Music label. Starbucks will be hosting \" a global listening event \" on June 5, in which they will play nothing but  Memory Almost Full  in their stores all day. XM satellite radio is getting in on the action as well, not only on their Hear Music channel (75), which will be airing special Macca programming on release week, but also by dedicating channel 120 exclusively to McCartney (with a special emphasis on  Memory Almost Full ) all day on June 5. If, like me, you have XM radio in your car, and if, like me, you have it programmed to notify you anytime Paul McCartney is playing on any channel, then you will have noticed today that your satellite receiver pinged every two or three minutes as every other channel on the dial advertised the upcoming June 5 radio event. It is, indeed, A Happening. And yes, I am taking the day off from work. Anyone want to meet for a cappuccino? 3. Good reading on parenting: A thoughtful reader pointed me toward  this Op/Ed piece  in the LA Times, written by Ralph James Savarese, whose new book  Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism & Adoption  is getting great early reviews. I wanted to read the book anyway; this article makes me want to read it soon. 4. Reality TV: I've  outed myself  on the reality tv thing before, so that in itself is not news. But, I have to say, last week was a one-two punch, as first Joey Fatone lost to Apolo Anton Ohno on  Dancing with the Stars  on Tuesday, and then Blake Lewis fell to Jordin Sparks on Wednesday's  American Idol . Honestly, it took everything I had to muster up the courage to tune into the new season of  So You Think You Can Dance  on Thursday. 5. Good reading on writing: I have had  this post  on writing from Kristen at  From Here to There and Back  saved in my Bloglines account since she posted it two weeks ago. In it, she talks about her journey as a writer and her attempts to walk away from writing, which always result in her return to it. It speaks to me, I'm sure, because I am still mostly  on hiatus  from blogging and, it seems, mostly on hiatus from writing. I keep returning to her post to read a single line - a line that serves as some sort of homing device for me. \"I come back,\" she writes, \"because when I write, I am alive.\" 6. Eating my words: And while I'm writing about writing, I may as well 'fess up to this. Remember last fall when I angsted long and loud about teaching writing to first-year college students? Remember how I vowed that I would never do it again? Well, teaching must be a little like childbirth, because somehow no matter how painful the experience, it tends to have a way to make you want to seek it out again. I'm signed on for Round 2 this fall. 7. Beach weather: Summer has arrived early in our little neck of the woods, and Bud and I have been taking full advantage of it. I've got to say - after a long, cold winter, it really feels like coming home. 8. Harry Potter: I'm re-reading the series in anticipation of the July release of Book 7. I've been pacing myself so that I wouldn't finish too early, but now I've got to kick it into high gear, since it's nearly June and I'm only a few chapters into Book 3. Okay - anyone willing to make a prediction on the record here? Severus Snape: Friend or Foe?

I  mentioned recently  that Bud has been experimenting with \"mean\" words, testing their power and finding their most suitable contexts. But, as a child with autism, he doesn't always retain the  specifics  of a mean idiom or figure of speech. Case in point: Over the past several weeks, Bud's been doing a lot of back-talk when he wants someone to stop speaking. Sometimes it's innocuous: The dog across the street barks, and Bud stands in our driveway and yells \"Shut out, Jenna! SHUT OUT!\" Sometimes it's impertinent: Nana tells him it's time to turn off the computer and he turns to her and says, \"Shut out, Nana. SHUT OUT!\" Sometimes it's just plain rude: The clerk at the supermarket asks him how he is today and he responds with a loud \"Shut out, man! SHUT OUT!\" I'm never sure what to do in these situations. Do I respond the way I would with a neurotypical child to this very developmentally appropriate behavior:  \"Bud, it is not nice to tell people to 'shut out.'  It makes them sad.\" ? Or do I address the autism-related issue here instead:  \"Bud, you want Jenna/Nana/the man to shut UP, not shut OUT. You say, 'Shut up, Jenna/Shut up, Nana/Shut up, man.'\" ?

{"date": "Sunday, August 05, 2007", "body": "\nBud and I took a mini-vacation this week and spent a few days staying at a hotel (Bud's very favorite thing in the world) and taking day-trips to the beach. Much to my surprise, after one thrilling day riding the waves at the  ocean , Bud was ready to return to the tranquility of the lake, so most of our vacation time has been spent at the very same beach where we've spent most sunny days this summer. (Luckily, though, vacation is really just a state of mind.) The other day, Bud brought his four prized Teletubbies figures with him to the lake so that they could enjoy a little R & R as well. The six of us - the four Tubs, Bud, and me - were floating together on a blow-up ring when I heard the unmistakable sound of thunder rumbling in the distance. The two teenage lifeguards stood high in their chairs, blew their whistles, and announced that everyone would need to clear the water for 30 minutes after the sound of thunder. I tried to keep my voice even and calm, unsure of how Bud would react to this unanticipated turn of events. Thunder has been one of the most powerful triggers for Bud's anxiety, yet he had barely reacted this time to the sound of the thunder in the distance. I explained that we needed to leave the water, and Bud suggested that it was time to leave the beach. I agreed and we started to make our way to the shore when Bud stopped in his tracks. Tinky Winky was missing. We started scouring the bottom of the lake in the area where we'd been floating, but the sand was kicking up and clouding the water as people all around us vacated the water. The lifeguards' whistles and shouts became more insistent and I could feel tension filling my body as I tried to lead Bud to shore: \"We need to leave the water, honey. We'll get Tinky Winky later. He won't go anywhere. We'll get him.\" Bud's anxiety kicked in and he started sobbing. \"I need him!\" he wailed. \"PLEASE can you get him, Mama?\" I looked at Bud standing at the water's edge and tried to see the situation from his perspective: His friend - his best friend -  his rock  - was stranded at the bottom of the lake with a thunderstorm -  the scariest event possible  - getting threateningly closer. I looked at Bud's tear-stained face and saw his little body tremble and I scanned the beach trying to come up with a plan. \"The lifeguard,\" I said to Bud. \"We'll ask the lifeguard to help us.\" Bud trailed me as I walked down the beach toward the high lifeguard chair and approached the tall, muscular teenager who was shouting out to people still in the water. I fumbled through an explanation of my problem -  \"My son, his toy, in the lake, he's panicking, it's a Teletubby...\" \"I'll help you find it,\" he said. Bud stood on the shore, his eyes red but his tears gone, as the lifeguard and I walked gently through the area where we'd been floating, our eyes scanning the sandy bottom. The lifeguard multi-tasked - scanning the bottom, blowing his whistle at lingerers, scanning some more, shouting to kids who would not leave the water, scanning again - as I searched and searched, worrying about what I'd do if I couldn't find the toy. I looked up at Bud. \"Did you find him, Mom?\" he shouted, his eyes and voice full of hope. \"Not yet, Bud,\" I said, with renewed determination. I looked over at my teenage counterpart and wanted to explain to him how much this meant, how appreciative I was, and stammered again  \"Thank you so much... don't know what I'd do... autistic... really important to him...\" \"It's no problem,\" he answered. And then, a moment later, he added, \"Take your time. Really. There's no rush.\" My shoulders relaxed and for the first time since I'd heard the rumble of thunder, I exhaled. Then I looked down, and there on the sandy lake bottom was our old friend, Tinky Winky, soaking wet, but safe and unharmed. I reached down, scooped him up, held him over my head and turned back to the shore. \"You did it, Mom!\" Bud shouted. \"You find him!\" I turned to the lifeguard several yard away, still shooing swimmers back to shore, and held up the doll. \"Thank you!\" I yelled, and he waved and went back to work. It's important work they do, those lifeguards. Every day they make decisions that change lives. Sometimes they really come to the rescue. And sometimes - sometimes they get to be heroes.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/08/real-life-saver.html", "title": "\nA real life saver\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 29, 2007", "body": "\nI've been reading lots of wonderful posts lately about Jennifer Elder's new children's book,  Autistic Planet .  Estee  has good things to say; so do  Kyra  and  Gretchen . Here's my take. Autistic Planet  is a picture book geared to children 6-10. In it, a little girl with autism makes a sphere out of clay and tells her friend that she has made \"the planet where I'm from.\"  She goes on to describe what makes her \"planet\" different: People work in offices, where Every seat's a rocking chair We don't do something one time, when... We can do it over and over again! In brief rhyming couplets, the book addresses a full range of issues that are instantly familiar to those familiar with autism: sensory integration, limited food preferences, echolalia, hand flapping. But because these quick references seem to presuppose a familiarity with autism, I found myself wondering about the book's target audience. According to the dust-cover flap, \"this book will be much loved by children, particularly those on the autism spectrum.\" I only have Bud as a point of reference, so I'm not sure how other children on the spectrum would react, but I think that in order for the book to resonate with Bud, he would need to recognize himself in its pages, which would require that he 1) recognize that he does many of the things in the book (uses echolalia, flaps his hands when he's excited, etc.), and 2) recognize that most of his peers do not do these things. I may be wrong - I could  certainly  be wrong - but I don't think it has occurred to Bud that either is the case. I imagine that this level of self-reflection, self-assessment, and comparison with others is in Bud's developmental future somewhere, and that  Autistic Planet  could provide some of the fuel to get that process in motion - but I'm just not sure that Bud needs me to hurry him along to try to get him there. But, then, I also imagine that by the time he gets there on his own he may consider himself \"too old\" for rhyming picture books like  Autistic Planet . I thought, too, about Bud's neurotypical peers, and about whether or not this book could help them understand Bud a little better. I think that it could, if it were used well - but  only  if it were used well. Those of us who understand the many ways that autism manifests can quickly recognize that  \"And at the end of every day, we flap our hands and fly away\"  is a sweet reference to self-stimulatory behavior. But I don't think that  Bud's friend Kelly , who is familiar with  Bud , but not familiar with  autism  per se, would be able to make much sense of it on her own. On the other hand, I think it would provide a great jumping-off point for a conversation guided by a knowledgeable teacher or parent who wanted to help her understand, and who could fill in the blanks to help her to make meaning of it. Ultimately, I think that's my overall assessment of  Autistic Planet : it is a rich tool and a wonderful conversation-starter that could be helpful for children both on and off the spectrum.

But for it to be most effective - for its warmth, humor and philosophy to  really  make a difference - it should not be a book that sits on the bookshelf in hopes of being stumbled upon; instead, it's a book that begs to be used intentionally, to be built into a curriculum, and to be presented thoughtfully, in the right way and at the right time, by older, more experienced guides.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.jkp.com/catalogue/book.php/isbn/9781843108429", "http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/2007/07/autistic-planet.html", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/07/autistic-planet.html", "http://gretsblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/what-i-did-on-my-summer-vacation.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/07/autistic-planet.html", "title": "\nAutistic Planet\n"},

I mean \"old,\" as in it may actually have been manufactured while Baby Jesus was still laying in the manger. That kind of old.

{"date": "Sunday, December 23, 2007", "body": "\nBud and I were invited to a Solstice Party on Friday night. It was a kid-friendly party, for which people were invited to wear yellow and orange and bring summery snacks and juices. The main activity of the evening centered around an outdoor bonfire on the snowy ground, with voices raised together to call back the sun. I told Bud about the party on Thursday and gave him full control over the decision of whether or not to attend. He didn't even pause before he answered: he wanted to go. The Solstice Party was all he talked about for the next 24 hours, and he was so upbeat about it that I think he only half-listened when I told him what to expect. As we drove toward the house on Friday night, though, Bud began to have second thoughts. \"I'll just wait in the car,\" Bud announced as we neared the driveway. \"No, I'd like to go in and see everyone,\" I said. \"I'll wait for you, Mama,\" he said. \"In the car.\" \"Let's just give it a try, Bud,\" I said. \"If you don't like it, we can go home.\" \"I don't like it,\" he said. But he climbed out of the car and walked with me to the door and seemed willing to give it all a chance. As soon as the door opened, I wondered what I'd been thinking. Let me paint the picture for you: This was the first time Bud had been out of the house since  his surgery . It was his regular bedtime. There were not many people in attendance, but most of them were strangers to us. The place was swarming with  cousins . They were the sort of cousins that are old enough to walk, so while there were actually only four in attendance, it felt more like there were sixteen of them. As we arrived, one of the cousins was crying. Loudly. We'd accidentally left  Bud's iPod  at home. There were two older children there as well. They were crawling on the floor, barking and pretending to be  dogs . There were two real-life cats darting through the crowd. Bud turned to me immediately and said, \"I don't think so, Mom.\" I guided him into the house, hoping that in a few minutes we'd all settle in a bit. I tried to direct Bud to the cookies, to the toys, to the people he knew. I put my hands over his ears. I let him crawl into my lap. And I prepared myself for the meltdown. The meltdown never came, but Bud never settled in. He tried, but there was just too much, too many, too late, too far. He gave it 25 minutes and half a cookie, then came to me and said with authority, \"It's time to go.\" I got our coats and boots and we said our goodbyes as the other guests started eating their first snacks and waited for the party to get underway. Our friends, the hosts, rolled with it beautifully as if this had been the plan all along. I wondered briefly what their friends, the strangers, thought, then decided that people who go to Solstice Parties are probably predisposed to roll with this sort of thing as well. As Bud and I crunched through the snow back to our car, he said brightly, \"That was a great party!\" \"It  was  a great party,\" I said. \"Do you think you'd like to come back another time?\" \"Yes,\" he said. We drove home and got ready for bed, and Bud was asleep before our friends started calling back the sun. The next morning, I woke to Bud's voice in my ear, asking, \"Did you have fun at the party, Mama?\" \"I sure did, Bud. Did you have fun at the party?\" \"I had fun,\" he answered. \"That was a great party.\" As I lay in bed and thought about the way Bud managed the party and framed his memory of it, the lyrics of Sheryl Crow's \" Soak up the Sun \" filled my head: \"It's not having what you want, I t's wanting what you've got. I'm gonna soak up the sun.\" He's amazing, that boy. He gives me new perspective every day. It's wanting what you've got. I'm gonna soak up my son.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://video.music.yahoo.com/up/music/music/?rn=1301797&vid=2154781&stationId=&curl=http%3A%2F%2Fsearch.music.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fm%3Dall%26p%3Dsoak%2Bup%2Bthe%2Bsun"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/12/soak-up-sun.html", "title": "\nSoak up the sun\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, May 16, 2007", "body": "\n Neil from  At My Table  has nominated me for a  Thinking Blogger Award . Neil lives in Melbourne, Australia, and is the father of M, a seven-year-old girl who has autism. If you're not familiar with Neil's blog, I encourage you to check it out - but here's a warning: visit on a full stomach. Neil is a chef and his blog is mostly about food, complete with tantalizing descriptions and photographs that (quite literally) make my mouth water. Neil occasionally comments here and I occasionally comment on At My Table, but unfortunately I can't point you toward our best exchanges: They have all happened on e-mail. Neil tends to start the conversations. He reads something I've posted, then sends an e-mail that starts with \"I see what you mean, but I'm wondering if you've thought about...\" or \"I think this other thing is also true...\" or \"Have you ever wondered...\", and a terrific dialogue ensues. Though Neil and I come from similar philosophical perspectives, he is still able to challenge my thinking and help me to articulate not just  what  I believe, but also  why  I believe it. In short, a Thinking Blogger Award from Neil is high praise, indeed. The official rules for participation in the Thinking Blogger Awards meme are as follows: 1. If, and only if, you get tagged, write a post with links to 5 blogs that make you think, 2. Link to  this post  so that people can easily find the exact origin of the meme, 3. Optional: Proudly display the 'Thinking Blogger Award' with a link to the post that you wrote. So now it's my turn to name five bloggers who make me think. For this round, I am naming writers who, like Neil, have challenged my thinking both on-blog and off. Here are my picks: 1.  Kristina Chew from AutismVox : Kristina was one of my earliest blogging friends. I was in awe of her ability to post lengthy daily updates when she chronicled life with her son Charlie at  Autismland , but I am completely blown away by the sheer volume of information and opinion she posts at AutismVox. Her blog has become my one-stop-shopping source for all things autism. Beyond the blog, though, Kristina has been an invaluable resource for insight, perspective, and support. Though I have never met her face-to-face, I have spent a lot of time over the past few years talking with her heart-to-heart. 2.  Kevin Leitch from Left Brain/Right Brain : When I was new to blogging and new to the concept of neurodiversity, Kevin scared the daylights out of me. Kev doesn't mince words. Ever. He says what he thinks, and he says it loudly and boldly for all the world to hear. As a result, he is something of a lightning rod for those who disagree with his perspectives and his blog tends to be just  the sort of blog that mine is not . That's the blogging Kev. And then there's the other behind-the-scenes Kev (sorry if I'm outing you here, buddy). That Kev - the Kev of e-mail, the Kev behind  Autism Hub  and the  Autism Parents Forum  - that Kev knows the importance of connection and support and friendship. That Kev spent a whole afternoon on a trans-Atlantic assist, helping me to realize a last-minute idea I had for a Christmas present for Bud. And that is the Kev who makes me think most, and whom I have come to consider a friend. 3.  MothersVox from Autism's Edges : MothersVox is a thinker who makes my head spin and a writer whose words stop me short again and again and again. She is also one of the few bloggers I \"know\" whose need for privacy rivals my own, which goes a long way in making me feel settled with the issue: If this tremendous thinker shares it, can it really be that bad?  And that we have been able to get more \"real\" behind the scenes is simply an added treat. 4.  Kyra from This Mom : Here's the thing about Kyra: whatever she's selling, I'm buying. Kyra writes with a passion that pulls me in every single time. Whether she's writing about  tweezers  or  herbal supplements  or  autism remediation , when I finish reading her words I am ready to sign on the dotted line:  Yes! Me, too! I'll have what she's having!  Kyra's highs soar, her lows crash, and she is real, real, real. She is just the sort of blogger friend I need in my life, and I feel very lucky to know she only a click away. 5.  Kristen from From Here to There and Back : Kristen is one of my newest blogging friends. Our conversations began on e-mail and I like to think that she is blogging today because I badgered her into. You can thank me later. And believe me, you  will  thank me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://tankeduptaco.blogspot.com/", "http://tankeduptaco.blogspot.com/2007/05/thinking-blogger-award.html", "http://www.thethinkingblog.com/2007/02/thinking-blogger-awards_11.html", "http://www.autismvox.com/", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/index.php", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/", "http://www.autism-forum.co.uk/", "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/", "http://www.thismom.com/", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2005/10/everything_i_kn.html", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/06/5htp.html", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/11/ppp_day_7_getti.html", "http://fromherethereandback.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/05/i-was-just-thinking.html", "title": "\nI was just thinking\n"},

I finally settled on a single, consistent response to Bud's  pleas that I not leave him at school : a matter-of-fact \"I will leave you every day, Bud, and I'll see you again every night.\" Bud's teachers and I finally established a workable drop-off routine: a meeting with Bud's aide at a side door with low traffic and a small audience, and a quick drop, kiss, and exit strategy for me. I've stuck to the script and we've stayed with the plan for weeks, and for weeks we moved two steps forward and one step back as, week after week, Bud started settling into a routine, only to have it disrupted by a sudden delayed opening or day off in the snowiest winter I've seen in my life. But this week, the weather was with us and Bud's health held up and for five days in a row, Bud had an established, predictable morning routine. And by Friday, Bud finally -  finally  - had a tear-free morning at home, a tear-free ride to school, a tear-free drop-off, and a tear-free day at school. His teacher sent me a note that actually called it a \"good day\" in which he was \"more available as a learner.\" And, don't get me wrong - \"good\" is good; \"good\" is  delightful  - but I'm not quite ready to bank on \"good.\" For now I'll take tear-free. It's snowing again today. Because it's Saturday, today's snow doesn't disrupt our routine, but as I watch it pile up outside my window I'm reminded that it  could  have. Had this snowfall come 24 hours earlier, had it come 48 hours later, we'd be facing a delayed opening or yet another snow day. We'd be facing a tear-filled ride, a tear-filled drop-off, a tear-filled morning at school - perhaps several of them, until we settled back into a routine. Next week's forecast calls for fair weather, so I'm spending the morning today staring out the window and willing the snow to fall, willing the clouds to empty, calling upon the universe to let this be winter's last hurrah, to bring on the frost heaves and pot holes and thick tire-trapping mud of spring.

{"date": "Saturday, April 05, 2008", "body": "\nI've been reading on the blogs that it's Autism Awareness Month. Actually, that's a lie. I haven't done much \"reading\" at all. I've learned that it's Autism Awareness Month by reading blog titles and scanning blog copy, because honestly, I haven't felt like I could handle any more autism awareness lately. Around here, it's felt like autism awareness year. And the truth is that this year, for the first time, I have often felt  painfully  aware of autism. It's been a year of struggle, of challenge, of two steps forward/one step back, of one step forward/two steps back. A year of stumbles, of trials, of risks, of unknowing. So, in the same way that last summer felt like the right time for  inactivism , this month has felt like the right time for unawareness. And so, no, I haven't watched  Autism: The Musical . I didn't see any of what was on  CNN . I haven't taped, I haven't read, I haven't looked, I haven't heard. Despite that, though, I accepted an invitation to be a guest speaker in a Child Psychology class at the college this week. The professor asked me to speak a little about parenting a child with special needs, and then to take questions from the class. I decided not to do much preparation. I am, at my core, an educator, and I decided that if these students were  really  going to learn about my parenting experience, then they needed to have the unedited story - not pre-packaged, not beautifully wrapped, just open, honest Q & A. I had a few notes with me, but mostly, I just brought along my courage. I arrived at the classroom after most of the students were there, and as they settled in I looked around for familiar faces. There were a few students I've taught before, a few I knew from other arenas of my work at the college, and a lot whose faces looked familiar, but whose names I didn't know. There wasn't anyone with whom I'd ever had a conversation about Bud. I started the presentation with an invitation: \"I want this to be helpful to you,\" I said. \"I want to answer the questions you have, whatever they are. So, I want you to know this: I am not easily offended. I understand that some of your questions might touch on sensitive areas and you might be worried about phrasing them the wrong way. Please, ask the questions you have with the words you can think of, and trust me that it will be okay.\" And they did. I gave a fairly brief introduction, walked them through Bud's early development and diagnosis, his education and intervention, and the current state of the state. Then I opened the floor to questions, and hands flew up all around the room: What were my thoughts about inclusion? Had I ever looked into the gluten-free diet? Could I tell them more about Bud's anxiety related to thunderstorms and what those episodes were like? Did his anxiety spill over into any other areas? What were my hopes and fears for Bud's future? Had I planned on having other children, was Bud's autism a deciding factor in not having them, and did I have any sadness or regret related to that? What has been the most difficult part of Bud's school experience? Did Bud's use of echolalia make me nervous about exposing him to age-appropriate media? What did I do to try to get Bud engaged with peers? How did I make decisions about medication? How did I deal with Bud's acute sleeplessness? How did I maintain my sanity? And more, more, more. I gave it to them straight and unedited, completely unsure about how they'd react. As I talked, I watched their faces - interested, engaged, encouraging me to give them more, to expand, to dig deeper. I watched for looks of horror when I described the hard times, but I saw none. I saw some flashes of sympathy. I saw some looks of recognition. And mostly, I saw the expressions on their faces soften and change, as one by one, person by person, they listened to my stories and fell in love with my son. None of it was white-washed; they got the unadulterated truth. But they were able to hear it all and zero in on the part that mattered: the part that told them that in parenting Bud, I get more than I give; the part that told them how lucky I am to be this child's mom. When I left the classroom, I was positively buoyant. When I'm slogging through the day-to-day, especially when I'm slogging through the  hard  day-to-day, it can be easy to lose perspective. I am always aware of the good that's there, of course, but I start to lose sight of the ratio - I can't quite tell if in the bigger picture, the bad has somehow started outweighing the good. I start losing track of which things are universal and which are situational, which are the norm and which the exception, which the foundation and which the one-off. But somehow, through 75 minutes with a room full of eighteen to twenty-two-year-olds, the clarity was restored and I exited the classroom with something I didn't have when I entered: awareness. Autism awareness? Maybe. Self awareness, for sure. Life awareness, I think. Whatever it is, it's good. It's making me take deeper breaths. It's making me believe that spring is actually coming - metaphorically and literally. I'm still not ready to break out the next round of autism memoirs or check to see if TiVo has been taping any good documentaries. I'll still be skimming the \"Autism Awareness Month\" posts for a while. But I've rounded a corner. I've turned a page. And I think good things are coming. Stay tuned.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://blogs.parentcenter.babycenter.com/momformation/2008/03/18/hey-kids-lets-put-on-a-show/", "http://pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/04/on-becoming-aware.html", "title": "\nOn becoming aware\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 23, 2008", "body": "\nIn a  recent post , I said that I thought the seasons were changing. I said I thought we were turning a corner. Now I'll say this: it's lovely around this bend. The sun is out, literally and figuratively. It has been warm and mostly sunny for more than a week. Spirits across campus have lifted immeasurably as students have ended the hunkering down of the snowiest winter since 1874, swarming the quad in shorts and halter tops and flip flops, playing wiffle ball and studying in the sun on patches of greening grass twenty feet away from still-melting snowbanks. Which reminds me - VTBudFan  asked for an update  and wondered how her April 18 guess had fared in  Ice Out 2008 . Had we been focusing on the backyard only, she would probably not have been that far off, as this is what it looked like at the start of this week: The front yard, however, still looks like this: Honestly, though, I can hardly even see the snow in my yard with all the sun in my eyes. But it's not just the blue skies, warm weather, and campus festivities that have me celebrating this seasonal shift. It is the change in my son that has accompanied the change in the weather. Is there a direct causal relationship between the weather and the behavior? I don't know. It might be that we have finally found the right balance in medication. It might be that the strategies and routine we've implemented in school are finally paying off. It might be that the  upheaval  we experienced in our family is now a full year old and Bud has been able to readjust and settle in. I don't know what has caused it; I only know that it's glorious. Bud and I spent last weekend hanging out together. We ran errands, we raked leaves, we had a pizza picnic, we went to the playground, we visited the library, we took a walk, we worked at my office, and we ate brunch in the college's dining room. We had fun together. All weekend. There were moments of disagreement and flashes of tension, but that's all they were: moments and flashes. The weekend was even, and happy, and stress-free. Bud sang a lot. We laughed together. We hugged and high-fived and held hands. Saturday and Sunday were like the Mom and Bud Days of old. I spent all weekend smiling and thinking \"he's back!,\" wondering if behind his own smile, Bud was thinking \"she's back!\" And the mood has continued this week, even though our schedule has been disrupted because I had to work two consecutive late nights. Bud was home with his grandparents, happy, cheerful, and charming, and he called me at work each evening to sing me a song and say goodnight. Tonight, I was home again and we slid back into our regular routine seamlessly - no bargaining, no retribution, no payback. Just an enthusiastic welcome with wide-open arms and a big toothy eight-year-old grin. It's the start of a new season. We're back. And we're better than ever.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/04/turn-turn-turn.html", "title": "\nTurn, turn, turn\n"},

I couldn't make out any of the words, but I recognized the rise and fall of the speech. \"I think it's Barack Obama,\" I said, wondering how to explain who Barack Obama is. \"Barack Obama is singing?\" Bud asked. \"No, Barack Obama is talking,\" I answered.

{"date": "Friday, March 28, 2008", "body": "\nI have to admit that I don't always keep up with the latest in autism research, because it exhausts me to think that much of the headline-grabbing research probably leads people to believe that Bud's autism is the result of my  bad judgment ,  bad parenting , or  bad timing  or the cause of the  bad experiences  in my life. I've had enough with the bad stuff, because - as you know - there is  so much good stuff  to focus on in my life with Bud. That's why I'm delighted to shine a little spotlight on a new study that's currently underway. Teresa Ulman is a doctoral student in clinical psychology at Vanderbilt University, and she is also the older sister of a young man with autism. She wrote to me recently to tell me about her dissertation: My dissertation study seeks to learn more about the positive growth in mothers and fathers of a child with a developmental disability. Having lived in a family with autism, I was struck by how the family research almost exclusively focused on all the horrible, terrible outcomes for families once a child with autism was introduced into the mix. My little project is hopefully a step forward in breaking the myth that a family touched by autism and other developmental disabilities is all doom and gloom. I was intrigued and I followed the link to Teresa's survey, but was disappointed to learn that I was not able to participate because, for research reasons, she has had to limit the scope of participation. But I  am  happy to do my part to help by passing the information on to the rest of you, as I know that many of you will have valuable thoughts to share. In order to participate in the survey, you must be a parent of a child or adult between the ages of 8 and 25 with a diagnosis of one (and only one) of the following: Angelman syndrome, autism (not PDD-NOS or Asperger\u2019s syndrome), Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, or Williams syndrome. (Because Bud's diagnosis is PDD-NOS, we were out of the running.)

{"date": "Sunday, June 15, 2008", "body": "\nChildren's author  David Elliott  creates characters who are much like the author himself: full of humor, full of heart, and just the tiniest bit subversive. I know this for two reasons: first, because David is a friend of mine, and second, because I never miss an opportunity to fall in love with one of the characters he's created. My love affair started with Roscoe Wizzle, the boy who took on corporate greed and corruption when he discovered that fast food was turning him into a bug in  The Transmogrification of Roscoe Wizzle . Then it was Evangeline Mudd, the intrepid daughter of primatologists, who taught me the word \"brachiate\" (now one of my favorite words - you'd be amazed how often it comes in handy) in  Evangeline Mudd and the Golden-Haired Apes of the Ikkinasti Jungle . And now there's Jeremy Cabbage. Jeremy is the hero of  Jeremy Cabbage and the Living Museum of Human Oddballs and Quadruped Delights . When we meet him, he is an orphan living at Harpwich's Home for Mean Dogs, Ugly Cats, and Strey Children, a joyless institution in a joyless city - the Metropolis, under the miserly rule of Baron Ignatius Fyodor von Strompie III, whose own sunny and luxurious home at Helios stands in stark contrast to the dilapidated and colorless world beyond its gates. As we get to know the Baron, we discover that the conditions in the Metropolis have developed less because he is purely evil, and more because he is short-sighted and focused solely on his own self-interest - which makes his style of leadership seem all too familiar in the modern day and makes the plight of the citizens of the Metropolis hit just a bit too close to home. Through their response, Jeremy and his friends - which include a sapient pig, a wuman cannonball, and a couple tattooed with every word in the English language - remind us about the danger of passivity, the insidious nature of intolerance, the power of community, and the responsibility we have to choose to do what is  right  over what is  safe . There's another theme in  Jeremy Cabbage  that also hits close to my heart. It explores how we, as parents, hold dreams and expectations for our children when they are born, but sometimes discover as our children grow and develop that our real-life children are very different from the children of our imagination (does this sound familiar to anyone else?)  Jeremy  reminds us that our mission as parents is to love our children not  in spite of  who they are, but  because of  who they are. As one character explains, when asked why he'd want to adopt a waif like Jeremy, \"Why does anyone want a child? To love, of course.\" To love, indeed. You'll be hearing a lot more about  Jeremy Cabbage  in the future; the movie rights were optioned by Fox 2000 long before the book was published. But don't wait to be introduced to Jeremy and his friends on the big screen.

{"date": "Saturday, June 28, 2008", "body": "\nYou know how sometimes you're just in the right place at the right time? I had a lot of that this week. First I discovered that my vacation schedule was coordinating well with the work schedules of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, making it possible for me to join them at their  historic unity rally  in the tiny, rural town of Unity, New Hampshire. Then I discovered that friends of mine were equally available and equally up for the adventure. We spent an extraordinary amount of time simply getting to the event. No cars were allowed in town, so like everyone else who attended, we drove to a ski area, stood in a long line to board a school bus, then rode, rode, rode across the back roads of New Hampshire to reach the tiny elementary school that was hosting the rally. When we arrived, we discovered that most of the other 4,000 people in attendance were already there. My friends and I hiked about a third of a mile to find the end of the line of people waiting to walk through the metal detectors to enter the field. We'd been in line a short time, chatting and soaking up the atmosphere, when a woman with a hand full of wristbands sidled up to me and said in a low voice, \"Are the three of you together?\" I couldn't imagine where this was going, but I told her that we were. \"Would you be interested in sitting on the bleachers behind the podium where Barack and Hillary will be?\" she asked. \"Yes, we would,\" I answered, as I turned to my friends in disbelief. She handed us red wristbands, then we joined a small party of other folks she'd pulled out of line as she marched us past the throngs of people waiting to enter and up to an entrance for special guests. We entered at the same time as Carol Shea-Porter, Congresswoman from New Hampshire. We continued on with our little group of wristband-wearers and travelled through a maze of barricades and bouncers, until we reached the front of the field - a small bleacher section set up directly behind the stage and directly in line with a bank of news cameras. The pied piper of wristbands passed us off to another campaign worker, who looked the three of us over, sized us up on I-don't-know-what criteria, then said definitively, \"Okay, this row - first you, then you, and then you on the end.\" I was the \"you\" on the end. It was surreal. More campaign workers came out, handing us signs, working up the energy, and reminding us that we were the \"face of the campaign.\" The energy built to fever pitch when Barack and Hillary took the stage, and we spent the better part of an hour applauding and hooting and chanting and holding up signs and - mostly - continuing to marvel at our outrageous good fortune. When Barack and Hillary left the stage to work the crowd, we left the bleachers and made our way down to the field, with very little thought that we'd actually make contact. But - since that's just how our luck was running - we did, and now I can say that I shook the hand of Barack Obama, the next President of the United States. Then it was over and there were 4,000 of us waiting to climb back onto school busses to make our way back to our cars. We decided to take our time and not fight the crowds, so we wandered back through the maze of barricades to try to find one of those hamburgers we'd heard the Kiwanis Club of Unity was selling. On our way, a woman with a video camera stopped us. \"Could I ask you a few questions?\" she asked. Well, of course she did. It was that kind of day. She interviewed both of my friends, who were characteristically thoughtful and articulate - the kind of interviewees the camera loves. As she said goodbye we asked who she was with, knowing that she could easily be there representing the local cable access channel. Not so. Her response: \"Associated Press.\" Natch. By this point we were downright giddy. We ate our burgers and talked about whether or not we would ever again wash our Obama-shaken hands and watched as slowly, slowly, slowly the crowd thinned as the campaign staffers loaded school busses and sent them off to their lots - a round trip that meant it would be an hour before each bus would return to reload. We were among the last hundred or so to board the busses - which we did, not in ordinary rain, but in a downpour of epic proportion (so much for never washing our hands again...). I spent the evening surfing the web and looking at footage from the event -  \"Bud, look! There's Barack, and Hillary, and Mom!\"; \"Hey! Hillary and I are making the same face in this picture!\"; \"Why am I the only person in the crowd who is acting like she's at a rock concert?\"  MSNBC, ABC, CBS - I was everywhere. It seems that the campaign staffer did me a big favor by insisting I be the person sitting on the end. I was in direct line with the cameras, unlike my friends who were visible when the cameras panned the crowd, but were cut out when they zoomed in on the candidates. I felt bad for a minute - felt like the bad spotlight-hogging friend. Then I remembered the Associated Press. Yes. My friends are in syndication - close up, larger-than-life, and articulate as ever. Our fifteen minutes of fame has already lasted an hour and a half. And the rally itself? Outstanding. Inspiring. Invigorating. Motivating. Unity. Hope. Change. Fired up. Ready to go. Yes we can. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/O/OBAMA_CLINTON?SITE=MAFAL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2008/06/unity-or-what-i-did-on-my-summer.html", "title": "\nUnity, or: What I did on my summer vacation\n"},

If I am hit by a bus this afternoon, my vote will still be counted. As I drove through the quiet streets of my small town, with the sun glaring through my windows on this unseasonably warm day, U2's \"Beautiful Day\" started playing on my iPod.

I realized how tense I have been for weeks - for months - for years - about the state of our country, the state of the world, and what it all means for Bud's future.

Then we went upstairs so he could brush his teeth and go through the final stages of his bedtime routine. As we were headed to his room, he realized that he'd left his beloved Between the Lions stuffed toys (a Christmas present from Nana and Papa, with a lot of help from ebay) in the kitchen, and he dashed downstairs to get them. As we snuggled together in his bed and I opened up to the first page of  Curious George Makes Pancakes,  I realized he was chewing something. \"Bud, do you have gum?\" I asked. \"No,\" he replied. \"What's in your mouth?\" I asked. \"Nuffing,\" he slurred, his mouth too full to give a clear response. \"Bud,\" I said more sternly. \"What is in your mouth?\" \"Grapes,\" he said. Thinking he must have had one left from his bedtime snack, I shrugged and turned back to the book, as in my peripheral vision I saw him pop another grape into his mouth. \"Bud, did you help yourself to more grapes?\" I asked. \"No,\" he replied. \"Nothing.\" \"Where did you get the grapes?\" \"You gived me some for a bedtime snack.\" \"Do you have more grapes?\" I asked. He held up his hand, bursting with grapes, and looked at me as he shook the fruits he held. \"You gived me some of these.\" \"Bud, you ate the ones I gave you and then you helped yourself to more.\" \"What,\" he said, more a statement  (\"I don't see your point\")  than a question  (\"Could you repeat that?\") . \"You ate the grapes I gave you. And then you what?\" \"I helped myself to more?\" \"Yes, you did.\" \"Silly boy!\" \"No, Bud....\" \"You're serious?\" \"Yes, I'm serious. It's not okay to help yourself to food. You have to ask first.\" \"Please, Mom?\" \"Well, Bud, it's too late now.\" \"I already did that?\" \"Yes, you already did that.\" \"And now you're mad at me? I'm time out?\" \"No, I'm not mad. But you have to ask before you take food.\" \"Please can I have grapes, Mom?\" And since we were already this far into the bedtime routine, and since he was already getting groggy from his nighttime medication, and since I couldn't think of any less convoluted way to explain the in-the-future-first-ask-then-take lesson I was trying to teach, and since  it was a handful of grapes for heaven's sake , I simply sighed and said \"Yes, Bud, you can have the grapes,\" and he munched happily as we read the story together (me reading the narrative, him reading - no, him  performing  - all the dialogue). When we were done, I kissed him and turned out the light, and started thinking about the amazing exchange that had just taken place. This is  not Bud's first foray into lying  - that not-typically-autistic behavior that requires you to adopt another person's perspective, anticipate their reaction, and modify your own response to try to elicit a different reaction, all in a fraction of a second. But there was a level of sophistication to this falsehood that was particularly impressive. Bud knew that he wasn't supposed to help himself to another snack, and he knew that I wouldn't be happy about it. He wanted to worm his way out of trouble, so he looked for the most plausible explanation he could imagine:  I am still eating the grapes you gave me earlier . But he knew that a statement like that would be a blatant lie that, if discovered, might lead to even greater trouble. So, instead of lying, Bud thoughtfully, artfully, cunningly - and  simply  - tried to mislead me. \"You gived me some for a bedtime snack,\"  he said. And he's right: I did give him some. I didn't give him those  exact  ones, but I'd given him some very much like them. He wasn't really  lying , but he was trying to set me on a path on which I would - all on my own, and through no fault of his - arrive at an incorrect conclusion that just so happened to exonerate him. When he saw that his plan was faltering - that I might not be taking the bait - he tried to kick it up a notch with a subtle but effective nonverbal cue. He reiterated his original (truthful) statement, \"You gived me some of these\" - while simultaneously holding up and shaking the grapes in his hands. He  said  the words \"some of these,\" but his action - his nonverbal communication - the shaking of the grapes - was designed to make me  hear  the words \"these grapes right here.\" And he even shot me a flash of meaningful eye contact just to drive the point home. So it didn't work - so I saw right through the deception. It was still masterful. And let's face it: in the end, he still got to eat the grapes.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/01/grape-escape.html", "title": "\nThe grape escape\n"},

I figured that I write so much here about Bud, it was only fair to give him a chance to turn the tables. Bud's responses are in quotes. My comments are in parentheses. 1. What is something mom always says to you? \u201cMorning, Buddy.\u201d 2. What makes mom happy? \u201cHugging makes you happy.\u201d 3. What makes mom sad? \u201cCause when you cut your thumb.\u201d 4. How does your mom make you laugh? \u201cWhen I\u2019m a clown.\u201d 5. What was your mom like as a child? \u201cYou\u2019re a girl. You have lots of toys cause you play with them.\u201d 6. How old is your mom? (This response takes a little explanation. Relative age is a concept that escapes Bud, so he had no idea how to answer. His first response was \"Four years old.\" When I confirmed by asking \"Four years old?,\" he quickly recanted: \"No! One years old.\" Again, I asked \"One years old?\" and he replied, \"No! Three years old.\" Then he fell into a  mitigated echolalic script  from Yo Gabba Gabba, which he insisted I type out in it's entirety. When it was finished, he asked \"How old are you?\" and I said, \"Forty-two.\" So he made me change \"Three-years old\" to \"Forty-two years old\" at the beginning of his script. The final result is printed here.) \u201cForty-two years old. I remember that you had a cupcake and it had one candle in it, cause you were one years old. I remember you had a bowl of spaghetti with two candles and you remember that your dad was there and that he let you blow the candles cause you were two years old. I remember when Nana was there cause she gave you a toy truck and remember when Papa was there cause he gave you a rubber snake. When you had a bowl of ice cream it had only three candles in it cause you were three years old.\u201d 7. How tall is your mom? \u201cBigger.\u201d 8. What is her favorite thing to do? \u201cHave a meeting.\u201d 9. What does your mom do when you're not around? \u201cBe alone.\u201d 10. If your mom becomes famous, what will it be for? \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d 11. What is your mom really good at? \u201cWriting the names of your friends on the pizza box.\u201d (This is not actually something I spend a lot of time doing, but had done it that afternoon after we delivered a truckload of Little Caesar\u2019s make-your-own-pizza kits to my office as part of a school fundraiser. Apparently, I did it very well.) 12. What is your mom not very good at? \u201cSwimming.\u201d (In my own defense, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that bad.) 13. What does your mom do for her job? \u201cWork at her desk.\u201d 14. What is your mom's favorite food? \u201cEnglish muffins.\u201d 15. What makes you proud of your mom? \u201cWhen the audience cheers for you.\u201d (Happens all the time\u2026) 16. If your mom were a character in a book, who would she be? \u201cLike, a firefighter.\u201d 17. What do you and your mom do together? \u201cWe be teamwork.\u201d 18. How are you and your mom the same? \u201cWe have two arms and one mouth.\u201d 19. How are you and your mom different? \u201cOur shirts.\u201d 20. How do you know your mom loves you? \u201cCause she always hugs.\u201d 21.

{"date": "Sunday, February 01, 2009", "body": "\nBud's in a good school district, which means that the children have always been expected to do a lot of writing. Because Bud struggles with fine motor skills, he often dictates his compositions to an aide, who either writes or types his words for him. In the early grades, Bud used these exercises as an opportunity to script and he would often come home with pages and pages of dutifully transcribed episodes of Teletubbies, Sesame Street or Blues Clues. As Bud got older and his echolalia became more sophisticated, he began mitigating scripts in his writing, swapping out details from the scripts with details from his life, so that the writing appeared to be original, but really wasn't. He got so good at it, in fact, that at this year's parent/teacher conference, his teacher proudly showed me a story he'd written about a trip that he and I had taken to a farm. Of course, we hadn't taken a trip to a farm. I recognized the framework of the essay as a direct lift from Elmo's World.  Some of the essays I saw at this year's parent/teacher conference, though, were not scripted. They were Bud's genuine attempts to tell a story - but they were not always true stories. They typically started with a germ of truth - he'd start with an event that had actually happened - but then he'd veer off into a story he seemed to find more interesting.  Sometimes - I'm guessing when he'd had enough of the exercise - he defaulted to a script as the essay reached its end. Last week, a stack of papers from last semester came home in Bud's backpack, and among them I found this essay: I Went For A Ride With Mom My mom and I went for a ride to return spoons that we used for a party.  So we went to Kiki's cottage which is on Placid Lake, and we returned the spoons.  Then we had to go to the gas station and fill up the tank. On the way I listen to music on my ipod.  My favorite singer is Dierks Bentley.  He sings country music.  Then we headed back home, but on the way mom hit a big mud puddle and the windows got all muddy. I like to go for rides with mom in her car.  I get all excited when mom says, \"Lets go for a ride.\"  I think mom's car looks like a red apple.  I love to look out the windows and watch the other cars go by. I was completely blown away. The essay is well-written.  It's well-organized.  The language is sophisticated.  And the story is told  exactly as it happened .  It's not a story his teacher would have known, so she could not have prompted him.  It's got to be all Bud's. I've re-read the essay a hundred times, and I'm still not sure which part of me is prouder: the writing instructor or the mom.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/02/bud-blogger-in-training.html", "title": "\nBud, blogger in training\n"},

But I'm still scratching my head over what happened a couple of mornings ago. Bud crept into my room in the pre-dawn hours, as he often does, for his last few hours of sleep. I woke, saw him sleeping soundly, then fell back into a deep sleep and started dreaming. I was sitting in the passenger's seat of a friend's minivan. The van was crammed full of furniture, and my friend had the back open and was trying to fit more furniture in. Just then, the van started rolling and I realized that it wasn't in park. I reached over to try to shift, but discovered that the minivan had a manual transmission, and I didn't know how to work it. The space between my seat and the driver's seat was so full that I couldn't climb over to step on the brake. The van picked up speed and was careening out of control, and I knew that it was about to crash when - I woke up. At precisely the same moment, Bud leapt out of bed, bolted to the top of the stairs, and shouted, \"Are you okay, Nana?\" We both listened to the silence that told me that everyone else in the house was still asleep. Bud walked back into the room and said calmly, \"Papa must have dropped something.\" There are probably a lot of reasonable explanations here that don't involve mind-reading. But I have to tell you, there's only one explanation that makes sense to me: Bud was awoken by the sound of the crash in my dream.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/06/super-connectivity.html", "title": "\nSuper connectivity\n"},

Bud zeroed in on a profession that capitalizes on his passion (Teletubbies), his talents (an ear for dialect, an uncanny memory, the ability to mimic virtually anything), and his natural inclinations (the soul of a performer, who sometimes needs to be out of the spotlight).

In other words... no real indication of how Bud had done this quarter. Luckily,  Bud's teacher  is not the type to settle for such an uninformative report and, as she has done every quarter, she attached a narrative to the standard report, summing up Bud's challenges and achievements this year. She wrote: Bud has grown both socially and academically this year. Walking through the isolated hallways during movement breaks has given us an opportunity to uncover Bud the conversationalist. He makes total eye contact and is fully engaged in the conversation that is topic appropriate. Bud has developed a circle of school friends with whom he participates in short conversations. The most successful setting for this is small groups such as reading group, lunchtime, and recess. He also shares his humor, poetry, and singing with the class. One sharing time, he sang the entire song \"Sideways\" with a pretend microphone, and yesterday in PE, he sang the entire song with a real microphone to his classmates and they all clapped. Bud endears himself to his peers. Transitions continue to be very difficult for Bud, yet we see him recovering a lot quicker than last year. At times working with Bud in the classroom becomes unproductive, so Ms. Brett takes the lesson \"on the road\" and Bud becomes engaged in the lesson again. This particularly works when brainstorming a writing topic and learning facts about a content area, such as the state. He is now able to work for short periods of time independently on math and reading worksheets. Type To Learn has been a very successful program for him and has enabled him to make full use of the Co-Writer program to write his own stories.

{"date": "Monday, July 20, 2009", "body": "\nYou know, I've gotta say, if the whole  Rolf Saxon  thing doesn't work out, I think Bud has a future as an  A&R man  for a record label. Seriously. Remember  back in February  when Dierks Bentley's incredible new album,  Feel That Fire , was released?  Bud went on record  at the time with his call for the album's best tracks: \"Feel That Fire,\" \"Sideways,\" \"I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes,\" and \"Here She Comes.\" Let's review what has happened since then. \"Feel That Fire,\" the album's first single, went to number one. A short time later, the album's second single, \"Sideways,\" was released. It, too, went to number one. And now, Dierks is releasing his third single to country radio: \" I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes .\" For those keeping score at home, that makes Bud three for three. Of course, from my Bud-centric perspective, I'm not sure how I feel about Dierks' new choice of single. Don't get me wrong - I love the song. I'm just thinking ahead to the video, which is certain to feature steamy footage that could potentially make the sizzling video for \" Come A Little Closer \" look tame. ( You may recall  that as Bud watched that one, he gave the play by play: \"They're having a nap. They're hugging. They're... having a pajama party?\") Bud actually has a different vision for \"I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes.\" Last week as he was getting ready for bed, we were talking about songs and the emotions they convey. (I've found that this is an especially useful tool to help my little music fan try to adopt another person's perspective to sort out  how  that person feels and  why  s/he might feel that way.) We were making our way through  Feel That Fire  tracks  (\"Life on the Run\" is angry and maybe afraid... \"Sideways\" is happy, but the \"HEY! now\" in the lyric might be a little surprised...)  when Bud asked \"And what kind of song is 'I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes?'\" \"Well,\" I said, \"It's a love song.\" \"No,\" Bud replied. \"It's a lullaby.\" \"A lullaby?\" \"Yes,\" he said. \"Dierks sings it to  Evie  when she needs to go to sleep.\" I reviewed the lyrics in my head - the ones that, up until that moment, could only be about one thing - and suddenly I could see how, when taken from Bud's perspective, they could also be describing a daddy getting his baby ready for bed: Girl I've been waiting on this long hard day to get over So I can rest my head right here on your shoulder I just wanna lay here and feel your breathe Listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat... We're wide awake, but girl I wanna make you close your eyes, and how even the most overtly suggestive lyric could simply be about helping the baby with her pajamas: And if you need a little bit of help from me, Babe, there's not a button that I can't reach. My heart just about melted on the spot. So, okay, maybe Bud's not quite ready to be in charge of a video shoot; I still think he'd be a great A&R guy.

I got a joke for ya!\" As they've been  in the past , most of his jokes are stolen from Zoboomafoo, so they tend to have an animal theme. For example, Bud: Hey, Mom. How are a tree and an elephant alike? Me: I don't know, Bud. How are a tree and an elephant alike? Bud: They both have a TRUNK! Insert peals of laughter here. Or, Bud: Hey, Mom. What did the lemur get when he cut himself on the mulberry branches? Me: I don't know, Bud. What did the lemur get when he cut himself on the mulberry branches? Bud: A Madaga-SCAR!

Laugh here till you snort. You get the point. Lately, though, Bud has not been satisfied with simply scripting his jokes; he's trying to make them his own. And,  as Bud has learned , in most situations in which your echolalic script is not quite doing it for you, you can  MITIGATE your echolalia  by swapping out words to fit your new situation. Sounds simple, right? Not so when you add in the element of comedy. Instead of inspiring a giggle, Bud's newly created jokes have a more surreal quality. I get the sense they may be the kinds of jokes that David Lynch told as a child. Like this one (that I  still  can't trace back to the original): Bud: Hey, Mom. What do you get a hippo...  (purposeful pause)...  and an ant? Me: I don't know, Bud. What do you get a hippo and an ant? Bud: Ants. And maybe uncles. Or this version of \"What do you get with a bird, a car, and a dog? A flying carpet!\": Bud: Hey, Mom. What do you get with a lamp... a chair... and a Mom? Me: I don't know, Bud. What do you get with a lamp, a chair, and a Mom? Bud: A... light seat mother!

Tonight he was delighted to discover all on his own that there was a hint of comic genius to build upon if he started out by renaming his favorite purple friend \"Stinky Winky.\" It will be interesting to see where that one leads. In the meantime, he's keeping me laughing and, truly, he is his own best audience. As he says multiple times a day, clearly scripting from I source I've not yet identified: \"I crack myself up.\" And also, a note to self: I really  must  find some time to explain to Bud that the  stink  does not come from the  breath  end of the skunk.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/01/why-did-echolalia-cross-road.html", "title": "\nWhy did the echolalia cross the road?\n"},

He didn't come out and ask, and I didn't come out and say, but together we danced around the idea of the Easter Bunny and we opened the question for consideration: just how much overlap  was  there between the bunny and Mom? \n \nBud hasn't raised the question since, not even through the Christmas excitement that started for him before the Thanksgiving turkey was fully digested. He wrote a letter to Santa and has been talking for a month about all the things that the man in red would bring. I did nothing to dissuade him. \n \nSo, I'm not sure what brought about today's turn of events. I'm not sure if kids at school have been talking about it, or if Bud has been processing it internally, or if he just suddenly had an epiphany, but this morning, as we talked about tomorrow being Christmas morning, and as he peppered me with questions to confirm that, in fact, the living room  would  be full of presents when he woke up, he paused, then asked me casually, \"Are you going to be Santa tonight, Mom?\" \n \nI answered nonchalantly, but honestly: \"Yes, I am.\" \n \nHe didn't flinch. \"And you'll bring presents for me?\" \n \n\"I sure will.\" \n \n\"You'll have a sack full of toys and come down the stairs and put them under the Christmas tree?\" \n \n\"That's right.\" \n \nHe was quiet for a minute, and I didn't know what that meant. \"How do you feel about that, Bud?\" I asked. \n \n\"I feel good,\" he said. \n \nAbout an hour later he approached me again and said with authority, \"Santa can't fit down my chimney.\" \n \n\"No, he can't,\" I answered. \n \n\"You're going to be Santa?\" \n \n\"Yes, I am.\" \n \nHe has confirmed it at least fifty times over the course of the day, but with no sign of dismay or disillusionment or disappointment. \n \nTonight, as we were getting ready for bed, he asked, \"And you hide the Easter eggs?\" \n \n\"Yes, I do.\" \n \n\"You're the Easter Mom?\" \n \n\"I'm the Easter Mom.\" \n \nI've wondered for years how this chapter would end.

{"date": "Saturday, January 02, 2010", "body": "\nThis has been bothering me for more than ten years now, and at this point I'm practically in crisis about it. What in the world are we going to call the decade that just ended? For ten years, radio stations have been playing \"the music of the eighties, nineties, and today.\" But now, it's 2010, and \"today\" is \"the teens.\" So what do we call yesterday? I remember reading an article in the mid-nineties in which cultural anthropologists or linguists or whoever it is who's paid to think about this sort of thing were speculating that by the late nineties, we, as a culture, would arrive at a generally agreed-upon moniker for the decade to come. I waited patiently for the cultural clouds to gather, then watched as we all rallied around the term \"Y2K,\" focusing our energy on a particular  year  and not the entire decade. Because if I asked you now what you were doing in Y2K, you would probably let me know what was going on in your life in 2000, but it wouldn't occur to you to mention 2004, right? Since I have been obsessing about this for more than a decade, I've asked nearly everyone I know for their thoughts on the matter. Most people don't seem as concerned about it as I am. People shrug and say things like \"I'm just going to call it 'the aughts,\" or \"I'm just going to call it the ohs.\" But that isn't the point, is it? It doesn't really matter what YOU call it, or what  I  call it. What matters is what WE call it. And, the point is, WE don't really call it anything. Sure, we call it lots of things. SiriusXM radio has a station called \"Pop 2k.\" Jerry Seinfeld did a bit on Jay Leno where he referred to the decade as the \"double-ohs.\" And, yes, we all know what those things mean when we hear them. But there is not an instant recognition, a connected knowing, a shared cultural resonance associated with those terms. And we are a culture that creates itself through shared cultural resonance. I think of this example: On September 11, 2001, my colleagues and I, like most of the rest of the country, felt like we should be  doing  something, though there was very little that we could do. For some reason, what we decided to do was run a roster of all of the students whose homes were in and around New York City or Washington, D.C., as we hypothesized that these might be the students most directly affected by the tragedy and most in need of support. Later that day, I was putting my printed roster in a file folder, assuming that there would be other pieces of paper that would eventually join it. I sat and stared at the folder, wondering how to label it. I  knew  that eventually this day would have a name - some culturally agreed-upon title that would instantly bring to mind the emotion and the import it had for everyone who had lived through it. I just didn't know what that name would be. It only took a couple of weeks, I think, for the name to emerge: September 11th. 9/11. If I walked up to you on the street today and asked \"Where were you on 9/11?,\" you wouldn't wonder if I meant 9/11/09 or 9/11/06. You would know instantly that I meant \"Where were you on 9/11/01 when you heard that the planes hit the towers?\" Cultural resonance. And the thing is, it didn't  have  to be called 9/11. It might have been called Terror Tuesday or The Airplane Attacks. We all know that Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941, but we don't call that day \"December 7th.\" We call it \"Pearl Harbor.\" Because \"Pearl Harbor\" has cultural resonance for us. And that's why I'm in such a quandary about the past decade's lack of a cultural identity. I don't know about you, but it was an important decade in my life. It was a hard decade, a hard fought decade, a hard won decade. I need it to matter. I need it to have resonance. I need it to have a name.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/lost-decade.html", "title": "\nThe lost decade\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 03, 2010", "body": "\nHave you reserved your copy yet? Gravity Pulls You In: Perspectives on Parenting Children on the Autism Spectrum , edited by two of my very favorite bloggers, Kyra Anderson from  This Mom  and Vicki Forman from  Speak Softly... , is slated for a February release and is currently available for pre-order from Woodbine House. Gravity Pulls You In  is a collection of 33 essays and poems written by the parents of children with autism.  BiggerBooks.com  describes it this way: Unlike the dozens of books that chronicle the acute challenges families face in reaching and teaching their child with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), this anthology of 33 candid essays and poems by parents highlights the complexity, wonder, and possibility that comes with raising these kids. While also acknowledging the struggles,  Gravity Pulls You In  goes to the heart of that which pulls at all parents: what does my child need and how can I provide this for them? The contributors are an accomplished group of mostly previously published writers, including poets, parenting guide authors, bloggers, short story writers, essayists, and translators. They are also stay-at home-mothers, professors, actors, teachers, a former dancer, autism treatment specialists, a psychotherapist, and a scientist. Each piece has been included because, as the editors requested, it offers a perspective that avoids \"the image of the parent feverishly scraping the autism out of her child or serenely offering up platitudes about life's roses among the thorns of hardship.\" Gravity Pulls You In  gives voice to what's hard about raising a child with ASD without feeding the stereotype of the devastation of autism. There are stories of discovery and enlightenment, of perseverance and humor that forge a deeper connection among parents by broadening the perspective on autism and attempting to dismantle the fear. The children written about range from toddlers to adults, and from high functioning to severely affected. Despite times of heartache and disappointment, the contributors describe learning things from their children that are transforming, of being awestruck by their kid's hearts and minds and the glimpses of their son or daughter's personality, humor, or wisdom. As one essay describes, it's possible to put aside the frustration and revel in her son's quirky intelligence when he explains to her that gravity pulls you in, not down, thereby keeping you from falling off the earth as it spins rapidly on its axis. His revelation leads to her own: \"Things that demand a closer look, a new approach, a shift in perspective, those things pull you in. Even when you are spinning, even when you are moving much more quickly than you thought was possible, even when you find yourself in territory where instincts alone don't feel like enough to complete the revolution,\" your child can pull you in.  Gravity Pulls You In  explores the otherworldliness of the parenting experience, where the territory is often unknown. This collection offers a sense of community and support to other parents and caregivers who wear similar shoes, and lets us all in on what's hardest and most important to families like these. I have not seen an advance copy of the book, or even a list of its 33 contributors. I'm one of them, though, and I imagine that many of the other names will be familiar ones. But even sight unseen, I have to say - ANYTHING produced by the powerhouse combination of Kyra Anderson and Vicki Forman would pull me in. I can't  wait  to read this book. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.woodbinehouse.com/main.asp_Q_product_id_E_978-1-60613-002-5", "http://kyraanderson.wordpress.com/", "http://www.vickiforman.com/", "http://www.biggerbooks.com/bk_detail.aspx?isbn=9781606130025", "http://www.woodbinehouse.com/main.asp_Q_product_id_E_978-1-60613-002-5"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/feeling-gravity-s-pull.html", "title": "\nFeeling "},
{"date": "Monday, January 04, 2010", "body": "\nOkay, I spent the better part of the weekend trying to upgrade the operating system on my HP laptop from Vista to Windows 7. I was very, very excited about the upgrade because I despise Vista, but after more hours than I'd like to admit, I'm ready to throw the laptop out the window. Has anyone else made this upgrade on an HP? I followed the instructions veeeeeeery carefully. Luckily, I backed up everything first. I say \"luckily\" because hours later I had to restore everything. I will spare you the details; the upshot is that after innumerable torturous hours and some pretty spicy curse words, my laptop is still running Vista. The reason? According to the upgrade software provided to me by HP, my \"keyboard filter\" driver needs to be updated. According to my HP laptop, I do not have a \"keyboard filter\" driver. According to the HP support website, there are a multitude of keyboard-related drivers for my computer for which updates are available. I have run them all. And according to the upgrade software provided to me by HP, after all those updates have run, my \"keyboard filter\" STILL needs to be updated. This update is so critical, in fact, that the whole upgrade process screeches to a halt without it. There is, it seems, no work-around. And so, I remain in the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad world of Vista. So, two things: 1. Are any of you running Windows 7? Is it worth continuing this fool's errand? and 2. What the heck is a keyboard filter driver and how in the world do I update it?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/mac-envy.html", "title": "\nMac envy\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 05, 2010", "body": "\nWe are the champions, my friends. Bud had a great visit with his pediatrician today. I've been in high-anxiety mode since late summer, when, as the result of a much-needed switch in the timing of his medication, Bud's appetite kicked into overdrive and he gained 11 pounds in three months. Shortly after that, the news was  full of reports  that this sort of rapid weight gain was not atypical for children on this type of medication. Typical or not, though, it was dangerous for Bud and his doctor warned that it could cause him to develop diabetes. At that point, Bud's diet got an overhaul. And it worked. As of today, Bud is back to the height/weight ratio he had in the summer and his BMI is within the normal range. Of course, we need to stay focused and stay on course, but today it's feeling really good. I'm loathe to give advice on this sort of thing, because I suspect it's a \"your mileage may vary\" kind of issue, but I also imagine that there are lots of parents out there Googling things like \"autism medication weight gain solutions\" as frantically as I was a few months ago. And maybe something that worked for us will spark an idea for somebody else. So... First, the most significant turning point in my thinking about Bud and food came when his doctor explained to me what the medication was doing in Bud's brain. Up to that point, I thought that the medication had simply increased Bud's appetite, and that the solution lay in finding foods that would fill him up and stay with him without adding too many calories to his diet. So, I focused on foods that were high in fiber, but it seemed that no matter how much he ate, he never felt full. The reason, his doctor explained, is that the issue was not really one of hunger. A side effect of his medication is that it basically deactivates the trigger in his brain that tells him when he is full. So, even when his body is satisfied - indeed, even when it is OVER-filled - Bud will still feel hunger. Suddenly, I understood why my boy was eating a pound of bananas in a single day. I asked the doctor what other parents had done to combat this. She said that, in honesty, those that had been most successful had gone the route of using locks - locks on the cupboards; locks on the refrigerator. I pictured my kitchen as a fortress. I imagined how it would feel to Bud. I imagined how confusing it would be to my dad, who is already  struggling enough with confusion . And then I dismissed the idea. Instead, I focused on devising a plan that would let Bud feel like he was eating all the time. I reasoned that, since he would feel the same level of hunger no matter what he ate, the important part was to make him feel like he was always able to have  something . And so evolved Operation Always Be Eating: - I used the Weight Watchers approach to choosing foods, trying to find low fat/high fiber substitutes for the foods Bud liked (Fiber One pancakes instead of Aunt Jemimah, fat free American cheese instead of regular - that sort of thing). - I made sure there were some things that would keep his mouth busy that he could always help himself to - sugar-free Popsicles and sugar-free gum were ALWAYS available in large quantity. - I stopped buying fruit juices and started buying single-serving bottles of water, which are just more fun for a kid to drink than a glass of water from the tap. - I bought sugar-free juice packets to mix in to the bottled water, and while I'd prefer that he had less artificial sugar in his diet, sometimes you just have to choose the lesser of the evils. - I found low cal, low fat treats he liked and didn't keep any high-fat, high-cal treats in the house. The biggest score? Cool Whip Free. Almost no calories, and he feels like he's eating ice cream. - I learned that portion control is a key to success. As long as Bud was having the same KINDS of foods, he didn't make a fuss about the quantity. One piece of toast was just as good as two. A small banana was as good as a big one. Using smaller plates and bowls helped to make it SEEM like he was having just as much as ever. 100-calorie snack packs were valuable because they had built-in portion control AND had the added benefit of not leaving an open bag of something that would be easy to steal from. I also did a lot of splitting 100-calorie packs (creating two 50-cal pretzel bags or three 33 1/3 cal mini-muffin treats.) - I learned that if Bud needed to feel like he could always be eating, I had to rethink the \"three meals a day\" approach to food. So, breakfast became the thing that happens over the course of the morning. Lunch became the thing that happens over the course of mid-day. Items that would once have been presented together as a total lunch \"package\" were metered out instead, piece by piece, hour by hour. - I also learned that some things need to stay as they are. His weekend cheese pizza from the local pizza shop? The thing he loves more than anything else? It stays the same, in frequency, size, and drippy, greasy content. And so far, so good - or, so says the doctor's scale. I have to say, in some ways, the autism-driven preference for sameness works to our advantage. Now, when given a choice, he will choose to buy the Weight Watchers ice cream treats instead of the higher-calorie (better tasting) versions. Because he likes what he knows, and now, that's what he knows. Bud has also been a trooper about it. We've talked a lot about healthy eating. He's working at it. He's still stealing food now and then, but not to the same degree. He's becoming a partner in the process - and I have to think that the medication he's on - the one that's causing the problem to begin with - has also been instrumental in helping him regulate enough to be more thoughtful about his food intake. It's still a daily concern and I still have to monitor it closely. But for today, it feels like a victory - and I'm going to eat it up.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704222704574499302698776062.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/always-be-eating.html", "title": "\nAlways be eating\n"},

{"date": "Friday, January 15, 2010", "body": "\nI attended a faculty development workshop about student learning this week, and I've been mulling something over ever since. The presenter covered a lot of territory in his day-long presentation, including statistics related to the link between memory and sleep. I couldn't remember the specifics of what he said (probably because, like many parents of children with autism, I don't get nearly as much sleep as I should), so I spent a few minutes Googling it this evening. I found  this article  from ScienceDaily from June, 2005. It reads: A good night's sleep triggers changes in the brain that help to improve memory,according to a new study led by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). These findings, reported in the June 30, 2005, issue of the journal Neuroscience and currently published on-line, might help to explain why children -- infants, in particular -- require much more sleep than adults, and also suggest a role for sleep in the rehabilitation of stroke patients and other individuals who have suffered brain injuries... New memories are formed within the brain when a person engages with information to be learned for example, memorizing a list of words or mastering a piano concerto). However, these memories are initially quite vulnerable; in order to \"stick\" they must be solidified and improved. This process of \"memory consolidation\" occurs when connections between brain cells as well as between different brain regions are strengthened, and for many years was believed to develop merely as a passage of time. More recently, however, it has been demonstrated that time spent asleep also plays a key role in preserving memory... \"The MRI scans are showing us that brain regions shift dramatically during sleep,\" says (Matthew) Walker (PhD, Director of BIDMC's Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory). \"When you're asleep, it seems as though you are shifting memory to more efficient storage regions within the brain. Consequently, when you awaken, memory tasks can be performed both more quickly and accurately and with less stress and anxiety.\" The end result is that procedural skills -- for example, learning to talk, to coordinate limbs, musicianship, sports, even using and interpreting sensory and perceptual information from the surrounding world -- become more automatic and require the use of fewer conscious brain regions to be accomplished. This new research may explain why children and teenagers need more sleep than adults and, in particular, why infants sleep almost round the clock. But what might it say about children with autism? What might it indicate about their brain function, sleep cycles, and development? Why do so many children with autism, like Bud, have trouble sleeping? How do so many children with autism, like Bud, have extraordinary memories (and, as I have suggested before, what almost appears to be a  diminished capacity to forget ), in spite of often getting so little sleep? And how much does their sleep deficiency account for the significant challenges that so many children with autism, like Bud, face with things like \"learning to talk, coordinating limbs... (and)using and interpreting sensory and perceptual information from the surrounding world?\" Is there a causal relationship in here somewhere? And, if so, where is the chicken and where is the egg? What is the starting point? Does Bud's brain start as a system with enhanced memory, which then requires less sleep, which then has a negative impact on his language, motor, and sensory development, which then makes him more inclined to put his energy into his area of strength - his memory - which then makes him need less sleep, which then...? Or does the process start somewhere else? Or are all of these factors co-occurring but unrelated? Or are they related, but not causal - are they all a function of a difference that exists in a particular area of the autistic brain? Is research being done on this?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/06/050629070337.htm"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/remembering-sleep.html", "title": "\nRemembering sleep\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 07, 2009", "body": "\nHave I got a story for you. \n \nYou need to sit down, for two reasons: \n \nFirst, it's a long story. \n \nAnd second, if you've been reading this blog for a while, then my opening line is going to knock you off your feet. \n \nOkay, are you ready? Are you sitting? Here it comes: \n \nBud met Dierks Bentley. \n \nI know. I KNOW! \n \nBud!!! \n \n Dierks Bentley !!! \n \nI  know !!! \n \nBut it's so, so, so much cooler than that. \n \nSo, let me back up. \n \nBud had a tough summer, behaviorally speaking. First it was tough. Then it was tougher. Then it was nearly unlivable. I'd been working closely with Bud's doctor all along, but when we reached \"unlivable,\" our problem-solving kicked into high gear and we made some significant medication shifts. \n \nAnd, at just about the same time, Dierks and Cassidy Bentley rode to our rescue. \n \nDierks was touring with Brad Paisley and had a show scheduled at a venue that's just a couple of hours from our house - an easy drive on country roads. The show was at a county fair, which, I knew, could be a double-edged sword: a high probability of a family-friendly environment, but also a high possibility of sensory overload, with crowds and rides and animals and activity. But still: Bud and I were stuck in a no-win cycle of troubling behavior (his) and inadequate responses (mine). I felt like we needed something to shake up the pattern. \n \nSomething big. \n \nIf there's one thing that I've learned as the parent of a child with autism, it's this: when somebody says \"Please let me know if there's ever anything I can do,\" what they  really  mean is this: \"Please let me know if there's ever anything I can do.\" Seriously. Lots of people offer support and empathy. Lots of people say things like \"I don't know how you do it\" and \"My heart really goes out to you\" and \"That sounds really tough.\" And I really, really appreciate their support. But those people who say \"Please let me know if there's ever anything I can do?\" They mean it. Now, they might not be willing to give you a kidney, but they really do want to help if they can. Take them at their word, and - trust me on this one - if there's ever anything they can do, please let them know. \n \nLuckily for me, Cassidy and Dierks are \"Please let me know if there's ever anything I can do\" people. Because this year, as the tour swung close to our house, I had a hunch that there was something they could do. I contacted Cassidy and, after acknowledging that I was quite aware that it's bad form to respond to someone's generosity with a request for more, I floated an idea. I gave her the background on the tour's proximity to our house, and I told her that I thought that Bud was probably not ready to manage the concert environment. But, I said, I thought he  might  be able to manage a meet-and-greet. And, I said, the reason I was willing to boorishly plow in and make the request was that I had a hunch that if Bud found himself face-to-face with Dierks Bentley, it would be an \"Anything Is Possible\" moment for him. And if Bud needed  anything  at that time, it was an \"Anything Is Possible\" moment. \n \nCassidy responded right away: \"Yes. Absolutely.\" I told her that I wasn't at all confident that I would get Bud through the gate, that there was every possibility that we'd drive two hours and he'd refuse to get out of the car, that he would panic at the entrance and we'd have to call the whole thing off. She said that was fine, that Bud's comfort was the most important consideration, and that we could give it a try knowing that everyone would be flexible and take their cues from him. \n \nI know. Incredible. \n \nAs the day approached, I watched Bud closely. We'd just made a huge shift in his medication. I tried to assess its effectiveness and predict his ability to manage a meeting with his hero. A couple of times, I nearly called it off. The night before our scheduled meeting, Cassidy sent me a reassuring e-mail, and I had the sense that, though she was back home in Nashville and wouldn't be there for The Meeting, she was still as nervous and excited as I was. \n \nAnd then, the big day came. I woke to Bud's face in my face, his body curled up next to mine. \"Can we go to the dinosaur museum today, Mom?\" \n \n\"No, Bud,\" I said. \"Not today. We're going to do something else today.\" \n \n\"Like what?\" \n \n\"Well,\" I started, \"today we're going to meet Dierks Bentley.\" \n \nSilence. \n \nI looked at Bud, whose face was buried in the pillow. His body didn't move. The silence continued. And continued. \n \nI started to wonder if he'd fallen back to sleep. \n \nFinally, when I couldn't stand it any longer, I said, tentatively, \"Bud?\" \n \nHe kept his in the pillow and replied, \"I don't think so, Mom.\" \n \nI paused a moment, weighing my options.  To push or not to push? \n \n \"Oh, I think so, Bud,\" I said, trying to keep my tone casual. \"Dierks is going to be at a fair near here, and he would REALLY like to meet you.\" \n \n\"I'll just stay with Nana and Papa,\" he said. \n \n\"Well,\" I said, grateful that we had several hours before we'd need to leave home, \"let's just think about it. We don't need to decide right now.\" \n \nWe laid there quietly side by side, each of us trying to make sense of the situation and figure out what to do next. After a long time, Bud spoke. \n \n\"Dierks would like to meet me?\" \n \n\"He sure would,\" I said. \"Look, Bud, I want to show you an e-mail that Cassidy sent me.\" \n \nI powered up my laptop, pulled up her e-mail, and read it out loud as Bud sat next to me reading along silently. Then, I highlighted the things I wanted him to think about. \"Look, Bud. Cassidy says three important things. First, she says that Dierks' friend Chris will find a quiet place for us to see Dierks, so even though we will be at a fair, it won't be noisy. Second, she says that the most important thing is for you to feel comfortable. You can do whatever you want to do, and you don't have to do anything you don't want to do. And third, she says that if you want to, you can see Dierks' tour bus.\" \n \nI waited. I knew that the tour bus was the ultimate carrot. One of Bud's favorite videos on dierks.com features Dierks giving a tour of his bunk on the bus. Bud loves it so much that he convinced me to string up a curtain by his bed so he could have a bunk of his own. I knew that the idea of seeing the ACTUAL bunk would be almost irresistible. \n \n\"I could see the bus?\" he asked. \n \n\"That's what Cassidy said.\" \n \n\"I could see Dierks' bunk?\" he asked. \n \n\"Well, maybe,\" I said. \"His bunk is on the bus.\" \n \nBud didn't say anything. We finished up our morning routine, then headed down the stairs for breakfast. From the kitchen, I could hear Bud open the door to the room where his grandparents were sleeping. \n \n\"Hey, Bud,\" Nana greeted him. \"What's up?\" \n \n\"I'm meeting Dierks Bentley,\" he said. \n \nScore one for the tour bus. \n \nAs the morning progressed, Bud's excitement grew, and soon he was dressed in a Dierks Bentley t-shirt, considering whether or not to bring along his guitar, and firing questions at me about what length Dierks' hair would be, whether or not he'd have a beard, and what sort of shirt he'd be wearing. In other words, Bud had found his groove. \n \nI did my best to prepare him, though I wasn't sure what to expect myself. But I played it out this way: We would drive for about two hours until we got to the fairground. There would be lots of cars, and we might have to park far away and take a shuttle to the gate. We would wait in line at the gate to buy tickets to the fair (but, I was quick to add, we would not actually have to GO to the fair). Then we would walk through the fairgrounds to get to the area where Dierks was. Dierks' friend Chris would meet us there, and he would bring us to a quiet area. Then Dierks would come and say hello. I carefully avoided the  specifics  of what would happen when he met Dierks, so that I wasn't setting up false expectations, but in my mind I pictured 5-10 minutes of contact, during which Bud might or might not make eye contact, might or might not say anything, and might or might not let me take a picture of the two of them together. And of course,  maybe  we would get to see the bus. Then, we would head back through the fairgrounds, make our way back to the car, and drive two hours back home. And I knew that if our day was anything even close to that, it would be a dream come true for Bud. \n \nMy first indication that things might not play out exactly as I'd imagined came as we drove up the highway toward the fairground and my cell phone rang. It was Chris Alderman, Dierks' tour manager, calling to confirm our meeting time, to let me know how excited they were to have us visit, and to reassure me that they were all prepared to play it by ear. He told me that he'd put my name on the list for backstage parking so that we wouldn't have to worry about dealing with the fair crowds. At least 50% of my anxiety lifted in that moment. \n \n\"And, hey,\" he said, \"why don't you guys plan on grabbing some dinner from catering with us as well? Then you won't have to worry about that either.\" I'd packed a peanut butter sandwich for Bud, but eagerly agreed to the plan. \n \nI said goodbye to Chris and filled Bud in on the latest development. I was relieved to know that we wouldn't have to face the potential landmines in the parking/gate/fairground process. Then it occurred to me that there was another piece of information I should share with Bud, because if we were going to be in the backstage area eating in the catering tent, then... \n \n\"Hey, Bud,\" I said. \"Just so you know, there's also a chance that we might see Brad Paisley.\" \n \nBud's response was immediate and decisive. \"No. Just Dierks.\" \n \nI knew what he meant. He likes Brad Paisley, but really, enough was enough. What was next?  Hey! Watch me pull Kenny Chesney out of my hat! \n \n \"You don't have to talk to him,\" I said quickly. \"You just might see him around. Walking by or something.\" I dropped it, but thought to myself,  how is this my life? \n \n Before long, we reached the fairground. Having no idea how to find backstage parking, I chose the gate furthest away from it. I texted Chris to tell him we'd be there soon, then wound through slow-moving traffic, talking to a steady stream of mostly kind parking attendants as I fumbled through an explanation of what I was trying to do. Finally, I got to the parking attendant stationed right by what appeared to be the backstage entrance. I don't know if he'd been getting a lot of stories like mine or what, but he was not buying what I was selling. Bud started getting nervous in the back seat  (\"But, Mom, where is Dierks?\"),  and I was just about to start to panic, when I heard a friendly voice approach the car: \"Hey! You made it!\" \n \nIt was Chris, who had a quick chat with the parking attendant, then motioned to me to swing my car around and through the now-open gate. Relief washed over me as I pulled through and Chris motioned to a spot just inside the gate. As soon as the car stopped, Bud and I climbed out, and I was about to start thanking Chris when a voice to our right said \"Hey, guys!\" \n \nWe were parked next to Dierks Bentley's bus. And Dierks' head was sticking out the window. \n \n\"Bud, look,\" I said. \"Who's that?\" \n \nBud glanced up, then turned his back to Dierks, stared down at the ground, and said \"That's Dierks.\" \n \nI looked back at Dierks, who motioned to me -  Should I come out? \n \n I shrugged and nodded  (I don't know; I think so.) , and in a flash he was with us. \"Hey, Bud! It's nice to meet you!\" \n \nBud kept his eyes down, but lifted his hand and said to the ground, \"Hey, Dierks!\" I wasn't sure how to read him. Was this moving too fast? Did we need to slow down? \n \nI put my head next to his and asked, \"Hey, Bud, what do you think about this?\" \n \nHe answered softly, but clearly: \"I think it's really cool.\" \n \nWe all exhaled, and I said, \"It is cool, Bud.\" \n \nDierks asked Bud if he'd like to take a walk around, Bud said that he would, and then we were off. The ice was broken and we were all, surprisingly, getting comfortable quickly. We walked through the grounds, as Dierks and Chris gave us the lay of the land, pointing out tents and trucks and trailers until we were at the back of the stage area. As we approached the stairs, I saw a familiar face heading down them. \n \n\"And there's Brad Paisley,\" said Dierks, as Brad walked toward us and Dierks made introductions. \n \nBrad said something. At least, I think he did. I know his lips moved. All I could  really  hear, though, was the voice inside my head yelling to Bud, \"PLEASE don't offend Brad Paisley!\" And Bud must have heard, because he answered the questions Brad asked him, then stood by patiently as Brad talked shop with Dierks. \n \nWhen they were done and Brad said goodbye, we turned back to the stage, which was swarming with crew members wheeling equipment and instruments, shouting to be heard over cranking music. Dierks surveyed the scene in front of us and without missing a beat said, \"Hey, Bud, would you like to see the bus?\" \n \n\"Sure!\" Bud replied, and they walked side by side, their comfort with each other already visible, as they headed back toward our car. \n \n \n \nAnd then, we entered the promised land: the tour bus. Dierks gave Bud the all-access tour, opening cabinets and drawers to show Bud where they store the peanut butter and where they keep their shoes, a view of each guy's bunk, and - the best part for Bud - Dierks' bunk - the very bunk that Bud had seen on video so many times. Bud was delighted. Dierks explained that the other guys were out playing golf, but would be back soon, and then he asked Bud if he'd like to go get some dinner. Bud was quick to agree. \n \nWe made our way to the tent where the catering staff had laid out a ham dinner buffet. Bud looked at the ham, potatoes, veggies, and other decidedly non-Bud foods, looked at me warily, and said, \"Mom?\" \n \n\"You know, Dierks,\" I said, understanding Bud immediately, \"Bud has a peanut butter sandwich in the car. He and I will just run and grab it, then we'll meet you back here.\" \n \n\"Why don't I just bring my dinner and we can eat on the bus?\" Dierks suggested. \"Would that work?\" \n \n\"YEAH!\" Bud cheered. \n \nWe headed back to the bus, and Dierks and Bud settled down at the table and started chatting. \n \n \nIt was about that time that I realized I could easily slip out and get my nails done and the two of them would carry on just fine without me. But I wasn't about to miss a minute of it, as I sat slack-jawed and watched my son not just respond, not just interact, but actually initiate real conversation by seeking out topics that he thought might interest his friend. \n \n\"So, Dierks, I was just wondering,\" Bud started, \"what does Jake and George  (Dierks' dogs)  like to do with you?\" \n \nAnd then: \n \n\"So, Dierks, I was just wondering, does Evie like to watch PBS Kids?\" \n \nAnd for each question Bud raised, Dierks had an answer, and they bantered back and forth about all the topics that really matter - how great peanut butter sandwiches are (Bud's looked so good that Dierks made one for himself), what music was on Bud's iPod, and, of course, which country artists they liked. GAC was playing softly on the big-screen TV, and from time to time Bud would identify a face that popped onto the screen. \n \n\"Look, Dierks! It's Keith Anderson! Do you know Keith Anderson?\" \n \n\"Oh yeah,\" Dierks replied, \"he's great.\" \n \n\"Yeah! He's great!\" Bud agreed happily. And so it went - Rodney Atkins, Keith Urban, Kenny Chesney - Bud was thrilled to know that Dierks knew all the same guys he knew. Bud kept an eye on the TV even when other things had his primary focus, and every now and then he'd shriek \"LOOK! It's YOU, Dierks Bentley!,\" and we'd all shift our gaze to see Dierks, larger than life, filling the TV screen. \n \nAfter the peanut butter had been eaten and the country singers discussed, Bud thought of another question. \"So, Dierks, I was just wondering,\" Bud asked casually, as though he had not seen several of them on the bus, \"do you have a guitar?\" \n \n\"Well, yes, I do,\" said Dierks. \"Would you like to see it?\" \n \n\"Oh, sure!\" Bud said, with feigned surprise. \n \nDierks grabbed a guitar, sat down, and strummed. \n \n\"So, Dierks,\" Bud said, \"I was just wondering - do you know a song, 'So So Long'?\" \n \n\"Well, yes, I do!\" said Dierks - which is not surprising, since he wrote it. And then he started playing it, while Bud shivered with excitement, and pounded his feet along with the music. \n \n\"Are you drumming, Bud?\" I asked. \n \n\"No,\" he replied, incredulously. \"I'm tap dancing!\" \n \nBut of course. \n \nAnd then, it was Total Request Live, as Bud shouted out songs and Dierks played them - \"Settle for a Slowdown,\" \"Sideways,\" \"Wish It Would Break,\" \"Midnight Radio\" - even an encore of \"So So Long.\" The hits just kept on coming. \n \nThen Bud said, \"How about 'I Wanna Make You Close You Eyes'?\" \n \n\"Oh yeah!\" Dierks said, \"You mean  the song I wrote for Evie ?\" \n \n\"Yeah!\" Bud cheered. \n \n\"Wow, Bud, you were right!\" I said. \n \n\"What?\" Dierks said, off-handedly. \"Did somebody guess that?\" And then he launched into the song and, to Bud's complete delight, changed up the lyrics to make them unmistakeably about his baby girl. Bud even laughed out loud when Dierks got to the part about her leaving a trail of dirty diapers for him to follow. \n \nWhen Dierks stood up to get something, Bud couldn't hold it in another moment. He stood up, too, threw his arms around Dierks and squealed \"You're the BEST, Dierks Bentley!\" (I have to say: I couldn't have agreed more.) \n \nA short time later, we heard voices coming from the front of the bus, as the members of Dierks' band returned from their golf game. We all looked up as the first person walked on to the bus. \n \n\"Hey!\" Bud shouted, \"That's Tim Sargent! He plays steel guitar!\" \n \nDierks and Tim both exploded with cheers for Bud's accurate ID, as the next band member joined us. \n \n\"There's Steve, Bud,\" Dierks said. \"What does he play?\" \n \n\"He plays drums!\" Bud said, to more cheers. \n \nBut I knew that Dierks was setting the bar low. \"Wait, Bud,\" I said. \"Steve who?\" \n \n\"Steve Misamore!\" said Bud, spotting the guy on his heels. \"And that's Robbie Harrington! He plays bass.\" \n \nThe guys were delighted, and though I knew there was one more band member yet to join us, I also knew he'd be the easiest one for Bud. He walked on to the bus, but instead of his trademark cowboy hat - the hat he  always  wears on stage - he was sporting a baseball cap. \n \nBud froze. He turned quickly to me, \"Who's that, Mom?\" \n \n\"Take another look, Bud,\" I said. \"You know who that is. He's just wearing a different kind of hat today.\" \n \nBud looked again, then turned back to me more insistently, \"Who IS it, Mom?\" \n \nI leaned over and said softly: \"Well, he usually wears a cowboy hat, and he plays guitar.\" \n \n\"THAT'S ROD JANZEN!\" Bud shrieked, and the rest of the bus cheered in response. Bud had officially won them over. \n \nThe guys made their way to the bunk area at the back of the bus, and Rod returned seconds later with his cowboy hat in hand. He plopped it on Bud's head and said, \"Bud, I'll need this for the show tonight, but you can wear it until then.\" Then Cowboy Bud sat down next to Dierks for an impromptu guitar lesson. \n \nDierks suggested to Bud that they go back and check out the stage area, and Bud readily agreed. We left the bus, and the two of them fell into step together, chatting as they walked. I trailed a few feet behind, marvelling at how naturally they were interacting and at how quickly they'd become friends. \n \nWhen we reached the stage, I saw that though some of the activity had died down, it was still very loud and fairly busy, and I realized I'd left our supply-filled backpack on the bus. \n \n\"Bud,\" I asked, \"do you want your earplugs?\" \n \n\"Yes, \" he said quickly. \n \n\"Okay,\" I replied, not wanting to interrupt the easy groove we'd all fallen into. \"You stay here with Dierks. I'll be right back.\" \n \nI turned and dashed back toward the bus - and then realized what I'd just done. \n \n Oh my GOD,  I thought, horrified.  I just made Dierks Bentley babysit! \n \nI paused, and for a fraction of a second I thought about turning back and getting Bud, but since I was already halfway to the bus, I decided to just own my faux pas and apologize when I returned. I ran to the bus, grabbed Bud's earplugs, and hurried back to the stage as quickly as I could. \n \nBud and Dierks were not where I'd left them, though. I looked around, and saw them together in backstage area, comfortably checking out instruments amid the noise and confusion. I stuck Bud's earplugs in my pocket and went up to join them, as Dierks asked Bud if he'd like to try on his guitar. \n \n \nAs I hovered nearby doing the mom thing  (\"Be very careful with that, Bud! Gentle hands! Not too rough, buddy!\" ), Dierks casually walked Bud out to the front of the stage, where he stood, front and center, his hero's guitar slung around his neck, star of the day as he basked in the glow of the imaginary audience that filled the still-empty stands. \n \nAfter Bud returned Dierks' guitar, the backstage tour continued as they checked out the inside of a huge equipment truck. As I watched Dierks and Bud together, I was struck by two things: 1) Dierks seemed totally at ease. Unlike many people who look to me for cues about how to respond to Bud, Dierks' responses to him were casual and natural, and 2) Bud seemed totally at ease. I realized that since we'd arrived, I hadn't heard any scripts from PBS shows or computer games. His responses to Dierks were casual and natural. \n \nWe headed back to the bus, where the guys waved me off when I tried to apologize for invading their home. Bud seemed to thrive in this guy-oriented haven. \"Hey, Dierks,\" he said, when Jack Ingram's video for \"Barefoot and Crazy\" came on, \"Look! It's Jack Ingram! This is a bikini video.\" \n \n\"Yeah?\" Dierks asked. \n \n\"Yeah,\" Bud said. Then he added conspiratorially, \"Bikinis are great.\" And the guy fun continued - Dierks showed Bud how to drive the bus, they compared muscles - I swear, if we'd stayed any longer I'm certain that there would have been a burping contest. In this instance, though, I was more than happy to fade into the background until I was summoned -  \"Hey! You gotta get a picture of this!\"  - to find that they'd climbed into bunks (Bud on the bottom and Dierks on the top) and were already smiling for the camera. \n \nMoments later, the guys beckoned us back to the front, where the video for \"Every Mile A Memory\" was playing on GAC. The video is full of concert footage, and it was more than a little surreal to sit watching the band  with  the band - Tim on the big screen, Tim on the couch; Robbie on the big screen, Robbie in the aisle... Bud, for his part, was completely unfazed, but thrilled to see that his guys - because, by now, they had surely become  his  guys - seemed to like all the same things he did. \n \nWhile Bud was hanging with Dierks and the guys, Chris found me and asked about the show, to find out what I was thinking now that we'd been there for a while: Did we want seats in the audience? Did we want to hang out behind the stage? I told Chris that I was still fairly sure that Bud wouldn't be able to manage the audience experience, and that I thought we'd just need to play it by ear. He told me that the passes we had would let us watch from anywhere, so we could do whatever seemed best at the time. \n \nThen, it was time for Dierks to get ready for his scheduled Meet and Greet, so Chris took over as our official tour guide. He brought Bud and me to his own bus, where we got to meet some of the crew and saw a whole NEW set of bunks. We visited the Meet and Greet area. Bud climbed into the cab of one of Brad Paisley's trucks and chatted with the driver about NASCAR. (Bud doesn't know what NASCAR is, but he held his own well enough that I don't think the driver even realized that.) And THEN Chris brought Bud to Dierks' jeep, and Bud climbed in and sat in the very same seat that Dierks had in the \"Free and Easy\" video - the video that, for us,  started this whole wild ride . \n \nWhen it was time for Chris to go help manage the Meet and Greet, he ushered us into the trailer that housed his office, set up his laptop, and asked Bud about his favorite website. Bud told him it was PBS Kids, then sat down to show Chris how he could make Curious George juggle fruit - and, I'm telling you, Chris responded with so much enthusiasm that he had  me  convinced it was the coolest thing he'd ever seen. Once we'd settled in and Chris confirmed that we were all set, he headed out to take care of business. Bud's anxiety flared once or twice, but he settled down when I assured him that he would see Dierks again. \n \nBud must have been processing the experience, because he was quiet for a moment, then turned to me and asked \"Mom? I'm ' With the Band ?,'\" the meaning of the phrase clear to him for the first time. \n \n\"Yeah, Bud,\" I said, smiling. \"You're 'With the Band.'\" \n \nBefore long, darkness had fallen and Chris came back to collect us and bring us back to the bus, where the air was suddenly electric with pre-show energy. The guys were dressed in the clothes they'd wear on stage. Crew members zipped in with microphone cases and other important-looking things. I worried that we were in the way, but the guys were as relaxed as they'd been all afternoon. Dierks and Rod sat down with acoustic guitars as they all gathered at the front of the bus. \n \n\"Bud,\" Dierks said, \"We thought we should practice a couple of songs before the show. Would you like to hear them?\" \n \n\"Sure!\" said Bud, sitting down on the couch in the middle of the room. And then, suddenly, the crisp acoustic opening notes of \"Every Mile A Memory\" filled the bus and I thought I might have forgotten how to breathe, as the guys launched into the most incredible version of the song I've ever heard. As they sang, Bud tap danced in his seat in time to the music. Nobody missed a beat. \n \nAs soon as the song ended, the guys launched into another -Bud's favorite - \"Sideways.\" When it was over, there was commotion at the front of the bus as more equipment was loaded in and I thought for certain that it was time for the guys to take the stage. \n \n\"So, Bud,\" Dierks said, as he walked to the front of the bus to collect a large box that had just been delivered. \"The guys and I were thinking that we wanted you to have something so you'd always remember this day.\" \n \n Are you kidding?  I thought to myself.  This child will never forget a MOMENT of this day. \n \n But Dierks continued. \"So we wanted you to have something special, that was one of a kind - something that nobody else had.\" \n \n\"Okay,\" said Bud, who clearly had no idea where this could be headed. \n \nThen Dierks opened the carton and lifted out a beautiful guitar designed with a Dierks Bentley  Feel That Fire  skin. \n \n\"Wow!\" Bud and I said together. \n \n\"So, we were thinking,\" Dierks went on, \"that we could all write our names on it for you. And then no one else would ever have one just like it. Would that be okay?\" \n \n\"Sure,\" said Bud. Then Dierks handed him the guitar, and he held it like a real musician as each of the guys stooped down and added his autograph. \n \nI thought I might swallow my tongue. \n \nI tried to gush. I tried to say  something . But this moment was not about me. This moment was about them - all of them. And it was a truly incredible moment. \n \nAnd then, as soon as the last name was on the guitar, it was time for the show. \n \n\"So, Bud,\" Dierks said, \"will you walk us out to the stage?\" \n \n\"Sure,\" said Bud. And then he walked hand-in-hand with Dierks in the middle of the pack as the cheers from the audience grew closer. \n \nWhen they reached the stage, Dierks said, \"Okay, Bud. We always huddle to say a prayer and a cheer before we go on stage. Will you join us for it?\" \n \nAnd he did. \n \nThen, one by one, each of the guys took the stage as the audience went wild, until only three of us were left backstage. \n \n\"Okay, Bud,\" Dierks said. \"I just need your help with one more thing.\" \n \nThen they climbed the stage stairs hand-in-hand and Dierks grabbed a microphone, leaned down and said to Bud, so that the whole audience could hear: \"Does anybody want to get Sideways?\" \n \nThen the band started playing, and Dierks took the stage, and the audience went completely out of their minds. \n \nBud and I stood in stunned silence for seconds. \n \nAnd then, as the show continued, Bud totally lost it. In fairness to Bud, I'll skip the details on that, but if you live with a child with autism, then you can probably fill in the blanks. It might have been the incredible volume, or that it was already long past bedtime, or that he had to share his new friend with an enormous crowd of people, or simply that he had held it together so beautifully for so long through so much that day, that now that we were alone and it was safe to let it out, the intensity of his emotions spilled over in the only way it knew how, and he melted. \n \nLuckily, because we all had a hunch that this might happen, Dierks had told me to feel free to head back to the bus if we needed to, so that's exactly what we did. From the bus, we could still hear the show in the distance, but Bud had some privacy to let his emotions escalate and play out. By the time the band was starting their final song - \"Free and Easy\" - Bud was spent, but was even again. I suggested that we walk outside to hear the last song, so we listened to it from behind the stage as I started wondering how in the world I was going to get Bud to leave Dierks without prompting a repeat of the emotional meltdown we'd just experienced. \n \nWhen the song ended, the guys left the stage and headed back to the bus, and Bud and I lingered outside as I tried to develop a game plan. I decided to try to stay as close to our regular bedtime routine as I could, and hope for the best. \n \n\"You know, Bud,\" I said, \"it's really getting late. It's about time to put on your pajamas and head back home.\" \n \nWe went back to the bus, where the guys looked about as exhausted as we were, and told them it was almost time for us to leave. Bud and I headed to the back, where he changed into his pajamas, took his medicine, and called his dad. Then I packed his clothes in his backpack and looked up to speak to him - but he wasn't there. Robbie pointed me to the front of the bus, where I found Bud and Dierks side by side, both looking like they'd had a long day. \n \nI told Bud it was time to go, and he said goodbye to the guys and packed up his gifts - which now included the drumsticks Steve had played with that night, a guitar pick from Rod, and a couple of t-shirts from Dierks. Dierks carried the prized guitar out to our car, loaded it into our trunk and then loaded Bud into the backseat, where his pillow and blanket were waiting. \n \n\"I had a great time, Bud,\" Dierks told him. \"Thanks for coming to visit. We'll do it again next time we're here.\" \n \n\"Thanks, Dierks,\" Bud said. And that was that. We pulled out of the fairground, and Bud was asleep before we hit the highway. \n \nWhen I got home, I found two new e-mails from Cassidy in my inbox. She'd sent the first one in the afternoon, twenty minutes before we were scheduled to meet.  \"I'm really hoping it goes well,\"  she wrote,  \"but no matter what happens, I'm really glad you guys are trying it.\"  And she'd sent the second after we left the fairground:  \"Just got the play-by-play... wanted you to know that my heart is so happy...\" \n \nThe next day, Bud was in a daze, as though he couldn't quite believe that it had all actually happened. But in the days and weeks that followed, it became clear that the experience had been powerful for Bud. He moved with a new kind of confidence. In the early weeks, he'd often ask \"Dierks is my friend?,\" but as time passed, so did his perspective, and now, almost daily, out of the blue, he makes a declarative statement: \"Dierks is my friend.\" \n \nIt may seem like a small thing, until you realize that Bud has never really been interested in having a friend before. We refer to the other kids at school as his friends.  They  call  him  a friend. But he's never really been  interested  in having a friend. He's refused the idea of playdates and, when asked, he's named his friends as Mom, Dad, Nana, and Papa. Until now. Now he has Dierks. And Chris. And Rod, and Tim, and Robbie, and Steve. Now, he calls people friends. Now he knows how cool it is to have friends. And, my hunch is, now he is probably on track to want more of them. \n \nI've thought a lot over the past weeks and months about the transformative power of friendship. I've thought about the kind of friendship that Dierks and Bud developed - the kind of camaraderie that's created when two strangers \"click.\" I've thought about the kind of friendship I have with Cassidy - the same kind that I have with so many of you, who I know only through my computer screen, but to whom I feel connected at the heart. And I've thought about how those friendships affect us, anchor us, empower us, change us. \n \nI've also been reminded about the power of kindness - about the power of doing something not because we  must , but simply because we  can -  about how when that kind of kindness goes out into the universe, it doesn't just add up; it doesn't just multiply. It compounds exponentially. It transforms. \n \nSo. \n \nThat's the story. It's astounding, right? I told you it would be. Thanks for sticking with it. Thanks for sticking with me. Thanks for sticking with  us . \n \nNow, please - go download some Dierks Bentley music. \n \nAnd, really - I mean it. Believe me when I say this, and then go out and say it to somebody else: \n \nPlease let me know if there's ever anything I can do. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ePQukxV_PvU/SvYtyYMUCQI/AAAAAAAAAyQ/it4YqEI2LrM/s1600-h/100_0365.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ePQukxV_PvU/SvYvD77ycjI/AAAAAAAAAyY/IQNWwsP0rKs/s1600-h/100_0368(1).JPG", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ePQukxV_PvU/SvYv0hyUtUI/AAAAAAAAAyg/aaned_dvpM8/s1600-h/100_0382.JPG", "http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss?url=search-alias%3Ddigital-music&field-keywords=with+the+band+dierks", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ePQukxV_PvU/SvYwJogTpPI/AAAAAAAAAyo/c7vKYb4du0U/s1600-h/100_0364.JPG"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2009/11/every-smile-memory-cassidy-dierks-and.html", "title": "\nEvery smile a memory: Cassidy, Dierks, and the transformative power of friendship\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 16, 2010", "body": "\nMost of the time, I feel like I'm parenting with a paper bag over my head, with no idea if I'm saying or doing the right thing. I like to believe that this has nothing to do with Bud's autism and that many parents feel like parenting is mostly just fumbling around in the dark, trying to minimize the damage you do, and hoping that, perhaps, by chance, you just might stumble into something good. And, man, when you stumble into the good stuff - wow, does it feel good. Bud's school is currently running their Winter Sports program on Fridays. Unlike  last year , Bud was absolutely sure which activity he wanted to choose: cross-country skiing. The team at school built a support plan and were ready to roll on the first day: he'd be skiing with his paraprofessional, Mrs. Nee, and a special educator, Mrs. Jamison, two women he trusts implicitly, along with the instructor and other children. When the time came, though, despite extensive preparation, the dramatic break in schedule proved to be too much for my routine-craving boy. Suffice it to say, it was a very difficult afternoon for everyone who was there, and Bud was sad and exhausted by the time he got home. I think he worried that he'd burned a bridge with Mrs. Nee, because on Monday - and every day for the rest of the week - instead of grumbling about not wanting to be at school, he met her at the door in the morning with a hug. The team made a plan for the following Friday, modifying his Winter Sports schedule in a way that didn't make it seem like he was being rewarded for difficult behavior. He switched to snowshoeing (at his request) with Mrs. Jamison - an activity that is more familiar and that doesn't require a bus ride. The team developed a social story that he read and discussed at school and at home, and he seemed happily ready for the next Winter Sports day. When the idea became reality, though, Bud balked and though his response wasn't as extreme as it had been the week before, it centered on the absence of Mrs. Nee - an absence he found so dysregulating that Mrs. Jamison opted to scrap the snowshoeing and move on to an even  less  challenging Plan B. Mrs. Jamison sent me an e-mail at work to fill me in on how the day had gone, and I called Bud on the phone as I drove home. We talked about what happened and I told him that we would need to keep talking about it, so that he would be ready for Winter Sports next week. \"Can Mrs. Nee do snowshoeing?\" he asked. \"I don't think so, Bud,\" I answered, not wanting to promise anything that might not be a possibility. \"She is supposed to go skiing.\" \"But could Mrs. Nee switch to snowshoeing?\" he asked. \"Can she do snowshoeing  instead  of skiing with everyone else?\" Inside my head, I was tap-dancing at the sophistication of his language and his ability to problem-solve and communicate his hypothetical ideas, but with my outside voice, I said, \"I just don't think so, Bud.\" \"Can I just stay at school and do work with Mrs. Nee while everyone else does Winter Sports?\" I was stunned by the idea that he would opt for  work  over  play  in any circumstance, but began to understand the depth of feeling he had surrounding the \"loss\" of Mrs. Nee for the afternoon. \"It's hard when Mrs. Nee isn't with you, huh, Bud?\" I asked. \"It makes me sad,\" he said. \"I'm sad because I miss Mrs. Nee. Can we ask her to do work with me?\" \"I'm not sure it's a choice, Bud,\" I said, silently scolding myself for using language that folds in on itself and is probably hard for him to understand. \"She might have to stay with skiing.\" \"But can I tell her?\" \"You can't tell her what to do,\" I said, \"but you can tell her how you're feeling.\" \"I can tell her how I'm feeling? I can tell Mrs. Nee that I feel sad?\" \"Yes, Bud,\" I said. \"It's  always  okay to talk about your feelings.\" \"Oh, THANK YOU, Mom,\" he said, the relief in his voice evident even through the phone. \"You make my heart happy.\" And, I'm sure I don't need to tell you,  that  was a parenting moment that made for  two  happy hearts.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/sad-boy-happy-heart.html", "title": "\nSad boy, happy heart\n"},

Thanks for chiming in. Here's another. This week, a colleague of mine brought in a twelve-pack of Pepsi Throwback. Have you heard about this product? It's a limited release brand of Pepsi that is made with real sugar, as it was before they switched to high fructose corn syrup in the early 1980s. My friend handed a can of Pepsi to anyone who'd take one, and when I cracked mine open, the smell that hit my nose transported me instantly to the 1970s. I don't remember the Pepsi formula changing. I'm not sure I even knew it happened. But, I'll tell you, the smell was unmistakable: it smelled like childhood. It started me thinking about the smells that bring me back. Like this: There's some kind of floor cleaner out there that, to me, smells strongly of green lollipops. I don't smell it often, but when I do, I am instantly walking through the side door of my elementary school. (As it turns out, according to  what I've been reading , it's not a very good sign that this is the sort of smell that triggers my childhood memories.  But, there you have it.) So, what are the smells that bring you back?

{"date": "Sunday, January 17, 2010", "body": "\nI just finished a weekend of training with our student staff and, as has become our tradition, we ended the weekend with a teambuilding exercise in which everyone contributed a song that represents them. We played a clip from each, tried to guess whose song it was, and then heard from the person who had actually chosen it about  why  they'd chosen that particular song. It's always a fascinating exercise, as it gives us all a sense of how well we can predict each other, who among us always keeps us guessing, and who no one seems to know at all. It's fascinating to hear the range of music that people choose - ballads, novelty songs, dance tracks, musical numbers, oldies, current hits, songs everyone knows, songs no one else has heard - as well as the reasons that people choose their songs. Some chose their favorite songs of all time. Some chose their current favorites. Some chose songs because of a lyric that is meaningful to them. Some chose songs from their childhoods. Some chose songs that represent their world view. Some chose songs that remind them of a person or a place or a time in their lives. Some chose songs specifically because they didn't think anyone would guess it was theirs. One even chose a song because it was the song that was playing when he got the e-mail telling him to choose a song. Each song - each staff member - had a story, and every one of them was interesting to hear. It got me thinking that it would be an interesting activity for any group of people to take on. So, if you're willing, post your song in the comments - what song best represents you and why? Post a link to the song if you can, so we can listen if we don't already know it. I'll go first, with the song I chose for our staff activity today. This was our fourth year using this exercise, and I've found that choosing a new song each year forces me to think about the year that has past since the last January training, about where I was then, and about where I am now. This year I chose the song \"Beautiful World,\" a duet by Dierks Bentley and Patty Griffin. I chose it because its message is one that resonates with me: there is a lot in this life that is challenging. There's a lot of pain and a lot of trouble. But there is also a lot of joy and a lot of beauty. I think that our lives get defined by the choice that we make to either focus on the trouble or focus on the beauty. And I choose to believe that it's a beautiful world. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/your-song.html", "title": "\nYour song\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2010", "body": "\nOne of the best things about blogging is that it captures moments in time, allowing me to go back to earlier posts and see what I saw  then  instead of relying on my memories of that time. It's especially helpful as I try to gauge Bud's development. As I often say, I try hard to avoid comparing Bud to his peers and instead try to compare him to himself. Having almost five years of blog posts to sort through can make the comparison a lot easier. In 2005, I wrote about a  victorious trip to the dentist . It was victorious even though very little actual tooth cleaning happened. In 2006, I wrote about  a difficult trip to the dentist , and about how Bud's iPod helped him manage the experience. You might want to go back and read those posts before you continue. Because Bud had a dentist appointment today. Bud and I sat in the waiting room of our fabulous pediatric dentist, him listening to his iPod and me filling out paperwork. While I was still completing the form, the hygienist came out and called his name. I started to gather our coats and bags when the hygienist said, \"Do you think he's ready to try coming in on his own?\" I was stunned. I knew that other parents waited outside while their kids went in - but  Bud ? Really? But the hygienist has worked with Bud before. She knew what to expect. She handed me a pager and said she'd buzz me when they were ready for me. I asked Bud if he'd go in while I stayed in the waiting room to finish the paperwork. Without hesitation he walked off happily with his hygienist as I sat and stared in amazement. When they'd gone through the office door, I looked at the seat next to me. Bud had left his iPod behind. I waited for them to come back out to retrieve it. They didn't. I finished the paperwork, then wondered what to do with myself. I could be reading a book,  I thought.  I could be sitting in a waiting room reading a book while my son gets his teeth cleaned. I am the sort of person who has the sort of child who can get his teeth cleaned while his mother is sitting in the waiting room reading a book. From behind the door, I heard a young child start to wail. I knew it wasn't Bud, but I also imagined that the sound would trigger panic in Bud. I stared at the pager, expecting it to start buzzing - expecting the hygienist to call in the cavalry. The pager was silent. When the pager finally sounded - after about the amount of time it takes to clean a child's teeth - I made my way back to join Bud in a bright and cheery orange room. The hygienist was giving him rides up and down in the dental chair while they waited for the dentist to come in and do a final check. Bud was calm and happy. So was the hygienist. We sat and chatted, then met with the dentist, and then set up an appointment for Bud in six months. The hygienist says he's ready now, so Bud will be getting x-rays. And I will be bringing a book.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/dazzling-smiles.html", "title": "\nDazzling smiles\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, January 23, 2010", "body": "\nSo, okay. As I promised yesterday, here is the back story on the  Dierks Bentley Hair Crisis of 2007  (and if you don't know what I'm talking about, then you can either click that link and backtrack a bit or just skip this post and come back and rejoin us here tomorrow). I'm not sure why I've never told you this story before. It must have happened at a time when I wasn't blogging much. Anyway, the solution to the mystery became clear sometime during the summer 0f 2008. At that time, Bud's communication skills had made some significant advances, allowing him to express more complex thoughts in more complex ways. Perhaps more importantly, he also had an increased desire to be understood - he could discern when I didn't understand what he was trying to say, and he was suddenly both more willing and better able to re-frame and rephrase until he knew that I'd received his message. (Even now, these are still emerging skills for Bud - but they are skills for him nonetheless.) So it was that one evening during the summer of 2008, Bud asked me, \"Remember when Dierks had long hair and he was a mean guy?\" I was stunned, so I started asking questions, and Bud started filling in the blanks. In order to understand the rest of the story, you need to watch two videos. The first is  the video for \"Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go) ,\" which was Dierks' single during the summer of 2007. That summer was a difficult time for our family, and Bud and I found solace - and a vehicle for connecting with each other - in country music. Country music was new to us and as we navigated through some rough waters in our life, it became our rudder - we could listen to it, learn about it, and talk about it together, and in so doing, remind ourselves that no matter what else was going on in our lives, we could always listen and learn and talk with each other. \"Free and Easy\" became an instant favorite for both of us, and we watched the video together a lot. And when I say \"a lot, \" I mean A LOT. Because we were new to country music, we were also new to Dierks Bentley, so the guy in this video was the only Dierks Bentley we knew. And he was already achieving hero status for Bud. What I didn't realize until Bud explained it to me in the summer of 2008, is that the  second  Dierks Bentley video we watched in the summer of 2007 - and the one you need to watch all the way through right now if you want to understand the rest of the story - was  the video for \"Long Trip Alone .\" In Bud's mind, this video featured two people - the repentant, respectful, hard-working, kind-hearted, short-haired Dierks who was a GOOD guy, and the surly, angry, hard-drinking, bar-fighting, long-haired Dierks who was a MEAN guy. The video's story was confusing for Bud, because his linear mind didn't grasp the concept of flashback, but, more importantly, the  meaning  of the video was lost because he didn't understand the concept of  acting.  In his mind, after watching that video, it became clear that the short-haired \"Free and Easy\" Dierks was still a hero, but the long-haired \"Long Trip Alone\" beer-fighter was to be avoided at all cost. Imagine his dismay, then, when we started watching other videos and he discovered that the long-haired mean guy sang all the other songs. As time passed, and as Dierks  reached out  and showed Bud what a truly nice guy he was, Bud came around to the long hair, but it was really in the spirit of forgiving Dierks his past meanness. Once I understood Bud's confusion, though, I was able to explain to him what music videos are, what acting is, and how Dierks was just  pretending  to be in a fight. Bud was relieved to know that the men in the bar were really Dierks' friends, that none of it actually happened, and that Dierks is a nice guy no matter how long his hair is. Bud still catalogues Dierks' music by hair length in the files of his mind - so, \"Lot of Leaving Left To Do\" is \"old curly hair,\" \"Sweet and Wild\" is \"short hair,\" \"Sideways\" is \"new curly hair,\" and, I imagine, if my supposition regarding yesterday's photograph is correct, the bluegrass album Dierks is currently working on will become \"new short hair.\" But it's all good. It was an amazing feeling when things finally clicked - when Bud was able to explain to me what was bothering him and I was able to reconstruct reality in a way that allayed his fears. But it also made me wonder what other misperceptions and misunderstandings color his view of people, of places, of life? What other imaginary hurdles are standing in his way? And what are the questions I need to ask to get those conversations started?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLcCl0D9jyY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yNXsWm-vKs"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/little-hairstory.html", "title": "\nA little hairstory\n"},

I cleared up the first concern quickly: He was better. He was going to school tomorrow. The end. I had to be a bit more delicate with the second. \"Mrs. Nee misses me?\" he asked. \"Yes, I'm sure she did miss you, Bud,\" I answered. \"She said, 'Oh, where is Bud?'\" \"Well...\" \"Did she cried? She said  (sob, sob, sob)  I miss Bud.\" \"Well, no, honey, she didn't cry.\" \"She missed me?\" \"Well, I'm sure she missed you, honey. But she didn't cry. She knows you're coming back, just like when  she's  not at school, you know that  she'll  be coming back.  She knows you're coming back, so she's not sad.\" While he processed that, I changed the subject and let him know I'd made an appointment for him with the eye doctor, because his pediatrician thinks he might need glasses.

{"date": "Friday, January 29, 2010", "body": "\nAs  I've mentioned , I'm currently reading Lev Grossman's latest book,  The Magicians . I'm bringing it up again because in the last couple of chapters, I've twice come upon adverbs that made me stop reading and start thinking. Here they are in context: \"Penny could be defensive when he was under attack, but he was so autistically focused right now that even direct mockery bounced off him.\" (249) \"Penny was nodding and rocking his whole body forward and backward semi-autistically.\" (260) It should be noted that the character Penny is not, in fact, autistic - or, at least, is not identified as such. I keep re-reading these sentences, because I'm not sure what I think of them - I'm not sure how I feel about \"autistically\" being used as an adverb to describe something other than autism. I don't think these adverbs are being used in a way that denigrates the character Penny - Grossman is not using \"autistically\" to mean \"inappropriate\" or \"inadequate.\" In the first sentence, he is simply characterizing the kind of focus one often sees in a person with autism. In the second, he is characterizing a kind of movement. (Though \"semi\" autistically? I'm not even sure what that means.) Part of me feels like this is okay - perhaps even  good -  as it simply conveys the message that acting \"autistically\" is just one of many ways of acting - not inherently good or inherently bad. Just one of many options. Another part of me is unsettled by the use of the word in this way, and I'm not even sure why. I am reminded, though, of Grossman's earlier book,  Codex , in which there was a supporting character who was autistic. He was smart and technologically savvy, and I spent the book waiting for his autism to emerge as a critical plot point. It never did. He just happened to be a character who happened to be autistic. The character in  Codex  and the incidental nature of his autism was reassuring to me. But the \"autisticallys\" in  The Magicians  are throwing me.

I'll just say that everything that was on the bed at the time ended up in the washing machine. It was an interesting morning, as we focused on slow re-hydration, avoiding solid foods and postponing his morning medication. By noon, he was re-hydrated, but, with no medication in his system, he was unable to slow himself down. At noon, he told me, \"I need to walk.\" And he started walking at a fast clip around the house, up the stairs, down the stairs, through each room, throughout the house, walking, walking, walking, and scripting, scripting, scripting from a variety of Elmo's World segments all at the same time:  Does a birthday cake draw? No, but you can draw on a birthday cake. Does a pineapple have a birthday? No, but you can eat pineapple at a birthday party. What sings and what doesn't? A birthday cake, a mailbox, or some children? What has hands and what doesn't?  Does a lion have hands? What grows in the ground? A carrot, a mailbox, or... This went on - and I am not exaggerating - for 90 minutes, during which I was able to get him to slow down long enough to take small bites of dry toast so that he'd have something in his stomach along with the medication I knew I had to give him. Afraid that the movement, toast and meds might be too much for his tummy, I made Bud lie down, and after half an hour of Elmo's World scripting in bed, he fell fast asleep and slept for the rest of the afternoon. He was in good spirits this evening, and had, in fact, done a turn-around regarding school tomorrow. This morning, he lifted his head from the toilet long enough to tell me, \"I guess I won't be going to school on Monday.\" But this evening on his way to bed, he thought it might be a good idea to go to school tomorrow. He has a hunch that his illness will make for a good story and will garner a lot of sympathy and support from Mrs. Nee, who, he tells me, will say, \"Oh, no! That's terrible!\" And, of course, he doesn't want to miss that. But time will tell, and we'll see how the evening goes and how he looks in the morning. He's sleeping now, and within minutes, I will be, too. It has been a very long day. (That was your cue. Everybody, now: \"Oh, no!

It's like how you don't notice that your child is growing in tiny increments week by week until the day you look at him and realize that all of his pants are two inches too short. Sometimes you just focus on the day-to-day, taking each presenting issue as it comes, reacting and responding to each incident as a stand-alone, not thinking about what it all means when taken together, until the incidents build up enough to turn into a two-by-four that bonks you over the head and you finally get it. Or maybe that's not how it is for you. That's how it is for me. I've noticed a whole bunch of things from Bud over the past weeks - or maybe months - that I only viewed in isolation. Like, I mean, I  noticed  how often I'd find him in front of the computer in his underwear, drawn to PBS Kids even though he was in the middle of getting dressed for the day. There have been  lots  of times when he's wandered downstairs, leaving his grandfather waiting for him in the playroom. Then, when I've asked,\"Hey, what'd you do with Papa?,\" he'd say \"Whoops!\" and run back upstairs with a grin. I've found myself commenting to my mom that he's suddenly started running laps around the house in mid-meal, mid-television show, mid-conversation, mid- everything , the way he did when he was a toddler. I can't  count  the number of times he's run upstairs to get something... then never returned with the thing in hand. I have grown accustomed to the monologue I deliver every time I give him his medication, which must be delivered in three spoons full of jello: \"Here you go. Wait, wait, wait. - don't go away - here's another. Good job. Wait, stay here, stay here, stay here. Bud,  come back here!  Okay, here you go.\" It began to strike me this weekend when he sat down to make a list for school of all the things he'd done since Friday. He started writing \"Sang song to Papa,\" got as far as the \"S-a-n,\" then was off to retrieve the CD that had the song that he sang, while he sang me the song that he sang and showed me the dance that accompanied the song that he sang and told me how much Papa loved hearing the song that he sang, all while I tried to redirect him back to the page with a feeble \"and what letter comes next?\" But I didn't really  get  it - the puzzle pieces didn't all fall together - the trees didn't become a thick, green forest - until this morning, when he sang and spun and talked and talked and talked his way through the morning, then dashed past Mrs. Nee as she met him at the school door and immediately started running laps around the cafeteria as I gave her a quick recap of our morning. He didn't stop running to say goodbye, and instead just blew me a kiss from across the room as he ran and ran and ran. That  is when the two-by-four bonked me: I think his ADHD meds might be two inches too short.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/02/forest-for-trees.html", "title": "\nForest for the trees\n"},

And sometimes, those lyrics get stuck in his head, and he says them out loud.\" \"When I get a song stuck in my head,\" said Nathan, \"I just try to concentrate on something really hard, like a math problem or something, to try to get the song out of my head.\" \"That's great,\" I said. \"When  I  get a song stuck in my head, it's really hard for me to think about something like a math problem, because the song keeps getting in the way.\" The students murmured with further recognition, sharing their own experience with song lyrics and distractibility. \"When I have a song in my head,\" said Kelly, \"I'll start writing and I'll write down the words to the song.\" \"That's another strategy to get the song out of your head,\" I said. \"I think what Kelly  means ,\" Ms. Walker offered, \"is that she starts writing the words to the song  instead  of the thing she's trying to write, without realizing that she's doing it.\" Kelly nodded enthusiastically. \"Oh!\" I said. \"Yes. When a song is stuck in our heads, we have to try to concentrate on two things at once. Sometimes the math problem gets our attention, and sometimes the song does. And remember Bud's great memory? He has a LOT of songs and a LOT of scripts in his head, that are trying to get his attention. \"Here's another question: how many of you have a favorite song?\" Hands shot up quickly. \"Does it make you feel good to sing your favorite song?\" They nodded and agreed that yes, in fact, it  did  make them feel good to sing their favorite songs. \"It makes Bud feel good, too. Sometimes, he just says his scripts out loud because it makes him feel good.\" Tomorrow:  Question #4 - Why does Bud run in circles? Why does he need movement breaks? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/03/sing-out-loud-sing-out-strong.html", "title": "\nSing out loud, sing out strong\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 30, 2010", "body": "\nAt 5:00 this morning, I thought it would be a good idea to take advantage of the fact that it was Saturday and sleep in a bit.  Bud had other ideas, though, and was up and about, checking in with me every four to six minutes to see if it was time for breakfast yet. We finally got ourselves up and moving (by which I mean, I finally got myself up and moving) and we had a nice morning at home.  After lunch, we headed out for an afternoon of errands.  Our first stop was the pharmacy, but when I pulled into the parking lot and looked in the rear view mirror, I saw that Bud was out cold.  I decided to let him sleep, since he'd been up so early, and I left the car running so the inside would be toasty warm as he snoozed.  After about a half hour, I realized that this wasn't just a catnap, and when I saw my friend Kiki in the parking lot, I was happy to roll down the window to talk to her, letting the arctic air flow into the car, hoping it would start to revive Bud. He slumbered on. After another fifteen minutes, I turned off the car.  I opened the door and let the \"your keys are in the ignition\" bell chime.  I called Bud's name. He didn't move. I knew that if I woke him and tried to carry on with our errands, I would cause an avalanche of difficult behavior and would wish I were back in the car with a sleeping boy.  I abandoned our errands, started the car back up, and drove home. By the time we pulled into the garage, Bud had been asleep for nearly two hours.  I woke him gently and he stumbled out of the car and into the house.  He fumbled out of his jacket, then fell face first onto the couch and fell back to sleep. Two hours later, well past the time he normally has dinner, I woke him gently, and he got up to eat. Then he discovered just how refreshing a long afternoon nap can be. Bud normally goes to bed by 8:00 p.m.  He takes nighttime medication that normally makes him sleepy. I gave him his regular meds around 8:15.  It's currently 9:30. He's acting like it's noon. This ought to be an interesting night.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/upside-down-and-backwards.html", "title": "\nUpside down and backwards\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 17, 2010", "body": "\n\"So, okay,\" I said, moving on to the next topic. \"'Why do noises bother Bud?' Well, we said that our brains control all of our senses, and that means that sometimes Bud's hair-dryer-brain senses are different from our toaster-brain senses. \"Remember when we talked about things that Bud is really good at? We said he has great hearing. We said that  sometimes  his hearing is even better than ours.\" The children nodded. \"Well, sometimes that great hearing doesn't feel so great to him. Because he hears everything so well, sometimes the things that are just background noise to the rest of us are really distracting to him. \"Imagine if you were sitting at your desk working on a math problem, and people were having a quiet conversation over there in the corner. It might be a little distracting, but you could probably tune it out and do your math. But imagine if, because of the way your brain was wired, that quiet conversation sounded like someone was shouting in your ear. Would you still be able to concentrate on your math?\" They shook their heads. \"No you probably wouldn't be able to concentrate very well. And that\u2019s how it can feel for Bud. With his great hair-dryer brain hearing, he hears EVERYTHING that\u2019s going on, very clearly, and all at the same time \u2013 from people talking in the corner, to the sound of the light buzzing, to the sound of a car driving by outside, to the noises from other classrooms, to the sound of someone next to him tapping a pencil on the desk. He hears it  all , which makes it really hard for him to focus on his work. So what do you think he uses to try to block out some of those noises?\" \"His earplugs,\" Molly offered. \"Or his headphones,\" Keelin added. \"Or his fingers,\" said Ms. Walker, putting her fingers in her ears. \"Or, if his hands are busy,\" I said, \"then, his shoulders.\" I cocked my head to the side and covered one ear with my shoulder, striking what I knew was a classic Bud pose. \"Have you seen him do that?\" They agreed that they had, and then offered their own experiences with distractibility, especially, they reported, given how NOISY some nearby classrooms could be. Not surprisingly, I found that attention and focus were issues that were not unique to Bud. \"So,\" I said, trying to rein in the wandering minds and bring back a little focus, \"having his earplugs really helps Bud to have the quiet he needs to do work. But there are some noises that REALLY bother Bud. Do you know what any of those noises are?\" They knew, and they brainstormed the list quickly: \"He doesn't like 'BOO!'\" \"Fire alarms.\" \"He didn't like the assembly where they were making banging noises.\" \"He doesn't like thunderstorms.\" \"That's exactly right,\" I said. \"He doesn't like loud noises that happen all of a sudden. And the reason he doesn't like them is that his brain reacts differently to them than your brain probably does. \"Imagine if you were in a haunted house and all of a sudden somebody jumped out and scared you. What would happen?\" The children all started talking at once. \"That's right,\" I said. \"You would scream, you would jump, your heart would beat fast. And that would all happen because your brain told your body to react that way. You wouldn't stop and think to yourself, 'Hmmm... somebody has just jumped out at me when I wasn't expecting it. I think I'll scream and try to run away.'\" The children laughed. \"If somebody suddenly jumped out at you, your toaster brain would just automatically send a \u201cDANGER\u201d warning to your body, and your body would react instantly. But Bud\u2019s hair dyer brain sometimes sends those \u201cDANGER\u201d warnings to his body when things aren\u2019t really dangerous. So, when there are loud noises that he\u2019s not expecting \u2013 babies crying, dogs barking, thunder, the fire alarm \u2013 his brain sends a \u201cDANGER\u201d warning to his body, and his body panics just the way yours would if somebody jumped out at you in a haunted house. \"Sometimes you might see Bud covering his ears even when there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of noise going on. Have you noticed that?\" They said that they had. \"You might  especially  see it when he\u2019s going into a new place, or when he's in a big crowd of people, or when he\u2019s doing something new or something that's not part of his regular routine. \"Here's a question for you: Have you ever watched a scary movie?\" I asked. \"YES!\" they replied. \"And have you ever gotten to a part in the movie when you  thought  something scary might happen, but you weren\u2019t sure? You wanted to keep watching the movie, but you didn\u2019t want to be surprised and have your brain send that \u201cDANGER\u201d warning to your body?\" \"YES!\" they replied, laughing. \"So what did you do?\" I asked. \"I kind of covered my eyes,\" said Kelly. I looked around and saw that, throughout the room, children had their hands over their eyes, but were peeking out between their fingers. I put my hands over my eyes and peeked out at them. \"Of course!\" I said, still peeking through my fingers. \"You  kind of  cover your eyes, so you can still see what's going on. But if something scary happens, you know you'll be able to  coverthemreallyquick !\" I slapped my hands over my eyes, and the children laughed again. \"That\u2019s what Bud is doing when he puts his fingers in his ears, or when he covers one ear, in a new situation. He\u2019s not sure  what  to expect in that new situation or with those new people, and he's not sure if something is going to happen that will give his body that \u201cDANGER\u201d warning. So he gets himself ready to block his ears quickly, just in case.\" I heard soft \"ooooh\"s and saw nodding throughout the room. Coming up next:  Question #6 - Why does Bud miss his mom so much?

This is the way I think about the answer to those questions. \"Remember how we said that our brains control everything our body does? Well, our brains also control our senses. Can anyone tell me what the five senses are?\" The child directly across the room from me, who asked to be identified as \"The Amazing Platypus\" if I wrote about him on the blog, raised his hand and I called on him. \"Okay,\" he said, \"there's hearing, and seeing, and feeling.... and, um... tasting, and.... wait, how many was that?\" \"That was four,\" Ms. Walker answered. \"And, um,\" continued The Amazing Platypus. \"Wait, which ones did I say?\" \"You missed smell,\" his classmates reminded. \"Yeah!\" he responded. \"And smelling!\" \"That's right,\" I said. \"Sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell.

So, what do you do when that happens? Show me what you do when your foot feels all tingly.\" The kids started shaking their feet and tapping and stomping on the floor, and I shook, tapped and stomped along with them. \"And then,\" I said, speaking up over the stomping, \"what if the tingling gets worse? What if your whole LEG gets tingly?\" They shook and stomped faster and harder. \"And THEN,\" I said, even louder, \"what if your whole BODY feels all pins-and-needles?\" They laughed as I stood up and shook all over, trying to work out my imaginary pins and needles. \"And THEN,\" I said, still stomping and shaking and wiggling, \"what if somebody came along and asked you to do MATH?\" The class erupted in laughter, and I sat back down. \"I think that's how it feels for Bud when he has to sit in the same place for a long time,\" I said. \"So, when that happens, what do you think he needs to do?\" \"Take a movement break!\" they answered. \"That's right,\" I said. \"He needs to get up and move or run around in circles for a while until his body feels normal again, and then he can sit down and do his work.\" Coming up:  Question #5 - Why do noises bother Bud? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/03/shake-your-sillies-out.html", "title": "\nShake your sillies out\n"},

And some of you asked why he gets so attached to some adults at school and always wants to be with them. \"Remember how I said that two of the things that Bud's hair-dryer brain has trouble with are using language and being social with people? Well, those two differences can make places like school  really  hard for Bud, because in school, most toaster-brain kids spend LOTS and LOTS of time talking with people and being with their friends. Bud is not always sure how to do those things - they're things that feel like making toast with a hair-dryer - and that can make school a hard place to be.\" The kids nodded, and I continued. \"Imagine what it would feel like,\" I said, \"if one day you came to school, and suddenly everything was happening in a different language. Everybody was speaking French.\" I looked up and caught the eye of  The Amazing Platypus , whose face brightened as he raised his hand - which reminded me that The Amazing Platypus comes from a bilingual family and speaks fluent French. \"No, wait,\" I said to The Amazing Platypus. \"Not French. Everyone was speaking Japanese.\" The Amazing Platypus' face fell. I glanced around the room to make sure there were no other suddenly brightening faces. There weren't. \"Yes, everyone was speaking Japanese. Your teachers taught all of your lessons in Japanese. All of the other kids were speaking Japanese. You couldn't understand what anyone was saying, and they couldn't understand you. The kids were playing Japanese games that you'd never played before. Everybody was  really  nice to you and they invited you to play, but you didn't know how to play the games and it was hard to learn because they were explaining the rules to you in Japanese. You could  kind of  tell what was going on , but you also knew you were missing a lot of things. And you knew you had to work a whole lot harder than everybody else just to get a little bit done \u2013 because you didn\u2019t speak Japanese.\" The children voiced a range of reactions, from mild amusement to abject horror. \"Then imagine that someone showed up at school who spoke BOTH Japanese AND English. They understood you, they could help other people understand you, and they could help you understand other people.\" \"I would be so RELIEVED!\" Zoe said, her voice filled with genuine emotion. \"I bet you would,\" I said. \"How about the rest of you? Would you feel relieved, too?\" They all agreed that they'd be delighted to have an interpreter arrive. \"And then,\" I said, \"how would you feel if that person had to leave, and you were all alone with people speaking Japanese again?\" \"Oh no,\" came the chorus of responses. \"That would be  terrible !\" \"That\u2019s how Bud feels every day when he has to say goodbye to me.\" Their faces registered sudden understanding. \"Bud knows that I understand him. I know his scripts and I know what they mean. I can guess what will be difficult for him, and I can find ways to make them easier. And when I leave him at the door every morning, he feels like I'm leaving him in a school full of people who are speaking Japanese. \"So, he tries to find other people who can fill in for me when I'm gone - people who can help him understand and be understood by all of you Japanese-speaking toaster-brain kids. And when he finds someone who can help him \u2013 someone like Mrs. Nee \u2013 he gets really attached to them and he wants to be with them as much as possible.\" Next:  Question #7 - How can I be a better friend to Bud?

{"date": "Sunday, March 14, 2010", "body": "\nIt occurs to me that I left out a critical piece of information that you'll need if you want to have an accurate mental picture of the circle of children and teachers I faced in Bud's classroom last week. You see, I forgot to mention that, quite by coincidence, I was meeting with the class on the school's annual Wacky Hair Day. Bud came to school for Wacky Hair Day wearing the backwards-cap-with-sewn-in-wig that we'd made last Halloween for his  Dierks Bentley  costume. (Did I mention that Bud was Dierks for Halloween?) He was greeted at the door by Mrs. Nee, in a deep purple wig (\"Your  favorite color , Bud!\"), and Lilly, her hair splayed from the top of her head and sprayed with red coloring and glitter. So, on this day, as I sat with Bud's class to talk about the  very weighty  issue of autism, I'd look up and see the supportive face of Mrs. Nee, looking like a Doodlebop, the affirming nods of Ms. Walker, in a 1976 hairstyle that would have made Farrah Fawcett proud, and a circle full of children whose hair was sticking up, or green, or fluffy, or rainbowed, or pointy, or even - as Kayleigh's was - adorned with crayons attached by microscopic elastic bands. There were even a few children who didn't have wacky hair, making their normal appearances seem just a little bit out of place. Could there have been a more perfect environment in which to talk about my child's differences? And so, my foundational analogy successfully delivered, I began addressing some of the common questions that the children had asked about Bud's behavior. The first: Why does Bud repeat things from TV? \"Remember how I told you that language is one of the things that's difficult for people with autism?\" I asked the wacky-haired, toaster-brained group, who nodded enthusiastically. \"Well, that has been true for Bud ever since he was really little. He learned to talk in a very different way from most people. \"Most people learn to talk by learning one word at a time - like, first they say \u201cMama,\u201d and then they say \u201cjuice.\u201d And then, when they get a little bit older, they start to put words together and they say things like \u201cJuice, Mama?\u201d For most of us, our brains automatically learn to talk that way. \"But Bud didn\u2019t learn to talk that way. When he was really little, around the time that most of you were saying \"Juice, Mama?,\" Bud didn't talk at all. When he wanted juice, he just walked over to me and handed me his cup. \"And then, as he got older and he started to use words, he didn't use one word at a time. He used his great memory to learn whole sentences that he would repeat back. So I would ask \u201cDo you want some juice?\u201d and Bud would reply \u201cDo you want some juice?\u201d And his brain learned that the words you say when you want juice are \"Do you want some juice?\" \"So, later, when he wanted juice, he would just walk up to me, hand me his cup, and say \u201cDo you want some juice?\u201d And I would know what he wanted. This way of talking is called echolalia. It\u2019s similar to the word 'echo' \u2013 hearing the same thing back after you say it.\" I heard some soft wows and ohs around the room. I think I heard a few light bulbs click on. \"Now, remember how we said that one of the things that Bud's brain is REALLY good at remembering things? Remember how I said he can remember whole TV shows after he\u2019s only seen them a couple of times? That was true even when he was really little. So, once Bud learned that saying things like \"Do you want some juice?\" could  actually  get him some juice, he started exploring the other chunks of language that he knew, to see how he might be able to use that, too. \"In other words, when he wanted to say something, it was  really  hard for him to try to put words together to make sentences, but it was very  easy  for him to think of scripts from TV shows that were about the things he wanted to talk about. \"As Bud got older, he learned to swap out words from scripts \u2013 he'd take out the words that didn\u2019t fit, and put in words that fit better. And as he got even  older , he started learning how to put sentences together the same way that you do - he started learning how to make language toast with his hair dryer brain. \"Now, Bud can do both kinds of talking \u2013 putting his own sentences together and using scripts. But because of the way his brain works, it is still easier for him to use scripts. \"It\u2019s especially easier for Bud to use scripts when he is feeling very strong emotions. When Bud is feeling sad, or angry, or frustrated, his brain is busy trying to deal with those feelings, so he doesn\u2019t have a lot of extra energy to try to put words together. Instead, he finds the words that somebody from TV was using when  they  felt the way he is feeling. \"So, how many of you have ever seen Bud get angry and heard him say 'That\u2019s it! I\u2019m leaving!'?\u201d I shouted out the words with the tone and inflection that I knew were classic Bud. Every hand shot up. \"Yeah, he says that a lot, doesn't he? That\u2019s Minnie Mouse from The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. She was REALLY angry and REALLY frustrated. \"Sometimes, when he\u2019s frustrated because he can\u2019t get what he wants, he might use a script from Dragon Tales. It\u2019s from a show where Zak and Wheezie want to play the wolf in a puppet show of The 3 Little Pigs. If they can\u2019t be the wolf, they don\u2019t want to play. So they say \u201cNo WOLF, no Zak and Wheezie!\u201d But Bud usually changes the words when he uses that script. So on a day when he's frustrated because Mrs. Nee tells him it's not snack time, you might hear him say in the very same way as Zak and Wheezie, 'No SNACK, no Bud-NOS.' \"But, as I said, when his emotions are really strong or really difficult, he usually doesn\u2019t change the words at all. He just uses the words from the script because they  really  capture the emotion he\u2019s feeling. \"So if you hear him say something and the words don't match what's going on at all, don't think about the words he's using. Try to think about the  feeling  that might go along with those words, and it might help you understand why Bud is saying them. Sometimes, you can even ask him, 'Bud, who said that? What made them say that?' And very often, he will explain it to you.\" A thoughtful silence filled the room.

Bud the rebel. Bud the 'tween hero. \"So, you see?\" I said. \"It's just like I told you before - you already ARE good friends to Bud, just by sticking with him and letting him know that who he is, is just fine with you.\" Noelle  raised her hand, with a far-away look in her eyes. \"I was just wondering,\" she said. \"Do you think Bud  knows  he's different?\" \"I think he does,\" I answered, \"but I don't think it bothers him.\" Then, silently, I added,  And thanks for making that point so beautifully, Noelle.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 23, 2010", "body": "\nI wrapped up my presentation by thanking the kids for inviting me in to talk with them, and I asked if they had any questions. \"Is 'The Upside Down Show' a real show?\" Noelle asked. \"It sure is,\" I said. \"It's on Nick Jr., and Bud loves it.\" Laurie raised her hand, \"What show is it from when Bud points his finger in the Name Cup at morning meeting and says 'Mrs. Nee! Mrs. Nee!'\" The children laughed with recognition. \"Hmm,\" I said. \"I'm not sure...\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Nee. \"And then he says 'Closer! Closer! Closer!'\" \"Ooooh!\" I said. \"I think that's from Oobi. That's another Nick Jr. show. Oobi and his friends are hands.\" I made my hands talk to each other. \"You might see him doing this with his hands sometimes. He's doing Oobi.\" \"What was your most memorable moment with Bud?\" Noelle asked. \"Wow, that's a tough one,\" I said. \" All  of my moments with Bud are memorable. He's my favorite person in the world. I don't think I could choose one.\" \"What about your most hilarious moment?\" asked Max. \"I'd like to hear about  your  hilarious moments with Bud!\" I said. Nathan raised his hand. \"Does Bud ever wish he had a brother or sister?\" \"You know,\" I said, \"I'm not sure about that. It's not something he talks about. He doesn't like babies, because they're so loud, so I think he'd move out if I brought a baby home.\" The kids laughed. \"But he would like a dog.\" I heard a reaction on the other side of the circle and looked over to see shocked expressions of the faces of some girls who have known Bud for several years. \"I KNOW!\" I said. \"He used to be  really  afraid of dogs. But now he likes dogs so much, he'll ask people he doesn't know if he can pet their dogs.\" There were soft \"wow\"s around the room, and then Sean, who'd just returned from recess, raised his hand. \"How did that happen?\" he asked. \"What made him stop being afraid of dogs?\" \"I'm not exactly sure,\" I told him. \"I think that being introduced to dogs little by little over a long time helped him get used to them. All of those little changes turned into a big change.\" The girls nodded in agreement and offered: \"Yes!\" and \"That's a REALLY big change!\" And then the kids, who had paid such careful attention for so long, headed off on a tangent about their own dogs and their thought on which  other  animals Bud might enjoy. \"He'd like my dog. He's really big, but he's quiet.\" \"Maybe he'd like a turtle.\" \"He says he wants a giraffe,\" Molly told me. \"Yes,\" I said. \"He wants an elephant, too.\" And then it was time for the kids to line up and go to chorus. We said our goodbyes, and off they went. Ms. Walters, Mrs. Nee, and I had talked through the best way to approach the rest of the day with Bud. I was afraid that someone would mention to him that I'd been there - and if I'd been there, but not seen him, I knew that would feel like betrayal to Bud. So, Mrs. Nee went to retrieve Bud from the Special Ed office, and told him that I'd come to pick him up early. Bud was delighted, and rushed into the classroom and into my arms. We used the \"found time\" to stop by the eye doctor's office, to look around and meet the doctor so that it would be familiar when he went for his scheduled eye exam. It was a good use of time and, for Bud, felt like a legitimate reason for being picked up early. Bud's quick return hadn't given the teachers and me much time to debrief, beyond a showering of \"You're amazing!\"; \"No, YOU'RE amazing!,\" so we spent the evening sending e-mails back and forth to celebrate the magic we'd just witnessed. In one e-mail, Ms. Walker wrote: At the end of the day I asked the kids to share one new/neat/cool thing they learned from our talk today...In a perfect world, I wish you could have been there to hear their voices and watch them immersed in their own \"think time\" over their experience today and the way got excited over each other's comments. Kallyn - I really liked knowing Bud knows he is different but doesn't care, but I think it still must be hard to be Bud sometimes. Nathan - I thought it was so cool that by changing just one small thing it can help Bud so much - like by making my sentences shorter and giving him time to think. It seems small to us, but in can make a HUGE difference. Simon -Being different is OK. Lilly - The echo way he learned to talk. \"You want juice?\" And how he was so computer smart by the time he was 2. Noelle - Connections to people who speak the same language. Max - I never knew there were so many types of differences within autism. Travis - I'm just really happy to know that Bud is happy being himself. I think about that a lot. Oh! and toasters and hair dryers - how cool was THAT? Brandon - I learned some of the ways that Bud learns, and that the big thing is he just needs more time to get used to things. Damian - It's cool that he doesn't care what people think. The Amazing Platypus - This has me questioning what I think normal really is - after this I feel like Bud fits normal and that I'm the one who is different. Laurie - That if you don't get an answer right away it's ok - he's just working on it and will get there. Kelly -He's happy being him. Kayleigh - Maybe we aren't so different after all - that what makes us different and happy makes him different and happy, too. Molly - I get it now that when he repeats other people's words it's to help him share his emotions. Carla - That he has an amazing memory and great hearing. Dan - I think it can help me understand more about the way he talks. Sean - That he isn't afraid of dogs any more. Jennifer - The way he thinks about things has really changed - like about dogs and wacky hair. Zoe - It's cool about how his body sends him signals for movement breaks. Cathryn - I liked learning about how Bud started talking. Nora - I feel like I get why he gets attached to people now - the whole Japanese thing. I just loved how she made it so we could understand. It was a big day for all of us. But the class has continued to reflect, and to talk, and to work on turning their thinking into action. More on that next time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/03/i-wrapped-up-my-presentation-by.html", "title": "\nWrapping up and moving on\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 02, 2010", "body": "\n The story  continues, and it just gets more magical. In the days that followed my meeting with Bud's classmates, every afternoon yielded a new surprise as I unpacked Bud's backpack and unearthed the treasures inside. One day, it was a tube of paper that unfurled into a long purple-based splatter-paint mural that Kallyn, Laurie, Lily, Nora, and Jennifer had made for Bud. Another day, there was a letter to me from  The Amazing Platypus , who wrote,  \"Thank you for coming to our class and helping me understand Bud and how to be a better friend... If Bud hadn't been in my class I would still be viewing him completly differently.\"  (He also thanked me for the blog name.) Another day, there was a stack of photographs from Pajama Day, which featured Bud in the center of a circle of friends, all of them sprawled on the floor watching a movie at a \"slumber party\" at school. Another day, there was a picture that Noelle had drawn for Bud. Another day, one from Nora.   Another day, Bud came home with a Zoboomafoo video tape that Sean had found at home. Sean didn't watch it anymore, so he brought it in for Bud, who, Sean knew, is a big fan of Zoboo. That night, Bud wrote Sean a thank you note, letting him know how much he liked the video, and he brought it into school the next day. That afternoon, I got an e-mail from Ms. Walters., who wrote:  \"Sean was SO pleased to get a note from Bud today - He read it, and turned around and said \"Thanks, Bud - you did a great job! I'm glad you like it!\" And then Sean turned to me and asked,\"Can I keep this?\" I smiled, ruffled his hair, and said, \"It belongs to you, of course you can keep it!\" \"COOL!\" he shouted, and ran for his backpack to tuck it away, and as he came back to his desk with a huge grin he looked up and said, \"That is SO awesome!\"  In the same e-mail, Ms. Walker told me that she was sending me a stack of \"quick writes\" that the children had done in class. She explained that the class was continuing to read the book  that started it all :  Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key   and that they'd gotten to a section in which an adult said about Joey, the boy with ADHD,  \"They shouldn't let messed up kids go to school with regular kids!!\"  Ms. Walker wrote,  \"There was an audible collective Gasp! as I read that line. They were simply stunned into silence. I told them we'd revisit how they were feeling the next day and the writing is the result.\" That afternoon, I opened Bud's backpack to find a stack of \"quick writes\" that the children had done in response to the writing prompt: \"In  Joey Pigza Swallowed the Key , Maria's dad is angry and yells, \"They shouldn't let messed-up kids go to school with regular kids!\" What do you think of this? Why? Include some examples from your own life/experiences at home and at school.\" The children's responses were beautiful, creative, and heartfelt. Some were written as letters to Maria's dad. Others were written in Joey's voice. Others were just raw, genuine reactions. And they took my breath away. Dan wrote: \"Mr. Dumbrowski... Sometimes kids like Joey can't control themselves at times... I have a kid like Joey in my class and his name is Bud at times he can't control him self. But hes an asowme kid... You know the old saying don't judge a book by its cover. Well, Joey's the book and your judging him by his cover. So think before you say.\" Brandon wrote: \"At my school there is different kids to but we all learn to get along together. In my class we have a chiled with autism and to get to understand him better his mom came in to tell us more about him. We can learn to work together with different poeple. We can also learn to exeped people with autism and with disabililetys. We can learn to treat each other fairly. We are lucky as a class to have a kid with autism because we can learn how children with autism learn, play, speek, and think.\" Kallyn wrote: \"We are all people and we are all diffrant. So I don't think anyone should get look down at because thay are diffrant. I think any class with someone who is diffrant is realy lucky... I have a kid in my class named Bud he is diffrent but I whould never look down at him because he is diffrent. but he isn't realy diffrant he is still human to. he still learned all the same stuff just a little diffrent.\" Noelle wrote: \"Dear Mr. Dumbrowski, I think this is very mean to yell at kids... We have kids at our school that have autism. We are so lucky as a class because we have a kid that is different from us but we treat him like us... Autism is not something to yell at anyone for having. When someone is born with autism there is know way they are going to lose it.\" Travis wrote: \"Dear Mr. Dumbrowski, I think your wrong in so many ways Because I have a Boy in my class whith autism and he isnt messed up he's Just different and so is Joey... So next time you say that think of what I said.\" Catherine wrote: \"I think Maria's dad should not of said that... I have had a lot of experience with a Diffrent kid in my class named Bud. He has autism, but I have had a great experience and I love being in his class... I really think Maria's dad should have a experience with a diffrent kind of kids and he might change his mind, but he should not of said that and it really made me mad because it dose not matter what he looks like or How diffrent He is we are all together in one world and no matter what happens we are all the same in some way.\" Sean wrote: \"I think he is wrong because someone in our class has dissabilitys, And nobody minds. I think Maria's dad is messed up! This guy should go to jail!... I believe that just because you've got autism or any other dissability doesn't mean he or she has something wrong with him.\" Zoe wrote: \"When Ms. Walker read that line It really shocked me. I realy don't like Mr. Dumbrowski for saying that. (My heart sangk.) I thingk are class is lucky. Because people like Bud is abel to partisapat in every speshil and learn the same thing as us but in a different way.\" Carla wrote: \"I think Marias dad has mest up thinking. Every one shoud be abal to go to school... My school has lots of kids how are difrint. But every one should have a chance... I think it is good that all kids can go to school, lern, and try to make friends. experiences can be magnifasint and exstrodany and speshal and learn things about each other.\" Damian wrote: \"I have a kid in my class who has autism and he is still a supper good speller and is a cool kid to have in my class... P.S. Mr. Dumbrowski you  stink .\" Kelly wrote: \"Joey is not messed up, he is just differant and everybody is differant in their own special way. Having kids in your class or world are fun, hard, and exciting, you can learn a lot by how others learn. It is very enteresting if you can just listed to them and you can learn a bunch like I did when a kid in my class whose name is Bud he has autism and every day I learn new things.\" Kayleigh wrote: \"Life with different kids can be hard, easy, and very fun. Theirs a kid with autism in my class, and he is very nice... It's good for him to be in classes with normal people because everyday we learn new things, And so does he. He is funny, fun, nice, and very smart... We are lucky as a class because he teaches us new things everyday. He always makes us laugh and tells us funny jokes and gives us high fives all the time. He is very fun to have around. He is a very good friend too.\" Sam wrote: \"Dear Mr. Dumbrowski, I think you should go to angre manigment because you were harsh on me and I don't realy like that. OK! I'm not trieing to be mean like you were to me. Sinserely, Joey Pigsu.\" Laurie wrote: \"Dear Mr. Dumbrowski, I think that kids who have a disabielaty should go to school with kids that don't have a disabeilety... I like having different kids in the classroom. Its nice to learn about how somebody else might learn.\" The Amazing Platypus wrote: \"What I think about this is that he is wrong because everybody deserves to show what they can do even if they are different... I have a autistic kid in my class he doesn't do stuff like us but he does math language and other stuff but at a different level... Are you messed up Mr. Dumbrowski?\" Nora wrote: \"Just because people are different doesn't make them \"messed up.\" I think this because I go to school with \"different\" people and it doesn't affect anything with anyone else in my school. School isn't just about Reading, Science, or Writing. It's about getting everyone what they need so that they can learn. It is an honor to have autistic people in your class because you can really learn from them.\" Nathan wrote: \"Dear Mr. Dumbrowski, I think your not nice. Kids should have a chance and... can I get back to you on that? Kids should have an equal and fair chance to learn. Just yous better, easier techneeks of learning. There should be trained teachers that are special for kids like me. P.S. Tell Maria I'm sorry. Pleas. See ya later, Joey\" Jennifer wrote: \"I think thats awful... Just cause there diffrent dosent mean there wrtong... Autism is just where you take medicen. I wonder if you had a kid in your grade? Some are diffrent becauseof there brain. It dosent mean there diffrent.\" Molly wrote: \"Our class is so lucky that we have a school that has different kids because we learn from them and they learn from us. I can't wait until I learn even more... I have been in the same class with Bud for four years. I have learned so much about autism and other disabilties. And I think you should learn more before you go around being mean to kids.\" Ms. Walker wrote that following these reflection pieces, they had an AMAZING class discussion in which the kids talked with each other about their own disabilities and together discovered the depth of difference in their classroom - a depth that goes far beyond autism alone. She wrote,  \"Some of the kids took the ultimate risk today when they shared, without any prompting, with their classmates about the meds they take and why, and how they help, and some of things that are hard about taking them, like getting to sleep.\" But the kids aren't stopping at the door to their classroom. Ms. Walker wrote,  \"The magic continues - they want to use our hallway bulletin board to write open letters to the school, and the title for the board would be along the lines of \"Different kids make a better world.\" They're learning \"We are the World\" in music: We are the world, we are the children We are the ones who make a brighter day So lets start giving Theres a choice we're making We're saving out own lives its true we'll make a better day Just you and me\" And then yesterday, April 1, the first day of Autism Awareness Month, another package came home with my name on it. Inside was a stack of thank you letters from the children, decorated with care and filled with words that made me want to reach through the pages and hug every one of them: Nora's \"I think it's really cool how much you get him and how you both understand each other. You're the purplest!\" Catherine's \"I feel great to be a part of his community in school. Evry time I hear I'm going to be in his class I always can't wait.\" Molly's \"Thank you so much for coming in. I learned so much about autism... You are a great mom.\" Kallyn's \"I learned so much and I think my friendship with Bud has grown. I been able to talk to Bud a little more and been feeling really good with where I am at with Bud and I think that now I know more about Bud I can relate to him better.\" Sean's \"Even though I went to recess it is because I am a kid who if he doesn't get outdoor time I get really bouncy and over excited. But I learned all about the part about toasters and hairdryers and how our buddy Bud needs movement breaks... Still the purplest!\" Noelle's \"That has helped me learn a lot more about Bud. He is very cool to learn about... My life with Bud has been really cool so far.\" Brandon's \"After you came in I understood Bud and I learned how I can help him play and learn.\" Laurie's \"I enjoyed your visit SO much. I wish you could come in again.\" Simon's \"We learn more about autisim every day.\" Kelly's \"I learned that Bud does not care that he is differant and that he is a hair dryer in a toaster brain world.\" Travis's \"Thank you so much for coming in to our class. I know I learned a lot... It ment alot to our class.\" Lily's \"I don't think Bud is really actually different than us. He's a human that just thinks and learns different than us. I've known him ever since first grade and even then I didn't think he was that different.\" Kayleigh's \"Also, thank you for adding us in your blog... I want to write blogs as good as you when I grow up. You have an amazing talent. You inspired me to write blogs.\" Damian's \"It is cool to have Bud in my class because he is realy funny.\" Max's \"I'm still learning about Bud, which is very fun because every time I learn something new I get a laugh from all my classmates as well as me.\" Jennifer's \"That was AMAZING! I didn't know much about autizm until you explained every one of those stories. It made me think what would it be like to have autizm?\" Carla's \"To me it was inportin to find out what Bud had and it was speshal that you did the presentashun about Bud's disability.\" Zoe's \"The whole time you were talking I felt like I was different... I don't know why, but when you were talking I felt REALLY relaxed and happy! I mean the \"whole time\" I was relaxed.\" Nathan's \"Thank you 1,000,000 times for coming! You opened a new door for me to walk through. I learned so much!\" Dan's \"I think it's cool that people all over the world are reading about our classroom. Some people are quick to judge Bud. Do you know the old saying don't judge a book by its cover? Bud's the book and people are judging him by his cover. But our class sat down and are reading a never ending book. The book is never ending because you keep learning more every time you read it. P.S. It's a really great book.\" And the neatest things about their letters, beyond their remarkable insights and their outstanding artistry? The children signed the letters with the names I'd given them on the blog, with one difference: they all had the same last name - NOS. Sean-NOS. Laurie-NOS. Nora-NOS. And on and on and on. All different, and yet all the same. Connected to each other. Connected to Bud and me. Connected like family. And at the bottom of the pile of these remarkable letters? A family portrait - a gift to Bud and me - a picture of all of Bud's classmates and both of his teachers, standing under a sign that says \"World Autism Awareness Day. We are Bud's Buddies-NOS,\" each of them holding a sign with their NOS names. It's a picture I'll treasure for the rest of my life. As I look at the picture, I keep having the same thought. In response to my posts about my visit to this classroom, I've gotten a lot of encouragement to turn it all into a book. And I'm thinking about it. But, honestly, here is the book I really want to write: In twenty-five years, I want to meet up with these children again and find out where they are. How many of them will be teachers, creating dynamic inclusive classrooms? How many will be employers of people with disabilities? How many will be parents, raising children as remarkable as them? How many will be finding ways to celebrate difference in their homes and in their neighborhoods? How many will be taking active roles in their local and state governments? How many will be speaking out against injustice and making their thoughts count at the ballot box? And how many of them will look back at this year, at this classroom, at these teachers, at these classmates, and recognize it all as a transformative experience in their lives? These children are going to change the world. THAT's the book I want to write. And, as Dan says, \"P.S. It's a really great book.\" Happy World Autism Awareness Day. And, oh, I almost forgot. The class sent along something for you, as well: \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Joey-Pigza-Swallowed-Key-Books/dp/0064408337/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1270256724&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/04/ones-who-make-brighter-day.html", "title": "\nThe ones who make a brighter day\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 19, 2010", "body": "\nI looked at the next question in my notes, then at the eager faces of Bud's classmates, and I smiled. \"The next questions you asked,\" I said, \"were 'How can I be a better friend to Bud?' and 'How can I be a person Bud would like to hang out with?' \"First of all, I want to tell you that you already ARE good friends to Bud. You accept him just the way he is, and you let him know that he is an important person in this class. You are very good friends. \"But there are some things you can do to make it a little bit easier for Bud at school. One thing you can do is to try not to talk too fast when you talk to him. Think about how you talk to one of your toaster-brained friends. You probably sayalotofwordsandyoumovequicklyfromtopictotopicandohiloveyournewhaircutanddidyouseethattvshowlastnightandourmathhomeworkwasreallyhard. Right?\" \"Right,\" they agreed, laughing. \"But to Bud, that all sounds like Japanese. It's easier for Bud to talk with you when you speak a little more slowly and you don't use as many words. You don't want to talk to him like he's a little kid, of course, but sometimes, it's just easier if you say a few words and give his hair-dryer brain a little time to think about them before you say some more. \"It can also take extra time for Bud to answer questions, because his hair-dryer brain has to work harder than your toaster brain to recognize that you're asking a question, figure out what kind of answer you're looking for, put the answer into words, and say them out loud. So, when you ask him a question, give him plenty of time to answer. Try to wait  three times longer  for Bud than you would with one of your toaster-brained friends. With a toaster-brained friend, that would feel like a long time, and you would probably ask the question again. But with Bud, you just need to stay quiet and keep listening - and most of the time, you will find that he'll answer.\" The children nodded, obviously taking mental notes. \"Sometimes it can be easier for Bud to have a conversation with you when you ask him about things that you know he's interested in. You can ask him about the scripts he's using or about the music he likes. When he's talking about things he knows well, he doesn't have to work as hard to find the right words to use. \"But keep talking to him about the things that interest you, too. He might not seem to be interested at first, but remember that we said that taking an interest in new things is one of the things that's really, really hard for his hair-dryer brain. Sometimes he just needs to hear about things a little bit at a time to start to get comfortable with them. And sometimes, he ends up finding out that he really does like something new. \"A couple of years ago, Wacky Hair Day was scary for Bud. Nobody looked the way they were supposed to look and he didn't know what to expect. But, over time, he started to get used to the idea, and now he  loves  Wacky Hair Day. This morning when I dropped him off, he told me he was going to laugh all day.\" His friends laughed, too.

{"date": "Saturday, March 13, 2010", "body": "\nOkay, so:  the presentation . First, I should tell you that we orchestrated it with the stealth of CIA operatives. We didn't want Bud to see me in the building, because we knew that my presence would be difficult for him.  (Mom does not belong in school. Mom should only be here when she has come to take me home.)  We all synchronized our watches, and as lunchtime approached, Mrs. Nee walked Bud to the lunchroom, where he was meeting another staff member, and Ms. Walker readied the classroom, while a student, Noelle, helped me slip in the side door and up the back staircase. While we waited for a few students to return to the class with their hot lunches, Ms. Walker let me know that they'd told the children a little bit about my blog, read them a few excerpts, and let them know that people all over the world read about their classroom. The kids were delighted to know that they had fans, and even  more  delighted by the idea that they'd been given pseudonyms when I wrote about them. It seems they'd had some fun trying to figure out who was who. Then, the children returned with their lunches and settled at their desks, which had been arranged in a circle. I sat down to join them, and it was time to begin. I started by thanking them for inviting me to their class. \"I hope you know,\" I said, \"that you are really, really important people to Bud. He doesn't always show friendship the way other people do, but believe me - you are important to him. He talks about you all the time. He tells me all about  his buddies . And he  loves  having buddies.\" They grinned their response. \"I also want to thank you for asking such great questions.\" I held up  their index cards . \"Your questions were fantastic, and they tell me that you really pay attention to Bud.\" Dan raised his hand. \"I wasn't here the day they wrote cards,\" he said. \"But I do have some questions.\" \"That's great, \" I told him. \"How about if I answer the questions that other people have asked first, and then if I haven't answered your questions, you can ask me more about them.\" Dan agreed, and I turned to the rest of the class. \"You can all ask more questions. Sometimes when something seems different, people can get nervous about asking questions, but I want you to know that I  want  you to ask questions. It's the best way to learn about things you don't understand.\" My intro was over and it was time to get into my answers to the questions they'd written. I'd prepared ten pages of notes. I wanted to help the kids understand Bud's differences, but I didn't want to present him as \"other,\" as though he were an alien living among them, as though there were something  wrong  with him, so I'd developed some analogies - some things that I hoped would help them relate Bud's experience to their own. The first one felt the riskiest. It was my make-or-break analogy - the one on which the rest of the presentation hinged. If it didn't resonate with them - or, worse, if it seemed  lame  - I was afraid I'd lose them. I knew that one ill-placed snarky comment from one of the kids could make the whole thing unravel. So I took a breath, and I started talking. \"The first question that lots and lots of you asked is: What is autism? \"Autism is something that people are born with \u2013 you either have autism or you don\u2019t have it. You can\u2019t catch it. \"Having autism means that your brain is put together differently. Your brain still works perfectly well. It just does things differently from other people\u2019s brains. \"Let\u2019s think about the brain as a machine. You know that your brain controls everything you do. You use your brain to think about things and to make your body do things. Your brain also controls things that you don\u2019t even think about. You don\u2019t have to remember to breathe, because your brain does it automatically for you. You don\u2019t have to remember to blink, because your brain does it. So, sometimes you USE your brain to do things and sometimes your brain just does things because that\u2019s what it\u2019s wired to do. \"The same thing is true in autism. Bud uses his brain for everything, too. But because there are differences in the way his brain is connected, there are differences in the way his brain reacts to things. \"Now, we all know that your brain is a machine that's made of tissue and neurons and nerve cells. But let\u2019s pretend it was a more simple machine. Let\u2019s pretend your brain wasn't made of tissue and neurons and nerve cells, but  instead , it was made of metal and plastic and electrical wires. And let's pretend that when you put that metal and plastic and electrical wire  together , it turned into a toaster.\" Here, the class laughed - the good kind of laughter. I carried on. They were with me. \"And let\u2019s pretend that MOST of us had toaster brains. Some of us might make white toast and some wheat toast or rye toast, and some of us might make light toast and some of us dark toast. Some of us might only toast bagels, and sometimes we might even  burn  the toast, but for the most part, all of our brains would be able to do the same thing: make toast. \"Now, think about the pretend world that we have just created. In our world, MOST people have toaster brains. So, when we make the rules for our world and decide how we want to spend our time, what do you think we\u2019ll decide is the MOST important thing a person can do?\" Nora raised her hand. \"Always try hard and do our very best?\" \"Yes!\" I said. \"And WHEN we do our very best, we will be doing a  great  job making...\" \"Toast!\" they responded in unison. \"Yes! Because we have brains that are really GOOD at making toast - so we will want to have a world where it's REALLY important and REALLY valuable to make toast. Right?\" Heads nodded around the room. \"Now let\u2019s pretend that Bud\u2019s brain is ALSO made of metal and plastic and electrical wires, just like our brains, except that when HIS metal and plastic and electrical wires get put together, they turn into a totally different kind of machine. Instead of being a TOASTER, Bud's metal and plastic and electrical wires turn into a HAIR DRYER.\" I swear, I heard gasps. \"Now, there\u2019s nothing WRONG with a hair dryer, right? Hair dryers are great! There are some things that hair dryers are really good for. There are some things that a hair dryer can do even BETTER than a toaster. But it is REALLY, REALLY hard to make toast with a hair dryer.\" They laughed again, and nodded, and totally, completely  got  it. \"So, in our pretend world, even though Bud has a perfectly wonderful hair dryer brain, it\u2019s going to be hard for him, because we toaster-brained people have decided that the most important thing that people do in our world is make toast. And Bud probably  can  make toast with his hair dryer, right? But he is going to have to work a lot  harder  to make toast with his hair-dryer brain than we will with our toaster brains. It will probably take him a lot longer to make his toast. And no matter how hard he works, his hair-dryer toast will probably always  look  different from our toaster toast.\" The room filled with murmurs of understanding. \"But, on the other hand - think about THIS! When we toaster-brain people have wet hair? We are REALLY going to hope that Bud and his hair-dryer brain are around.\" Nathan piped in. \"Because we could get ZAPPED if we tried to use our toasters!\" \"Exactly,\" I continued. \"And the same thing is true in the real world with our real brains, that are made of tissue and neurons and grey matter and, uh...\" \"And important stuff,\" offered Travis. \"Yeah, and important stuff,\" I said. \"Because for most of us, when that important stuff gets put together, we have a certain type of brain. And we have created a society that says the most important things are the things that most of our brains are really good at - things like: \"Talking and communicating with people; \"Making friends and spending time with people; \"Doing lots of different kinds of things, having lots of different kinds of interests, and trying new things. \"Because our brains are really GOOD at those things, we try to spend most of our time doing them. But those are all things that, because of his autism, Bud\u2019s brain has a really  hard  time doing. \"Language is difficult for him and he doesn't talk the same way as other people. \"Being social and knowing how to interact with people is difficult. \"Changing his routine and trying new things is difficult.\" The classroom resonated with affirmation. Bud's classmates knew exactly what I was talking about. They knew, without me explaining any further, what kinds of behaviors I was talking about. I could see the understanding in their faces. \"But, remember how there were some things that the hair-dryer brains could do better than the toaster brains? There are ALSO things that Bud\u2019s brain is really GOOD at doing. There are things that HIS brain can do better than a lot of our brains can do. \"I bet you can guess what some of those things are. Can you?\" Hands flew up all over the room, and without my prompting, they recreated the list I had written in the notes in front of me. \"He's really great on the computer. He's better at it than LOTS of people.\" \"He has great hearing.\" \"He can remember lots of lots of things.\" \"He can remember all the words to TV shows.\" \"And he can remember the words to songs.\" \"He is very musical.\" \"He's a great speller, too,\" I added. \"Once he learns a word, he usually remembers how to spell it.\" \"If I had a brain like that,\" said Nathan. \"I'd read the whole dictionary and learn all the words.\" \"That would be a great thing to do,\" I said. \"And it reminds me that Bud is also a really good reader.\" Molly raised her hand. \"And he has a great sense of humor, too.\" \"He does have a great sense of humor,\" I said. \"And that's one of the ways that his brain is a lot like other people's. What are some of the other ways that Bud is just like everyone else?\" Again, the hands flew up. \"He can see just like everyone else.\" \"He looks just like everyone else.\" \"He's human.\" \"Yes! He's human - which means that he has all the same feelings that everyone else does. And he loves the people in his life. And he likes to play and have fun. He likes to laugh, he likes to swim, he likes to eat pizza. In lots of ways, Bud is just a regular kid.\" I looked around the room at the smiling faces of Bud's classmates - his friends, with their toaster-brains firing. \"But a lot of your questions were about some of the ways that Bud is different from you and about the things that are harder for him than they are for a lot of other toaster-brained people. So, let\u2019s talk about some of those questions.\" Up next:  Question #2 - Why does Bud repeat things from TV? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/03/on-being-hair-dryer-kid-in-toaster.html", "title": "\nA hair-dryer kid in a toaster-brained world\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 15, 2010", "body": "\nOkay, first - true confession time: I've been a bad mom. It's true. It was the ultimate betrayal. I went to see  Dierks Bentley  and I didn't tell Bud. I know - it's terrible. There's nothing you could say about me that I haven't already said about myself. I'm trying to convince myself that I wasn't all bad, though. It was a long drive - two and a half hours - to a late-night show on a school night. It was loud and crowded and, now that I think about it, probably a 21-plus show. So I was exhibiting good judgment, right? Good, sound parenting practice. But it's hard not to feel bad for Bud. Because, the show? It. Was. Awesome. Seriously. Beyond awesome. It's the fifth time I've seen Dierks live, but it was like nothing I've ever seen before. He's doing a limited tour in small venues with bluegrass giants  The Travelin McCourys . The show features some of Dierks's greatest hits played with a bluegrass flair, interspersed with tracks from his upcoming bluegrass-inspired album,  Up on the Ridge , with a smattering of fun, crowd-pleasing covers of songs from artists that span from George Strait to Pearl Jam. And because he's playing such small venues - this one was a sold-out, standing-room-only crowd of about 500 - it all just feels like an incredibly great party in someone's sizable basement. And for as much fun as the rest of us were having, no one in the room was having a better time than Dierks Bentley. It was awesome. There was some good news for Bud, though. As luck would have it, I happened to go to the show on the first night that the new album was on sale at the merchandise table (it won't be available in stores until June 8), so I was able to pick up a copy to take home. And the album is as awesome as the show. It is, simultaneously, classic Dierks Bentley and a complete departure from his previous albums. There are songs like \"Draw Me a Map\" that resonate so completely that after just a few listens I feel like I've known them forever. And there are others, like Bud's favorite, \"Fiddlin' Around\" - a fiddle-driven up-tempo track that makes it impossible to sit still - that are totally new sounds. There are tracks written by Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson and U2. There are appearances by Del McCoury and Miranda Lambert and the Punch Brothers and Jamey Johnson. When taken as a whole,  Up on the Ridge  is hard to define. It's too country to be traditional bluegrass, but too bluegrass to be mainstream country. It is, I think,  a hair-dryer album in a toaster-brained industry . Of course, I know nothing at all about the inner workings of the music world, except what I glean from this side of the radio - but what I observe is a market that sometimes seems to reward conformity over innovation, and an industry that too often uses valuable prime-time network TV slots not to showcase the best of what country music has to offer, but to market a select number of carefully groomed country artists, promoting them as potential crossover artists to the lucrative pop-dominated airwaves. But, then, what do I know? In any case, it seems to me that  Up on the Ridge  flies in the face of all that. It is Dierks Bentley performing directly from his heart, and it leaves his audience - or it leaves me, anyway - thinking, \"Ah. So  this  is who you are.\" And I sure do like who he is. But all of that barely matters when I see Bud's reaction to the album, as his hands fly across the strings of his air guitar while he sings along to the title track. The bad news is that it will likely inspire requests that will be hard to meet. He's already asked me if he could be Dierks's new mandolin player. And I imagine that his request for a dobro will be coming soon. But really, it's all good, because  Up on the Ridge  inspired much more than that for Bud. Remember back at the beginning of the school year, when I  shared my hunch  that Bud's friendship with Dierks would make the idea of friendship more appealing to him? And then, remember how he's spent a year in a  classroom of peers  who are helping him become their friend? Well, Bud's second reaction to  Up on the Ridge  - immediately following his request to join Dierks's band - was this: \"I'll bring this to school tomorrow. The kids are going to love this.\" Did you catch that? Bud thought the album was so good that he wanted to share it with his friends. How awesome is that? So, I have three take-away messages here, and in case you've missed them, I'm going to re-cap: 1. If Dierks and the McCourys are coming  anywhere near you , don't miss the opportunity to see them, even if it means travelling two and a half hours each way and having to go to work the next day on only three hours of sleep. Trust me on this. 2. Don't let the word \"bluegrass\" scare you.  Up on the Ridge  will make you love Dierks more than you already do. And, finally, 3. The good news is that sometimes a little low-stakes bad-mom moment can turn out to be not so bad at all. In fact, sometimes it can lead to something truly awesome.

As we said, it\u2019s hard for  him  to branch out and try new things, but  you  can try to take an interest in the things he likes. Ask him about them. When he\u2019s using a script, ask him what TV show it\u2019s from. Ask him who his favorite characters are. If you can climb into HIS world, he will be more comfortable about talking with you. But keep telling him about your interests, too, and helping him to learn about new things. The more he sees and hears about new things, the more comfortable he'll get with them. Help him practice the things that his hair-dryer brain makes hard for him. The more practice he has, the better he'll get at them.\" \"Think about morning meeting,\" Ms. Walker offered. \"Remember what a tough time Bud had at morning meeting at the beginning of the year?\" The children nodded and agreed that he'd had a difficult time with it. \"And now,\" said Ms. Walker, \"who  runs  morning meeting?\" \"Bud does!\" they answered. \"So, you've already seen it happen,\" I said, smiling. \"And you already do a lot of things to help Bud. \"But the most IMPORTANT thing you can do to help Bud is to make sure that your school is  always  a place where it's okay to be different. \"And the best way you can do  that  is to let your own differences show. Be proud of who you are. If you like something that other people don't like, talk about why you like it. If you like wearing something that's different from what other people wear, then wear it with a smile. Listen to the music you like. Follow the interests you have. Talk about the things you're good at and talk about the things that are hard for you. \"And  listen  to each other. Learn from each other. If someone likes something you don't like or does something that you don't understand,  ask  them about it and then  really  listen to their answer.

{"date": "Saturday, June 12, 2010", "body": "\nIf you've been reading this blog for a while, then you probably have a sense of the extraordinary progress that Bud has made in recent years.  If you know him in real life, then you are certainly aware of it.  The progress is undoubtedly a good thing. And yet, I find myself thinking lately about  a post I wrote  several years ago about the down-side of being a \"high functioning\" child, as I find myself responding to Bud with higher expectations, lower levels of patience, and increasing frustration with his behavior. I'm reminding myself that I need to take a step back and remember what's going on here. It's one of the dangers, I think, of having a child with a \"hidden\" disability.  The more he \"looks\" like other children on the surface, the quicker I am to blame him for troubling behavior, instead of recognizing that it is merely another manifestation of his disability. I think about it this way:  If Bud were blind, I doubt I would hear myself saying \"You have a cane.  We have been over this a million times.  Would you PLEASE stop bumping into things?\"  I'm virtually certain I would not blurt out in frustration \"CAN YOU JUST WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING?\" I have a hunch that I would be quicker to remember that visual impairment is the very definition of blindness, and that the behaviors that stem from that are merely signs that there is more progress to be made. Why, then, can it be so difficult to remember that most of Bud's troubling behavior stems from the core deficits that are the hallmark of an autism diagnosis: Language impairment; Difficulty with appropriate social interaction; Restrictive interests and repetitive behaviors. When I look at the behaviors that make me want to scream - that do, in fact, sometimes make me scream - I can see how neatly they fit into these three little boxes. Bud has made - and continues to make - extraordinary progress.  His skills compound.  His abilities soar.  And he is still autistic.  The core deficits of autism will continue to manifest in new ways for him, signalling our need to shift approaches and rethink assumptions. It is MY job to watch where we're going.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/06/matter-of-perspective.html", "title": "\nA matter of perspective\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, July 03, 2010", "body": "\nYou may know that Bud has been taking melatonin for years to help him sleep through the night.  As he's grown, we've had to increase the dose to maintain its effectiveness, and for the past year or so he's been taking 9 mg a night - a dose that would leave most adults groggy for days, but which has been just enough to help Bud get a solid night's sleep.  This spring, however, with the anxiety of the end of school, the unknowns of summer, and a new school year looming large on his horizon, Bud started to have trouble sleeping again, and his 9 mg dose was rendered ineffective.  The doctor he sees for medication management authorized us to go up to 12 mg a night, but before we got started with that, Bud had an appointment with his pediatrician, who asked me about the melatonin I was giving Bud and, specifically, about where I'd been buying it.  I told her I usually picked it up at Target or the local pharmacy, and she gave me a valuable tip. She said that melatonin, like most natural supplements, is not regulated, so a 3 mg tablet may not  actually  contain 3 mg of pure melatonin.  She suggested that I go online and order \"pharmaceutical grade melatonin\" and try that before I increased Bud's dose.  It worked beautifully.  Bud's holding steady at 9 mg a night and has been sleeping soundly - even during the past week, when we were away from home on vacation.

And remember how I talked about the risk he was taking by producing a bluegrass-inspired album that stood in stark contrast to the mainstream market, which, in my estimation, \"is a market that sometimes seems to reward conformity over innovation, and an industry that too often uses valuable prime-time network TV slots not to showcase the best of what country music has to offer, but to market a select number of carefully groomed country artists, promoting them as potential crossover artists to the lucrative pop-dominated airwaves.\" You may not have realized it at the time, but my subtext there was \"I'm talking to YOU, CMAs.\" Um, yeah.

I'm positively FEASTING on my words. There's a message in these nominations, I think - a message about being who you are and doing what you love and not worrying about how other people will react to it. It's the same philosophy that  underscores my parenting  with my not-so-mainstream, outside-the box, bluegrass-inspired son. I'll say it again: the boy chooses his heroes well.

{"date": "Tuesday, July 27, 2010", "body": "\nHere's a question: How do you introduce the concept of death to a child with an anxiety disorder without creating intense anxiety for him? And here's another: How do you introduce the concept if the child has autism, which means that 1) he has trouble understanding the abstract, and instead focuses on the very real and the very concrete and 2) he is prone to perseverating on issues and can zero in on a single topic for hours, days, or weeks at a time? In other words, how do you introduce the concept of death to this child without planting the seeds of worry that will swiftly grow into \"I will die\" and \"you will die\" and \"it could happen any time\"? How do you introduce the concept and then expect to  ever  have a conversation with this child about anything else for the rest of his life? Weighty issues for a mid-summer night, I know, but it's a topic that has been on my mind a lot, because in recent days, some new words have crept into Bud's vocabulary: Guns. Kill. Die. They are words he uses with a worried tone. \"Mom,\" he said as we were driving to summer school yesterday, \"if people are killing me with guns, I'll hide behind a rock.\" I nearly drove off the road. \"Bud,\" I said, \"that would never, never happen. Where did you hear about people with guns?\" I couldn't imagine the source. As far as I knew, Bud had no frame of reference for killing and he had no idea what a gun was. The only television shows that he watches are preschool programs, none of which have such dark themes. He doesn't even see commercials. \"From  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ,\" he said. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?  First, I don't remember people getting shot in  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , and second - \"Where did you see  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , Bud?\" \"In fourth grade.\" Which ended weeks ago. Which means that he has been processing those images on his own for at least a month. I reminded Bud that things that happen in movies aren't real, but since we were nearly at school, I didn't pursue the conversation any further. Instead, I decided to think about how to approach the issue more thoughtfully. Tonight at bedtime, before I'd had a chance to develop a thoughtful plan, Bud raised the issue again. \"Mom, those are guns?\" \"What are guns, Bud?\" \"Guns are machines.\" \"No, I know that. What guns are you asking about?\" \"At the pharmacy? Those are toy guns?\" \"I guess they do have toy guns at the pharmacy. I don't really think guns are good toys.\" \"They're bad?\" \"Well, I don't like them.\" \"Guns are bad, Mom?\" \"Well, guns aren't toys, Bud.\" \"Guns kill elephants?\" What??? \"Did they shoot elephants in  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ?\" \"NO! They shoot  people  in  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang .\" \"Who shoots elephants?\" \"The hunters do!\" \"What hunters?\" \"In the BOOK! In summer school! That I read with Ms. Barr.\" \"Oh. What happens when they shoot the elephants?\" \"They kill them.\" \"What does kill mean?\" \"It means they die.\" \"Oh. And what does die mean?\" Bud thought about it. \"Well...\" he said, \"it means they get sick.\" \"And then what happens?\" \"They go to the doctor.\" \"And what happens after they go to the doctor?\" \"They take their temperature.\" Ah. His constructed understanding of killing and death - already disconcerting and alarming to him - is missing a critical element. Which is why I find myself, in the middle of this lovely summer, with dark and weighty issues on my mind. Where do I go from here? How do I help my son understand the cycle of life and death without inciting panic? And is preserving his naivete and allowing him to stay happily unaware truly the more compassionate path? Is it wise to take the risk that Bud will be introduced to the very  idea  of death when someone he loves is gone from his life? I tried to introduce it to him several years ago when his goldfish died, but the losses barely registered with him. The fish were here, the fish were gone. The impact was minimal. But Bud is in a very different developmental place now, and the stakes feel a whole lot higher. If I don't process it with him, he will surely continue to process it on his own. So, really: how do you do it? How do you help a child with autism and anxiety understand death without killing his joyful and optimistic approach to life?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/07/questions-of-life-and-death.html", "title": "\nQuestions of life and death\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, August 08, 2010", "body": "\nMy friend  Niksmom   once told me  I was ubiquitous. At the time, I was flattered (I'm anyone's for a word like \"ubiquitous\"), but it seems that these days I might be experiencing a bit of a double-edged ubiquity. A couple of years ago,  I discovered  that there was someone else out there on the Interwebz posting as Mom-NOS. I stumbled upon her accidentally, but, because we appeared to travel in different circles, I thought that the potential for misunderstanding seemed small. Truth be told, in real life I have a fairly ubiquitous Susan Jones sort of name, so I've gotten used to being one of many. For the most part, it hasn't been a problem (except, of course, for the time when Bud's dad and I were dating and he called the Susan Jones who not only lived on my street, but also had a phone number that was just one digit off from mine, and she told him she'd never heard of him... but I digress). In the years that have passed since I discovered that other Mom-NOS, it seems that more of us have appeared and now I'm afraid we might have started tripping over each other. I have, sadly, not been able to stay current in my blog reading. In recent months, I have fallen behind in the lives of my blogging friends and have failed to reach out to expand my blogging network (which, I swear, is not from a lack of caring, but simply from a lack of time). Despite that, not long ago, I was on a friend's blog trying to bring myself up-to-date. I clicked on a link to leave a comment on a post that was weeks (months?) old, and there, in the comment section, was - I thought - a comment from me. But it didn't  sound  like me. It wasn't offensive in any way - it just wasn't the sort of thing I'd say and it wasn't said in the sort of way I'd say it. I kept reading the comments and saw that my blogger friend had responded - and from her response I could see that she thought she'd responded to me. Suddenly, that theoretical potential for confusion that I'd tucked in the back of my mind became a tangible source of confusion, and I started to imagine the hurt feelings that could result if \"I\" started posting \"I-don't-know-you-very-well\" comments to blogging friends with whom I'd been through years of highs and lows. I could imagine my friends reading these comments and thinking \"you don't REMEMBER that I went through...\" and thinking that I'd checked out on them completely. Because, you know how it is - we moms in the autism blogosphere? We have been through a LOT together. We may never have met, but we know each other well. So an ill-placed \"I-don't-know-you-very-well\" comment? It would be akin to walking up to my brother and asking, \"So, do you have any siblings?\" But, the Internet being what it is, and the slippery slope of pseudonymity being what it is, there is really no hope of reigning in this particular phenomenon. If anything, I imagine it will continue to grow. It is certainly another check in the column of \"reasons to uncloak\" - something I've begun to do in some circles anyway, but something that I still need to ponder a bit further. In the meantime, know this: When I comment on blogs, I always, always, always link back here. If there is no link or if it links elsewhere, it is not me. I don't participate in chat rooms or discussion boards or support groups. I don't use this name for anything other than autism blogging. Almost all of my blogging happens here and when I post as a guest-blogger elsewhere, I will post a link to that guest post here. I guess that's the best I can do for now. That, of course, and try to carve out more time to increase my presence in the comment sections of the blogging friends I care about deeply and the blogging friends I've yet to meet. Maybe then, with a little more effort on my part, I can start to reclaim some ubiquity in my own right.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternalinstincts.wordpress.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/08/mom-not-specified-enough.html", "title": "\nMom - Not Specified Enough\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 23, 2010", "body": "\nI'm hoping to start a new Thanksgiving tradition this year. Here's why:  our current tradition, as it has played out in recent years, typically involves Bud dissolving in a muddle of tears and dysregulation by bedtime.  I understand it.  I really do.  Thanksgiving is a high-build-up, low-pay-off holiday for Bud.  It gets bundled as part of \"The Holidays\" in our national culture, aligning it closely with Christmas, as though it's the first installment of a spectacular series of events, and not just a precursor of spectacular things to come.  There's build-up in school, with the promise a long stretch of time off.  But, then, when the \"big day\" comes - well, for Bud, it's usually a whole lot of nothing.  No egg hunt and basket.  No trick-or-treating.  No pile of presents in front of a sparkling tree.  Just adults who are distracted making foods he doesn't want to eat, a TV showing parades and sporting events he doesn't want to watch, and, ultimately, a heaping helping of disappointment and let-down. And, then:  Cue the tears. With memories of Thanksgivings past weighing heavily on my mind, I've spent the past couple of weeks trying to come up with a new Plan A - something to build Bud's day around.   There were some built-in challenges to my brainstorming.  First, I am still forced to hyper-vigilant about Bud's  food intake , which meant that the new \"extra special something\" could not involve the preparation and consumption of high-calorie treats.  Second (and not surprising for anyone familiar with autism), the introduction of new people - either by visiting them or by inviting them to our house - would probably not help, since it might add to the dysregulation instead of diminish it.  Third, Bud is not a crafty kid - so the whole \"make a Thanksgiving centerpiece out of macaroni, tissue paper and yarn\" thing was out.  Fourth, I am battling daily to keep the Christmas-frenzy from overtaking him full-tilt (a battle I am not sure I'm winning, incidentally), so I wanted to avoid anything that might even HINT at Christmas-preparation.  And fifth, I really wanted to avoid turning Thanksgiving into yet another present-getting occasion, as our festivals of consumption are plentiful enough. So, working around all of those potential landmines, here's we're we've landed:  Bud and I will be having an indoor camp-out.  On Thursday, in between the potato mashing and the table-clearing, we'll be turning the playroom into the great outdoors: setting up the tent, rolling out the sleeping bags, and firing up the battery-powered lanterns.  We'll have stacks of books, lots of pillows, and, I imagine, a gathering of stuffed friends around us.  We'll pop some popcorn and eat marshmallows that we've pretended to roast on an open fire that I imagine we'll make out of paper. The plan is still forming, of course, so I'm open to suggestions of additional ways to make the day special - camping-related or not.   So, please - send your ideas this way.  They may become part of our Thanksgiving tradition for many years to come.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/11/breaking-with-tradition.html", "title": "\nBreaking with tradition\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 22, 2010", "body": "\n This post originally appeared at  Hopeful Parents  on November 11, 2010. It occurred to me a few days ago that the eleventh was rapidly approaching and with it, my posting date for Hopeful Parents.  Could it really be the eleventh again?,  I thought.  So soon? But, of course, it was. Is. The 11th. 11-11, actually. Elevenses. I Googled \"elevenses,\" because I knew I'd heard the word somewhere before, and I landed on  this Wikipedia entry  (and for any of my writing students who happen to be reading: No, Wikipedia is STILL not a credible source), which informs me that in the UK and Ireland, \"elevenses\" is a light snack - a warm beverage and a tasty cake - eaten in late morning. It's a little treat - something you do for yourself, just to get yourself through the day. I imagine that if you're the parent of a child with special needs, you get the same question I get from well-meaning doctors and therapists: \"What are you doing for yourself?\" It's an important question, but by the tone and frequency with which it's asked, I get the sense that when these doctors and therapists ask it of most special needs parents, they are met with blank stares and lengthy silences. Not so with me, though. I merely thank them for their concern and assure them that I am, indeed, taking time for myself. I am enjoying my elevenses. And I am. Sometimes they take the form of things that I  do  - enjoying a night out with friends, reading a novel that's just for fun, shopping for a new pair of chunky-heeled boots. And other times, they take the form of things that I  don't  do, because I just cant manage one more thing, even if, under different circumstances, that thing is something I might like to do - seeing my students perform in the college play, volunteering for the school Book Fair, responding promptly to an e-mail from an old friend. Or writing a blog post simply because it's time. The key here - the elevenses part - is not simply in the not doing. It's in not feeling  bad  about not doing. That part is more difficult, but it's critical. In order to make it happen, I have to assume that everyone else will be willing to cut me a break - and, as it turns out, when I test my assumptions, I find out that in most cases, the break has been cut. That knowledge - or, perhaps, that ongoing assumption - makes it easier for me to cut myself a break as well. They are not huge, my elevenses. Taken alone, they will not shake the ground enough to register on even the most sensitive seismograph. They are not cruises to the Caribbean. They're not even days spent at the spa. They are little moments of doing and little moments of not doing. But taken together, they get me through. Guilt-free elevenses. And, of course, all this is my explanation for why I am not writing a Hopeful Parents blog post today, 11-11, the high holy day of elevenses. And yet, it seems that in my explaining, I have written a blog post. But I'm not going to beat myself up over it. I'm just going to look at this as one of those \"do\" elevenses, and not one of the \"don't do\" ones. Whatever the case, I'm going to go celebrate with a warm beverage and a tasty cake. Perhaps you'd like to do the same. Or not.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/11/11/elevenses.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevenses"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/11/elevenses.html", "title": "\nElevenses\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, December 25, 2010", "body": "\nMy mom and I are a team. We play in the Double-A league - Autism and Alzheimer's - my son's and my father's. Our life is a series of in-depth strategy sessions, finely-choreographed hand-offs, and reviews and critiques of the play-back tapes. Our game plans are constantly evolving as the needs and issues change - as one of our teammates seems to lose ground as rapidly as the other gains it. We marvel at the crossover between these two conditions - at how well the strategies we learned with autism can be adapted for use with Alzheimer's - and, together, we keep our team of four moving forward every day. We are both, I think, always braced and ready to respond to an emergency involving either of \"the boys.\" But, until very recently, I hadn't really considered what would happened if my mom got benched. A couple of weeks ago, my mom had a health scare. For a short time, it was a big scare; it is less so now, and she is, thankfully, feeling good, doing well, and back in the game full-time. But for a couple of days, things felt much less certain. In the first hours of my mom's health scare, after the scariest moments had passed, I watched the clock and tried to make a plan. My dad was at lunch with friends. Bud was at school. Neither knew that my mom was in the hospital. Each would be panicked by this sudden change in routine, by the lack of clarity surrounding the situation, and by the idea that my mom might not be well. It occurred to me as I sat in the emergency room: It doesn't just take a village to raise a child. It takes a village to live a life. And I needed my village. I took to the phone and made some tentative phone calls. I wasn't sure what I needed, but I wanted people to know that I might be calling again. I sought out people uniquely qualified to help with my most immediate needs - Mrs. H and Ms. Walker, Bud's former teachers - women who had seen Bud at his most challenging and his most charming, who would not panic at a dysregulated response from my boy (and - because the universe just seems to work this way - women who each have a parent with Alzheimer's). Mrs. H sprang into action that night - arriving at my home just after I'd explained the situation to Bud and my dad, and staying late into the night while I returned to the hospital, where my mom had been admitted. Ms. Walker offered to be on call for the following day, to pick up Bud from school and to step in as needed, in whatever way might help. I called my dad's friends - people I hardly know - and explained what was going on. Within twenty minutes, they'd rearranged their day, agreeing to pick up my dad the next morning and stay with him for as long as he needed their company - until I called with word on my mom. The next day, with Bud and my dad in safe hands, I stopped at my office on my way back to the hospital, and my colleagues met me in the hallway. \"Do you need anything?\" \"Yes, I do. I'm not sure what. I'll call you. Thank you.\" \"Can I come over and sit with your dad?\" \"Yes, you can. I'm not sure when. I'll call you. Thank you.\" \"Can I do anything? Take your trash to the dump? Run to the pharmacy?\" Yes, you can. I'm not sure which. I'll call you. Thank you. \"Can I make you a meal?\" Yes, you can. I don't know what. But could you make it gluten-free, please, for my dad? Thank you. Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you. I didn't know if I needed a plan for hours, or days, or weeks. I started planning the weekend - the one which was clearly marked \"Put Up Christmas Tree\" on our calendar at home (something that seemed, at the time, like such a great way to keep Bud from obsessing about a Christmas tree, but which, I see now, was not my wisest move). I thought of which friends I could call to go and pick out a tree and set it up in my living room, so that no matter what else happened, Bud would be able to decorate on Saturday. I thought about people whose presence would be most reassuring and comforting to my dad and to Bud. I thought about who might be able to come and stay overnight for a couple of days. I thought about things that people could do from long-distance: Research. Phone trees. Christmas shopping on Amazon. Luckily, I never had to enact the plans. My mom was released the next day and has returned to good health. In retrospect, it all feels like an elaborate test of the emergency broadcast system  (This is a test. This is only a test. If this had been an actual emergency...)  What I discovered over that 36 hour period, though, is that there's one thing that the challenges in my life have taught me well - one lesson I have learned all the way to my toes: I know how to ask for help and I am quick to accept offers of help from others. That wasn't always true for me. Like many people who find themselves in helping professions, I saw myself for a long time as a helper, and not as one who needed help. \"Thank you,\" I'd say when people extended a hand. \"Really, I appreciate it. But I'll be fine.\" There came a time, though, when I knew I wasn't fine and I had to lean on the people around me - people who were eager to prop me up - people I would desperately want to prop up if the situation were reversed. So I leaned while they propped, and I survived. And through that experience, though I still look for opportunities to prop up others, I've learned to be comfortable with leaning, too. Our recent experience was an important reminder for me. We are part of an extraordinary village of people who live both near and far. Some days we carry the water to the village for them, and some days we call for them to carry it. We need that relationship to survive. We have to remember to offer help, but we also have to remember to ask for it and to accept it. My closest villagers - my team of four - just celebrated a Christmas full of As. Autism and Alzheimer's figured prominently, of course, with each made more pronounced by the break in routine that the holidays bring. But this year, they were joined by a whole lot of other As: Awareness. Appreciation. Affirmation. Abundance. This holiday feels especially precious - as fragile as it is beautiful. It's hard to keep from wondering where we'll be at this time next year. But, wherever we are, I hope you'll be there, villagers. I'll be calling when I need you, and I hope you'll call when you need me, too. And when I offer to help, please - just start with \"yes.\" You can fill in the blanks for me later. Merry Christmas, friends. Thanks for being part of my village.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/12/just-say-yes.html", "title": "\nJust say \"yes\"\n"},

{"date": "Friday, February 18, 2011", "body": "\n N.B.: I typically wait a few weeks to re-post my Hopeful Parents entries on my own blog, but this one seems to have resonated with parents to a degree I hadn't anticipated. Between the comments and e-mails I've received  and the notification on Facebook that says 254 people have shared the link, I'm thinking that this is a subject that has not gotten enough attention and that it's a message that many parents need to hear. Since the shelf-life of posts on Hopeful Parents is relatively brief (because there are two new posts every day), I think it might continue to reach more people here, where posts tend to linger on the home page a lot longer.  This post originally appeared on  Hopeful Parents  on February 11, 2011. In her book  Making Peace With Autism , Susan Senator writes of the periods when her family must manage her son\u2019s most difficult behavior, \u201cwe live as if under siege.\u201d In her blog, Jess from  A Diary of a Mom  talks about her feelings in the early days following her daughter\u2019s diagnosis as \u201cthat awful, combustible mixture of heart-wrenching pain and abject fear.\u201d In the archives of my Twitter feed is a tweet I wrote during a particularly difficult school vacation, when Bud\u2019s behavior made me afraid to leave the house with him: \u201cI feel like a hostage.\u201d As anyone who reads us knows, Susan, Jess, and I love our autistic children. We truly, madly, deeply love them. We celebrate them. We advocate for them. And yet, each of us has experienced intense feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and fear. I heard the same dichotomous feelings echoed by other women a few weekends ago, when I attended a social function with a phenomenal group of autism moms. As I\u2019d expected, over the course of our evening together, there was plenty of IEP talk, plenty of been-there-done-that edification, and plenty of laughing so hard it hurt. But there were also more tears than I\u2019d expected. There was more vulnerability than I\u2019d predicted - more fragility, more shared feelings of aloneness, more compared notes on the emotional and physical tolls that this autism parenting journey was taking on the women around the room. It was in the middle of one of our more heart-rending conversations that one of the moms, whose husband has been serving active duty in the military, said, \u201cYou know what this is, right? This is PTSD. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. It really is.\u201d The group fell silent. Then people started sharing. The physical reaction to loud noises. The sleepless nights. The ceaseless anxiety. The sensory overload. The fear. Not their children: Them. The diagnosis resonated \u2013 not for everyone, but for some. I watched as faces changed, as moms considered \u2013 perhaps for the first time \u2013 that their feelings and their troubles were not the cause of some personal inadequacy or weakness or inability to cope, but were instead the reasonable response of a reasonable person who had been living with unreasonable demands without reasonable support for an unreasonable length of time. I watched as they looked at each other \u2013  but YOU \u2013 so strong \u2013 so together \u2013 YOU feel this way, too? It was a powerful moment. I walked away thinking that it was a moment that should be shared \u2013 that there are probably  many  parents of autistic children who think that their pain, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness are theirs alone, and, worse, are an indication that they are just not capable of parenting their children. So, I went home and started Googling. I landed on  a page from the National Institutes of Health  that lists the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The description below belongs to the NIH, but the bolding is mine; it highlights the symptoms that I heard my friends identify in themselves: Symptoms of PTSD fall into three main categories: 1. Repeated \"reliving\" of the event, which disturbs day-to-day activity \u25a0Flashback episodes, where the event seems to be happening again and again \u25a0 Recurrent distressing memories of the event \u25a0Repeated dreams of the event \u25a0Physical reactions to situations that remind you of the traumatic event 2. Avoidance \u25a0 Emotional \"numbing,\" or feeling as though you don\u2019t care about anything \u25a0Feelings of detachment \u25a0Inability to remember important aspects of the trauma \u25a0Lack of interest in normal activities \u25a0Less expression of moods \u25a0Staying away from places, people, or objects that remind you of the event \u25a0Sense of having no future 3. Arousal \u25a0 Difficulty concentrating \u25a0Exaggerated response to things that startle you \u25a0Excess awareness (hypervigilance) \u25a0Irritability or outbursts of anger \u25a0Sleeping difficulties You also might feel a sense of guilt about the event (including \"survivor guilt\"), and the following symptoms, which are typical of anxiety, stress, and tension: \u25a0 Agitation, or excitability \u25a0Dizziness \u25a0Fainting \u25a0 Feeling your heart beat in your chest (palpitations) \u25a0Fever \u25a0 Headache \u25a0Paleness It\u2019s important to note that PTSD is characterized by symptoms that persist for more than a month \u2013 and that the items I\u2019ve highlighted here are those that have been persistent and unmitigated for my friends. Symptoms resolved within a month \u2013 those I haven\u2019t addressed here - are considered manifestations of Acute Stress Disorder (and, no, the irony that it shares its acronym with Autism Spectrum Disorder is not lost on me). The source of my friends\u2019 symptoms - the identified \u201ctrauma\u201d - varied from woman to woman. For some, it was the impact and subsequent upheaval of the diagnosis itself. For others, it was an event - or series of events - involving their children\u2019s aggressive behavior or uncontrollable tantrums or self-injurious behavior or indescribable fear. For others, it was the toll exacted by constant vigilance - living life, day after day, in a metaphorical foxhole, watching and waiting for the next attack, but never being sure when it would come, how long it would last, and what kind of devastation it would leave behind. For some women in the group - more, actually, than I would have imagined - autism emerged in their lives in the wake of another trauma, the physical and emotional impact of which had not been fully resolved. Already struggling, already vulnerable, already fragile, they found their symptoms \u2013 the reliving, the avoidance, the arousal \u2013 not just heightened, but compounded by parenting a child with autism - more insidious, more difficult to pinpoint, and, somehow, more easily assumed by them to be the result of their own personal failing. I hope that as you read this post, you don\u2019t see yourself in its words. But if you do \u2013 IF YOU DO \u2013 listen to me: you are not experiencing these things because you are weak or because you're a bad parent or because you\u2019re just not trying hard enough. You are experiencing these things because you are a reasonable person who has been living with unreasonable demands without reasonable support for an unreasonable length of time. And it can get better. Here\u2019s what you can do: Read about treatment options.  Here . And  here . And  here . Make an appointment with your physician or with a therapist. Print  the list from the National Institutes of Health , highlight the symptoms you have, and bring the list with you to the appointment. Read  this post from Jess at A Diary of a Mom  if you start to lose your nerve. Better yet, print it out and bring that with you, too. Find a support group. Don\u2019t find a group of angry parents who get together and spin their wheels while they rage against the oppressive system. Though they may call themselves \u201csupport groups,\u201d in my experience, those groups are toxic. Find a group of people who want to talk through the hard stuff, but who are forward-thinking problem-solvers. If you can\u2019t find one in your local community, take  the advice of Boy Wonder\u2019s Mom  and find one online. Look for people who are saying things that resonate with you, then join the conversation. Don\u2019t be afraid to jump in \u2013 bloggers are blogging because they want to connect. People are joining online communities and listservs because they are looking for others who understand. Find them. If you feel under siege, if you feel heart-wrenching pain and abject fear, if you feel like a hostage, then know these two things: You are not alone, and It will get better. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2011/2/11/asd-and-ptsd.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Making-Peace-Autism-Discovery-Unexpected/dp/1590303822/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1297461703&sr=8-1", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2009/05/01/welcome-to-the-club/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001923", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001923", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/DS00246/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/DS00246/DSECTION=coping-and-support", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001923", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2011/01/07/avalanche/", "http://theadventuresofboywonder.blogspot.com/2011/02/village.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2011/02/asd-and-ptsd.html", "title": "\nASD and PTSD\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 21, 2011", "body": "\nA friend of mine is teaching a Creative Nonfiction course this semester and he's asked me to cover a couple of classes while he's out of town.  He wants me to focus specifically on blogging and the aspects of writing creative nonfiction in the blog format that make it unique.  I'm delighted to have the opportunity - and not just so I can be the cool, fun substitute teacher - but I could use the collective wisdom of the blogosphere as my plans come together. \n \nI'll be teaching two classes.  In the first, I thought I'd introduce elements that are characteristic of the medium and decisions that bloggers make and debate as they craft their voices and shape their blog personae.  I'm thinking about things like: \n \n- The decision to use your real name or a pseudonym, and the pros and cons of each decision.  (There have got to be some great posts out there that dissect this issue.  Can anyone point me to one?) \n \n- The ethical implications of using other people's names - or, even, other people's stories, even if the names are changed. \n \n- The further implications and considerations for bloggers who write about their children:  Where does the blogger's story end and the child's story begin?  What rights of privacy should a child automatically be afforded?  What happens when the cute story you wrote about naked five-year-old Sally is discovered by the classmates of awkward eighth-grade Sally? \n \n- The many ways that parent-bloggers negotiate and balance the right-to-privacy or safety-and-security issues with the establishment of veritas and the bringing-to-life of the narrative: real names with photos; fake names with photos; real names without photos; fake names without photos - and the potential benefits and pitfalls of each. \n \n- The self-referential nature of blogging - the ongoing narrative, the link-back to previous posts, the assumption that the reader already has - or knows how to find - the backstory, the presumption that there is  always  backstory. \n \n- The phenomenon of comments - the dialogue that can ensue between author and reader, or between readers - the way that the best, meatiest, most heartfelt, most meaningful part of a post often appears in the comment section. \n \n- The communities that form through blogging - the circles that emerge - the politics of the blogroll - the danger of creating \"insiders\" and \"outsiders\" among one's readership. I remember reading a post somewhere long ago that talked about how blogging was like being back in eighth grade - and then reading a response post on a different blog about how blogging is, in fact,  nothing  like being back in eighth grade.  Does that ring a bell with anyone?  Can you point me to a link? \n \n- The existence of blog trolls - people who seem to stalk your blog obsessively, waiting for new updates (and the fact that you  know  about their existence because you have been tracking your blog stats obsessively) - and people who leave nasty, hurtful comments - almost always anonymously, with no reply address, like grenades lobbed through the blogosphere. \n \n- Flame wars and the way that misunderstandings can escalate quickly and divisively, with lines drawn and opinions entrenched within hours. \n \n- The crafting of a blogging persona and the assumption by some that because you are writing about your own life, the blog reflects exactly who you are - and the reality that blog writers shine spotlights on the areas of their lives that they want you to see, leaving the vast majority of their lives - and themselves - in the shadows. \n \nI'd be delighted - and eternally grateful - if you can point me to any blog posts you've read that delve into these subjects and capture well any perspective on them.  I'd like to avoid turning these into classes on autism blogging or mommy blogging, so I'd especially welcome suggestions from further afield (though, by all means, I'd be happy to have examples from closer to home as well). \n \nAt the end of the first class, I'd like to assign each of the students some reading, asking them to read a post or a series of posts that captures a quintessentially bloggy phenomenon - something that could only happen through writing on the web - that they can showcase them for us in the second class.  Some ideas: \n \n- Real-life implications of online writing - how the same things that make for a wonderfully snarky post can really come back to bite their author.  I'm thinking, especially, of things like being  Dooced  (or, fired for blogging about one's job), pointing them  here  - or more recently,  the blogger  who found Child Protective Services at her door because of a post that she'd written. \n \n- The collective power of blogopshere - The Bloggess's  recent response  to spam mail from a PR firm comes to mind, though I'm sure there are examples with greater heft and import (Like...?  Help me out here.) \n \n- The equalizing power of the internet and the instant access that blogging can grant to the often unsuspecting blogger - there was some  story I read once  about a kid with autism who got to meet his country music superstar hero.  And, of course, the one in which the autism mom got  invited to the White House  to share her thoughts and expertise. \n \nAnd what else?  What posts out there capture the essence of blogging?

{"date": "Sunday, August 28, 2011", "body": "\nWe're prepared. \n \nI'm not talking about Hurricane Irene, though we were, indeed, prepared for that, too - the lawn furniture in, the kitchen\u00a0stocked with bottled water, the counters covered with flashlights and batteries, the cell phones charged, the bathtub filled to the top\u00a0in case the pump house flooded.\u00a0 Luckily, though, we survived Irene unscathed. \n \nThe real preparation that has had our attention over the past days, weeks, and months, is the preparation for middle school, which was due to start tomorrow, but (thanks, Irene) will instead start on Tuesday.\u00a0 The middle school prep really started in early spring, when Bud's wise and wonderful teacher, Ms. Parker, arranged for her daughter Gretchen - a student at the middle school - to Skype with Bud.\u00a0 And so, Bud became introduced to the middle school from the comfort of his known-and-familiar elementary school, through\u00a0a medium that\u00a0gives him great comfort - the computer.\u00a0 Through several introductory meetings, Gretchen talked to Bud, then picked up her laptop and gave him tours of the building, introducing him to people she met along the way.\u00a0 Those introductions were so successful, in fact, that when I arrived for my first tour of the facility in late spring and was introduced to teachers, staff, and administrators, person after person said to me, \"Oh, Bud?\u00a0 I know Bud!\u00a0 I Skyped with him!\" \n \nAs the school year wound up, energy focused on helping the entire fifth grade start making the transition to middle school.\u00a0 Visit days were scheduled - and for Bud, pre-visit days were scheduled to help make those larger-group events even more successful.\u00a0 His team developed an Extended School Year plan for the summer that focused on both continuity and transition, with time spent at both the elementary school campus and the new middle school.\u00a0 By the time his summer program ended, Bud was not only comfortable at the middle school, but he was also starting to feel at home there. \n \nThe final week before the start of school was not included in his Extended School Year program,\u00a0of course, because it's a time when staff and teachers are\u00a0focused on professional development and\u00a0on their\u00a0own preparations for the\u00a0first weeks of school.\u00a0 I knew, though, that a\u00a0week of down time would put\u00a0Bud at\u00a0risk of losing momentum, of sliding back from the progress he'd made, and of falling prey to the anxiety of the unknown.\u00a0 So, when the team met last spring, I pitched them my idea for that final week of summer:\u00a0 Operation Continuity. \n \nThe plan was simple:\u00a0 Bud and I would arrive at the middle school at the regular opening time with a task list in hand:\u00a0\u00a0give mom a tour of the building, set up your locker, bring supplies to your classroom.\u00a0 We'd stay less than a half hour, but it would 1) help us hammer out a morning routine that requires us to leave the house 45 minutes earlier; 2) keep him in the get-up-and-go-to-school-each-day routine; and 3) allow him to see the building transform from the empty hallways in which he'd spent his summer to the bustling center of activity it would become on opening day.\u00a0 All I needed, I promised the team, was their blessing.\u00a0 No one had to develop the activities or be on hand to meet us or anything else.\u00a0 I just need to know that no one would stop us at the door or tell us we had to leave.\u00a0 They gave us the green light without hesitation. \n \nSo last week, Bud and I took the middle school by storm.\u00a0 He toured me through the building and I got to see how comfortable he is there - how well he knows the building and how at ease he is with the people.\u00a0 We decorated his locker with pictures of Dierks Bentley and he practiced opening and closing the padlock we'd purchased to avoid the frustration that a combination lock would likely bring.\u00a0 We watched as the O.T. room came together.\u00a0 We reviewed his picture schedule, already posted on the wall. \n \nAnd then, toward the end of the week, through pure serendipity,\u00a0the stars aligned.\u00a0  \n \nHis fourth grade teacher, the incredible  Ms. Walker , e-mailed me on Wednesday night.\u00a0 She said she'd be at the middle school for a workshop in the morning and she wondered if she could come by to have Bud show her his locker.\u00a0 I was delighted at the idea of having one more transition point - one more person to help usher him into this new environment. \n \nMs. Walker met us near his home room in the morning and they had a happy reunion.\u00a0 She was appropriately enthusiastic about everything he showed her, and he was happy to play tour guide.\u00a0 Ms. Walker asked Bud if he would help her find the room for her workshop and he led her up the stairs to\u00a0the cafeteria, which was already\u00a0buzzing with the sounds of teachers catching up with each other after a summer away. \n \nThen, suddenly, as if by magic,\u00a0the middle school hallway\u00a0filled with familiar elementary school\u00a0faces \u2013 faces of people who had been his lifelines for the past six years - his former teachers, his\u00a0paraprofessional aides, his\u00a0speech-language pathologist, his occupational therapist, his school nurse - all greeting him with hellos and hugs and high fives.\u00a0  \n \nIt was like somebody set off a love bomb.\u00a0 The air was infused with positivity.\u00a0 A circle formed around Bud - a circle full of people  genuinely  delighted to see him - people enthusiastic about his new school - people bursting with pride and warmth and excitement.\u00a0 Bud was so high he nearly left the ground. \n \nHe talked about that moment for the rest of the day.\u00a0 He called his dad to report on it:\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere were twenty teachers! There were HUNDREDS of them!\u201d\u00a0 And at bedtime, as we snuggled together and reflected on the day - a day that was good in lots of other ways - time spent with a favorite babysitter, a chance to swim at the college pool, computer time at mom's office - I asked him what the best thing was that day. \n \n\"The best thing...\" he said, pausing with a far-away look.\u00a0 \"The best thing...\"\u00a0 He fell silent and I waited, reminding myself that if I really wanted an answer I'd need to stay silent for at least 45 seconds.\u00a0 \"The best thing...\" \n \n\"The best thing was the teachers,\" he said. \n \nHis take-away message was clear:\u00a0\u00a0he finally knew for certain that his long-held fear would not be realized.\u00a0 He is leaving the elementary school, yes.\u00a0 But he is not losing the people who have become so important to him.\u00a0 They are still there; they are still connected.\u00a0 As he moves on to the middle school, he is simply\u00a0adding to his village. \n \nWe're prepared.\u00a0 Bud starts middle school on Tuesday.\u00a0 And he's going to rock it like a hurricane.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2011/08/well-prepared.html", "title": "\nWell prepared\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2012", "body": "\nOnce again, this year, on April 2, World Autism Day, Bud and I will be swapping out\u00a0the soft-glow energy efficient light bulb in the entryway of our house for a bright blue bulb, as we join with other households - and with the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, Niagara Falls, the Sydney Opera House, the Hungarian Parliament Building, and many other public venues worldwide - in the  Light It Up Blue  campaign, sponsored by Autism Speaks and directed at shining the spotlight on autism. \n \nI know that this is a campaign that makes some eyes roll - Is this really activism?\u00a0 In what way is it really spreading meaningful awareness or making a tangible difference in the lives of people with autism?\u00a0 Isn't it just a campaign that makes people  feel  like they're doing something good, without actually prompting them to  do  something good? \n \nLast year, I engaged in some dialogues about the relative merit of the campaign.\u00a0 This year, though, our blue light feels a lot more personal than political.\u00a0 And I'll tell you why. \n \nBud knows he has autism.\u00a0 A couple of years ago, as I was preparing\u00a0an  autism\u00a0presentation  for his classmates, my mind kept coming back to the disability rights philosophy \"Nothing about us without us.\"\u00a0 I knew that it would not be helpful to Bud or to his classmates for him to be part of the presentation, and yet, I also knew that it was not fair to give them information about him that he didn't have about himself.\u00a0 I'd never hesitated to use the word \"autism\" in front of him, but I'd also never\u00a0talked to him directly about it. \n \nAnd so, before I met with his classmates, I sat down to talk with Bud about autism.\u00a0 As you might imagine, Bud's not an analogy kind of guy, so I steered clear of any mention of toasters or hairdryers.\u00a0\u00a0Instead,\u00a0I tried to keep my explanation clear, direct, and on point.\u00a0 I told him that people have brains that work in different ways, and that the way his brain works has a name:\u00a0 autism.\u00a0 I told him that autism makes some things harder for him than they are for other kids, and it makes some things easier for him than for other kids.\u00a0 He acknowledged that he'd heard me - I think he said \"oh\" - but he didn't seem particularly interested. \n \n\"Can you think of some things that are really, really hard for you, Bud?\" I asked. \n \nAnd without missing a beat, he responded, \"Change is hard.\" \n \n\"That's exactly right, Bud,\" I said.\u00a0 \"Change IS hard, and sometimes it's a lot harder for you than it is for other kids.\u00a0 And that's because of autism.\" \n \n\"Oh,\" he said again. \n \n\"And can you think of some things that are really easy for you?\" I asked. \n \n\"Computers,\" he answered. \n \n\"That's right, \" I said.\u00a0 \"Computers are easier for you than for other kids because of your brain's autism.\u00a0 And you know how you can say all the words to TV shows?\" \n \n\"Yeah.\" \n \n\"Most other kids can't do that.\" \n \n\"They CAN'T?\" \n \n\"Nope.\u00a0 But it's easy for you because of autism.\" \n \n\"Oh.\u00a0 Cool.\" \n \nBud asked if I had autism, too, and I explained that I didn't.\u00a0 We talked about other people we know who don't have autism and other people we know who do.\u00a0 And that was about that.\u00a0 Bud's world was not rocked, but he did have a new word to carry with him. \n \nFrom that point on, I'd bring it up from time to time.\u00a0 If he was struggling with something, I'd help him take a step back by explaining that it was his autism that made it difficult for him.\u00a0 Once, when\u00a0we were at the mall, we heard a child making loud but cheerful\u00a0vocalizations that were echoing through the aisles.\u00a0  \n \n\"Why does she keep doing that?\"\u00a0Bud asked. \n \n\"She likes to do that, Bud,\" I answered.\u00a0 \"You know how you like to say the words from Teletubbies?\" \n \n\"Yes.\" \n \n\"You like to do that because of your autism.\u00a0 Well, she has something that makes her like to make that noise.\u00a0 It might be autism or it might be something else.\u00a0 Everyone is different.\" \n \n\"Oh,\" he said.\u00a0 And then, his sensory integration rattled because of the interplay between the other child's reverberating\u00a0cheerful vocalizations and his own autism, he added \"Let's get out of here.\"\u00a0 And we did, as I chalked\u00a0one up\u00a0for emerging self-advocacy skills. \n \nA short time later,\u00a0Claire Hughes-Lynch's  wonderful book \u00a0came in the mail.\u00a0 Bud, always hopeful that any package delivered to the house will include a surprise for him, asked what was inside. \n \n\"It's a book, Bud.\u00a0 It's for me.\" \n \n\"What's the book's name is?\" he asked. \n \n\"It's called  Children With High Functioning Autism .\" \n \nBud gasped.\u00a0 \"Like ME???\"  \n \n\"Yes!\u00a0 Just like you,\"\u00a0 I said, as he skipped away, delighted to be the sort of person that people write books about. \n \nSo, over time, \"autism\" became a familiar concept around our house - though, to be honest, Bud sometimes has a hard time remembering the word itself\u00a0  (\"What is it, again?\") .\u00a0 And so, last year seemed like the right time to introduce the concept of Autism Awareness, through the lens of the Light It Up Blue campaign. \n \nI explained it to Bud this way:\u00a0 People all over the world would light blue light bulbs on the same day, so that everywhere people went, they would see blue light bulbs, and the blue light bulbs would keep reminding them of the same thing:\u00a0 People with autism are important. \n \nA few days before April\u00a02nd last year, we went together to  Home Depot  to pick up a bulb.\u00a0 \"Remember, Bud?\" I said.\u00a0 \"We'll light up this blue light bulb to remind everyone who sees it\u00a0that people with autism are important.\" \n \nAnd then, it was April 2nd, and as night fell, I went outside to take out our old light bulb so we could light the house up blue.\u00a0 It was dark enough that the bulb cast an impressive glow, and I called Bud over to see it. \n \nHe stood at the front door, pressed his face against the glass, and stared with wonder no less profound than it would have been if he'd been looking at the northern lights or at a sky filled with the flashes of a meteor shower. \n \nI crouched down next to him and stared out the window at our blue-tinged front yard. \n \n\"Remember Bud?\"\u00a0 I said.\u00a0 \"Remember what the blue light means?\" \n \n\"What?\" he asked. \n \nI prompted him with the words we'd been using for weeks.\u00a0 \"The blue light reminds everyone who sees it that people with autism are...\" \n \nAnd as he stared out into the blue, he answered softly in a voice that came from a million miles away:\u00a0 \"Awesome.\" \n \nSo, yeah.\u00a0 We'll be lighting it up blue again this year.\u00a0  \n \nTo remind everyone who sees it that people with autism are important. \n \nAnd, more importantly,\u00a0to remind Bud that people with autism are awesome. \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.lightitupblue.org/Markslist/home.do", "http://www.amazon.com/Children-High-Functioning-Autism-Parents-Guide/dp/1593634021/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1332954156&sr=8-1", "http://ext.homedepot.com/community/blog/light-it-up-blue-for-autism-awareness-with-special-bulbs-from-the-home-depot/", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mmS9SZIyz8k/T3NQ-KMlY5I/AAAAAAAAA4k/ZQhgWzpxwkM/s1600/DSCN0318.JPG"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2012/03/autism-awareness-begins-at-home.html", "title": "\nAutism awareness begins at home\n"},

In it, Dierks talks about his latest single, \"Home\" - a song that pays tribute to the U.S., not by glossing over its troubles, but by acknowledging them.  It's a song that reminds us that our country was founded on struggle and challenge, that patriotism should never be blind, and that what we have, despite flaws that can sometimes be overwhelming, is worth preserving, worth repairing, and worth celebrating. \n \nMelissa Block contrasts the messages in \"Home\" with other songs in the genre, saying, \"If you listen to a bunch of recent country songs about America, patriotic songs that came out, especially after 9/11, there was a lot of chest pounding, Jingoistic tone, us versus them.\" \n \nDierks responds, \"I was trying to write a song that's just honest... That's where you find a real relief, real inspiration, real hope, real understanding of what's going on. I mean, it's easy to sell something to say 'We're number one!'  It feels good, but it's not necessarily truthful or really helpful.\" \n \nTo me, the release of \"Home\" is well-timed as we head into another election season, because it's a reminder that being truly patriotic - being a REAL American - requires us to look at our own mistakes and missteps and misunderstandings, as we try to move forward - together - in a better direction. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.npr.org/player/v2/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&t=1&islist=false&id=141468103&m=141477159"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2011/10/dierks-bentley-and-npr.html", "title": "\nDierks Bentley and NPR\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, September 05, 2012", "body": "\nIt was one of those afternoons. \n \nI imagine a similar\u00a0scene has been playing out all over the country lately, as kids return to school and spend their days trying to manage new environments with new people who have new agendas, but have not yet established new predictable routines.\u00a0 This time of\u00a0year is exhausting for Bud and though he's been making a\u00a0smooth transition to school, it's taking everything he has.\u00a0 By the time he got to me late\u00a0this afternoon, he had exhausted his reserves.\u00a0 The poor kid was just\u00a0a big jumbled mess of\u00a0reaction and emotion and dysregulation. \n \nYou can probably imagine the behavior that typically results from reaction and emotion and dysregulation - and it played out just that way.\u00a0 As it did, I tried to be clear about expectations and boundaries and consequences, but, despite that, Bud kept pushing until, ultimately, he pushed too far.\u00a0  \n \nWhen the consequences I'd promised finally\u00a0ensued, Bud's emotional dysregulation escalated and his emotion ran even higher.\u00a0 I tried to stay even, recognizing that the more he\u00a0escalated, the more I needed to be consistent.\u00a0 We spent a lot of time and he shed a lot of tears, but eventually, he accepted the reality of the situation and settled into it. \n \nAt about that time, he called his dad.\u00a0 I only heard Bud's side of the conversation, but I could surmise what was happening on the other end, as his dad tried to assess the situation, seize the teachable moment, and affirm that the consequences were warranted and fair.\u00a0 But, what I heard from Bud\u00a0was this: \n \n\"I lost my computer today.\" \n \n pause to listen to dad \n \n\"Well... because I made a bad choice.\" \n \n shorter pause \n \n\"I hit Mom.\" \n \n longer pause \n \n\"I'm going to be nice to her from now on.\" \n \nBud and his dad continued to process the events of the afternoon, while I sat at the table slack-jawed, deconstructing what I'd just heard him say. \n \nFirst:\u00a0 \"I lost my computer today.\" \n \nHe didn't say \"Mom took my computer\" - which really would have meant\u00a0\"I am a victim of circumstance\"\u00a0 or\u00a0\"A terrible injustice has been done to me.\"\u00a0  \n \nNo.\u00a0 He said, \"I lost my computer today.\"\u00a0 In other words, he said,\u00a0\"I am responsible for what happened today.\"\u00a0 He said,\u00a0\"I did something that caused something else to happen.\" \n \nIn this story, as Bud told it, the main character, the subject, the one who  owned  the action,\u00a0was Bud himself.\u00a0  \n \nThen:\u00a0 \"I made a bad choice.\" \n \nHe didn't say \"I was bad.\"\u00a0 He didn't internalize the action and allow it to chip away at his sense of self.\u00a0 He\u00a0isolated the event, framing\u00a0it not as who he  is , but simply as what he  did .\u00a0  \n \nBut it was even more than that.\u00a0 He didn't say, as I've often heard him say, \"I did a wrong thing.\"\u00a0 He took it a step further and acknowledged that as the event unfolded, he had choices.\u00a0 He acknowledged that he didn't make the best choice and that he could have made a different one. \n \nThen:\u00a0 \"I hit Mom.\" \n \nBingo.\u00a0 In three words, he acknowledged that he knew  exactly  what caused him to lose his computer - exactly where the line was - exactly when he made the wrong choice. \n \nAnd finally:\u00a0 \"I'm going to be nice to her from now on.\" \n \nIn other words, \"I know what the other choices look like.\"\u00a0 \"I know that I have another chance to make a different choice.\"\u00a0 \"I know that our relationship\u00a0will remain\u00a0intact.\" \n \nBy the time Bud went to bed, he was no longer talking about his computer.\u00a0 He was reading books and going through his normal\u00a0nighttime routine, complete with cuddling and kisses, and completely devoid of hard feelings. \n \nHe understands why things unfolded the way they did today.\u00a0 He trusts that he will get his computer back, as promised, tomorrow.\u00a0 He knows how to avoid a similar situation in the future. \n \nIt was a hard afternoon for Bud and me.\u00a0 I know Bud struggled without his beloved computer.\u00a0 I know that it was a hard and meaningful loss to him. \n \nBut it sure felt like an educational, developmental, milestone-marking\u00a0win to me.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2012/09/when-losing-is-winning.html", "title": "\nWhen losing is winning\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, February 22, 2012", "body": "\n Hello team, I just wanted to touch base after Bud\u2019s difficult day today to share my perspective on what we may be seeing. \u00a0  I apologize for the length of this e-mail, but I think it\u2019s critically important that we\u2019re on the same page as we head into the rest of \u201cspirit week.\u201d I picked Bud up after school today because, after hearing reports, I was nervous about leaving him with a sitter. \u00a0  He has been calm this afternoon, but he is also exhausted. I have a hunch there were two important factors at play today \u2013 1) emotional dysregulation in the midst of the unpredictability/high energy of a \u201ctheme\u201d week at school and 2) scripted echolalia that often takes over in the face of emotional dysregulation. 1) Emotional Dysregulation. \u00a0  Bud is often (I might even say always) overwhelmed by \u201ctheme\u201d days at school. \u00a0  \u201cFun Day\u201d is never very much fun for him. \u00a0  As a child who needs predictability and structure to succeed, he is thrown by the break from routine and the excess energy that accompanies special days. \u00a0  Even when he is looking forward to a special day, the reality of it is often overwhelming for him. \u00a0  I wrote a piece about Bud\u2019s emotional dysregulation back in 2005, which you can find  here . \u00a0  Though the piece is more than six years old, it describes a dynamic that still exists. \u00a0  When Bud is faced with a theme day, the unpredictability triggers a warning of danger for him. \u00a0  While other children see teachers dressed in pajamas and classmates wearing trash bags as a fun diversion, Bud sees it as a threat \u2013 i.e., if the rules about what people wear to school are no longer at play, then what other things that he has come to rely on might also be negotiable? \u00a0  \u00a0 In the face of this, Bud spends all of his emotional reserves managing a fight-or-flight reaction. \u00a0  What appears to be a complete disconnect on his part is actually hyper-vigilance. \u00a0  He is so anxious about other potential unexpected occurrences that he turns inward to create an inner environment that is predictable, knowable, and unchanging. \u00a0  For Bud, this inner environment almost always takes the form of a television show or website that he knows and loves.  \u00a0 He invests his energy in that scripted environment, which gives him a sense of control and helps him manage the actual environment, which, as I\u2019ve said, he perceives as a threat. As you might imagine, when this happens, he has no emotional reserves left \u2013 no energy at all, really \u2013 to expend on any of the other things that we ask him to do every day at school. \u00a0  In the language of SCERTS, this makes Bud \u201cdysregulated\u201d \u2013 or, unavailable for learning and engaging. \u00a0  When he is in that space, he is totally unable to engage in anything until he can first reestablish a sense of emotional regulation and safety \u2013 which, again, for him, means predictability and structure. This leads to\u2026 2) Echolalia As you know, spontaneous, constructed language is a challenge for Bud in the best of circumstances \u2013 when he is fully regulated, it is still hard work. \u00a0  When he is in the throes of emotional dysregulation, it\u2019s almost impossible. \u00a0  In those situations, Bud almost always defaults to echolalia \u2013 memorized scripting. A few things are important to note about Bud\u2019s echolalia: He is EXTREMELY skilled at using scripts. \u00a0  Unless you know it\u2019s a script, you often won\u2019t know it\u2019s a script. \n When he is scripting, the actual meaning of the words is usually irrelevant. \u00a0  He is usually using his scripts to convey a feeling. \u00a0  The words themselves are empty place-holders. \n Bud\u2019s echolalia is mitigated. \u00a0  In other words, he swaps out words from the actual scripts and replaces them with words that reflect his current circumstance. \u00a0  HOWEVER, it\u2019s important to remember that it is still a script, and as such, it is meant to convey an emotion. \u00a0  Though, to the rest of us, the words may imply meaning, they are still just empty place-holders for him. \n An example, which I hope will help this make sense: A current script that Bud uses is \u201cI\u2019m gonna go read in the bathroom.\u201d \u00a0  This is a phrase that Bert uses with Ernie when Ernie is distracting him and he has simply had enough. Bud frequently says \u201cI\u2019m gonna go read in the bathroom\u201d when what he means is \u201cI\u2019m tired of you trying to impose your agenda on me. \u00a0  I want to do what I want to do, without you interfering with my plan.\u201d \u00a0  It\u2019s important to note that when he says \u201cI\u2019m gonna go read in the bathroom,\u201d he is not interested in reading or in going to the bathroom. As you might imagine, though, someone who does not know this script might spend a lot of energy trying to engage Bud in choosing a book and discussing appropriate locations for reading, or they might decide that he is saying that he needs to use the bathroom, setting of an entirely different kind of negotiation. To further confuse things, it is equally likely that Bud would mitigate this script, so that instead of saying \u201cI\u2019m gonna go read in the bathroom,\u201d he might say, \u201cI\u2019m gonna go read in the cafeteria,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m gonna go eat in the bathroom,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m gonna go sleep in the kitchen.\u201d \u00a0  The rest of us can only recognize these as variations of the original script if we know the script well enough to recognize the tone and prosody and cadence of the script. \u00a0  Nonetheless, ALL of these statements inevitably mean the same thing: \u00a0  \u201cI\u2019m tired of you trying to impose your agenda on me. \u00a0  I want to do what I want to do, without you interfering with my plan.\u201d This brings me to today, which was the second consecutive theme day. \u00a0  It only occurs to me now that theme days in elementary schools happened only on Fridays, so by definition they were always a week apart, which gave him recoupment time after each one. \u00a0  This structure is likely a lot more challenging for him. Bud was VERY excited about pajama day. \u00a0  In fact, he spent the whole weekend talking about it and planning for it. \u00a0  He invested a great deal of emotional energy planning for it, and his plans created the structure and predictability he needed to successfully manage the day. \u00a0  He did not have the same plan in place for recycle day, and I believe his emotional well had run dry by the time he realized that he was facing another out-of-the-ordinary (and so, fight-or-flight) day today. As a result, he focused inward, imposed an internal script to restore predictability to his world, and reverted to scripting as his primary means of communication. \u00a0  Some of the reports about things he said today were very troubling to me and didn\u2019t sound like him at all, so I tried to talk to him about it tonight. \u00a0  Here\u2019s what I gleaned: 1. \u00a0  I asked Bud if he talked about chasing someone with an axe. \u00a0  He answered (happily \u2013 one of the beautiful things about him is that he is rarely cagey about such things), that he had. \u00a0  I asked what that was from and he said it was from the woodsman from Little Red Riding Hood \u2013 \u201che grabbed his axe and started chasing the wolf.\u201d \u00a0  My hunch is that whatever emotion that portion of Little Red Riding Hood speaks to for Bud was the emotion he was trying to convey with those words. 2. \u00a0  I asked him if he knew about shooting. \u00a0  He said, \u201cYes. \u00a0  Shooting stars.\u201d \u00a0  I asked if he knew any other kind of shooting. \u00a0  He thought for a minute and said \u201cShooting arrows. It\u2019s a sport.\u201d \u00a0  I pushed further \u2013 what else can you use to shoot?  \u00a0 What other kind of shooting is there? \u00a0  He said, \u201cShoot something from the Oregon Trail\u201d (a computer game they played at school last year). \u00a0  I asked what shooting they did and he said \u201chunt buffalo and kill rattlesnakes.\u201d \u00a0  I asked what else people use a gun for and he said \u201cUse guns to shoot rocks into the earth like a meteorite.\u201d \u00a0  I continued to ask about shooting from a number of different perspectives to see if he had any sense that people sometimes use guns to shoot other people, but I got no information that led me to believe that\u2019s in his frame of reference at all. For that reason, I simply find it hard to believe that he said he was going to shoot someone in the cafeteria. \u00a0  I do believe that whatever he did say was interpreted that way \u2013 but I also think that if he said something about shooting, the words were meaningless place-holders meant to convey an emotional state. \u00a0  They were not spontaneously constructed language that could be interpreted literally. \u00a0  The words themselves were as empty as \u201cI\u2019m gonna go read in the bathroom.\u201d That being said, though, I am not aware of any script Bud has that involves the word \u201cshoot.\u201d \u00a0  However, twice this afternoon, Bud said \u201cI\u2019m going to shoo them away.\u201d \u00a0  He was talking about the neighbor\u2019s dogs, but because he used the same cadence and inflection both times, it was clearly a script \u2013 and I have to wonder if it\u2019s the same script he was using in the cafeteria today, which may have been mis-heard and misinterpreted, since, sadly, we adults have a very different frame of reference for the tragedies that can occur in school cafeterias these days. I imagine that we may see some of the same behaviors from Bud as we head into the rest of spirit week, and I think it\u2019s a good idea to have a game plan. \u00a0  My suggestions: I\u2019ve written a brief social story (attached). \u00a0  I\u2019ll review it with him, and suggest that it might be a good idea to start his day at school with it and revisit it throughout the day as his dysregulation emerges.  \n Predictability and structure can make all the difference in the world. \u00a0  I know he has a schedule for the day, but I suggest breaking it down into much smaller pieces. \u00a0  Break \u201creading\u201d into a series of steps that let him know exactly what he can expect during reading time. \u00a0  It often helps to give him a checklist that he can physically check off as he completes each step \u2013 holding it in his hands and checking it off himself gives him a sense of control. \n If he is scripting \u2013 or if he\u2019s saying things that don\u2019t seem to make sense \u2013 ask \u201cWhat is that from?\u201d \u00a0  If he doesn\u2019t answer, just pick a show \u2013 \u201cBud, is that from Sesame Street?\u201d \u00a0  He won\u2019t be able to resist the urge to correct you (\u201cNo, it\u2019s from Dragon Tales.\u201d) \u00a0  Once he has identified it as a script, it gives you a point of connection from which to build. \u00a0  Ask him who said it, what made them say it, and how they were feeling when they said it. \u00a0  It will help you help him talk about how he\u2019s feeling in the moment. \u00a0  It will also help pull him out of his inner scripted world and into your world. \n If he says anything disconcerting or unusual, please, please, please, stop what you\u2019re doing and write it down verbatim for me. \u00a0  It is not at all helpful for me to know \u201che said something about hurting people\u201d and very, very helpful for me to know \u201che said \u2018poison them, drown them, bash them on the head\u2019\u201d (Cruella de Vil \u2013 which means he was feeling an excess of emotion and he didn\u2019t know what to do with it, but he knew he had to get it out.) \n Thanks for your time, and thanks for your help with this. \u00a0  I feel certain that if we\u2019re all on the same page, we can help Bud successfully navigate the rest of the week. \u00a0  Please don\u2019t hesitate to call me. \u00a0  I\u2019d also be happy to meet at any time, if it seems like more brainstorming would be useful. All the best, MOM-NOS \n Social story: It is spirit week at school. During spirit week, students and teachers dress differently. \u00a0  Sometimes they wear funny things. I can dress up for spirit week if I want to. \u00a0  I can wear my regular clothes instead if I want to. Even though people are dressed funny, school is the same during spirit week. Students pay attention to teachers and do their work during spirit week. I will pay attention and do my work, too. If I am having a hard time, I will use Bud words to talk to Mrs. Edwards about it. I will have fun and work hard during spirit week. \n \n \n 2/23/12 - Edited to add: \n Several people have written to ask how Bud's team responded to this e-mail.\u00a0 I'm happy to report that their response was fast and enthusiastic - which is not surprising, since,  as I've mentioned before , we work with an extraordinary team.\u00a0 Each team member responded to me \u00a0individually.\u00a0 They wrote to thank me, to ask if they could share the e-mail with others who work with Bud, to offer new thoughts and\u00a0suggestions, and to\u00a0problem-solve.\u00a0 And through these responses, I got the most important message of all - the one that told me that every one of them is committed to helping my child\u00a0succeed. \n \n There are good people out there.\u00a0 Truly.\u00a0 Find them, and collaborate, collaborate, collaborate. \n \n My thanks to  Autism Speaks  and Jess from  Diary of a Mom  for linking to this post and directing so much traffic here today.\u00a0 If this is your first time here, welcome - and please feel free to  click here  to follow Bud and me on Facebook. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/#!/autismspeaks", "http://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2012/02/23/following-the-script/", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/MOM-Not-Otherwise-Specified/194673183927449"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2012/02/spirited-away.html", "title": "\nSpirited away\n"},

\n \nWell.\u00a0 Everything. \n \nThat's why the updates have been hard to post.\u00a0 How do you write about  everything ?  \n \nSo here are the thumbnails, to get you up to speed. \n \nMy parents moved to another state\u00a0just a couple of months after that September post.\u00a0 Bud had seen them every day since he was two months old - had lived in the same house with them since he was two years old\u00a0- and then, suddenly, they moved two hours away.\u00a0 It was a good move - it was the  right  move - but it was a big move. \n \nMy dad's Alzheimer's has continued to progress.\u00a0 It's hard for everyone, though I imagine that it's hardest for my mom.\u00a0 He just turned 90 - a happy occasion and a bittersweet milestone.\u00a0 And, despite the distance, despite the difficulties, he and Bud continue to have a relationship that takes my breath away. \n \nBud and I are living in a residence hall on the college campus where I work.\u00a0 The planets aligned at just the right time personally and professionally and the plan fell easily into place.\u00a0 It's a few miles and a thousand light years from our little house on the dirt road in the woods, but it's been a good move for both of us. \n \nMy house is on the market.\u00a0 Where it sits.\u00a0 And sits.\u00a0 And sits.\u00a0  \n \nThere are new relationships in my life and in Bud's - new game-changing relationships with people who have come to mean more to us than we could possibly have predicted a year and a half ago.\u00a0  \n \nAnd, of course, there's Bud - the boy who has historically struggled with transition and change more than any other issues.\u00a0 In this year full of external change - different settings and locales, new people in his daily life, new kinds of relationships - he has also turned 13, an age marked by tumultuous, ongoing internal changes. \n \nSo, yeah.\u00a0 It's been a fast-paced, head-spinning, change-everything eighteen months for Bud and me.\u00a0 And every bit of it has been hard and messy and challenging and painful and really, really good. \n \nI can't really go into detail on any of it.\u00a0 As I've said a million times before, I am hesitant to tell stories that are not mine alone - to share information that's not really mine to share.\u00a0 So, instead, I want to tell you about something else - a philosophy that has helped ground me and guide me through this time of head-spinning change: \n \nIt's called Appreciative Inquiry. \n \nI was introduced to the concept at an academic advising\u00a0workshop at work almost two years ago.\u00a0 The premise of the workshop went something like this: \n \nYou are an academic advisor.\u00a0 You're meeting with an advisee\u00a0about her mid-semester grades.\u00a0 She has a D in Biology, Bs in Writing, Math, and History, and an A in Psychology. \n \nHow do you start the meeting? \n \nIf you're like most advisors, you start with a little chit chat - how are you doing, isn't this weather beautiful, my what a lovely scarf you're wearing - and then you jump to the heart of the matter: the D.\u00a0 What's going on in Biology? \n \nBut the workshop encouraged a different approach - one called \"appreciative advising\" - in which the advisor follows the chit-chat with an entirely different focus: the A.\u00a0 What's going on in Psychology? \n \nIt's a simple shift, but it's transformative.\u00a0 It changes the whole paradigm of the conversation, moving it from \"what's going wrong?\" to \"what's going right?\"\u00a0 It encourages the student to focus on her success - to identify and articulate why she is successful, what conditions are enabling her success, what talents she's using, what strategies are working. \n \nAnd then, once the student has explored that, the question expands:\u00a0  How can you do more of that? \n \nIn other words, what can we take from our analysis of your work in Psychology to apply to your work in Writing and Math and History and Biology?\u00a0 How can we build on the success you have already established - the skills you already exhibit - the strategies you already know how to employ? \n \nIt's likely that an advising session framed through the lens of appreciative inquiry leads a student to feel\u00a0 empowered and prepared for success, because it starts with the assumption of strength.\u00a0 In contrast, the more traditional \"What's going on in Biology?\" conversation starts in a place of challenge.\u00a0 It starts where the student feels least confident, where her footing is least sure.\u00a0 It is a less sturdy foundation on which to build. \n \nBut it's not just a model for academic advising.\u00a0 When my department was asked to re-engineer in an effort to save money and increase efficiency, we read\u00a0  a monograph ,  The Thin Book of Appreciative Inquiry  by Sue Annis Hammond, which introduces appreciative inquiry as a model for approaching organizational change.\u00a0 The book transformed my thinking.\u00a0 \"It never occurs to us that we can fix an organization or even our society by doing more of what works,\" Hammond writes.\u00a0 \"We are obsessed with learning from our mistakes.\u00a0 But, why not allow our successes to multiply enough to crowd out the unsuccessful?\" \n \nHammond draws a distinction between having a  problem-solving  focus, which is how we typically approach change, and having an  appreciative inquiry  focus, which she suggests is more effective.\u00a0 When we problem-solve, we try to do less of something we don't do well - we try to fix what's broken.\u00a0 When we employ appreciative inquiry, we try to do more of what works - we try to capitalize on the things that are already effective. \n \nHammond suggests that the traditional problem-solving approach is the old \"Don't think of an elephant\" directive.\u00a0 How do you NOT think of an elephant?\u00a0 If you're like most of us, you start by thinking of an elephant, and then you try to unthink it.\u00a0 The unthinking is nearly impossible to do, and you find yourself hopelessly stuck with a mind full of nothing but elephants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nBut what if the elephant is out of the equation entirely?\u00a0 What if we use the appreciative inquiry model instead and we focus on the thing we want more of? What if we simply say, \"Think of a lemur?\"\u00a0 Instantly, our imaginations are full of leaping, swinging primates, and there's not a trunk or an ivory tusk to be found.\u00a0 Suddenly, through appreciative inquiry, we don't have to worry about the elephant problem, because it has gone away on its own.\u00a0  There is no elephant to eliminate. \n \nWhen we use appreciative inquiry, says Hammond - when we identify what's working and then do more of it - the problems that have existed will fade away naturally.\u00a0 She identifies a four step process in making that happen: \n \n- Appreciating and valuing the best of \"what is\" \n \n- Envisioning \"what might be\" \n \n- Dialoguing \"what should be\" \n \n- Innovating \"what will be\" \n \nIt's a simple premise, but it can be difficult to employ - especially for those of us raised in a culture that has encouraged us to tackle problems head on - to focus on the D in Bio instead of on the A in Psych. \n \nBut I'm telling you - when I've been able to do it - when I have really focused on it and been very intentional about it - it works.\u00a0 It's been instrumental in shaping organizational change in my workplace.\u00a0 And, truly, I can't imagine how some of the changes that I've experienced over the past 18 months would have been possible had it not been for appreciative inquiry. \n \nI wish I could say that things are leveling out in my life and that the waves of change have calmed, but I don't think that's the case.\u00a0 That's life, though, right?\u00a0 Change is the only constant.\u00a0 There's a lot to think about, both in the short term and the long term, for Bud and for me.\u00a0 At times, it can be completely overwhelming.\u00a0 So I'm glad my subconscious led me back to this post today - a post that's been lingering in draft form for at least four months - to remind me that I already know what I need to do next. \n \nNext, I need to figure out what's working. \n \nAnd then, I need to do more of it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Thin-Book-Appreciative-Inquiry-Series/dp/0966537319/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1359418576&sr=8-2&keywords=appreciative+inquiry"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2013/02/appreciative-living.html", "title": "\nAppreciative living\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 11, 2011", "body": "\nIt's been a hard week. \n \nI've written before about  my dad's Alzheimer's  and about  the beautiful relationship that he and Bud have .  Both of these things have been weighing heavily on my mind this week. \n \nMy dad fell on Tuesday.  He was alone in the yard when it happened, so we don't know the circumstances, don't know how hard the fall was, don't know how long he was down, don't know what he had to do to get up.  An x-ray revealed that he had fractured a rib - a problem for which the only solution is time.   \n \nThe first days after his fall were frightening, because, as often happens with Alzheimer's, the pain, or the pain medication, or both, transformed his dementia into delirium.  When he slept, his sleep was fitful, his hands moving, his legs twitching, and his lips murmuring unintelligibly, but with purpose.  When he woke up, he was bewildered and angry - he had things to do, he insisted, and we were keeping him from them.   \n \nHis condition worsened, his pain so extreme that we were unable to move him.  He ate very little.  His speech was slow and muffled.  His eyes were wild.  I was afraid that we were - that Bud was - losing him completely. \n \nThe past 24 hours have been transformative, though.  A visiting nurse and a home health aide have been in.  My sister, my mom, and I have been joined by family friends with experience dealing with situations like this.  My dad's pain is being managed.  He is more mobile.  His eyes are clearer.  His dementia is less extreme, allowing him to spend longer stretches of time engaged with us and making his mental forays away briefer.  It's clear, though, that we can't leave him unattended at all.  Not right now.  Maybe not ever again.   \n \nSo, the big questions - the new realities - are still largely unknown and overwhelming, but for the first time in days, I find that I can exhale a little.  I'm starting to reflect on the past week - a week during which I feel like I spent my time vacillating between two postures - flailing action and paralyzed inaction.  I flailed my way through my life outside the house - tearing through my to-do lists without being able to prioritize in any meaningful way - applying quick-fix resolution to issues that really deserved more thoughtful consideration, and postponing action on mundane things that could have been more easily settled.  And then, when I walked through the door to my house - saw my father in his bed, confronted his labored breathing, heard his muddled speech, looked into his wild eyes - my mind went blank.  My to-do list vanished.  I felt completely at a loss. \n \nThings are better now, of course, but there is still so much that needs to be done, and I find myself struggling to fight paralysis without starting to flail.  But it's hard to know what I should be doing.  I feel like I should plan - but for what? for how long? with whom?  Without knowing what we're really facing, it's hard to know where to put my energy. \n \nMy best cues, though - the most useful bits of wisdom I've gleaned in recent days - have come from the two sources I'd have thought most unlikely - the two people whose expertise I'd clearly underestimated most:  Bud and my dad. \n \nBecause this week, while I stood looking at my father, trying to fight my paralysis, but feeling the panic rise within me, Bud brushed past me, ran to his grandfather's side, and greeted him joyfully, \"Hey-a, Papa!  How you doing?\" \n \nAs I stood worrying about my father's hygiene, concerned about the time he'd laid still in bed, unkempt and unwashed, Bud clamored up beside his sleeping grandfather, nestled in, and said, \"I love you soooooo much.\" \n \nAs my father slept and I walked aimlessly around the house wondering what I should be  doing , Bud sat in the chair by his Papa's bed, matching Papa's labored breath with his own, slow breathing - his eyes closed, his ankles crossed, sharing the stillness. \n \nAs I made room for the professionals who came in to help my father sit, stand, walk, bathe, eat, and I found myself hovering on the periphery, unsure if I was staying on the sidelines for the sake of my father's privacy or because of my own discomfort, Bud settled himself in the center of the action, assuming the roles of both head coach and cheerleader.  He sat across from Papa, his arms crossed, intently watching the nurses in action, and chiming in frequently with encouragement and support:  \"Papa, the nurse is going to give you a check-up and it WON'T. HURT. ONE. BIT,\" and \"You're doing great, Papa!\" and \"I'm very proud of you.\" \n \nAs my father's color returned and his breathing normalized and he settled into an easy chair, I collapsed in on myself, focused on my own relief, but Bud sidled up to Papa, stroking his arms and patting his head. \n \nAnd my father.  My father.  Even when things were at their worst - when his eyes were their wildest - when he seemed unsure of where he was, how he got there, and what in the world was happening to him - he consistently recognized Bud.  When the rest of us could barely get a response from him, my father still brightened when Bud entered the room.  The fog lifted temporarily and my father spoke more clearly than he had all day:  \"Hey, buddy.  How was your day?\" \n \nBoth my heart and my mind are still trying to process it all.  But the messages, I think, are clear. \n \nFrom Bud, the message is this:  Be there for Papa.  Stop focusing on who he was and on who you want him to be.  See who he IS.  Love who he is.  Stop thinking and trying and pushing and planning and doing - and just BE with him.  Be present to him.  Just be there. \n \nFrom my father, the message is this:  Be there for Bud.  Set aside your own confusion, forget your own fear, step outside your own pain, and be there for him.  Stop trying to plan for, to warn about, to protect from, and just BE with him.  Be present to him.  Just be there. \n \nAnd I'm trying.  I'm trying to be there.  I am.  I have two extraordinary role models - two exceptional teachers. \n \nI'm a slow learner.   \n \nBut I'm trying.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2011/09/being-there.html", "title": "\nBeing there\n"},

I can't blame him, really. Around here, we stay bundled from October to May, and for the most part, even a balmy day can be followed by a blast of arctic air. You don't want to be caught with your pants... er... short. Still, the forecast for Tuesday called for temperatures over 90 degrees, and an overheated boy means an unpleasant school day even if the boy is overheated by choice, so last weekend I started talking to Bud about his impending clothing transition. He was having none of it. His logic went something like this: Short are for summer. Summer starts in June. It is still May. Therefore, arms and legs must be covered and jackets must be worn. But I was relentless. I talked about the importance of wearing the right clothing for the weather, regardless of what the calendar says. I wrote a social story. I asked the team at school for reinforcement. And I put a call out to friends for words of advice. It was my friend  VTBudFan  who offered the best, most succinct advice - four letters, brilliant in their simplicity: WWDW? What Would  Dierks  Wear? It was my ace in the hole - my sure-fire solution if my social story went belly-up. I had no doubt that a picture of Bud's hero in shorts in May would have the desired effect. But I never got to test the theory. By Monday night, the social stories and conversations with Mrs. Nee had worked their magic, and Bud slept in summer-weight pajamas, with his shorts and t-shirt laid out and ready for the morning. He's been happily weather-appropriate ever since.

I've fallen so far off the blogging wagon I'm not even sure what  other  bloggers are doing these days. Now, I'm not getting down on myself for not posting regularly in 2009. There are lots of reasons - lots of  good  reasons - why I didn't. But there are three things that occur to me as I contemplate the number 31. First, I think that, for me, a scarcity of posts is a phenomenon that feeds on itself. There is a game my brain plays with itself, that goes something like this:  if I'm only going to have one post a month , my brain contends,  then it better be a darned  good  post.  When I'm posting a couple of times a week, I don't feel the same kind of self-imposed pressure. I can post a little nothing sort of post, secure in the knowledge that it will drop from top billing in just a couple of days. Not so when I think it might stay there for weeks on end. As a result, most things don't feel post-worthy, and even more time passes between posts. Second, I miss blogging. I miss the mental exercise of writing. I miss the regular interaction with the blogging community. And most importantly, third, I think I'm a better parent - a more  mindful  parent - when I'm blogging than when I'm not blogging. When I'm blogging, I reflect more on the everyday as I parse through our life and think about where to shine the blogging spotlight. And then, more often than not, the very act of trying to give those moments shape by putting them into words forces me to look at things differently, to make connections I might otherwise miss, to discover things I didn't know I knew. So, I'm resolving. I'm not ready to make a year-long resolution, but I am prepared to start a little BloPoMo of my own, in hopes of finding my BloPo mojo again. I'll be posting every day in January. I may not have anything at all to say, but I will be logging in, writing down, and hitting publish. Feel free to ignore them - I may end up with a whole lot of posts about what I had for lunch. But I'll tell you this for sure: in 2010, I'll be hitting at least 32.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/01/be-it-resolved.html", "title": "\nBe it resolved\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 30, 2010", "body": "\nIt seems Bud has decided that he doesn't like a heavy dose of melancholy in his music. This is not exactly a new phenomenon - for years, he has avoided Keith Urban's song \"Everybody\" because, he says, \"it makes me strain.\" But recently, there seem to be more songs that are pulling his heartstrings in all the wrong directions, and he's having none of it. I get it, since I tend to be the same way with books and movies - I mean, life can be tough enough all on its own; I don't need heartbreak and despair in my entertainment. So, when a song like Carrie Underwood's \"Just a Dream\" comes on and I hear Bud's cautious \"Mom?\" piping up from the back seat, I quickly change the station and find a more upbeat tune. Sometimes, though, Bud just wants to provide a little commentary on the music that's playing or ask a question about the lyrics, so I try not to make assumptions about how a particular song will affect him until he lets me know. The other day, Bud and I were in the middle of a long road trip when Trace Adkins' \"I Wanna Feel Something\" came on. It's not a new song and Bud has heard it a million times before without comment. This time, though, as the song came to its chorus, \"I want a heart that beats and bleeds, A heart that's bustin' at the seams, I wanna care, I wanna cry, I wanna scream. I just wanna feel something,\" I heard Bud's voice from behind me. \"Mom,\" he said, \"it's satisfying.\" \"What's satisfying, Bud?\" \"Trace. 'I Wanna Feel Something.' It's satisfying.\" \"You feel satisfied?\" I asked. \"Yeah,\" he said. But the \"yeah\" sounded just a touch too glum to me. Something wasn't adding up. \"What does 'satisfying' mean, Bud?\" I asked. \"Means it makes me sad,\" he answered. Ah. Not satisfying. Sad isfying. Got it.

{"date": "Friday, August 31, 2007", "body": "\nI'll admit it: I was skeptical when the offer came in. Last month's e-mail from Sourcebooks, Inc., the publisher of Jonathan Levy's book  What You Can Do Right Now to Help Your Child with Autism , explained that the book: offers parents 10 specific ways to help their autistic children interact better in the world. The techniques Jonathan outlines in this book were developed by the Autism Treatment Center of America and have produced dramatic results with children whose illnesses range from mild Asperger\u2019s Syndrome to severely autistic. Even following only some of the 10 suggested methods can produce positive changes in autistic children. Of the over 800 families that Jonathan has worked with in the past 12 years, only 3 did not see differences in their children. It sounded promising, of course. But \"1o specific ways\" to help my autistic child? I mean, if it were  that  easy - well, I wouldn't really need a book on it, would I? But, I figured, what did I have to lose? I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. Levy's book is a quick read. It's easily accessible and instantly understandable. And it's full to the brim with suggestions and examples that resonated with me - that sounded like  just the thing  to help me approach this or that issue that I'm currently working on with Bud. Levy does, indeed, suggest ten specific things, and he makes no mystery of them - they're listed right there in the table of contents. They are listed, even, in the publisher's press release. They are: 1) Don\u2019t react 2) Make eye contact a priority 3) Join the stims 4) Coping with crying 5) Give the child as much control as possible 6) Focus on attitude 7) Work one-on-one in a nondistracting environment 8) Be dynamic with the child 9) Go directly to language 10) Make sure food isn\u2019t part of the problem But it's not the list itself that is the goldmine in this book; it's the way that Levy unpacks the list. For each item, Levy provides four things: 1) a good description of a specific problem; 2) a very tangible suggestion about how to address the problem; 3) solid philosophical underpinnings that explain why the suggestion makes sense; and 4) a real-life example of the suggestion in action. And best of all, it is not only easy to understand what Levy is explaining, but it is also easy to implement the suggestions he makes. Levy is honest and up-front with the fact that he approached his work through one very specific model, the Son Rise program, which he used in his work with the Autism Treatment Center of America. I'll be honest and up-front with the fact that I have almost no familiarity with the Son Rise program, so this post is neither an endorsement for nor a critique of it. I will say, though, that many of the suggestions he makes and examples he gives - especially those that resonated most with me - also seemed to fall in line with many of the philosophies that underlie  RDI . That's not to say that I agreed wholeheartedly with everything Levy had to offer. I found some suggestions that seemed not-quite-right for Bud and me. I found only one that seemed entirely wrong. But, mostly, I found gem after gem after gem. And here's one of the things I liked best about Levy's style and philosophy: In three different places in the book - including the introduction and the conclusion - he made statements like this: I ask that you read this book with an open mind and heart. If there is advice or activities in the book that you don't agree with, don't do them. Understand, though, that everything here is my best advice to you. Perfect. I'm glad I read this book when I did - just before the start of a new school year, as Bud is transitioning into a new school setting with new professional and paraprofessional staff. This is exactly the sort of book I want to pass on to the people who'll work with Bud in the years to come - easy to read, easy to grasp, easy to implement. I have a hunch that my copy of this book will be well worn by the end of the fall semester. Levy provides ten suggestions of things you can do right now to help your child with autism. I'll just provide one: Read this book. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/08/what-you-can-do-right-now-to-help-your.html", "title": "\nWhat You Can Do Right Now to Help Your Child with Autism\n"},

Here, then, are ten things that Bud and I have in common: 1.  We have the same taste in music.  We don't just like the same artists; the same tracks from those artists, the same melodic turns, the same tempos, the same instrumental breaks, the same harmonies seem to capture us both. 2.  We both have an uncanny capacity for remembering song lyrics.  My ability is far greater than the average person's; Bud's ability is far greater than mine. 3.  We both love road trips.  We look forward to the weekends, when \"Mom and Bud Days\" afford us the opportunity to pack a lunch, pack the car, and head somewhere, windows down and music playing.  The destination is rarely as important to either of us as the trip itself.  We like to be out - we like to be doing - we like to be active. 4.  We are fans of technology.  Computers, iPods, satellite radio, TiVo, you name it - we rarely meet a technology we don't enjoy. 5.  We both love books and we are both good readers. 6.  We both dislike math.  7.  We enjoy the outdoors.  We like walking in the woods.  We like picking blueberries in the summer and apples in the fall.  We like spending time at the lake and at the ocean. We like to feel the sun on our skin and the wind in our hair. 8.  We like spending time with the people in our lives.  We are also comfortable spending time alone. 9.  We both have seasonal allergies, and both use prescription nasal sprays.  10.  In the summer, we prefer wearing sandals to wearing socks and shoes or sneakers.  We also like being barefoot.  In the winter, we both wear socks to bed.

{"date": "Friday, July 27, 2007", "body": "\nAt Bud's school, new classroom placement is distributed to students in their report cards as they leave the building on the last day of school, so there is very little opportunity for kids or parents to compare notes and figure out who will be where in the coming year unless they run into each other during the summer. So, like the rest of the soon-to-be-second-grade families, we've been keeping our eyes out for Bud's first-grade friends when we're out and about in town to try to get the scoop on how his second-grade classroom has shaped up. As I've  written before , Bud's first grade classroom was magical. The other children were big fans of Bud, and he returned their affection wholeheartedly. If the whole gang of them could have moved together to a new classroom, I would have been downright delighted. What we've discovered as we've talked to friends around town, though, is that most of the other children from Bud's class have landed in one of the other three second grade classrooms. Parents are speculating that the mix is intentional, so that by the time our children have made it through to the regional middle school, they will know all of the other children from their own elementary school. And, honestly, I trust Bud's team implicitly and I know that they had a hand in pupil placement. I'm certain they have created a good nest for Bud, so, really, my worries are few. But one child we haven't run into this summer is Bud's very best friend from first grade,  Kelly . Kelly is the child who greeted Bud every morning when we entered the classroom. Each night, when I asked him who he played with at recess or ate with at snack, hers was always the first name I heard. So, naturally, I wondered where Kelly had landed in the second-grade shake-up. My questions were answered recently when a letter arrived in the mail for Bud. On top of a full page drawing of a girl and her family enjoying a day at the beach were the following words in perfect seven-year-old scrawl: Dear Bud I am in Mrs. Connemara's class Iam wudring iF you are. Love Kelly P.S. Iam having Fun are you? I have a lose toth! Bud played it cool when he read Kelly's letter, but I could tell he was happy to get it. I suggested several times that he write back, but each time he told me that he'd do it later. Tonight I pushed a little harder, and Bud sat down at the computer, put Kelly's letter next to the keyboard for reference, and wrote back: Deer kelly I am in mrs connemarals class. I am wuodering if you love Bud ps I am having fun are you? Call 193256906788216789 be your Bud Buuuuup be be be dooooo wop buuuuuuup bee booodoo seeeeeeeeeeee4wweweweeebrbrbvwioop qewvxsdooooo buuuup beee beee I asked Bud for clarification on some of the finer points.  Had he left out some words?,  I wondered to myself. \"Bud, what are you wondering?  'I am wondering if you...' \" \"I am wondering if you love Bud.\" Okay. So clarified. \"And  'Call 193256906788216789 be your Bud' ? What do you want Kelly to do?\" \"Hug me.\" Gotcha. After a bit more clarification, I added notes in the margin to let Kelly know that the long string of digits is a pretend phone number and that the second paragraph is a song. But, the fact is, Kelly probably doesn't need the clarification the way I did. She might guess what each thing is on her own, but even if she didn't, it probably wouldn't matter to her. She'd probably just laugh with recognition of Bud's unique and quirky style. Because that's just how it is with friends.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/07/dear-friend.html", "title": "\nDear friend\n"},

This morning I attended the first-grade poetry reading, a Valentines Day event that had been postponed earlier in the week because of inclement weather. When we entered Bud's classroom, we found all the desks pushed to the side, the chairs lined up for the audience of parents, and a space cleared on the carpet for the children to take the stage. Bud stayed close - but didn't seem anxious - as the room filled up with children and parents. While the rest of the children took their places on the carpet, Bud slid onto my lap in the front row. His neurotypical friend Michael - also not inclined to perform in public - slipped into the seat behind us, next to his mom. The program included songs and poems performed by the children solo and in small groups, with a couple of numbers from the whole ensemble. Bud sat happily, smiling as he watched his friends, applauding enthusiastically after each performance. When the time came for his assigned poem, the one he's been practicing at home for weeks, the other children in his group formed a line on the carpet. Ms. Parker turned to us, and before she finished asking \"Bud, would you like to join your friends?\" he was on his feet and rushing to stand just behind his group. His group recited the poem - a call-and-response rhyme with a complicated meter - while he read along silently behind them. When the poem ended, he bounded back joyfully to where I was sitting. A short time later, the program called for Maddi to sing a solo. There must be some history here that I don't know, because Ms. Parker once again turned and asked Bud if he'd like to come up. Bud jumped up and joined Maddi, and while she sang a sweet song about chicken soup, Bud stood next to her, waved to his friends and flashed a \"thumbs-up\" to the audience. When the song ended, I let out a loud whoot as the rest of the parents applauded politely. Bud ran into my arms and bowed repeatedly as the applause continued. When the program ended, Ms. Parker asked parents to help get the desks back in place, and suddenly the room was filled with noise and movement. Bud's friend Kelly dashed across the room to where Bud was standing. \"Bud!\" she cried, \"You did a great job!\" He hugged her, then turned to look for me in the swarming mass of parents, desks, and children. I suggested that we take a break and go to the bathroom, and he readily agreed. When we emerged a minute later, the room was still loud and buzzing with activity, but one girl, Jamie, stood patiently outside the bathroom door holding sound-blocking headphones, one of the tools for self-regulation that Bud has available in the classroom. Jamie held out the headphones and said, \"Bud, would you like to use these?\" Bud murmured a \"yes,\" took them from her, and slipped them over his ears. \"Thank you, Jamie,\" I said. \"You are  such  a good friend!\" Jamie smiled as she walked away. Bud had a wonderful belated Valentines celebration with his friends. And I don't know - I could be wrong here - but watching Kelly and Jamie today... well, something tells me that I'm not the  only  person who thinks that they don't come any cuter than Bud.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/02/poetry-in-motion.html", "title": "\nPoetry in motion\n"},

Blogger, friend, and fellow autism mom Kristina Chew, who chronicles life with her son Charlie on  Autismland  and provides soapbox wisdom on  AutismVox , is quoted in an article about today's premeire of the  extended version of Autism Every Day  at the  Sundance  festival. I've been hoping that, in response to concerns raised  here  and  elsewhere  about the one-sided portrayal of the bleak life of parents of children with autism, the lengthier version would attempt to provide a more balanced view - not a whitewashed view, just a more  accurate one . I'm not sure it does. From  The New York Times : As he worked on a documentary about children with autism, Eric Solomon wanted its opening sequence to have an impact similar to the start of \u201cSaving Private Ryan,\u201d he said: \u201cThe soldiers are storming the beach and you feel like you\u2019re in battle with them.\u201d  The film, \u201cAutism Every Day,\u201d is being shown starting Jan. 21 at the 2007  Sundance Film Festival  in Park City, Utah. Its first 90 seconds are an uncomfortable, compelling sequence of children crying, shouting and rocking as their parents struggle to restrain, comfort and connect with them. Enter Kristina to provide an alternate perspective on Solomon's goal of making viewers feel like they're \"in battle with them\": That focus has angered some families. Kristina Chew, a mother of an autistic child who writes two blogs about the disorder, said the initial version of the documentary \u201cportrayed a tone of hopelessness.\u201d I am trying to keep an open mind about the new extended version, which I have not seen.  The New York Times  reports:  \"While the filmmakers capture hope, love and determination, the documentary also reveals the unrelenting stress and occasional despair in rearing children with autism.\"  Most of the parents I know who are raising children with autism experience stress sometimes. Some of them experience \"occasional despair.\" And all of them are fueled by \"hope, love, and determination.\" I hope that the  Autism Every Day  that's screening at Sundance is both new  and  improved, and that it depicts the whole spectrum of emotion, the whole spectrum of experience, the whole spectrum that  is  the spectrum. I'll give the film a chance, and I'll view it when it becomes available. In the meantime, I'll continue to follow the adventures of Charlie and his family as they experience the stress, the hope, the determination and, most of all, the love that is  Autismland .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/21lifilm.html?_r=2&ref=nyregionspecial2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/", "http://www.autismvox.com/", "http://festival.sundance.org/2007/", "http://www.autism-hub.co.uk/autism-speaks-dont-speak-for-me/index.php", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/21lifilm.html?_r=2&ref=nyregionspecial2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin", "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/sundance_film_festival_park_city_utah/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/21lifilm.html?_r=2&ref=nyregionspecial2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/01/quotable-quote.html", "title": "\nQuotable quote\n"},

Each evening, Bud wants to talk through the flow of the days ahead. Though he knows the days of the week, he is less interested in discussing that tomorrow will be Thursday, and then will come Friday, and is much more interested in talking about the  meaning  of each day in his life. He has just recently started identifying which activities at school go with which days of the week: Mondays are gym days; Tuesdays, music; Wednesdays, art; Thursdays, library; Fridays, gym again. Saturdays and Sundays are Mom and Bud Days. Tonight, Bud reminded me that Wednesdays are not just art days; they are also pizza days - the one day each week when Bud buys his lunch at school. Every other day, he brings his lunch from home and just buys milk in the cafeteria. So at dinner this evening, when Bud wanted to talk through the days to come, I had some trouble keeping up. \"Mama, what tomorrow is?\" \"Tomorrow is Thursday.\" \"No, Mama.\" \"Library day?\" \"No. Milk day.\" \"Oh, of course. Milk day.\" \"Then another milk day, then Mom and Bud day, then Mom and Bud day, then milk day, then milk day, then pizza day.\" So, for the record, and for those keeping score at home, that means we have 14 milk days, 3 pizza days, and 8 Mom and Bud days until Christmas.

I'm flattered by the request and happy to oblige. Here it is. First, it's important to recognize the incredible work that Ms. Walker, the classroom teacher, and Mrs. Nee, the classroom paraprofessional, have done this year. As I wrote to Ms. Walker this week, \"Thank you for the credit you are so eager to hand over to me, but REALLY - this is not the result of one hour-long conversation. This is the result of seven months full of planting seeds and seizing teachable moments and providing opportunities and recognizing that teaching for life is more important than teaching to the test.\" They started their work at the very beginning of the school year, celebrating Bud's tenth birthday in  an extraordinary way . Their work continued throughout the year, and they explained their approach to me in a conference last month. At that time, they  asked if I'd be willing to meet with Bud's classmates and gave me a stack of questions that the children had submitted for me . My meeting with the class was so extraordinary that  it was hard to find the words to describe it . So, instead, I decided to recount the experience, one question at a time. Those questions were: What is autism? Why does Bud repeat things from TV? Why does Bud say the same things over and over? Why does Bud run in circles? Why does he need movement breaks? Why do noises bother Bud? Why does Bud miss his mom so much? Why does he get really attached to people and want to be with them all the time? How can I be a better friend to Bud? How can I be a person Bud would like to hang out with? Will Bud always be this way? Does Bud know he's different? How can I help? Later that afternoon, Ms. Walker asked the children to reflect on the conversation.  Their responses were extraordinary . The magic is still unfolding in the classroom, and I imagine there will be further posts in the coming weeks and months. I will add links to them on this page. This link:  http://bit.ly/9FLDc3  will lead people here.

So I was feeling more than a little antipathy as I thought about the one-on-one conferences I'd be having with each of my students in lieu of one of this week's classes. I just finished the last of the student conferences. How were they, you ask? In a word: delightful. We talked. We engaged. We solved problems. We discussed plans. We traded ideas. They were honest. They were humble. They were thoughtful. They were, in other words,  entirely  unlike the swarming mass of discontent that fills my classroom twice each week. Huh. Not only is the whole  more  than the sum of its parts - the whole is a  different entity altogether . There's a completely different ethos at play - a different level of engagement, of relationship, of cooperation. And so it makes me wonder. To what extent is  my  classroom experience this year similar to  Bud's ? He loves the component parts of his school experience. He likes  the children . He likes the reading, the computer, the counting, the music, the art, the gym, the recess, the snack, the writing. He likes  the staff . He loves  his teacher . And yet he's had  a hard week . And each night he's told me \"I'm not going to school tomorrow.\" So I have to ask the question: When all the individual components of Bud's day are layered and compressed and presented together, what are they adding up to for him? And how do we deconstruct them to  rethink their organization ?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismvox.com/more-than-a-behavior-problem/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/11/disdaining-forest-enjoying-trees.html", "title": "\nDisdaining the forest, enjoying the trees\n"},

My husband, my parents, and I spent most of the day calling each other -  how do you think it's going? what have you heard? here is the latest...  We realized this morning that in Bud's almost 7 years he has never once spent six continuous hours away from the four of us. School days were half-days; babysitters were short-term. In his entire life, until today, Mom or Dad or Nana or Papa always appeared before four hours were up. So today was difficult for all of us. My husband and I were at work, watching the clock and counting the seconds. My parents, suddenly under-employed, spent the day bumping into each other as they meandered through a strangely quiet house. And as they began to compare notes, they discovered that they'd each started the day in a similar way - by having a silent conversation with my grandfather, Pa, who died thirty-one years ago today, on my ninth birthday. \"I can't be with him today,\" my father said, \"So I need you to be.\" \"Stay with him,\" my mother said, \"And bring  his siblings  along for moral support.\" It's really no wonder that Bud didn't need  Gramps' hat  on his head for his first day of first grade.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 29, 2006", "body": "\nYou know how you read all the time about the government monitoring the flow of communication in suspected terrorist networks, looking for patterns that might indicate a mounting credible threat? Sometimes parenting in  Autismland  feels a lot like that. You can't pounce on every small suggestion of a thought that seems to be off-kilter. You have to remain vigilant, attuned to the details while staying focused on the bigger picture. What is an isolated incident? What do the patterns suggest? When is the right time to take action? It's imperative in Autismland, as in government, that we neither over-react nor under-react. Over-reacting causes panic and paranoia; under-reacting can have devastating results. I am beginning to recognize a slight pattern of concern in the networks I'm monitoring at Bud's school. Taken in isolation, nothing is a great worry. But it's the  pattern  that I'm watching and that I'm struggling to interpret. The messages have been filtering through slowly and gently. The first, in his IEP meeting in June, went something like this: \"I don't think we should encourage him to take  Gramps' hat  to first grade with him. Other children don't wear hats at school.\" A more recent message came through this way: \"Maybe bringing  his iPod  to school would not be the best idea. He might get too dependent on it. It might be better to find something that other children could use as well.\" Taken alone, neither issue is important enough to make a fuss over. Bud will be fine without Gramps' hat, and he will manage without his iPod. As I explained to his teacher, Bud is incredibly flexible in his rigidity. He will, without question, need something to bring him  local coherence , but he will be creative in determining what that something will be. Before he discovered Gramps' hat in Kindergarten, Bud stuffed his pockets full of plastic fruit every day. In preschool, Bud sat on the \"B\" on the alphabet carpet at circle time and carried around the  \"home\" card  from his visual schedule. Bud will figure out what he needs to get by in first grade; I'm not worried about that. But, just like the government agents who monitor the networks, I feel compelled to listen not just to what is being  said , but also to what is  missing  from the messages - to listen not just to the  words , but also to the  meaning  that underscores them. I need to make sure that if these statements are signs that we are veering off into different philosophical perspectives, I am ready to intervene at the appropriate time to make sure that we don't continue down these divergent paths. I will need to speak up to confirm that  \"encouraging Bud to be (or just act) like every other child\"  has not somehow snuck itself between the lines of his IEP. Bud is not like every other child. Bud is autistic. He will go far, he will do great things, and he will  still be autistic . If Bud had spina bifida, I feel certain that no one would say, \"Other children don't use chairs with wheels. In first grade, we walk.\" If Bud was hearing impaired, I don't think we'd be concerned about the disparity of letting him be the only child in the room who gets to wear the cool accessory on his ears. No one would worry that Bud might get too dependent on the wheelchair or the hearing aid. What makes the  accommodations for autism  any different? Children are smart. There was not a single child in Bud's Kindergarten class who didn't recognize that Bud was different. And I don't think there was a child in the class who would have traded places with him, who would have opted to swap the ability to make friends for the privilege of wearing Gramps' hat. In fact, by allowing Bud to wear Gramps' hat in Kindergarten every day - by letting him literally wear his difference on his head - we gave all of the children in that classroom the opportunity to learn two very important lessons: 1. Different is not \"better than\" or \"worse than\"; different is just different.; and 2. Fairness does not equal sameness. We also allowed Bud to learn a third, and even more valuable, lesson: You are just right,  just as you are . I'm not obsessing over this. I'm thinking about it, certainly, but ultimately I'm keeping it in perspective. Two incidents do not constitute a pattern, especially when considered in the context of a hundred other messages that indicate that the team at school knows, understands, and respects Bud. This is not a credible threat. It's not time to start banning liquids from all international flights. But, all the same, I think we need to stay vigilant at the scanners.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2005/12/185.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/08/yellow-alert.html", "title": "\nYellow alert\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 17, 2006", "body": "\nI made an important realization this week. By a quirk of scheduling I had a day off from work during Bud's regular school week, which gave me six hours all to myself. I'd been looking forward to doing some shopping. Shopping has been a challenge since the onset of Bud's  weather anxiety , because in big \"box stores,\" like Target, the thumps and rattles of workers stocking shelves can sound like  rumbling in the distance , and the rumbles reverberating across the high ceilings can be too disconcerting for Bud to withstand. I'd especially been looking forward to this solo outing because it followed an extraordinarily difficult weekend trip to the grocery store with Bud, which involved a toe-to-toe stand-off in the produce section that ended with me carrying my taller-than-average tantruming seven-year-old sideways across my body through a long and busy parking lot. So when the day came, I dropped Bud at school, drove to the mall, and set about the business of shopping. I wandered, I poked, I browsed, I purchased, and I accomplished more in one hour by myself than I would have in an entire day of shopping with my sidekick. It was a productive and efficient use of time. But it was also static, uninspired, and joyless. Two hours into my six-hours of \"freedom,\" I was ready to be done. In the planning, I'd thought about taking myself out for lunch, since Bud is currently eschewing the dine-in experience, making restaurant visits a rare event. But in the moment, when the time came for lunch, I just went to the drive-through because, I realized, it's not the restaurant  food  I miss now that we don't go out to eat. I miss the giggling over french fries. I miss the coloring on placemats together. And so the restaurant lunch of my fantasy, when played out in reality, would have been entirely unsatisfying. I poked some more. I wandered. I watched the minutes tick along on my wristwatch. And then, with two hours yet to go, I climbed in the car and made the 40 minute trip back to Bud's school. I stopped for coffee, then sat in the parking lot  grading papers  until it was time to pick him up. That's when I made the realization. It was surprising, but I'm grateful to have made it - especially now, in the midst of a time in which Bud and I are facing a lot of tough issues and difficult moments. This is what I realized: A turbulent, challenge-filled day  with  Bud is infinitely better than a placid, uneventful day  without  him. I think those six hours by myself were better for me than I'd ever dreamed they'd be.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/10/realization-and-perspective.html", "title": "\nRealization and perspective\n"},

Tell them to drop these plans. On September 10th and 11th, ABC is planning to air a \"docu-drama\" called \"Path to 9/11,\" which is being billed as \"an objective telling of the events of 9/11.\" In fact, the film was written by an unabashed conservative who twists the facts to blame President Clinton.  And since we wrote you on Wednesday, new details have emerged that show even more distortions and intentional conservative slant to the program.  Tell ABC to cancel this show -- and Scholastic, Inc. not to distribute it in our nation's schools .  Among the latest developments:  Approximately 900 copies went out to conservative bloggers and media personalities such as Rush Limbaugh -- but the producers flat-out refused to send a copy to former President Bill Clinton for review.  The show's producers have reassured conservatives that \"blame on the Clinton team is [still] in the DNA of the project.\"  ABC has teamed up with Scholastic, Inc -- a textbook publisher -- to offer this propaganda with an accompanying \"study guide\" to 100,000 teachers across America.

He often used one of his earliest \"shared phrases\" when we were having a good cuddle. He'd squeeze me tight and press his sweaty little face to mine and in a breathy sigh say,  \"So nice.\"  They were the two sweetest words I'd ever heard. I told Bud about it recently while we were hugging: \"When you were a very little boy and we hugged each other, you used to say,  'so nice.' \" \"So nice,\"  Bud repeated. He burrowed his face into my neck and I melted into the joy of the recreated moment. Tonight at bedtime we were having a cuddle and I asked, \"Do you remember what you used to say to me when you were little?\" He wrapped his arms around me, laid his nose alongside mine and said  \"So nice.\" \"That's right,\" I said.  \"So nice.\"  He let out a loud blast of fake laughter, then we laid there nose-to-nose in the dark, quiet room. Bud finally broke the silence. \"I talked, Mum?\" he asked. \"When I was little? I talked?\" \"You talked,\" I said. \"You were quiet a lot, but you said  'so nice.' \" We said our goodnights then and I left the room, but I haven't stopped thinking about his question. Does he remember not talking? Was he aware of that difference at the time? If he was, how did he feel about it? What does it mean to him now? What does he think about his current speech patterns? Is he aware that they are different from ours? And if so, how does that feel to him? Bud's language is a gift. It's wonderful to hear his voice.

Though I have been a fan of Al Gore since the late 1980's, I have to admit that I was a bit reluctant to use a rare and highly-coveted date night to watch a feature-length film with a gloom and doom messsage about global warming. I'm glad I didn't listen to myself. An Inconvenient Truth  is factual, compelling, startling, and overwhelming; but I didn't find it depressing. That's just not the sort of leader Al Gore is; he doesn't engage in scare tactics and hyperbole, and neither does his film. The overall message in  An Inconvenient Truth  is an optimistic one:  We are on a collision course toward global devastation if we continue our current practices. But we can  change  our current practices and reverse the problem we have created. We  can  do it, we  must  do it, we  will  do it. I feel better informed today than I did yesterday. More than that, I feel more empowered today than I did yesterday. I believe that my personal actions can make a difference. And, after several years of feeling disenfranchised by the political establishment, I am beginning to feel hopeful once again that my political actions and the votes I cast can make a difference as well. I have high hopes for the outcome of the 2006 midterm elections, and I am developing resolve - and, yes, even optimism - for the 2008 Presidential election.

As I watched  An Inconvenient Truth , the thing that was most on my mind was not the polar ice caps, not the warming of the ocean, and not Hurricane Katrina. The thing that was most on my mind was Bud. If I  truly  want Bud to have the best possible future, then I needed to be in that theater, listening to that message, and learning some terribly inconvenient truths. Today I read a  terrific review  by Roger Ebert, who seemed to be affected by the movie in a similar way. He wrote: In 39 years, I have never written these words in a movie review, but here they are: You owe it to yourself to see this film. If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to. Even if you're not typically a fan of Al Gore, even if you disagree with his political leanings, I urge you to watch  An Inconvenient Truth .  Someday our children will thank you.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/", "http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/", "http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/", "http://wampum.wabanaki.net/", "http://draftgore2008.org/", "http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/", "http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060601/REVIEWS/60517002/1001", "http://www.climatecrisis.net/takeaction/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/07/just-warming-up.html", "title": "\nJust warming up\n"},

And he's proud of what he's created. He's told me about it several times, and each time the description has been different. Though he mentions each of the elements - the apple trees, the sky, the grass, the rainbow, the line (because that top red line is  not  part of the rainbow; it is simply a line, no less important to the landscape than any other element) - he talks about them in different orders, with different inflections, using different words.

For Bud, it's the video camera. He loves working the camera, and he loves watching home movies of himself. But there are few things I can think of that are more  dysregulating  for him. When Bud watches movies of himself, two things happen. First, he is reminded of obsessions that have passed, toys that have long been broken that he must have right now, and scripts that were  hard to lose  but are easily found. Second, the movies themselves become sources of echolalic scripts - he begins quoting a younger, less verbal self. So, this weekend when Bud pleaded with me to let him watch home videos, I hesitated. He was persistent, and ultimately my resolve wore down and I compromised. I told him I would get a blank video so that he could make a new movie, then watch it. He was thrilled, and he focused his attention exclusively on the upcoming activity until I was able to get a new video so that he could get to work. It was all downhill from there. In a very short time, Bud became distracted, short-tempered, dissatisfied, and anxious. I've been trying to figure out what happens for Bud when he uses the video camera, and what I've come up with is this: he reacts to the video camera the way an addict reacts to a drug. Initially, it's just about having a good time. So he uses, and it feels good. Then it doesn't feel right. It feels bad. It feels  really  bad. And he wants to feel good again. So he uses. And he feels better, but not good. He wants to feel good. So he uses more. Or he uses differently. And he feels good. Then he feels bad. Then he feels worse. And so he uses. By the end of the day, Bud seemed strung out. He seemed miserable. He wanted more, different, again, back, other, bigger, slower, faster, closer, away, near, stop, go, moviemoviemovie. I cut him off cold turkey, and he actually seemed relieved. He hasn't asked for it since. I need to continue to keep the video camera out of sight. Unfortunately, this means that I have very little footage of my adorable, talented boy. It's okay, though; I still have a front-row seat to a terrific live performance.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/05/just_like_the_j.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/05/lights-camera-distraction.html", "title": "\nLights, camera, distraction\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, November 27, 2005", "body": "\nYet more insight gleaned from the  SCERTS  seminar. During his presentation, Barry Prizant made frequent references to Ros Blackburn, a woman from England who has autism and often gives presentations at autism conferences. Like Temple Grandin, Blackburn is able to talk about autism in a way that gives neurotypicals real insight into life on the spectrum. One particular reference stood out for me. Prizant said that he once asked Blackburn to name the thing that other people did that was most frustrating to her. She answered that other people don't allow enough time for people with autism to answer questions. Typically, she said, just as she is forming the answer the other person starts talking again. And not only that - they're not just repeating themselves,  they are saying things differently. It struck an instant chord. I do it all the time. I hear other people do it all the time as well. We honestly think we're being helpful. We ask, \"Bud, what did you do in school today?\" Pause. We think,  is he listening? We say, \"Bud, look at me. Was school fun today?\" \"Yeah.\" We think,  good, he's listening.  We repeat, \"What did you do?\" Pause. We think,  maybe he doesn't understand what I'm looking for. We ask, \"What was your favorite part of school today?\" Pause. We think,  he still doesn't get it; I'll be more clear. We say, \"Did you play with toys at school?\" \"Yeah.\" We think,  here we go!  We say, \"What did you play with?\" Pause. And on and on it goes until we give up or have gotten enough yes/no responses to satisfy our need for the pretense of conversation. According to Prizant, Ros Blackburn compares her experience of this sort of \"conversation\" to assembling a jigsaw puzzle. Someone asks a question, and she begins to piece it together -  what are they asking? what is the expected response? what do I think about this? how do I put that into words?  The piecing takes her full concentration, so she is silent while she thinks. She is silent, in fact, for a long time; long enough that the other person decides s/he needs to be \"helpful\". Unfortunately, by rephrasing the question, it feels to Blackburn as if the person steps in, grabs the puzzle she has almost completed, and hurls the pieces into the air. Now she has to start over, this time trying to assemble the puzzle with a heightened level of frustration. (And we wonder why people with autism get  dysregulated ?) So I've been trying since the seminar to slow down my conversations with Bud and to stop \"prompting\" his answers. The conversations go something like this: \"Bud, what was your favorite thing in school today?\" Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause. \"I play Magic Letter Factory on the computer.\" \"Oh, that sounds fun. Did any other kids play with you?\" Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause. \"Sadie play me.\" Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause. Pause. \"And Margo, too.\" As the Dalai Lama says, \"Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer. \"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/silence-is-golden.html", "title": "\nSilence is golden\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2005", "body": "\nIn a  recent post , I discussed my (thankfully short-lived) concern that Bud's classroom was adopting a square peg/round hole, just do your best to \"pass,\" one-size-fits-all sort of philosophy. I based this supposition on a single element: a piece of representational artwork that Bud brought home and that I knew could not possibly be his because Bud does not  do  representational art. Since the moment I clicked on the \"publish post\" button, Bud has produced nothing but... you guessed it, representational art. And he's not just producing it; he has developed a passion for it. On a nightly basis, he pulls out his markers and a stack of paper and gets working. But I'm noticing an interesting phenomenon. Though he's producing representational art, he is not creating it from his imagination. So far, his artwork has been limited to what he has seen in videos: he draws the clues he's seen Joe and Steve draw on Blues Clues; he draws the scenes he's seen Oobi draw on Noggin. In the same way that so much of  his speech  is derived from videos, he is  scripting  his drawings. I've begun thinking of it as visual echolalia. Framing Bud's drawing as echolalia also made me look at another phenomenon in a different way. In his blog,  Patrick Fitzgerald  searches for an explanation for his son Dan's recent habit of opening books in synchrony with the opening of the book at the start of his Disney movies. Patrick describes Dan's behavior this way: \"He has gone around the house, gathering all the large books he can find. He then lays them out carefully around the room. As the movie starts and the on-screen book opens, he goes along his line of real books, opening them. At the end of the movie, as the on-screen book closes, he reverses the process.\" I recognized the behavior immediately, because it's similar to what Bud does. He doesn't watch Disney movies, but he does watch Clifford the Big Red Dog, and every episode has a \"Speckle story\" that Emily Elizabeth reads to Clifford. At the end of the Speckle story, the pages flutter and the book closes. Bud delights in recreating this grand finale - again and again and again. It seems to be some sort of behavioral echolalia. At the  SCERTS  seminar I attended, Barry Prizant discussed the phenomenon of echolalia. Too often, he said, people view echolalia as a problem because it is such unconventional speech and, as a result, they respond to it with statements like \"Now stop all that silly talk.\" Instead, we should look beyond the behavior itself and try to identify the  function  that the echolalia is playing for the child. The most important question when dealing with echolalia or most other \"autistic\" behaviors - the question that will help us remediate the problem instead of address the symptom - is \"why?\". When I look at the evolution of Bud's echolalic speech, I see phenomenal developmental progress. Bud's echolalia seemed to start as strings of words that didn't have any particular meaning to him, but that he used as a means of self-regulation. As Bud developed, his echolalia became more complex and he began to use it in meaningful ways. If we were playing ball, Bud would pull out a line from a script that had something to do with playing ball and seemed somewhat relevant to the context. Later, he advanced to the point where he could use mitigated echolalia, substituting specific references from the script with salient details from the real-life situations to approximate conversational meaning. (He still does this masterfully.) Only then was he able to step out and take risks with creative language. Prizant frames this pattern of development,which is typical of many children with ASD, as movement from a gestalt mode of language acquisition (in which phrases and multiword utterances are the basic units of language) to an analytic mode (in which single words are the basic units of language). This sort of development, says Prizant, is a very positive prognostic indicator for the child's continued language development. So what role is Bud's echolalic language playing now? I believe that Bud has used echolalia to create opportunities for what RDI's Steve Gutstein calls \" productive uncertainty ,\" and what I've called  chaos and creation , to test the waters of communication to see if he's able to swim. He started using scripts because that was the form of language in which he had the most confidence. Bolstered by his success, he was able to take a bigger risk and start substituting words. That risk had a huge pay-off and allowed him to have real back-and-forth communication for the first time. Once he became comfortable and \"safe\" with that level of communication, he was finally ready to swim without his floaties and start to construct his own creative language. Similarly, when I look at most of Bud's \"echolalic\" behavior - recreating scenes from favorite videos - I see that it has been an important step in the development of his capacity for pretend play. I think that in many ways it started as a way to connect. Because his real-life peers are unpredictable, socializing with them has been a struggle for Bud. But the characters in his movies? They are his perfect playmates - predictable, consistent, and always at the ready. Recreating scenes from their lives gives Bud an opportunity to  be  a part of their lives. And, as with his language development, it has given Bud the chance to take the risks and achieve the success that makes the  idea  of risk less scary and more appealing. My hunch is that, bolstered by his achievement in language and play, Bud is using a similar process with his artwork. Early on, Bud was loathe to pick up a crayon, marker, or paintbrush. When his first tentative stray marks of paper earned praise, he got bolder and more intentional with his strokes and blobs. When those creations met with rave reviews he took the risk toward representational art, but is starting with pictures that he knows have a \"right answer.\" My hope, and my hunch, is that before long he will move into creating pictures from his mind. As Barry Prizant said, our attribution of a behavior - our perspective on the \"why?\" - frames our response to it. It's fascinating that when considered from a different angle, echolalia transforms itself from an annoying, frustrating example of disability, into a valuable developmental process. Prizant uses a quote from Wayne Dyer that I think sums it up nicely: \"When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.\" And change and change and change.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://homepage.mac.com/pdxpatfitz/iblog/C1588891139/index.html", "http://www.rdiconnect.com/archive/newsletters/04232004/default.htm"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/resounding-echoes.html", "title": "\nResounding echoes\n"},

It's been a trying day. Aside from having no voice, I started the day feeling pretty healthy so I tried to do all of the things I normally do. By 2:00 I was so exhausted I was almost bleary-eyed. I happened to be reading an article about echolalia at the time and was really able to relate it to Bud's language development when it hit me: I've been struggling to talk for one day - really, for only 8 hours - and I am completely tapped out. Bud struggles to talk  every single day of his life . That's when I started to see the parallels. Obviously, speech is not a  physical  challenge for Bud, but the mental energy he needs to spend to try to string words together to make people understand him is at least as taxing for him as my laryngitis was for me. And it manifests in so many of the same ways. Throughout the day, though I knew what I wanted to say to people I was continuously weighing the pros and cons of making the effort.  Is what I have to say  really  that important? What if they can't hear me? It's easier to just say nothing.   If I don't look at anyone, maybe no one will start talking to me and then I won't have to say anything. Every time the phone rang, my anxiety escalated.  Telephone  communication is completely speech-based; I did not believe I could meet the challenge. Often, when I did speak, people misunderstood what I was trying to say. It was frustrating. If I could have just carried around a tape recorder with  a few choice phrases  that I could play to people to approximate what I was trying to say, I would have. As the day wore on, the effort began to take it's toll. I was emotionally spent and physically exhausted. When I came home and tried to tell my husband about my day, straining with the effort of slowly getting each word out until I had finally whispered the whole sentence, and his response was \"What?\" I wanted to  scream and bop him on the nose . I didn't want to talk to anyone. I wanted to be alone with my books, and my computer, and the things that bring me comfort. Huh. Whaddaya know.

There were two women there with their kids - a boy about Bud's age, and two toddlers. From past experience, we would predict that one of several things would happen: a) Bud would ignore these children entirely; b) Bud would show distress anytime one of the children came anywhere near him (\"Oh! He's taking my water!\"); or c) Bud would approach the children indirectly, and make echolalic pronouncements like \"Tinky Winky jump for fun!\" and play  near  the children, but not  with  them. Nana found out quickly that the little boy's name was Brian, and that he was very, very verbal. Brian knew how to swim, face down in the water and with great aplomb. Bud watched him with fascination, then approached him directly and said \"I want to do that.\" And so the friendship began. Brian showed Bud how to blow bubbles and they delighted in sticking their heads all the way under the water. Then Brian wanted to play sharks, and Bud joined in (though he took the time out to run over to Nana to say \"It's imagination\") before returning to the game. At one point, Brian-the-swimming-shark was chasing Bud-the-running-boy and Bud looked over his shoulder with more than a little wariness. Brian stopped and said \"I know! Let's play Follow Your Friend, But Don't Bump Him.\" Bud thought that was a great idea, and the game continued. Nana says she sat at the water's edge, entranced and with an enormous smile on her face for the full hour and a half that the boys played together. She said \"I've never seen him look into another child's eyes and laugh -  but he was doing it! \" By the time they parted, Brian announced \"He's my best friend!\" The bad news is that Brian is not from around here - not even from the same state (though Nana told his mom that if she moved here, we'd provide free child care.) But the good news is, success breeds success. My hunch is that this experience has boosted Bud's confidence and has given him a taste of how fun it can be to play with another child.

We nod to our neighbors as they drive by, but we don't really know them. Most people in our neighborhood have dogs, and though there is technically a leash law I'm not sure that any of them own leashes.

{"date": "Saturday, March 26, 2005", "body": "\nFor weeks, the top news story has been the Terri Schiavo case and Op-Ed columnists have weighed in heavily with their thoughts on the matter. No other column has struck me as much as  Brian McGrory's  in yesterday's Boston Globe. Poor judgment By Brian McGrory March 25, 2005 Wouldn't it be something if George W. Bush raced back to the White House from his Texas ranch for something with a little broader consequence than the feeding tube of one woman in a vegetative state whose husband says she would choose to die? Wouldn't it be something if he saw that much urgency in the lives lost in the nation's ghettos every day? Wouldn't it be great if he announced that people are dying every minute the government fails to improve housing for the poor, safety in the streets, education in the urban centers, and job prospects for those who are out of work, and that those deaths aren't acceptable anymore? Wouldn't it be great if he picked out just one person, one otherwise anonymous boy who represents thousands. He could announce that the boy didn't ask to be born into poverty to a single mother and a violent father who has been sentenced to prison. He could say that the boy shouldn't have to live in a public-housing project where cockroaches race up the bedroom walls at night, where drug dealers have taken over the urine-stained stairwells, where gunshots can be heard in the near distance like fireworks in the suburbs on the Fourth of July. The president might add that this boy shouldn't have to go to a school where teachers have to reach into their own pockets to buy supplies, where textbooks are older than the students, where learning is an afterthought on the fortunate days when adults are able to achieve some small semblance of calm. And the president could say that if the government waits just one more hour to act, we're going to lose this child. He might be caught in the crossfire of two rival gangs, dead long before his time. He might join a gang himself, get a gun, turn to drugs, and kill someone else. Hours matter, the president might announce -- minutes even. The nation has to act, for this boy's sake, for the hundreds of thousands of youths just like him, for the millions who are affected by their actions. Society, he might add, cannot afford to do nothing. Wouldn't it be great if House majority leader Tom DeLay proclaimed, as he did for Terri Schiavo, that, ''Every hour is incredibly important for this boy.\" Wouldn't it also be great if Senate majority leader Bill Frist explained, as he did after the unusual Schiavo vote last weekend, ''These are extraordinary circumstances that center on the most fundamental of human values and virtues: the sanctity of human life.\" But they don't, and it's grossly na\u00efve of me to think they ever would. The problems of urban America are not easily addressed in an up-or-down vote. And there's no powerful political constituency praying and lobbying for the desperately poor the way the religious fundamentalists are pushing for Terri Schiavo's feeding tube to be reinserted. Four people were slain in Boston last weekend while Congress worked on trying to keep one Florida woman alive in a vegetative state that her doctors said she will never overcome. The victims were good people -- and maybe some not-so-good people -- shot and stabbed, in a bar, in cars, and even in stark daylight on a city bus. There were no officials in Washington talking about that. It's an hourly event in this and every other city: Potentially good children slip into drug-addled lives of violent crime because they've never been shown another way. They go on to become miserable, predatory adults. Girls become pregnant, furthering the cycle of poverty. Law-abiding neighbors, also known as the working poor, barricade themselves in their houses and apartments out of fear of what's happening outside. Neither the president nor the Congress ever rushes back to Washington in the middle of Easter break on behalf of these people, and I suspect they never will. The reason is simple: The sanctity of some lives isn't held in the same high regard by our sanctimonious and simplistic leaders. Brian McGrory is a Globe columnist.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 01, 2006", "body": "\nWhen I arrived to pick up Bud from school yesterday, his eyes were a bit red and puffy.  Mrs. H  explained that he'd been crying and that the dysregulation seemed to spiral up out of nowhere. He'd been perseverating on one of the cards from his visual schedule, insisting on carrying it around with him. Since his visual schedule is such a critical tool for keeping his day structured (and, therefore, for keeping him regulated) it's important that Mrs. H maintain control of the cards and the board. So, she asked Bud to put the card back... and he lost it: \"No, Mrs. H. That's MINE! Give it BACK!\", tears, and full-body hurling that resulted in a bumped head and more wailing sobs. In my experience, when Bud has extreme reactions like this, there is a reason. They don't typically come out of the blue. \"Which card was it?\" I asked. \"It was the HOME card.\" A-ha. Now we were getting somewhere. When Bud was in preschool, he used the HOME card as a regulating tool. He carried it around in his hand the way other children carry blankies. It was his own little reminder that \"home\" was coming - a well-earned pay-off at the end of the school day. I explained the preschool context to Mrs. H and asked if he'd been feeling homesick or acting out of sorts. \"Not until I tried to take the card away,\" she said. I could tell we were getting closer to solving the mystery, but I just couldn't see it yet. I looked at his schedule board, and the little two-inch-square pictures velcroed in a line. \"Is this a new picture or anything?\" I asked, looking at the HOME card. \"Well, that wasn't the actual card he was carrying. He found a spare one on the shelf.\" She walked to the other side of the room and took it down to show me. Mystery solved. Same HOME picture. On a THREE-inch, not two-inch square card. Just like in preschool. Like many people on the spectrum, Bud has a hard time generalizing from the specific. Two-inch cards belong in Kindergarten. Three-inch cards belong in preschool. He is the only person from preschool who is in Kindergarten. If a three-inch card has appeared at Kindergarten, it must be his.  Not even wrong . My hunch is that Bud recognized the HOME card as a  touchstone  - a regulator, a comfort-giver. We all have them. We bring our favorite music in the car when we know it's going to be a stressful day, we wear crosses or Stars of David or flaming chalices on chains around our necks, we carry pictures in our wallets of the people we hold most dear; they are the small reminders that we take with us when we leave the security of our homes. We cling to them tightly, so that whenever we need to we can remind ourselves that this moment, this place, this circumstance is not all there is. So it's not so hard to put myself in Bud's shoes. Let's say I have a favorite picture of my family that I carry with me every day and that brings me great joy and comfort during difficult times. Then let's say that I go through a long stretch of good, untroubled times and I don't take the photo out much to look at it, and without even realizing it I lose it. Then ten months pass, and I find the photograph tucked in a dark crevice where I never expected to see it. I realize that I had forgotten all about the picture, but I experience a flood of warmth and comfort when I look at it, and I'm delighted to find it again. Just then, someone scoops it up with a stack of papers and heads for the shredder. I have a hunch that Bud experienced that sort of panicked feeling when Mrs. H took the HOME card away. As soon as I gave her the context, she brought the card over to Bud and suggested that he take it with him. She told him he could keep it and he didn't have to bring it back to school. He could not have been more delighted. He carried the card with him all evening, then fell asleep with HOME curled up in his fist. And, it's no surprise: in the morning, he very happily let go of his touchstone and left HOME and home to head off for another great day at school.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/02/carrying-home.html", "title": "\nCarrying home\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 28, 2006", "body": "\nI read Kamran Nazeer's book  Send in the Idiots: Stories from the Other Side of Autism  shortly after it was released, mostly because it was  highly recommended  by  Paul Collins . I liked the book very much, but decided not to blog about it right away. The truth is, I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to  say  about it. I thought I'd let some time pass and see which elements of the book stayed with me. I'm ready now. The premise of  Send in the Idiots  is intriguing: as a small child, Nazeer attended a school for autistic children in New York City; now, as an autistic adult (and PhD policy adviser), Nazeer has tried to reconnect with some of his former classmates to find out how and what they are doing today, and what life with autism has meant for each of them. Through Nazeer we get a glimpse not only into  their  lives as autistic adults, but also into his own. It is a fascinating view. There are two concepts upon which I've found myself reflecting in the months since I read the book. The first is the idea of \"local coherence,\" which is a theme that runs throughout the narrative. Nazeer describes local coherence as the preference that autistic people frequently demonstrate for a limited, though immediate, form of order as protection against complexity or confusion and quirks...small, obsessive behaviors that provide some sort of encolsure from the world. He provides many \"typically autistic\" examples of local coherence: echolalia, perseverative language and behavior, strict adherence to routine and order. He also provides examples of more subtle examples: spinning ice cubes in a glass while at a party, playing with a cell phone while trying to make conversation, brushing imaginary things off one's shoulder. Nazeer likens the need for local coherence in an individual to the need for rules and order in a society. He writes, One of the bars we went to had a sign that read \"No Dogs Allowed.\" This was a statement of a rule. The strategies that autistic individuals use to negotiate the world of others...are also like rules. Like all rules, the barkeeper's rule had some problems... It was overinclusive... Not all dogs are a nuisance, and so the rule covered animals it didn't need to cover in order to achieve its purpose. The rule was also underinclusive... Clearly, there were other animals that might be a nuisance. Despite these problems of form, though, the rule probably tended to work. It achieved local coherence. We could make sense of it.  The strategies that autistic people use to achieve local coherence, Nazeer says, provide a similarly imperfect means of control, sense-making, and distillation of chaos. By responding to a potentially overwhelming situation by focusing on a smaller task, behavior, or item, they are able to reduce the overwhelming situation to one that's more manageable. It's not a flawless plan, of course: spinning ice cubes may reduce your anxiety at a cocktail party, but it will not necessarily make you a sparkling conversationalist. He writes, of one former classmate, He can't pull the entire...experience into a coherent ball of dough, but he can do these other, much less ambitious things, and when he does them everything else becomes background...This is called local coherence.  I certainly recognize this coping mechanism in Bud. The  Teletubbies  provide local coherence for Bud in stressful situations - as do his  scripts , his  iPod , his  pacing , his  3D works of art . I also recognize this tendency in myself. I can think of times in my life when I've been consciously aware of my need to create local coherence: driving to a job interview, feeling the stress mounting, and playing a Paul McCartney CD as I thought to myself, \"No matter what happens during this interview day, when I get back in the car this music will be same;\" working through the depths of  grieving  by breaking my days into 15 minute units -  How can I get through the next 15 minutes? I can water the plants.  - not allowing myself to consider the next 15 minutes until I'd made it through the first; marking the greater passage of time during that same period by religiously eating the same breakfast - a buttered English muffin and a glass of cranapple juice - every morning. These things, too, provided local coherence. What strikes me, of course, is that though Bud and I both have a similar response in the face of something that is overwhelming and frightening, the circumstances that prompt our needs for local coherence differ dramatically in scale: for me, the loss of a child or a high-stakes interview; for him, a visit from his cousins or the barking of a neighbor's dog. Despite that, recognizing our shared need for local coherence helps me to have empathy for what Bud is feeling when he \"retreats\" to his comfort zones and, as a result, to be a little more patient with him when it happens. The second thing from  Send in the Idiots  that has stayed with me - that, in fact, I have thought about often since I finished the book - is a vignette toward the end in which Nazeer meets with his former teacher from the autism program. He is nervous about the meeting; he wonders what she expects him to be like and how he will compare to her expectations. He writes, I was afraid I might not have come far enough. Had I beaten the curve identified by the studies? Might she have expected me to do better than I had? It was also becoming obvious to me that (she) had no intention of easing my discomfort. She had spotted it, for sure; perhaps she thought that I was grown up enough to manage, that she was allowed to toy with me. I grinned as I realized that this might be the explanation. \"You're a mean person,\" I said. \"You're not autistic,\" she replied . She and another former teacher make similar comments twice more. I waited anxiously to get Nazeer's take on the comments: What did \"you're not autistic\" mean to him? What did he think it meant to her? Was she paying him a compliment? Did he take it as a compliment? Did he agree with her assessment that he was no longer autistic? Had this been his goal? And though Nazeer addresses these questions to an extent, he never builds up to the final denouement I expected, in which he addresses these issues directly and reveals his own conclusions about what it  means  to be autistic. Instead, in the final chapter of the the book, Nazeer discusses many of the current philosophies and perspectives about autism. He presents few absolutes and talks in vague terms about several schools of thought. Though he refers to neither by name, he appears to reject the  biomedical  perspective, citing studies of the genetic roots of autism, as well as the  neurodiversity  perspective. He writes, of a former classmate, The premise was that you could be extraordinary and distinctive purely on account of being autistic, that this was a creative and valuable way of being... Craig didn't accept that. He felt that it was exactly the same as believing that all autistic individuals were retarded or that all autistic children were savants... I agreed with Craig.  The conclusion Nazeer draws, it seems, is that while there are some advantages to the way that his autistic mind works, he is able to be successful because he has remediated the more problematic aspects of his autism: perhaps most significantly, he has found socially acceptable ways of achieving local coherence. He writes, What I found myself arguing...was that it was arrogant to believe that I was better because I was autistic; perhaps it did equip me well for certain things, perhaps some of these were not trivial, perhaps, for example, something of my intelligence was related to being autistic; however, I had only reached the threshold beyond which I could even have this discussion with them Thanks, surely to professional help... and a lot of consideration, and work, and care.  In sharing his own journey, and those of his former classmates, Nazeer appears to be making a case for the  remediation of autism . He does not claim to have \"recovered\" from autism; instead, he seems to show by example the ways he has enhanced and preserved the aspects of his autism that have moved him forward, and minimized and overcome those that have held him back. He writes, (My former teachers) were teasing me when they told me that I wasn't autistic anymore. But there was more to it: they also meant that I didn't display as many symptoms as when they last knew me... and that I no longer had all the same limitations. I got better, to say it that way. And so did all of my former classmates... We became this way through exposure to the world that lay beyond the horizon of our own selves... Our autism eased, in each case, because of other people, our parents, friends, and our teachers, of course. This realization sometimes expands inside me until I feel as if my organs are going to bruise one another.  I think I understand this feeling of organ expansion; Nazeer's assertion almost leaves me breathless. It makes me think of Bud and me, of course, but it also makes me think of so many other neurotypical parents I know who are blogging about their fears, hopes, and questions about the  ends  as much as about the  means  as they raise their autistic children by trying to  connect ,  connect ,  connect ,  connect ,  connect ,  connect . And though Nazeer can't speak for others on the spectrum, his is one voice that tells us we are on the right path. And sometimes, for me at least, one clear voice is all it really takes to gain a little local coherence.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582346194/103-3334217-5347027?redirect=true&v=glance&n=283155", "http://weekendstubble.blogspot.com/2006/03/send-in-idiots.html", "http://injectingsense.blogspot.com/2006/06/rolling-snowballs-with-friends.html", "http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/2006/02/deconstructing-view-continued-autism.html", "http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2006/02/blah_the_discus.html", "http://kangasintuition.blogspot.com/2006/07/who-needs-it-more.html", "http://lisa-jedi.blogspot.com/2006/07/busy-week.html", "http://autismsedges.blogspot.com/2006/05/field-day.html", "http://www.kristinachew.com/autism/2006/07/letting_go_397.html", "http://gretsblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/perspective.html", "http://eterniti1.blogspot.com/2006/07/hellooo-mr-potty-andgoodbye.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/07/send-in-idiots.html", "title": "\nSend in the Idiots\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, May 31, 2006", "body": "\nBud's iPod is not just a device for entertainment, nor is it simply a trendy fashion accessory. It actually helps him hear better. In recent months, as the weather got warmer and people in the neighborhood began letting their dogs stay outside for longer periods of time, Bud started to have extreme reactions to the sound of  dogs barking . He'd be fully engaged in playing with his toys, then suddenly leap to his feet and bellow like a war protester: \"STOP THE BARKING! STOP THE BARKING!\" I'd listen and would hear faintly, through the closed windows of our house, the sound of a dog barking a block away. Bud would run to the window and pull the shade, then cover his ears with his hands. At first, I thought he was overreacting and being overly sensitive, and I would try reasoning with him: \"The doggie is in his yard. He can't come in here. You're okay. The doggie is just saying hello.\" Then I read  this post  from Ballastexistenz and I began to understand the situation differently. Bud was not overreacting. The barking sound, though faint and distant to me, was drowning out everything else for Bud. It wasn't  volume  of the barking that was difficult for Bud; it was the  effect  that the barking had on him: shifting his attention, compelling him to focus fully on the barking, making it impossible for him to shift his attention back to any other more pleasant sound. Now that Bud has  adopted my iPod , he suddenly has a valuable new tool to use against  dysregulating  noises. He doesn't listen to it very loudly; it doesn't hinder his ability to converse with me. But it helps him regulate his focus and shift his attention away from noises that trouble him and toward ones that make him feel secure and balanced (currently  Paul McCartney's  live cd  Back in the U.S. ). He has gotten adept at knowing when to bring it with him on outings, and at differentiating between the situations in which he need only keep it handy vs. those which require him to venture forth with headset in place. Bud and I haven't discussed this phenomenon, but I know he's been thinking about it too. Yesterday as I was getting ready for work I heard barking, probably from our neighbor's dog Jenna, through our open windows. I braced myself for the battle cry, but instead I heard Bud talking softly to himself as he walked past me. \"Jenna, you stop barking me. Where is my iPod?\"\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=110"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/05/hearing-aid.html", "title": "\nHearing aid\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 03, 2006", "body": "\nBud and I were running late for  gymnastics  class today, so by the time we arrived the others were already busy bouncing, swinging and tumbling. The class has grown a little and we've missed two weeks because of illness, so I didn't recognize the two moms who were sitting in the middle of the room engaged in an intense and animated conversation. Bud and I scurried past them and got engrossed in the balance beam and bounce house, and I forgot all about them. A little while later, one of the moms approached me. She lives in a town near me and her son (18 months younger than Bud) will be starting Kindergarten at his school in the fall. She told me that she is staring to look into which Kindergarten teacher is \"best\" so that she will be able to get her son into that class, and that she was going to \"push for full-day\" Kindergarten (our district has half-day sessions.) She asked me if Bud was in for the full day and I told her that he isn't and that, in fact, I don't think he could handle full days of school right now. Sometimes three hours is overwhelming for him. \"My son needs full days,\" she said definitively. \"But I probably won't get it. I never get anything that I ask for.\" She pointed to the mom she had been talking to earlier. \"She's an advocate. I'm going to get her card. She lives in ThisTown - that's in the best school district in the state. Our district is terrible.\" \"Really?\" I asked. \"Oh, yeah,\" she said. \"Her son gets xyz hours of This Specific Intervention every week. It works great for him. It would work for my son, too. I know it would. Does your son get that?\" \"No, he doesn't, \" I said. \"I haven't asked for it. I -\" \"Well I have,\" she said, \"and they told me he doesn't need it.\" \"Well, I think that This Specific Intervention is not right for all kids on the -\" \"Have you ever tried it?\" \"No, I -\" \"Yeah, our district is terrible,\" she said, and walked away. I got the sense that I was being dismissed as an uninformed-and-gullible-parent-being-played-by-the-system as I saw her make her way back to the advocate mom to get her contact information. I thought about the interaction all the way home.  Our district is terrible? Can that be? Am I naive and gullible? Am I nonassertive? How is it that this mom who has been dealing with \"the system\" for 18 fewer months is so much more certain of what her son needs, what the district will fight her on, and how she is going to make her case? Do I have low expectations? Should I be putting up a fight about... something? Because here's the thing: an hour before we left for gymnastics, I was in a team meeting with all of the people who work with Bud at school - his teacher, the classroom aide, the inclusion coordinator, the OT, the SLP, the learning specialist. They meet every week to discuss his progress, compare notes, test hypotheses, and develop strategies. They invited me to join them - this week, and any other week - and they involved me in the discussion and listened to what I had to say. And I left feeling great. But as I drove home from gymnastics, I replayed the team meeting and all of the other meetings and conversations I've had with these folks and I wondered,  have I done what I'm supposed to do as a parent? I've never brought in a list of specific requests that I want them to meet. Have my expectations been high enough? The more I thought about it, the clearer it became. No, I've never suggested to the team that Bud needs blahdy-blah intervention for zippidy-do hours each week. But I've communicated my expectations clearly and consistently: I expect you to know my son. I expect you to learn to recognize the nuances in his behavior and to take advantage of the teachable moments that the nuances provide. I expect you to expect him to change, to grow, to learn, to become. I expect you to delight in his humor. I expect you to make him feel safe - safe to be himself, safe to take risks, safe to make mistakes. I expect you to be insightful, thoughtful, and creative. I expect you to structure his school experience in a way that builds his sense of competence and confidence. I expect you to be flexible, to try new things, to tweak what sort-of works, to set aside what doesn't work, and to go-go-go with what works while it works but not when it stops working. I expect you to know your stuff, to keep current, and to share what you know. I expect you to have high expectations of Bud, and expect that you'll provide high levels of support to help him meet those expectations. I expect you to be vigilant about not letting him manipulate you... but I expect you to be delighted inside that he has tried to. I expect you to see his strengths and his gifts, to encourage and feed them, to help him show them to others, and to help him develop a sense of pride. I expect you to see  Bud  when you look at Bud, and expect you to know that autism is just one part of who he is. I expect you to love him, love him, love him. The team that works with Bud meets my expectations consistently. They don't have all the answers. They don't even have all the questions. But they collaborate, and they try, and they really, really care. So, perhaps I'm naive, perhaps I'm gullible, and perhaps our district really is terrible; all I know is that I am terribly, terribly pleased.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/02/great-expectations.html", "title": "\nGreat expectations\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, April 22, 2006", "body": "\nYesterday I spent my day meeting with high school seniors who will be starting college in fall, helping them choose the courses they'll take in their first semester. I love this day - the energy, the excitement, the enthusiasm - and I love the variety of students who choose to come to our small college. My last appointment was with Rob, a bright, engaging young man who came with his dad. He's starting college without a major, but has a lot of interests he'd like to pursue - psychology, maybe; or sports management; perhaps business. He's good at math, though this year's grades wouldn't necessarily reflect that; he attributes that more to Senioritis than ability. I looked down at the registration form he'd come in with. A note from the Registrar instructed us to schedule four classes for Rob's first semester, instead of the traditional five. I launched into a lengthy monologue about the college's liberal education requirements and the options he had. Rob listened politely, but when I stopped speaking and turned the conversation over to him I was met with silence - not awkward silence; just the sort of silence that indicated that Rob had nothing to say. Ah. I started over, with just the first chunk of information. And then I started to pick up on cues that made Rob more and more familiar to me. There was something about the way he looked at me as he spoke - or, more accurately, about the way he  didn't  look at me. Something about the cadence of his speech. Something in the subtle flick of his hand. Something that made me want to say, \"Hey, Rob, I think I  know  you.\" We tackled our task systematically, one step at a time. While Rob took some time to look over course options on his own, I chatted with his Dad. \"I wonder if you can tell me about the learning services you have here,\" his dad said. \"Rob has ADD and -  halting   pause  - another learning disability.\" I filled in the blank on my own. We talked about the services at the academic development center, and about the college's commitment to working with students as individuals, making the accommodations that will help them to be successful. Rob finished looking at his choices and we went back to a very successful  concrete sequential  scheduling session. As I worked with Rob and his dad, I found myself wanting to ask the same question I always want to ask the students I know who are (or who appear to be) on the spectrum:  \"Can you tell me what you were like when you were six years old?\" But, as always, I kept my question to myself. Yesterday was Rob's day to look forward, not back. But I couldn't help looking forward myself.  What will Bud be like at eighteen? I imagine that Rob has faced a lot of obstacles as he has made his way to this place, where he is a high school senior full of promise, ready to take on college life. I hope he doesn't spend too much of his energy dwelling on his struggle and is instead able to focus on his success. I hope he knows that yesterday he made someone think,  \"I hope my son grows up to be just like you.\"  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/04/glimpses.html", "title": "\nGlimpses\n"},

{"date": "Monday, September 11, 2006", "body": "\nI was dancing with Bud when the first plane hit. Of course we didn't know it was happening at the time. We were wrapping up a Kindermusik class in a lovely multipurpose room in a quiet church in the woods, physically and psychologically far from the madness unfolding in Manhattan. Bud was not yet two and not yet diagnosed, but already very much himself. We tapped sticks together and danced among our classmates. The others danced in unison, in rhythm with the bouncy melody coming from the CD player. Bud danced on the periphery, in rhythm to a music all his own. I danced between them, to a mash-up of the two, and tried to bridge the distance. We all had a wonderful time. I had planned the morning carefully. When the class ended, my husband would be waiting in the parking lot and we would bundle Bud into his car so that I could head to the college, to work. It promised to be a busy day. It was the first day of classes, and I was scheduled to start the morning with a rare staff meeting with the college President. I'd have just enough time to get to my office, change from my Kindermusik jeans to my meeting-with-the-President skirt, grab my folders, and head to the conference room. The plan started off without a hitch. My husband was waiting, and Bud joined him happily. I drove straight to the college and found a parking spot in the first lot I checked. As I walked toward my office I spotted a friend and colleague hurrying across the quad. \"At this rate, I think we better just go directly from Convocation to Commencement and start again next year,\" she said, rolling her eyes. She looked at my puzzled expression, and explained, \"Oh, you haven't heard? It's crazy. A plane flew into the World Trade Center.\" She said she was headed to the campus center to check out the tv coverage. I pictured a disoriented pilot in a single-engine Cessna, and wondered how he could have made such a horrible miscalculation. We walked together across campus and as we approached the campus center another colleague came out and said, \"There were two planes. Two planes hit the twin towers.\" My God , I thought.  Something is wrong. There must be a problem with the airspace radar system. And then,  But why would they both hit the same building? At that moment, a third colleague rushed out of the building and said, \"They got the Pentagon.\" My mind went blank. I hurried to my office, my stomach churning and my head spinning. I pulled up Yahoo and read the headline, but the story wouldn't load. I heard my colleagues in the hallway through the pounding in my head, \"Def Con 3\"... \"Pennsylvania\"... \"other planes\"... \"terrorism.\" As my head began to clear, my brain began searching for  local coherence , and I focused intensely on a single issue:  Should I still change out of my jeans and into my skirt? Will we still be meeting? Of course we won't be meeting. Why wouldn't we be meeting? It's not like there's anything we could do. But of course we'll have to do something. No, no. Everything has changed. I don't need the skirt. I should put the skirt on anyway. Maybe I'd better keep my jeans on in case I have to do something. But what would I do? Maybe we should all go home. I can't go home. I have to meet with the President. If I don't change now, I won't have time to do it before the meeting. Should I even go to the meeting? I shouldn't go to the meeting. There won't be a meeting. No one will care what I'm wearing. Maybe I should just keep the jeans on and go to the meeting. No, I should put on the skirt. Just in case. Right? Then I started to cry, and I don't remember much that happened after that. I remember that we had a meeting with an entirely different agenda, but I don't remember if the President was there. I don't remember where I went when the meeting ended. I don't remember if I was still wearing jeans or if I had changed into the skirt. But I remember very clearly the fog rising off the lake as I left home on that crisp, clear, almost-autumn morning. I remember the carefree joy I experienced in my final moments in a world in which some kinds of horror were still unthinkable. And most of all, when I think of September 11, 2001, I remember dancing with my son.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/09/where-were-you-when-world-changed.html", "title": "\nWhere were you when the world changed?\n"},

{"date": "Monday, March 07, 2005", "body": "\nIn a previous post I mentioned  Paul Collins's  terrific book  Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism , with a promise to expand on it later. Here is the expansion. Not Even Wrong  is part-memoir and part-historical reference guide. Collins intersperses a retrospective look at autists and autism research from 1725 to the present with his own thoughts and emotions as his young son is diagnosed with autism. His perspective is at once intellectually objective and lovingly subjective. It is a fascinating read, and has easily become one of my favorite autism-related books. I especially appreciate that through his title - Not Even Wrong - Collins has given me a framework to explain one of the most fascinating aspects of Bud. Collins writes: \"Wolfgang Pauli used to deride colleagues in theoretical physics who disagreed with him as \"not even wrong.\" He meant this as a put-down - that the questions they were asking were so off-base that their answers were irrelevant. Yet Pauli's notion could also be applied to those who are autistic. They do not respond in expected ways to questions or to social cues... but then, only a person working from the same shared set of expectations could give a wrong answer. The autist is working on a different problem with a different set of parameters; they are not even wrong.\" Collins was writing specifically about the autist's lack of a \"theory of mind,\" or the understanding that other people may have a different perspective from one's own. But I find that the \"not even wrong\" idea goes beyond that. Often - very often - Bud says things that are seemingly meaningless - complete nonsequitors that are easily overlooked. But if I take the time, if I reconstruct his world, if I use  my  theory of mind to try climb inside his brain, I am astonished at the connections I can make. One of my favorite of those moments of enlightenment went something like this: We were at the supermarket and Bud got a superball out of the quarter machine at the door. It was a swirly, translucent, unremarkable superball. I hoisted him up into the shopping cart, and he held up the superball and said \"Mama, what's this?\" (This is one of Bud's favorite activities. He will make a proclamation: \"I following the footprints!\" and then test me on it, \"Mama, what I'm doing?,\" either for his own edification or so that he can be sure that I get it. Regardless of my answer, I am quizzed for the next 15, 30, 60 minutes - \"Mama, what I'm doing?\" - I guess, to make sure I don't forget.) So, I replied \"It's a ball.\" He said, \"It's a hamster.\" (A  hamster ?) \"Mama, what's this?\" \"It's a ball,\" I said, slightly less sure of myself but feeling the need to hold my ground. \"No,\" he said. \"It's a hamster.\" I started panicking. Was it a hamster? I held it up to the light to see if there was a hologram inside that I was missing, but it was just a regular old superball. \"I don't understand, honey. Can you tell me more words?\" \"It's a hamster. Just like church.\" Then, like when all of a sudden the dots in a magic eye picture become the face of Dwight D. Eisenhower, it all fell into sharp focus for me and I  got  it. We go to a tiny little church, where Bud is usually the only child in their even tinier \"Sunday school\" program. His favorite toy in the playroom there is a marble-run building set. But he keeps forgetting the word \"marbles,\" and instead he calls them \"gerbils.\" The superball - round and translucent and swirly - is a lot like a marble/gerbil, only it's different. And what else is like a gerbil, only different? A hamster, of course. Not even wrong. Remarkable, insightful, completely outside-the-box, but not even wrong.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.collinslibrary.com/blog/index.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/03/not-even-wrong.html", "title": "\nNot Even Wrong\n"},

As I watched the footage of the two together, I found myself holding my breath and wondering which, ultimately, would win - the \"mothering\"/nurturing instinct that the lionness clearly had for the antelope, or the hunger and the biological instinct to hunt? The documentary is compelling as it depicts a series of events that simply couldn't happen - but did. This is reality television at it's best. If you're looking for something a little less serious, don't miss  Comedy Live: Dylan Moran  on BBC America. I'm not usually a fan of stand-up comedy, but I stumbled across Moran's act one night and was immediately hooked. He is truly laugh-out-loud funny. Another fun show on BBC America is the sit-com  My Family , which stars actor Robert Lindsey. I've been a fan of Lindsey since the late eighties when six other people in the world and I enjoyed the movie  Bert Rigby, You're A Fool . (Is it even available anymore? Has anyone else ever heard of it?) Anyway,  My Family  is smart and funny and easily better than almost any situation comedy currently airing on US network television.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://media.animal.discovery.com/fansites/wildkingdom/lioness/videogallery/videogallery.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/03/tivo-alerts.html", "title": "\nTiVo Alerts\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 05, 2005", "body": "\nMany months ago, I posted about a mystery that had me  stumped , in which Bud had started calling the remote control to the portable DVD player a \"miper.\" I knew there had to be a logical reason, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out what it was. When Bud adopted the \"miper\" title, his obsession  d'jour  was using it to change the Teletubbies narrator from speaking with an American accent to speaking with a British accent, then back again. Tonight, after days of listening to him beg, I relented and let him watch home videos of himself. I am usually loathe to do this, because 1) the videos remind him of old scripts he has stopped perseverating on, and reintroduces them into his repertoire for a while, and 2) the videos themselves start to become scripts for him to perseverate on. However, I did let him watch himself in action for about 30 minutes. In one of the segments, he was in the bathtub singing loudly into my round hairbrush. An hour later, the videos were stashed away and it was bathtime and - true to form - Bud wanted my hairbrush so that he could recreate the scene he'd just watched. \"Mama, can I have my miperphone?\" \"Your what?\" \"My miperphone.\" The fog lifted. A miperphone is a device that you talk into that changes the sound of your voice. So what would you call a device that you  don't  talk into that changes the sound - the accent - of a voice? A  miper , perhaps? Not even wrong .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2005/11/i-think-ive-finally-got-it.html", "title": "\nI think I've (finally) got it\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 14, 2006", "body": "\n Susan Senator  has tagged me to do a delightful seasonal meme, and since I enjoy compiling lists as much as  Nick Hornby  and enjoy Christmas music as much as  Santa's elves , this one is a natural for me:  Name your top five holiday songs, and explain why you chose them.  I actually had a hard time narrowing down the list, so I decided that instead of thinking of favorite Christmas carols (I love 'em all), I'd think about specific recordings that I look forward to hearing every year. Here's what I've got: 1. \"Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth\" by David Bowie and Bing Crosby I'm actually not a huge fan of \"Little Drummer Boy\" as a stand-alone, but couple it with the beautiful counter-melody of \"Peace on Earth\" and it slays me every time. The Bowie/Crosby pairing is pure genius, though I can't imagine the tv executives (the song originally appeared in a 1977 Bing Crosby television special) who sat around a table and thought \"You know who'd make a great duet?\" Maybe it's the juxtaposition of the two that makes it work so well, I don't know - but it's like last year's Grammy's mash-up that melded Paul McCartney with Jay-Z and Linkin Park. Only more so. With bells on. 2. \"Wonderful Christmastime\" by Paul McCartney If you're a regular reader of this blog, you know that this is a no-brainer. Q: What's better than a Christmas song? A: A Christmas song written and performed by  Palmer Cartney . 3. \"Christmas Waltz\" by Frank Sinatra I actually had to look up the title of this one, but it's the one that goes  \"Frosted window panes, candles gleaming inside. Painted candy canes on the tree. Santa's on his way; he's filled his sleigh with things - things for you and for me.\"  I guess the bit about  \"this song of mine in three-quarter time\"  should have been a clue. I just think it's delightful, whatever it's called. 4. \"Sleigh Ride\" I love most versions of this song, as long as they are performed in a straightforward way. I am profoundly uninterested in show-off performers adding runs and trills and odd syncopation to my Christmas standards, making it completely impossible to sing along. I am a \"Sleigh Ride\" purist, and prefer the song played loud when I am alone in the car. I should mention that the definitive recording of the song for me, which I haven't actually heard in years, was the one that appeared on the Christmas compilation LP we owned when I was a child. I seem to recall that it was a gas station give-away - a free-with-a-fill-up sort of promotion - and it included a version of \"Sleigh Ride\" by Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme. Now  that  was a sing-along good time. 5. \"Fairytale of New York\" by The Pogues Okay, I'll grant you, this is not your typical warm and fuzzy, Currier and Ives, chestnuts-roasting-on-an-open-fire kind of tune. It's more the seamy underbelly of the Christmas season, with Shane MacGowan's opening stanza slurred out with a scowl: It was Christmas Eve, babe,  In the drunk tank.  An old man said to me,  \"Won't see another one.\"  And then he sang a song,  A rare old mountain tune.  I turned my face away,  And dreamed about you.  Kirsty MacColl joins MacGowan in a duet that  Wikipedia  describes as the story of \"two Irish immigrants, lovers or ex-lovers, their youthful hopes all but crushed by alcoholism and drug addiction, reminiscing and bickering on Christmas Eve in New York City. \" It may not sound like the stuff of which tradition is made, but trust me - not a Christmas goes by without my husband and me crooning to each other: You scumbag, you maggot, You cheap lousy f****t, Happy Christmas your arse, I pray God it's our last.

Bud has started working one-on-one with  Mrs. H  for the summer, and in their first session he drew this picture in his journal: She did the labeling, but the pictures are all his. This is the first time I've ever seen Bud include eyebrows in a drawing, and he uses them well - the sad face has a furrowed brow; the surprised face has eyebrows raised high; the angry face captures the ever-popular passive-aggressive \"My mouth might be smiling, but my eyebrows are telling you how I  really  feel.\" (When I'm exhibiting the signs of this particular emotion Bud often raises his fingers to my face and tries to push my eyebrows back up, assuming that if we can just get those darned  eyebrows  to cooperate we will all feel much better. And, of course, his attempt makes me laugh, which gives me a release, which makes me feel less angry. He's a smart kid, that Bud.) Some of the  things I've read  would lead me to believe that this is a Very Important Step for Bud, and though I am only  reasonably pleased  with this development I imagine that it's the sort of thing that would make Simon Baron-Cohen feel quite encouraged.

{"date": "Monday, January 23, 2006", "body": "\nBefore I had a child, back when I was an expert on parenting, a friend of mine \"confessed\" to me that her three-year-old still climbed into bed with her and her husband almost every night. I don't remember how I responded, but I cringe at the thought that I probably launched into a no-nonsense directive on how to \" Ferberize \" the child. Internally, I was probably somewhat smug and thinking that she'd made her bed... so to speak. A few years later we had Bud, and all my expertise about the \"right\" way to train a baby to sleep flew out the window. From the moment we settled into our room at the hospital, Bud made it clear that he was not interested in spending time in the bassinet. He wanted to be on a chest - mine or my husband's - where he could scoot in closely and sleep soundly. To be honest, my husband and I were as high-need for contact with Bud as he was with us. Bud's entry into the world had been bittersweet; his identical twin brother was stillborn. So, after nine months of having my heartbeat on one side of him and his brother's heartbeat on the other, I think Bud was frightened when he found himself all alone. And we parents, grieving the loss of one son, could not get close enough to the other. So it seemed very natural that, upon arriving home from the hospital, we left the cribs empty and crowded together in our bed. The reference book I was using most, because it made the most intuitive sense to me, was  The Baby Book  by Dr. William Sears, who is a leading proponent of co-sleeping. Dr. Sears thought sharing our bed with Bud was a fine idea, and said that we could be sure that he would decide to leave our bed on his own when he was ready. All was happy for a short time, until everywhere we looked the news was full of  warnings against co-sleeping . Having just lost one baby, I panicked at the thought of losing the other and immediately ordered  this amazing product , which allowed us to continue to share sleep with Bud without taking any risks. When Bud outgrew the co-sleeper, we moved his crib into our room and he continued to sleep right next to me, though nearly every night he woke at some point and climbed in with us. Dr. Sears wrote at length about the virtues of \"nighttime parenting,\" and about responding to your child and being with your child to comfort him to sleep instead of trying to get him to self-sooth and learn to \"cry it out\". The philosophy made intuitive sense to me, especially in light of the loss we had all suffered. Crying it out might help Bud to learn to be more independent, I reasoned, but having just lost his twin he's probably already feeling more independent than he'd like to be. I feared that if I let him cry it out the message he'd hear would be \"You're on your own, kid. Make it work.\" By \"parenting\" him to sleep, I hoped I was saying \"You are never alone. You do not need to worry. I understand.\" I fully recognized that my need was as great as Bud's; when I returned to work full-time a few months later, my need to connect with Bud at night might even have been greater than his. And so it continued, me cuddling with Bud until he fell asleep each night, then the three of us huddled together like a cozy little wolf pack, as the months turned into years, as we outgrew the Queen and purchased a King, until we woke one morning to find a big huge five-and-a-half year old in the middle. I consulted the Sears book again, looking for that chapter in which he assured me that my boy would be developmentally ready to move on to his own bed if we let him do it in his own time. Ah, yes, there it was. According to Dr. Sears, my son would be ready to do this when he reached the age of approximately ... three. Ah. I see. Dr. Sears had not accounted for autism when he made this prediction. At that point I realized that this transition was probably not going to happen all on its own. I created a sticker chart - a cartoon picture of a boy sleeping in a bed, 5 empty squares for stickers, and then a picture of the payoff, a  video that Bud knew darned well I wasn't buying any other way . I explained to him that any time he could fall asleep all by himself in his bed, he would get one sticker in the morning, and when he got 5 stickers we would buy the movie. I let him know that this was entirely up to him - if he wasn't ready to try, that was okay and he could try again another time. I also let him know that if he woke up in the night he could come into our room and he would still get his sticker. It worked beautifully. I think it only took him 6 nights to get 5 stickers, and after a few more sticker charts (each a little longer than the one before) he was falling asleep on his own every night. But like clockwork, each and every night we heard a telltale thump-thump-thump as Bud padded from his room to ours, climbed up the foot of the bed, and squirmed himself into the middle. We have just passed the one-year mark of Bud falling asleep on his own, and Bud still pads into our room every night at some point. Last night he climbed under the covers and sighed, \"This is great.\" And the thing is, he's right; it  is  great. I don't have the words to explain it articulately yet, but on a gut level I just  know  that co-sleeping has made a difference for Bud. I don't think it has made his autism less severe; that's far too simplistic. But I think it has made us more  connected . I think it has helped us to read each other better than we would have otherwise, to understand each other on an intuitive level. In a chapter titled  Our Most Important Discovery  in her book  Making Peace with Autism , Susan Senator described the pivotal moment when she began to understand Nat's need for connection. Kristina Chew at Autismland writes eloquently and frequently about her  connection  with her son Charlie. In blog after blog written by parents of children on the spectrum, I see examples of great things happening when they are able to connect.  How  we make the connections that yield success differs from family to family, but  that  we make the connection seems remarkably consistent. Like  Lisa/Jedi , a fellow co-sleeper and recent addition to the world of autism bloggers, I believe that our connection with Bud was cemented with whispers and cuddles and giggles and snuffles amid pillows and flannel sheets.

{"date": "Friday, August 04, 2006", "body": "\nI've been scrambling to find a new autism specialist because the developmental pediatrician who's been working with Bud for the past four years is moving out of state. I was nervous about it because we live in a small, rural town and I'd heard that this pediatrician was the only autism specialist in the local area. Luckily, though, my investigations turned up what appears to be a fantastic child development clinic on the other side of the state that takes a team approach to assessment. The team is led by a developmental pediatrician and includes an OT, PT, and SLP, in addition to other specialists. Their assessment includes time in the clinic, a home observation, and a school observation, and seems like a perfect way to get a \"where are we now\" snapshot. Their wait list is long, but the woman I spoke with said she would pencil us in for early spring as long as we returned their intake paperwork as soon as we got it. It was an easy promise to make before I saw their daunting paperwork, full of questions that challenged my fuzzy memory - when did he first sit independently? drink from a cup? say a word? So today I trudged up to the attic to pull out copies of the paperwork I completed when Bud was 2 years old and we were just beginning with Early Intervention. As I sorted through five-year-old paperwork I found the notes from his first assessment with the EI team. I remember the meeting well. I remember being delighted to open the door to find that the team was a group of warm, friendly, engaging women: Bud's target demographic. I remember sitting in a line-up on the couch - my dad, my mom, my husband, me - as we watched the already charming but still nonverbal Bud flirt with the team and revel in their attention and affection. I remember the four of us tag-teaming our answers to their questions: \"How would you describe his strengths?\" \"He's very affectionate\" - \"Loving\" - \"He's flexible\" - \"Adaptable\" - \"He adjusts well to new people and places\" - \"He's very social\" - \"He plays well\" - \"He sleeps well\" - \"And eats well\" - \"He's so much fun\" - \"He's happy.\" \"What concerns do you have?\" \"He's not talking\" - \"He doesn't react to pain\" - \"It doesn't seem to register\" - \"Not even when he bangs his head really hard\" - \"He doesn't point\" - \"He doesn't follow a point\" - \"It's hard to direct his attention to something\" - \"He seems to get overstimulated easily\" - \"He runs laps around the house when he's excited.\" \"And what would you most like to change about Bud?\" Uh - The four of us sat upright, barely breathing, shooting glances at each other from the corners of our eyes.  Of course , I thought,  that's the point of Early Intervention, isn't it? We're supposed to want to  change  something. Of course that's it. I should have thought about this. I should have been prepared for this. How can we possibly qualify for Early Intervention if there's nothing we want to change? The silence was going on too long; I could tell by the way the team members were looking at each other. \"Well, you know,\" I said. \"It would be good if he could talk. I mean, I hate to think about him being frustrated that we don't understand him.\" \"Okay, good. So he seems frustrated?\" \"Well... no.\" \"It would be good if he followed a point,\" offered my mom. \"And the pain thing,\" I said. \"He could really hurt himself and we wouldn't know it.\" We were crashing and burning. It was Bud's dad who jumped in to clarify for the team. \"See, the thing is,\" he said, \"We just think Bud is perfect. You know, even if he's behind, he's perfect. He's the perfect Bud. And that's all we really want him to be.\" They smiled and nodded. We exhaled. Bud qualified for Early Intervention. So now, five years later, as I'm filling out the lengthy form for this new assessment I am mentally preparing the answers to the questions I assume this new team will ask as well. It's interesting to note how much has changed. Some of the answers to the first two questions, his strengths and challenges, have swapped places; others have stayed the same. Bud still plays well, but now he has difficulty sleeping; his anxiety is high in social situations and he'd usually prefer to stay home than go to a public place; his language is still not typical, but he is able to communicate well; he has appropriate responses to pain; he points and follows a point and is increasingly good at maintaining joint attention; he's often fearful of new people and places; he still runs laps when he's overstimulated; he's still fun; he's still happy. And that third question? The one about what we'd change? I don't have an updated answer to that one. Bud is still perfect. Luckily, some things never change.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/08/more-things-change.html", "title": "\nThe more things change\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, July 15, 2007", "body": "\nI\u2019ve been watching the Eight Things meme cycle around the blogosphere for weeks, and it seems to have cycled over to me - I've been tagged by  Niksmom . Now, in all honesty, I try to respond to tags when I discover them, mostly because it seems the decent thing to do. But I am especially inclined to respond to  this  tag, not only because I am quite fond of Niksmom, but also because in her tag she called me \u201cubiquitous\u201d. I am putty in the hands of a  word  like \u201cubiquitous.\u201d So, first the housekeeping. The rules of this meme are: 1. Let others know who tagged you. 2. Players start with 8 random facts about themselves. 3. Those who are tagged should post these rules and their 8 random facts. 4. Players should tag 8 other people and notify them they have been tagged. And now, eight things: 1. I\u2019ve been having trouble sleeping lately. This is due only in part to the fact that Bud is also having trouble sleeping lately. I know this because on the rare morning in recent weeks when he\u2019s slept past 4:00, I\u2019ve found myself staring at the ceiling just the same. This is highly, highly unusual for me, as sleeping is typically one of my very best things, good times and bad. 2. I am coming out of the closet as a country music fan. In all honesty, I didn\u2019t give country music much of a chance for a long time (probably because I assumed it was out of whack with my political and religious leanings), but last January I had a training weekend with my student staff in which several of our activities centered around music. During the weekend, I discovered two things: a) My staff was heavily into country music, and b) Their music was good. So I started dabbling and trying things out and at some point in recent months I got so hooked that these days it\u2019s almost all I listen to. I should add the caveat that I am not a fan of  all  country music. In fact, I am only really interested in a very specific sub-genre of country music \u2013 what Yahoo Launch Music calls \u201c Today\u2019s Country ,\u201d and what XM Radio calls \u201c Highway 16 \u201d: Keith Urban, Billy Currington, Faith Hill, Brad Paisley\u2026 within the genre, I\u2019m hard-pressed to find someone I really don\u2019t like. An interesting aside: Bud has become a fan as well and frequently asks me to add specific tracks to his iPod. His recent requests have included Sugarland\u2019s \u201cEveryday America,\u201d Tim McGraw\u2019s \u201cWhen the Stars Go Blue,\u201d and his hands-down, all-time favorite,  Dierks Bentley\u2019s \u201cFree and Easy (Down the Road I Go) .\u201d 3. I\u2019ve been peripherally following the storyline of General Hospital since the early 80\u2019s \u2013 since before Luke and Laura were Lukeandlaura. I haven\u2019t necessarily been  watching  GH since the early 80\u2019s, but I\u2019ve been dropping by and catching up here and there for more than 25 years. I\u2019ll go five or more years, then catch word that there\u2019s a great storyline (read: Stone Cates dying of AIDS in the mid-90\u2019s) or I'll find myself home sick some afternoon and I\u2019ll tune in. It usually takes about a week to bring myself up to speed on anything I\u2019ve missed in the intervening years. The advent of TiVo has made this excessively easy.  I can easily get some episodes in the line-up, and before you can say \"Port Charles\" I'm right back in the know - and then, after about two weeks, I'm good to go for another five years. 4. I really like the taste of beer, but I have an incredibly low tolerance for alcohol.  I\u2019m typically loopy enough after half a beer that I wouldn\u2019t drive, and on the rare occasion that I actually finish two whole beers, I'm usually fast asleep. 5. Twenty-three years out, I am still in touch with many \u2013 most, actually \u2013 of my best friends from high school. In fact, I am in touch with more friends from high school that I am friends from any other period of my life. I was one of those people who loved high school \u2013 probably because I was lucky enough to find myself in really terrific company there. 6. I was diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatter disease when I was 10 years old, and I still have a very weird bony bump on my kneecap to show for it. 7. I drove cross-country with two friends from college in 1989. They were dating each other, which didn\u2019t keep the three of us from sharing a tent for the whole summer. Highlights of the trip included Beale Street and Graceland; Bourbon Street and Preservation Hall; the mechanic named Dink who arrived on the scene in Georgia moments after our tire blew out and directed us to one of the loveliest campgrounds of the whole trip; Moab, Utah and Arches National Park; Bend, Oregon; the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota; and the sub-zero swimming environs of Rangely Lake in Maine. 8. The friends with whom I shared a tent in 1989 were married in 1995, and I got the credentials I needed to be able to perform their wedding ceremony. When their son was born in 2001, I was on the scene again and, as such, I have the proud distinction of being the first person on the planet to ever see the top of his head. I'd like to tag eight bloggers, but I swear that I've already seen tags out there linking to almost every blogger I know. If you haven't had it yet, and you're inclined to share, please do. I'd even be happy to call you \"ubiquitous\" if it would entice you more.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://maternal-instincts.blogspot.com/2007/07/randomness-of-life-or-eight-facts-about.html", "http://music.yahoo.com/launchcast/stations/station.asp?i=39469132", "http://www.xmradio.com/onxm/channelpage.xmc?ch=16", "http://www.dierks.com/jukeBox.php"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/07/i-eight-too-much.html", "title": "\nI eight too much\n"},

In contrast, I walked into today\u2019s meeting with a list of points I wanted to make sure we covered, and in every instance \u2013 without exception \u2013 someone else on the team raised the issue before I had a chance. I truly believe that the plan we have in place for Bud \u2013 and the plan you\u2019ve been implementing with him all spring - is fantastic and puts him in the best possible position as he prepares to make the transition to middle school. \n \n This could be an overwhelming and frightening time for Bud, and for me. Instead, because we have the good fortune to work with people like you \u2013 insightful, collaborative, forward-thinking people who truly know and respect my son \u2013 it\u2019s an exciting time full of possibilities.

{"date": "Thursday, October 06, 2011", "body": "\nI have to admit, I'm surprised by the intensity of my reaction to the news of death of Steve Jobs.  I'm devastated.  I'm stunned.  But, of course, I  know  that his death really wasn't a surprise.  We all knew that it was coming, right?  What was I expecting?  Did I think he would show up unannounced at the next shareholders meeting with \"one more thing,\" as he pulled the cure for cancer out of his back pocket? \n \nNo, I didn't expect that.  Not really. \n \nBut, damn.  He was  Steve Jobs .  If anyone could have pulled that off, it would have been him. \n \nBut it wasn't.  And now it never will be.  And I'm really, really sad. \n \nIt wasn't just that Steve was a genius disguised as an Everyman - like he was just cool Uncle Steve, always showing up for holiday dinners with the hottest new toys.  It wasn't even that he singlehandedly made it cool to be a geek, raising the market value for so many of us as we make our way in this world. \n \nIt was that Steve Jobs changed my son's life. \n \nWhere would Bud be right now if Bill Gates had not had Steve Jobs to engage him in the continual battle of one-upsmanship that made home computing what it is today?  Where would he be without the point-and-click technology that Jobs pioneered - the technology that works in absolute congruence with his non-typical brain?  For Bud, computers are the one intuitive thing he has in a world that is otherwise almost entirely counter-intuitive.  Bud has been computing since he was a toddler, and in all that time, computers have not just given him a sense of competence.  They have given him a sense of mastery.  They are the arena in which he knows that he is not just on par with his peers; he surpasses them. \n \nAnd it was Steve Jobs who brought us the iPad, the device that has been transformative for so many children with autism - the device that has  given them independence  and  helped them find their voices . While the iPad has not been quite as life-changing for Bud, it's clear that we have only begun to recognize the possibilities that it holds for him as an educational tool.  For now, though, it is the ultimate imagination machine, which Bud uses to experiment with multimedia, casting himself as designer, producer, narrator, and foley artist of his own creations.  And where will his iPad take him from here?  It will be fascinating to find out. \n \nAnd the iPod - the single most powerful tool in Bud's arsenal.  The iPod is Bud's  armor in battle , his passport in interaction, and his solace in times of stress.  A quick glance through the pages of this blog would reveal how often the iPod makes an appearance here.  A look through our (digital - thanks, Steve) photo albums would show you that the iPod is Bud's personal American Express - he won't leave home without it.  Would Bud ever have become the model patient at the pediatric dentist if he  hadn't had his iPod  to help him self-regulate through those early years of visits?  Would he ever have conquered his fear of thunderstorms without his iPod to temper the fury?   It is hard to imagine. \n \nWithout Steve Jobs's iPod, Bud would probably spend most of his time in the public arena with his fingers in his ears or with sound-blocking headphones standing between him and the rest of the world.  From a distance, he would look, to strangers and peers, a little different, a little odd, a little \"other.\"  But now, with his iPod in hand and his earphones in place?  He just looks like the cool kid that he is. \n \nThe iPod is his conversation starter (\"Hey, Bud - what are you listening to?\").  It is his shelter from the storm.  It is his socially acceptable and entirely private way to restore  local coherence  when the world gets overwhelming, allowing him to replay brief snippets of songs or sound bites, over, and over, and over again, as he reclaims control when his world is too unpredictable, as he restores his own sense of internal order when his external environment seems in chaos.  For Bud, it's a life-saver - and a gift that only Steve Jobs could give. \n \nPerhaps most importantly, though, it was Steve Jobs who framed a cultural philosophy that makes the world a safer place for my son to be himself, because it was Steve who challenged us to \"think different.\"  And for a child whose  brain is designed to think different , that celebration of difference, that trumpeting of both the value and the importance of difference - well... it's everything. \n \nWe will miss you, Uncle Steve.  The holiday dinner table just won't be the same without you.  But, truly, your legacy will continue in ways that even  you  might never have imagined were possible - and, as we all know, that's really saying something. \n \nAnd, oh yeah, one more thing:  Thank you - from the bottom of my heart.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.blogher.com/ipad-nearmiracle-my-son-autism", "http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-684217?ref=feeds%2Foncnn"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-thinking-different-changing.html", "title": "\nSteve Jobs: Thinking different, changing lives\n"},

I'll do it myself.\" I stepped back and gave him some privacy as he massaged shampoo into his scalp, then I offered to help him rinse it out. He turned me down. Yesterday at the end of the school day, the children in Bud's class sat down for their math lesson. Bud turned to his aide and said \"I'll do it myself.\" She happily stepped aside and watched as he sat at his desk, chatted appropriately with his neighbors, and stayed focused and on-task. Then she wrote a very happy note in his school-to-home notebook. This morning Bud stopped me at his bedroom door when I tried to help him get ready for school. \"You go out there,\" he said, pointing to the hallway. \"And close the door. I'll do it myself.\" I stepped outside and heard him rustling through drawers. On the first attempt, he came into the hallway with his shirt inside out. Then he forgot to put on underwear. The next time he emerged, his underwear was on, but he had both legs through the same leg-hole. Each time, he happily accepted my suggestions on how he might make a change, but he insisted that he did not want any help from me.

But Bob Wright and I do have something in common: We're both fans of Aaron Sorkin's latest TV drama,  Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip . A couple of weeks ago, rumors were flying that  Studio 60 's cancellation was imminent. Then an entertainment columnist  reported  that Bob Wright wanted to keep the show on the air (and, yes, I realize I'm linking to Fox News here, but any port in a storm, you know?). The reporter quotes Wright as saying, \"We'd never get that kind of cast together again. I think it will go on.\" And he's right.  Studio 60  has a stellar cast. Matthew Perry is the clear standout, in a role that helps him prove his talent as an actor by requiring him to be funny without bearing a slight resemblance to  Chandler Bing . But Steven Weber, Amanda Peet, D.L. Hughley, Ed Asner, Bradley Whitford, Timothy Busfield, Sarah Paulson, and Nathan Corddry (who you may not know now, but who is certain to become a break-out star) are an outstanding ensemble.

{"date": "Thursday, February 23, 2006", "body": "\nI read a lot of blogs written by parents of children with autism. Sometimes I'm moved; sometimes I'm humored; sometimes I'm inspired. But increasingly in recent days I have been challenged. Though I'm typically drawn to the blogs written by parents who share my philosophy, I've broadened my approach recently to read some by parents with alternative viewpoints. Even in many of my \"regular reads\" I've found people challenging themselves and each other, considering multiple perspectives, and taking some risks - and I really appreciate it. To make sense of it all, I have found myself turning to the principles of the \"moral conversation,\" an approach to considering complex issues that I first learned in graduate school and that I now recognize as the single most valuable piece of learning in my life so far. Developed by Dr. Robert J. Nash at the University of Vermont, the moral conversation seeks to provide a framework for engaging with others about difficult, potentially divisive issues in a manner that emphasizes the fundamental worth and dignity of all those involved. Its central premise is deceptively simple: First, find the truth in what you oppose and the error in what you espouse. Then and only then can you declare the truth in what you espouse and the error in what you oppose. It sounds easy; it's not. The moral conversation is not about maintaining a superficial tolerance for ideas with which we disagree. It's not about listening politely and acknowledging to others that they \"make a good point.\" It's about truly  engaging  with the ideas we resist: trying them on; walking around in them for a while; running them through multiple filters; and searching, searching, searching for the  truths  that lie within them. Because, usually, the truths are there. They are small \"t\" truths: not universal, not unassailable, but truths nonetheless. But that's not all. The moral conversation further pushes us to consider our own beliefs, opinions, and ideas. It requires us to delve deeply into the truths to which we've, consciously or unconsciously, assigned a capital T, and then to bravely, honestly, thoughtfully reevaluate our stances and change our cases. Finally, it requires us to put it all together and articulate a new, more thoughtful, less universal, perhaps less dogmatic, but usually much more honest philosophy. I've been using the moral conversation in many ways for many years. It has guided me through some of the most  painful, confusing, conflicted times  in my life. It has helped me in my profession, in my relationships, and in my parenting. It's difficult every time; but when I do it well (and I don't always do it well) the benefits are extraordinary. And so, once again, it's time to let down my defenses, open up my mind, and engage in a moral conversation - with other philosophies, with other writers, and, ultimately, with myself.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/02/blogs-autism-and-moral-conversation.html", "title": "\nBlogs, autism, and the moral conversation\n"},

His first visit  was difficult, so we weren't sure what to expect this time. But we know that, for Bud, familiarity breeds comfort, so we were determined to forge on. Based on my experience with Bud's end-of-the-year  \"why is Mom at school?\" dysregulation , I thought that perhaps my presence at last week's visit was part of the problem. So, this week, Nana went with Bud to visit Mrs. Parker. As you may recall , following the first classroom visit Bud sent a letter to Mrs. Parker, which he composed entirely on his own. It read: Der mis prker I liek horn moeosik Iliek read er rabbit Luv bud As luck would have it, when Nana and Bud arrived they found Mrs. Parker seated at the computer struggling with a problem. It seems she was  trying  to play a Reader Rabbit game, but she just didn't know how to do it. Bud to the rescue. Bud and Mrs. Parker sat side-by-side at the computer while Nana lurked in the background. Mrs. Parker handled the interaction with finesse - involved, but not too involved; allowing for the self-soothing of some  perseverative  mouse-clicking, gently redirecting to the exploration of a new element, then allowing for the brief return to the safety of perseveration. Success, success, success. After a short time on the computer, Bud was ready to explore the classroom. He practiced hanging up his backpack. He practiced putting his pencil case in his cubby. Then, it seemed, it was time to test Mrs. Parker about her tolerance for Budthings. He introduced her to his  stuffed purple Boohbah , his favorite Boohbah, the one he calls \"My brudder Sumbah.\" She was pleased to meet his brother Sumbah. He acted out a Teletubbies script - silly actions, baby talk, and all. She was just fine with the Teletubbies scripting - didn't pay it too much attention, didn't pay it too little. He suggested that he might walk down to the Kindergarten classroom and visit his friend  Mrs. H . She said that Mrs. H wasn't there that day, but she knew that he would be able to see Mrs. H a lot while he was coming and going to first grade this year. Success, success, success. I was in my office watching the clock, worrying, and wondering how it was all going when my phone rang and I heard a voice I  don't often hear on the other end of the phone . \"Hi, Mom.

{"date": "Friday, March 17, 2006", "body": "\nBud's goldfish, Dorothy, is dying. She has been unwell for a while - bulging in the wrong places, listing to the side - but last night she took a discernible turn for the worse, her eyes getting white, her gills struggling to open, her fins barely stirring. We moved her into a private bowl, away from her friend Stevie, and into the bowl that will act as her goldfish hospice. This morning she looked even worse and poor Stevie, alone in his bowl for the first time, seemed distraught. So this morning I was presented with a dilemma. Bud had not noticed Dorothy's absence from the bowl. I could easily have asked Nana to slip out while he was at school and buy a replacement Dorothy, sparing Bud the tragedy of losing his beloved pet. And while I want to protect Bud, while I want to keep him free from unnecessary pain, I also want him to live fully -and loss is a part of life. Dorothy will not be the only loved one that Bud will lose in his life. And as difficult as her loss might be, it will not be the most difficult loss he will experience. It is time to help him start to develop the skills that will help him withstand the greater losses when they eventually come. I didn't want to start the difficult conversation before I sent Bud off to school, so I just started laying the groundwork. \"Dorothy is very sick, Bud,\" I said. \"Oh no! My fish!\" he yelled, running to the bowl, where Stevie swam in confused circles. \"She's over here in this bowl, honey,\" I said, holding it low so Bud could peer in to see the barely-moving goldfish. \"She is sleeping here so Stevie doesn't get sick too.\" Bud put his face close to Dorothy's water. \"That's okay, Dorothy,\" he said. \"You feel better soon.\" Then he kissed the air above her bowl with a loud  smack . My throat tightened, but I reminded myself,  now is not the right time.  I put Dorothy's bowl back on the counter, where she was out of Bud's sight. So very soon - tonight, or perhaps tomorrow - it will be time to introduce my son to one of the most difficult parts of life: the ending. I'm thinking about how to phrase it, about which words will bring comfort, and about what I can say that won't make him panic the next time that he, or someone else he cares about, gets sick. I imagine that I will take my cues from him, and work hard not to plant emotions that are not there. I'll try not to talk too much. I'll try to listen to what he's  not  saying as much as to what he is. But, mostly, I will just  be  with him. Because, ultimately, when we're grieving and we're struggling to understand our own grief, it is the comforting presence of other people, the space and the permission to  feel , and the knowledge that even in our darkest moments we are not alone, that we really need most. Perhaps that lesson is the final gift that Bud will get from his very first pet.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/life-lessons.html", "title": "\nLife lessons\n"},

{"date": "Friday, December 22, 2006", "body": "\nSanta won't arrive for several more days, but I've already gotten the best Christmas gifts ever. Yesterday I attended the first grade holiday concert at Bud's school. I was nervous, because the last school event I attended was the Kindergarten end-of-the-year celebration, which  did not go as well as we'd hoped . The first grade event was much more grandiose, with children from four first-grade classrooms crowded on a stage, facing rows of smiling parents in the school's multipurpose room. I reminded myself of the lessons I'd learned last year, and tried to have realistic expectations about it. Daddy, Nana, and Papa stayed away, so as not to overwhelm our boy with too many people out of context. I left the camera at home, so Bud would feel less \"on the spot.\" And I gave Bud several opportunities to let me know he'd like me to stay away as well, and let him have only \"school people\" at his school event. He assured me that he wanted me to come - though I had strict instructions that I was to JUST WATCH, and  not sing along . I arrived early and found a seat that was close (but not too close) and on the aisle in case I needed to make a quick exit. Once the parents were settled, three first grade classes - all but Bud's - filed in and found their places on stage. My mind briefly flashed to an image of frantic teachers delayed because they were trying to calm a hysterical Bud, but moments later his class rounded the corner into the room. His teacher looked breezy and carefree, and by her side was Bud, smiling, wearing his sound-blocking headphones rigged up with paper reindeer antlers. His aide pointed me out in the audience, and he dashed over for a hug. I wondered if he'd refuse to leave once he was with me, but he happily followed his aide to join the rest of his class on stage, where he waved and smiled and winked at me. It was a lovely program. Each class sang two songs, then the entire ensemble sang a song together. Bud stayed on stage for the entire production. He didn't sing, but he listened, and conducted, and tapped sticks in perfect syncopation with the rest of his class. He didn't sit, as the other children did, but he stood to the side by his classmates, in a spot that gave him a good view of the other singers, a good view of me, and easy access to his teacher whenever he needed a hug. It was a resounding success. At the conclusion of the program, we went back to Bud's classroom for juice and cookies. A mom I'd never met before stopped to tell me that her daughter Lily is very fond of Bud and \"talks about him all the time.\" She said Lily had made him a Christmas present and would bring it to school the next day. When Bud and I arrived at the classroom the following morning, Lily and her dad were waiting for us. Lily's dad suggested that Bud open his present so that I could take it home to make sure it didn't get broken. I helped Bud open a lovely glass ornament on which Lily had painted a snowman's face, and as the other children in the class gathered around to see it, I realized that Lily hadn't made an ornament for all of her friends. She'd only made one for Bud. Bud was a bit overwhelmed by the hubbub and the break in routine, and was too distracted to take a long look at the ornament, but he did give Lily a prompted \"thank you.\" I told Lily's dad how moved I was by her thoughtfulness and he replied, \"Lily was really excited about making it for him.\" My heart soared. Last night, Bud was delighted when I suggested that he write a thank-you note to Lily. I told him he could use the computer to write it, hoping that if he didn't have to struggle through handwriting he might write a lengthier note. My plan worked, and without any help from me, Bud wrote: Dear Lily thank you for this presint And thank you to Wow I seid Oh no seid Lily Msis PrGER luv his frend Good frends seid Msis Prker Luv bud Which translates to: Dear Lily, Thank you for this present. And thank you, too! \"Wow,\" I said. \"Oh no,\" said Lily. Mrs. Parker  love his friend. \"Good friends,\" said Mrs. Parker. Love, Bud. Last night before bed, Bud and I prepared the packages he'd be taking with him for his last day of school before the holiday break: a tin of homemade cookies for his class party, cards and treat bags for his teachers and the special ed staff, and a large supply of  Christmas crackers  to share with all his friends at school. Bud was so caught up in the spirit of the season that he climbed out of bed before me, rustled around for a while, then burst into my room shouting \"Get up, Mama! It's Christmas! It's presents downstairs!\" \"No, Bud,\" I said. \"It's not Christmas yet. It's a school day, remember? It won't be Christmas for a few more days.\" \"No,\" he corrected me. \"It's me, Bud, give presents for you!\" Intrigued, I made my way downstairs to discover that he'd snuck down before I was out of bed, filled my stocking with items from around the house (spoons, a note card, one of his shirts), and placed a few treasures (a beach ball, a stuffed character) under the tree. \"Merry Christmas!\" he shouted. Yes. Merry Christmas.

I'm sitting here, a blogging neophyte, staring at a white screen that seems to be taunting me. My heart is racing. I'm in a state of flight-or-fight panic. I can barely stand to read the words I'm writing. Bud has PDD-NOS, an autism spectrum disorder. We've been trying on this diagnosis for two-and-a-half years.

From what I have gleaned so far, the diagnosis of PDD-NOS doesn't really tell you anything about the individual who has it, because the \"spectrum\" plays out differently for everyone who has it. For Bud, writing and drawing are challenging activities. He can hold the crayon and make the right marks, but he can't stand to  look  at the page while he's writing, so the marks are all disjointed and hanging out there in space. Last week his teacher had a break-through. She went to hear  Temple Grandin , an autistic woman who has written extensively about autism in a way that non-autistics can comprehend. Another teacher asked Temple about this not-looking-at-the-paper phenomenon (which I thought was unique to Bud, but I guess isn't.) Temple didn't miss a beat and suggested that the teacher start using cream or grey colored paper. Apparently, the light bouncing off the stark white paper is often too much for the sensory system of autists. It never would have occurred to me.

{"date": "Tuesday, October 25, 2005", "body": "\nI  posted previously  about how much Bud and I enjoy Paul McCartney's latest CD,  Chaos and Creation in the Backyard . Since then I've been thinking a lot about what an appropriate title that is for our life right now. \"Creation\" is a primary goal for Bud these days. He is learning to string words together to create meaning, instead of using scripted language to approximate it. He is learning the art of creative problem solving, instead of relying on us to solve his problems for him. He is learning to assert himself and make his wants and needs and preferences and ideas and imaginings known - he is creating his self-image and, with our help, creating his place in the world. At the same time, Bud likes routine and predictability. He likes knowing what's going to come next, and likes the satisfaction of having things play out just as they \"should.\" Often, and especially in times of stress, Bud  needs  that kind of routine and predictability. However, I find that the  student development theory  I use with college students works with Bud as well. The theory suggests that to develop to their greatest potential, students require an environment that provides the right balance of challenge and support. In an environment that provides too much support and not enough challenge, a student will stagnate. In an environment that provides too much challenge and not enough support, a student will become overwhelmed and will shut down. And so it is with Bud. He needs routine and predictability, but if we allow him too much of it he turns further inward and his creative ability slows. If he has too little routine and predictability, he is scared and anxious, unfocused and distressed. We must constantly reassess and readjust to find the ever-changing balance; we must preserve enough of the \"known\" to help him to feel safe, and find just the right moments to introduce an element of surprise, of uncertainty... of chaos. These are not move-the-earth moments. They are tiny moments that are easy to miss, but they are of critical importance to Bud. One of those tiny moments happened last week while we were playing with his Teletubbies. \"Mama, what Tinky Winky's favorite color is?\" Bud asked. I knew the right answer. The right answer is purple. We have played this game a million times, and the right answer has always been purple. Tinky Winky is purple, so purple is his favorite color. To suggest otherwise in the past has been to start an argument. And yet... I went there again. \"Well,\" I said, \"Tinky Winky is purple. But today I think his favorite color is orange.\" Bud considered my answer without comment. No argument, but no comment. \"What Dipsy's favorite color is?\" And the game continued. I suggested that Dipsy liked blue instead of green, Laa Laa preferred pink to yellow, and Po would rather white than red. Bud accepted my answers quietly. \"Bud,\" I asked, \"What do you think Tiny Winky's favorite color is?\" \"Yellow,\" he answered. One small step for a Teletubby; one giant leap for Bud. Another moment, a few days later. Bud was playing with the Tubbies again, this time having them act out a script from a video: \"Four happy Teletubbies hopping 'round the tree. One went to hide, and then there were three...\" \"Yeah!\" I said. \"The Teletubbies can play hide and seek! Dipsy can be \"it\" and the others can hide.\" Bud dropped his script instantly and set to work hiding and seeking, creating interTubby conversation, and helping them play the noncompetetive and highly collaborative Bud-version of this popular game in which the hider announces his location as soon as the seeker is in sight (\"Ready or not, here I come!\" \"Here I am, Dipsy. I in the plant!\") Another creative leap forward. Then last night, as we were getting for bed we were playing a rousing game of \"I Want To Wear Jammies,\" a game I developed a couple of years ago when Bud was first starting to use language. It's a game designed to encourage turn-taking, model the back-and-forth flow of conversation, introduce unpredictability, and provide opportunities for shared emotion. The format is simple: we take turns naming places where we'd like to wear our jammies, the more absurd the better. So, for example... \"I want to wear jammies... to school!\" (\"School? Hahahahaha...\") \"I want to wear jammies... to church!\" (\"Oh, that would be so silly!\") You get the picture. While still a favorite game, I Want To Wear Jammies has outgrown it's usefulness, since Bud has mastered the skills it introduced. Now, in fact, it has turned into something of it's own script, since we tend to visit all the same places every time we play. This time, though, Bud threw me a curve ball - a place I hadn't heard before: \"I want to wear jammies... in space!\" \"Space?\" I said, my eyes as wide as I could make them. \"I want to wear jammies in space, too! Let's go!\" So we jumped into his bed (our spaceship), counted down from ten, and shouted \"Blast Off!\" as we hurtled into the sky. \"WOW! Look at that!\" I said, pointing at the lamp. \"Look what's out the window!\"  (Please, Bud,  I thought , don't say you see a lamp...) \"Yeah!\" said Bud, looking at the lamp. \"It's stars!\" \"Stars!\" I said. Then I pointed to the toyshelf. \"And look at that!\" \"A moon!\" he said, awe in his voice. \"And, oh, my goodness,\" I pointed to the ceiling. \"Out there - it's p-\" \"PLANETS!\" he shrieked.

{"date": "Friday, March 24, 2006", "body": "\nWhen we first got Bud's PDD diagnosis, I started lurking on listservs and message boards for parents of kids on the spectrum, and I kept seeing references to \" stims \": \" he spent the afternoon stimming\"; \"how do I stop all the stims?\"; \"we took it away because he was getting stimmy\"; stim, stim, stim, stim, stim. I had no idea what they were talking about, but I could tell from the  way  they were talking about it that \"stimming\" was a terrible, terrible thing and I was  very  glad that Bud did not do it. It honestly took me a long time to realize that when they talked about \"stimming\" they were talking about many of the things Bud did all the time: flapping his hands, humming, or running laps around the house when he was excited;  repeating phrases  and quoting videos; listening to clips from a song, then skipping back to hear the clip again and again and again; rewinding videos to watch favorite scenes, or segments, or moments, over and over. So I was confused. Why were they being so  negative  about it? A lot of time has passed since then, and I now understand the challenges of perseverative behavior better than I did then. Some of the self-stimulatory behavior that Bud exhibited along the way included hitting himself in the head or knocking his head against a wall when he was frustrated, and forcefully kicking the wall when he had trouble sleeping. So I understand why some of the behaviors are of concern. But, I have to say, I still don't like the word \"stim.\" Last semester I taught a class in  Interpersonal Communication , and one of the concepts we discussed was word choice. I did an exercise with the class in which I divided them into three groups and handed each group one of three sentences: Sheila is  careful  with her belongings. Sheila is  meticulous  with her belongings. Sheila is  fussy  with her belongings. \"What is your impression of Sheila?\" I asked each group. The people who knew Sheila to be  careful  had a mostly positive view of her. Those who thought she was  meticulous  had mixed views. Those who saw her as  fussy  had a very negative view. We tried some other examples: The  youthful  Senator took the stage. The  young  Senator took the stage. The  inexperienced  Senator took the stage. and Robert is  economical  with his money. Robert is  thrifty  with his money. Robert is  cheap  with his money. The point of the exercise was to illustrate that words have two types of meanings. They have  denotative  meanings - the dictionary definitions; but they also has  connotative  meanings - the associations with the word that evoke emotional - even visceral - reactions in us, and that create a context in our minds when we hear the word. Examples of the effects of connotative meaning are everywhere. Watch a few minutes of Fox News, then switch over to CNN and listen to the words they use to report on the very same stories. Then turn on NPR to hear what they're saying. The differences in word choice are fascinating. So the issues I have with discussions about \"stimming\" are not about the  behaviors  being discussed; they are about the word itself. To me, the word \"stim\" has a powerful connotative meaning: \"stim\" says  unusual ,  disconcerting ,  abnormal ,  dangerous . But Bud's behaviors are none of those things. I think about his proclivity to rewind. Since he learned to master the TiVo remote, he sometimes engages in sheer  festivals  of rewinding and rewatching. Just this morning he was watching (and rewatching and rewatching) a 1 or 2-second clip from  It's a Big, Big World  in which a character said \"Sure!\" in a funny voice. \"Sure!\" blip-blip-blip \"Sure!\" blip-blip-blip \"Sure!\" blip-blip-blip Then Bud added his own dialogue. He said to the screen: \"Do you want to play?\" \"Sure!\" blip-blip-blip \"Do you want to go upstairs?\" \"Sure!\" blip-blip-blip \"Do you want some breakfast?\" \"Sure!\" And on it went. Was it stimming? \"Sure!\" But it was also pretend play. And it was  practice . It was a predictable conversation that allowed him to try a variety of permutations to see how they sounded. It was a safe way to test the waters of interaction. It was really very cool. And it makes me wonder: when he was rewinding before he had expressive language, what was going on in his mind? Or I think about 2-year-old Bud and his fascination with the CD player. He would listen to the introduction of a song, and then just as the singer was about to sing the first note of the lyrics he would click back to the start of the song. Again and again and again. I never really thought of it as strange. Bud loves music. He  loves  music. So he was learning the songs - and he was learning them the way  he  wanted to know them. He was learning the bass lines, and the drum beats, and the pauses, and the piano riffs. Some people walk in the park and hear the birds singing. Others hear the robins, and the cardinals, and the blue jays, and the sparrows. It's about having interests. It's about having passions. I've read a lot of wonderful  posts  by other  bloggers  that have contributed to my thinking on this. And more than once I've posted a comment that said something like \"I don't really like the language of stim.\" It was the  connotative  meaning of \"stim\" that I was talking about in those comments - the way that the word somehow pathologizes the behaviors. Because the thing is, sometimes Bud's behaviors are disruptive and unhealthy for him; but sometimes they keep him in balance. And isn't that true for most of us? Isn't my morning coffee one of the things that keeps me alert and focused? And don't I get jumpy, irritable, and easily distracted if I've had too much? The thing I keep coming back to in my mind is this: The words we use  matter . Words shape our perception. And perception shapes reality. So Bud will continue to flap, he will continue to perseverate, he will continue to rewind, repeat, and recite. He will also attend to details, pursue his passions, hone his strengths, explore his interests, and perfect his talents as he learns to self-regulate. He will have behaviors that enhance his life and behaviors that become problematic for him. But he will not \"stim\" - not to my eye and not in my mind. And, definitely, not on this blog.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.geocities.com/autismandpdd/Glossary.htm#S%20-%20U", "http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18784165&postID=114295947364085695", "http://29marbles.blogspot.com/2006/03/barneys-harmonica-revisited.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/03/choosing-my-words.html", "title": "\nChoosing my words\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, June 08, 2006", "body": "\nBud has been eagerly awaiting the release of  Sesame Beginnings , a new line of DVDs that feature beloved  Sesame Street  characters as babies and focus specifically on the relationships between the babies and their caregivers. For what seems like months he's been watching the  video clips  available on the PBS website and scanning the DVD aisles of every store we enter to see if they're in stock yet. Last week, thanks to partial funding by the  Tooth Fairy , Bud was finally able to take one home. I was surprised that the series held such allure for Bud, as  babies  have never been among his favorite things. I imagined that he'd pop the DVD in once, see that there were actual human babies sprinkled in among the Muppets, and abandon it entirely. I was wrong. Bud is absolutely captivated by this DVD. All week he has been seeking me out to re-enact parent/child moments from it - songs, games, interactions (though he is quite clear that in our version we must change all child-references from \"baby\" to \"boy.\") I watched him watch the DVD this morning; he was transfixed, grinning, his face only inches from the screen. And it wasn't just the Muppets. His big smile got even bigger when he watched real-life pop singer Brandy interacting with her 3-year-old daughter Sy'rai. Then it hit me. The target audience for  Sesame Beginnings  is children 6 months and older. Based on his intellectual and cognitive development, Bud should be far beyond it. But based on the work he and I have been doing together with  RDI , I recognize that this is  precisely  on target with the level of his  relational  development. I think Bud loves this DVD because, perhaps for the first time, he can relate to it. He knows  why  the babies and parents are relating to each other the way they are. He knows how it makes them feel. He knows why they continue to seek it out, and he understands the things that they each do to keep it going. Just like the 6-month-old children that the  Sesame Beginnings  producers had in mind when they put it together, Bud looks at the characters' interactions and he sees himself. I looked at the  Sesame Beginnings   website  this afternoon and saw that they describe it this way: Sesame Workshop is breaking new ground through the introduction of an innovative research-based DVD series for parents and young children that encourages learning through parent-child interactions. Based on research that shows that young children learn best when experiences are shared with a loved one, these DVDs -- Sesame Beginnings -- are specially designed to help parents and caregivers encourage their child's curiosity and interest in learning during everyday interactions. I was struck by how, with a few alterations in language, this description could be used to describe the goals of the earliest stages of  RDI  - the stages, in fact, that Bud has only recently mastered. The folks at Sesame Workshop have  come under fire  with the release of  Sesame Beginnings  because the development of a line of DVDs for infants stands in stark contrast to the recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics that children under two have no exposure to television. Perhaps I should give Sesame Workshop a call; it seems Bud and I may have discovered a whole new target audience.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sesameworkshop.org/sesamebeginnings/new/", "http://www.sesameworkshop.org/sesamebeginnings/new/about.php", "http://www.rdiconnect.com", "http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0419-31.htm"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/06/new-beginnings.html", "title": "\nNew beginnings\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, November 04, 2006", "body": "\nThese days at our house it's all Curious George, all the time. Longtime readers will recall that though Bud's a huge fan of the  Curious George books , he  adamantly refused  to go to the theater to see the  Curious George  movie. But earlier this fall, PBS began airing an animated Curious George series and a few weeks ago my husband brought home the Curious George movie on DVD, and since then there has been a decidedly simian vibe around here. Bud's still interested in reading about Curious George, of course. And now he's also interested in watching Curious George. But, really, more than anything else, Bud is interested in  being  Curious George. Now, for those who may not be up on the Curious George plot lines, let me give you a quick overview: George is a good little monkey, but he's always very curious. He lives with his friend, The Man with the Yellow Hat. On a regular basis, The Man with the Yellow Hat leaves George on his own  for just a moment ... and in that moment, mayhem ensues. Like, for example, the time that George got his foot caught in the rungs of a chair. The Man with the Yellow Hat tried using butter to get George out, but it didn't work and he ended up having to call the fire department to free George. Last night we were eating dinner. Bud, who was long finished, darted into the room and took a long swipe of butter on his finger. Not recognizing the context, we admonished him, wiped his hands, and sent him on his way. We heard rustling in the pantry but opted to finish our dinner instead of going to investigate. A short time later I went to find Bud and the moment I entered the playroom I was overcome with the distinct aroma of... chicken soup. A few steps further in and I began to see the fairy dust trail of chicken bouillon granules that Bud had smuggled out of the pantry to use as a stand-in for butter (since, of course, they're both yellow.) Bud, having been freed (though we never actually heard the arrival of the fire department), had fled the scene, but his tipped, bouillon-covered chair told me everything I needed to know. There's been a lot of that kind of thing lately: attempts at \"fixing\" clocks, applying \"styling gel\" (in the form of moisturizing lotion) to hair, proclamations shouted from the kitchen that he is making a cake and will need to break some eggs. He has also incorporated Curious George scripts into his  already complex echolalic repertoire . It took me weeks to figure out why, despite the fact that I sent him to school in layers to keep him warm on these chilly autumn days, he kept coming home from school in a short-sleeve t-shirt with his sweatshirt stuffed into his backpack. He'd been \"playing\" a favorite Curious George episode about a heatwave, and approaching his teachers as The Man with the Yellow Hat, exclaiming loudly, \"It sure is hot today! It's  roasting  in here!\" And, of course, they responded appropriately and helped him off with his top layer. Weekends have become an adventure because each week, as we get closer to the days when Bud knows there is no school and no work, Bud starts hatching a Curious plan. Last weekend I asked him what he'd like to do and he announced that we'd be heading to The Big Hot City (which, incidentally, is from the same heatwave episode). I played along, wondering what he had in mind, and we found ourselves at the empty administration building at the college, where we walked the halls, rode the elevator, ate cookies, and did a whole lot of pretending about fixing the air conditioning system. The weekend before we went to the library, where we walked from room to room finding clocks for Bud to fix. Today was a Bud and Dad day, because it was a Saturday when I needed to work. As I left the house this morning, I heard Bud announce to his father that they'd be going to the beach. I thought Dad might get off easy, as Bud had played an indoor version of Curious George Goes to the Beach earlier this week, by spreading a beach towel out on his floor, opening an umbrella as a parasol, rolling in a basketball as a beach ball, dragging in a sofa cushion to use as a rubber dinghy, donning a baseball cap and sunglasses, and preparing a picnic of fake food. Apparently, shortly after that, Bud decided that instead of the beach they should head to the country (which is not a big stretch, since we  live  in the country), so Dad took him to the children's museum where there are lots of lovely hiking trails. Bud enjoyed the hiking, but mostly he enjoyed standing in the center of the museum, shaking his tail, and belting out a song about being together. We're not sure what episode that came from. But doesn't it make you curious? \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/11/havent-you-always-wanted-monkey.html", "title": "\nHaven't you always wanted a monkey?\n"},

And, in his memory - in his honor - I want to tell you a story. \n \nFor the first trimester of my pregnancy we believed that our twins were monoamniotic - that they shared a single amniotic sac - and were therefore at high risk of having their tangled umbilical cords cut off their blood supplies.

Pal's death was inexplicable. \n \nBut the perinatologist did know this: Because our boys shared a placenta, if Pal had died sooner, before Bud was ready to be born, he would probably have taken Bud with him. \n \nI will never know why Pal couldn't stay.

There had been two rapes on the campus, they explained, and shortly after that the young woman got frightened when she believed that someone was following her as she walked to her car. \"I called Campus Police,\" the mom recounted incredulously. \"And they told me that they couldn't guarantee my daughter's safety.\" And with that, her daughter decided to withdraw.

I was thinking about:  Have you seen the startlingly attractive woman talking about her autistic son on Paul McCartney's latest DVD,  The Space Within US ? But it's not to be. Paul McCartney's latest DVD is on the shelves, but it doesn't include me. Last fall, I went to see McCartney as he toured the country promoting his most recent album,  Chaos and Creation in the Backyard , and like all slightly manic fans I waited patiently by the gated back entrance to catch a glimpse of him as he zipped past in his limo. While I passed the time with a crowd of warm-hearted, like-minded crazies, McCartney's videographer (I recognized him - how pathetic is that?) wandered out with his cameraman and started interviewing some people in the crowd. I listened from afar, and imagined what I would say if I had the opportunity. The videographer said to the cameraman, \"Let's do one more,\" then he looked up and, from the other end of the crowd, locked eyes with me. Horrified, I instantly broke eye contact and looked away, but he walked directly up to me and said, \"Can I ask you a few questions?\" Yikes. He asked me some sort of open-ended question about why I was there that evening, and I started telling him about Bud - about how much Bud loves Paul McCartney - about how Paul's music is something that Bud and I share, something that connects us - about how Bud watches Paul's last concert film constantly - about how, though language has always been a struggle for him, music has been second nature - about how, even before he could talk, Bud could sing  Band on the Run  - about how, even though  Chaos and Creation  had only been out a few weeks, Bud already knew all the lyrics - about how, despite all this, the sights and sounds of a concert would be scary and overwhelming for Bud - about how I was there that night for both of us. Halfway through the interview, the videographer asked me to stop and start again with a clear opening that would make a good soundbite  (\"My son Bud is six-years-old, and he has autism...\")  I don't remember exactly what I said, but my friend says I was concise and articulate. I've spent the last year trying to convince myself that with the thousands of hours of footage they'd taped I wouldn't have a chance of making the final cut. But I secretly hoped that when Bud and I sat down to watch the DVD, he'd see the camera cut away from Paul and cut to me talking about Bud.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 21, 2007", "body": "\nI've mentioned  my word thing  before. I've mentioned it  more than once . I'm about to mention it again. Well, a variation of it, at any rate. For the past forty-eight hours, ever since I started writing  my last post , I've been thinking - okay, I've been  perseverating .  It's gone something like this: Gray. Grey. Gray? Gray. Gray . Grey. Grey? It's making me crazy. Grey - or gray - was a key word in my last post.  I had to choose one spelling and stick with it.  I started with \"grey\".  Then I made reference to Carol  Gray , so I went back and changed all the \"grey\" to \"gray\" - you know, so I'd look more clever. But the \"gray\" bugged me.  It bugged me so much I had to go through and change it all back to \"grey\". Then I started to panic, so I did what I always do when I'm starting to panic:  I turned to Google.  I was surprised and, frankly,  relieved  to find that I was not alone in my grey/gray conundrum, especially when I found  this post  by Bernie Zimmerman from May, 2004...  and its 146 comments. Zimmerman explains that both spellings of the word are acceptable, but he sums up the difference this way:  \"Gray is a color.  Grey is a  colour .\" Fascinating.  Why, then, is it  grey  that speaks to me?  I mean, really: despite my fascinations with Paul McCartney, Colin Firth, and Sarah Ferguson, I will never actually be British.  Though I live in a cold climate and support socialized medicine, I will never actually be Canadian.  I'm an American.  I wait  in  lines, not on them.  I go on  vacation , not on holiday.  If I wrote the word \"colour,\" it would feel like an affectation. But I am all about the  grey . Maybe my brain is making a subconscious connection to another recent obsession:   Grey's Anatomy .  I think it's more likely, though, that I'm being driven by a  connotative meaning  of the word that  Wikipedia  describes this way: \"Some American writers tend to assign wistful, positive connotations to grey, as in 'a grey fog hung over the skyline', whereas gray often carries connotations of drabness, 'a gray, gloomy day'.\" That's it, I think.  In a post that celebrates grey - that celebrates Bud and his unique grey matter - I was driven to steer clear of connotations of the drab and the gloomy. So  grey .  I'm sticking with  grey . By which I mean no disrespect to  Carol Gray .  Or  Macy Gray .  Or  Gray Davis . Oh, no.  Here we go again...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bernzilla.com/item.php?id=232", "http://www.greyswriters.com/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences", "http://www.thegraycenter.org/", "http://www.macygray.com/", "http://www.gray-davis.com/"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/03/insanity-is-in-details.html", "title": "\nThe insanity is in the details\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, April 03, 2007", "body": "\nI've  mentioned before  that Bud has trouble grasping math concepts. His teacher and I have been working on ways to make math problems more accessible to him, and one of our first challenges has been trying to capture Bud's attention long enough to give him time to think about the question being asked. This weekend, Bud's math homework included four word problems. His teacher had added a note for me: \"Do you think you could adapt these types of problems with Teletubbies or Curious George's bananas?\" It sounded like a workable solution to me, so before we got started I sat down at the computer and re-worked the questions to make them more Bud-friendly. So, for example, Ruth had 7 stickers. Mrs. Rhoton gave her 3 more. How many did Ruth have in all? became Laa Laa had 7 flowers. Po gave her 3 more. How many flowers does Laa Laa have all together? Bud read the whole problem out loud to me. Then he went back and read the first line  (\"Laa Laa had 7 flowers\")  again.  I pulled out a blank sheet of paper and drew a picture of Laa Laa. Bud was fully engaged. Together we drew seven flowers next to Laa Laa. Bud read the next line:  \"Po gave her 3 more.\"  I drew Po, then together we drew three more flowers. Bud added dialogue: \"Ee-ah,\" said cartoon Po; \"Oh, thank you, Po,\" said cartoon Laa Laa. Bud read the last line:  \"How many flowers does Laa Laa have all together?\"  I had cartoon Po say goodbye to cartoon Laa Laa, and I drew a border around Laa Laa and all her flowers. Bud and I counted the flowers together, then we talked through the math problem that our picture represented as Bud wrote at the bottom of the page: 7 + 3 = 10 Feeling confident, we moved on to the next problem, which was originally: Mo is 6 years old. Her sister Ann is 14 years old. How much older is Ann?, but now read: Po is 6 years old. Tinky Winky is 14 years old. How much older is Tinky Winky? I guessed that this kind of comparative thinking was going to present a greater challenge for Bud, so I tried to make the abstract concept of age a bit more tangible. Bud read the first sentence:  \"Po is 6 years old.\"  I drew a picture of Po next to a big birthday cake, and we counted together as I drew six candles on the cake. Bud read the second sentence:  \"Tinky Winky is 14 years old.\" \"Po is six years old, so she had six candles,\" I said slowly. \"But Tinky Winky is  fourteen  years old. So, what does Tinky Winky's cake need?\" \"Frosting,\" Bud replied. Okay, here's the thing. I will grant you that math is not Bud's strong suit. But it's hard to argue with  that kind of logic .\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://thismom.blogs.com/this_mom/2007/03/the_blue_room.html"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/04/bud-takes-cake.html", "title": "\nBud takes the cake\n"},
{"date": "Monday, November 27, 2006", "body": "\nI've  mentioned previously  how flexible Bud is in his pretend play. His favorite activity is acting out tv and movie scripts with his characters. If he has the actual toy versions of the characters in question - the Blues Clues crew, the Teletubbies, the Sesame Street ensemble - then he uses them. If he doesn't, he improvises. Here are some of my very favorite improvisations. The first characters Bud needed to create on his own were Chris and Martin Kratt, the hosts of the PBS show  Zoboomafoo . Here's what Chris and Martin look like in real life: And here's what they look like at our house, as played by the Fisher Price family dad and mom. (NB: The mom always plays the role of Martin. I'm not sure, but I think it's because Chris wears the green shirt.) Bud is also a fan of  Moose and Zee , the cartoon hosts over at Noggin: Except that in Budland, the roles are played by a moose puppet and Norville, the bird from  Clifford's Puppy Days : Sometimes Bud likes to play with Smooch and Winslow, the marmosets from  It's a Big, Big World , who look like this on TV:  And like this in Budland:   And, of course, we can't forget the ever-popular  Curious George  and The Man With the Yellow Hat: as played in Budland by BJ (of  Barney  fame) and an anonymous stuffed monkey. (You may also take note of the clever roller skates on George's feet, created by Matchbox cars and twist-ties.): Bud's current passion is the new Noggin program,  The Upside Down Show , starring \"brothers\" Shane and David, whom (for obvious reasons, when you realize that you're looking at Shane on the right) Bud calls \"Shave-it and Dave-it\": This is what they look like around here, where Zoboomafoo stars as Shave-it and Woodstock stars as Dave-it: And, finally, the  piece de resistance  and my personal favorite, Charlie and Lola, as they appear on the BBC CBeebies website, And as they as they appear in our bathroom (That's Charlie on the left): \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/11/dynamic-duos.html", "title": "\nDynamic duos\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 02, 2007", "body": "\nGuys, I need your help. I read about  your big appearance in New York  on Kristina's blog, AutismVox, and about the tie-in you're doing to  raise money for autism research . Then I went to check out  your new website . The problem is that I checked it out while Bud was with me. Oh, wait. You don't know Bud. Well, you probably get this all the time, but I mean it sincerely: Bud is your number one fan. Need proof? You can start  here  - or simply type \"Teletubbies\" into the \"search blog\" bar above. You'll be amazed by the number of posts that pop up. Bud is a dedicated, over-the-top fan. Oh, and he's also autistic. Anyway, from the website we watched  footage of you on the Today show , walking through the streets of New York and standing in front of the Statue of Liberty. And then we saw the interviews - first the one that showed you in costume, and then the one that revealed the four actors standing inside them: John Simmit, who plays Dipsy; Pui Fan Lee, who plays Po; Nicky Smedley, who plays Laa Laa; and Simon Shelton, who plays Tinky Winky. I watched Bud for a reaction: would he be crushed to learn that it was all illusion, and that you were regular people inside oversized costumes? Just the opposite. Bud was delighted. The interview confirmed for him that you are not just characters who exist inside a screen. You are actual people who don your suits and go places. You get on airplanes. You go to New York. You could come to our house. Bud started planning immediately: He would write you a letter inviting you over to play. He would ask you to sleep over. It would be great. (I should point out to you here that Bud does not invite people to come to his house to play. This is a big deal. This is a Very. Big. Deal.) I told him I didn't think you could go to kids' houses, but he wouldn't be dissuaded. He went straight to the computer and he typed like I have never seen him type before. He took care with spelling, going back and correcting the errors he spotted. He paused to consider how he wanted to word his request. He stopped typing in mid-sentence to ask me if you would have trouble getting your tummies into sleeping bags (I told him I thought you bought really big sleeping bags. Do you?) He even used punctuation - an apostrophe. I had no idea he knew how to use an apostrophe. His letter is below, unedited. The words and the sentiment are his entirely: deer teletubbies i want you to come to my house and play with me and hav a bath and i dry yoer entenass i will put you in your seepingbags and you will go to mom and dad`s bed and sleep with me As soon as he finished typing, he ran to the front door to wait for you. He was sure you were coming. I told him how busy you were. I told him you had to make TV shows and movies and books, and that all of those things took a long time. I told him you had to do your jobs. He said he'd wait until you were finished. I told him that you have to work every day, and that you live in England, which is very, very, very far away. I told him it would take ten hours to fly here, and that you couldn't possibly come to visit and get back in time to do your jobs. He suggested that we could drive to England to visit you instead. I told him that England is on the other side of the ocean, and that cars can't drive across the ocean. He said we could take an airplane. I told him that it costs a lot of money to take an airplane to England. He headed for his piggy bank. I told him that we'd have to keep saving our money, and that when he is 18 we can take a trip to England. I have no doubt that he'll hold me to it. So I'm sure you can appreciate the bind I'm in here. Bud will be 18 in ten-and-a-half years. How in the world will we find you when we get to England in ten-and-a-half years? And will you still have access to the suits? You could really do us a favor and save us a long, angst-filled decade if you'd just come over for a night. I mean, we can't offer the allure of Manhattan, but there's a real charm to our tiny town in the woods. We know how to cook all your favorite foods. And you will experience a genuine, innocent, guileless love the likes of which you have never known before. One thing I do need to mention, though: The bit about \"Mom and Dad's bed?\"  I'm sorry, but I really have to renege on that point. Nothing personal. I hope you understand. Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this. Bud is absolutely certain that his \"guys\" won't refuse his invitation. Just to be safe, though, I'll be saving our pennies and planning our trip to Europe in 2017. Either way, we look forward to seeing you.

{"date": "Friday, January 26, 2007", "body": "\nThere's been a word explosion at our house. Words are everywhere. Bud's writing them. He's reading them. And, best of all, he's saying them - all over the place. Bud spends a lot of time these days with his nose in a book. His favorite is one that Santa brought him -  Arthur's First Sleepover , which comes with a CD of the story read by its author, Marc Brown. Bud listens to it every day, following the words as Brown reads them, turning the pages appropriately at the end of each line. He's still watching TV and movies, of course, but these days he insists that I turn on the closed captioning while he watches ( \"Mama, can you get the words, please?\" ), so he can read along with the dialogue he's hearing. And the talking - oh, the talking! We're still hearing plenty of scripts, but his spontaneous language is getting more sophisticated all the time. Bud has started using lots of words to offer up information about his day - what he ate for snack, the project he worked on in art class, who he played with at recess, which part of his day didn't go as well as he'd hoped it would. He uses words to share insight into his emotional state - \" I miss Ms. Parker,\"  or  \"That makes me angry!\"  He uses words to seek out information from us:  \"Hi, Daddy. How was your day?\"  or  \"What's so funny, Mama?\"  These days, our back-and-forth has been going back-and-forth-and-back-and-forth-and-back again repeatedly, as it did last night at bedtime: \"What happened at school today, Bud?\" \"I was sad.\" \"Oh. What made you sad?\" \"Ms. Parker was working with another friend.\" \"Which friend was she working with?\" \"With Sophie.\" \"Well, that's her job, honey. Ms. Parker has to work with  all  the children.\" \"And then me.\" \"Yes, and then you.\" \"Okay. Tomorrow is school?\" \"Yes, tomorrow is Friday. It's going to be very cold, so you'll be staying inside for winter activity day.\" \"I'll stay with Ms. Parker.\" \"Remember? Ms. Parker called and said she's sick so she can't go to school tomorrow. Ms. Jones will be with you.\" \"No, not with Ms. Jones. I can stay with Ms. Parker.\" \"Ms. Parker is sick, sweetie. She can't come to school. She has to rest.\" Pause. \"I can take care of Ms. Parker. I can rest with him. I'll just hold her arm.\" (Yesterday, as Ms. Parker felt she might be coming down with something, she asked Bud not to hold her hand because she didn't want to transmit germs to him. He held her arm instead.) \"That's very nice, Bud. You are a good friend to Ms. Parker. Maybe you could make her a \"Get Well Soon\" card.\" \"At home?\" \"Yes, at home, and we'll send it to her. But at school tomorrow, you'll be with Ms. Jones.\" \"And Ms. Jones will teach the kids?\" \"Yes, she will.\" \"Okay.\" He's also made huge strides in finding words to help us understand his needs, even when the words don't come to him readily. One night after he'd gotten into bed he called out to me in a somewhat panicked voice: \"Mooooom! I need your heeeeelp!\" I went to his doorway and asked what was wrong, and he answered slowly, \"It's - it's - it's  tih-ing  me!\" \"It's  what , honey?\" \" Tih-ing  me! It's  TIH-ing  me!\" he paused, listening, so I paused and listened as well. Then I heard the click of the baseboard heaters kicking on as the chilly night swallowed the warmish day:  tih  -  tih  -  tih  -  tih . I explained that the noise was the heat coming on so that we would be warm all night and, satisfied, he rolled over and fell asleep. I wonder how a similar scenario might have played out a year ago, before he was able to find - to  create  - those words. I imagine that he would have called for me, but he would not have been able to tell me  why  he needed me. I would have thought he was restless and agitated and being difficult for no reason. I would have told him - probably too sternly - that it was time to sleep. He might have tried again, but ultimately he would have found himself in the dark, alone with his fears and anxieties as he listened to the mysterious, unexplained  tih - tih - tih  that seemed to be getting closer and closer. Ouch. The most exciting recent development, though, is that Bud's starting to be able to answer \"why\" questions. It's still an inconsistent skill. He has mastered the why/because question/answer format, but often his \"because...\" answer is not quite congruent with the \"why\" question that was asked. But sometimes -  sometimes  - he nails it. One night last week, he nailed it despite being in the middle of having himself a good cry. He was overtired but fighting the idea of going to bed, and in protest he dumped water from his water bottle onto the floor. I handed him a towel and took his water bottle, explaining that he was done with it and could have it back in the morning. Much weeping and snuffling and melodrama ensued, and in the midst of it he threw his arms around my neck and exclaimed \"But, Mama, I'm so SAD!\" I decided to go for it: \" Why  are you sad, Bud?\" \"I'm sad because, because... I'm sad  because   I lost my favorite water bottle! \" he wailed. I consoled him, gave him a brief reminder of how the situation came to be, and assured him that the water bottle was not  lost  and would be returned to him in the morning. He sniffed and snuffed and tried to pull himself together, and I stayed somber and sympathetic on the outside. But on the inside, my heart was doing a big old dance of joy. Why? Because there's been a word explosion at our house - and it's rocking my world!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/01/words-words-words.html", "title": "\nWords, words, words\n"},

Most of what I blogged about our lives in 2007 was written between the lines. I alluded to what we were going through, but I didn\u2019t write much about it. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, for starters. And I wasn\u2019t sure how much of the story was mine to tell. So I stuck with allusion. I talked to Bud\u2019s dad the other day, though, and he told me that he feels like a guy whose character got written out of a sitcom because the actor\u2019s contract was not renewed. I can see where he\u2019s coming from. As you may have surmised by what I haven\u2019t written this year, Bud\u2019s dad and I are no longer together. It\u2019s complicated, of course, and really not for public consumption. He made a difficult \u2013 but logical \u2013 move to another area, and he talks to Bud on the phone every day, and often several times a day. As a result, 2007 was characterized by extraordinary change for Bud. He had to deal with a radical shake-up at home, and with the absence of one of the most primary people in his life. He had to manage confusion and uncertainty and anger and sadness. His transition to a new school year was difficult. His anxiety was at an all time high. His unrelated health issues prompted the scheduling of major surgery. And yet, he did it. Bud negotiated the difficulty. He named his sadness and his anger. He forged a new kind of day-to-day relationship with his dad, and became masterful at the art of the telephone conversation. He focused on working through small changes, which helped him learn to work through the big ones. He trusted his dad and me. He kept moving forward. As a result, 2007 was also characterized by extraordinary growth for Bud \u2013 physically, emotionally, and developmentally. He became a terrific reader. He made tremendous advances with language \u2013 using it to comment, consult, question, explain, describe, implore. He learned that though circumstances change, a parent\u2019s love never does. And neither does a child\u2019s. We have all survived 2007, both apart and together. No one has been written out of the sitcom, though the plot has taken some sudden turns. And we all move into 2008 with hope - hope for a year of continued progress and hope for a year of settling in.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2007/12/tale-of-2007.html", "title": "\nA tale of 2007\n"},

{"date": "Friday, October 15, 2010", "body": "\nThis is just too good to keep to myself. First, a bit of background. It's been a rough couple of days around here. A major storm blew into our area yesterday and the low pressure system that accompanied it wreaked havoc on Bud's system, the way that low pressure systems often do. Coincidentally, Bud had an appointment with the doctor who does his medication management yesterday, so the doctor got to see first-hand the extreme behavior that these kinds of systems can cause. We were able to talk through some strategies regarding the timing and dose of medications when these situations arise. But, today, the storm continued to rage outside my house and inside my boy, and though I had a plan for medication (which was ultimately successful, I think), I knew early this morning that I would not be able to send him to school today. Instead, we had a sort of home-spun homeschool day, just the two of us, for better or worse (and, frankly, we experienced a little bit of both). It's been exhausting - and I imagine it's been twice as hard on Bud as it's been on me. And it's been frightening. When I see extremes in behavior, there is always some small part of me that fears it's a shadow of things to come - that this is not merely a blip on the radar caused by barometric pressure, but is, in fact, an emerging issue. It was right in the middle of the day today that I remembered an e-mail I'd received a couple of days ago. It was titled \"Hope?\" and it was from Sharon, the mom of a young man with Aspergers. She'd attached a video clip and said she was sending it to remind me to never give up because the fight is worth it. I couldn't open the video link on the computer I was using when I'd opened my mail, so I'd saved it in my inbox until I could watch it from home. I clicked the link today, and I \"met\" Sharon and her son Scott. The video was made when he was 21, following a period of about seven years when he was so uncomfortable around people that he rarely left his home. But on the day this video was made, Scott took a risk and left home. He did it, he says, because \"a lot of people have a lot of pre-judgment against autistic people and I'm here to try to break it.\" And break it, he did. It was just what I needed to see today - a day when Bud and I weren't able to leave our house, a day that didn't seem full of hope. But this filled me up. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2010/10/hope-by-factor-of-x.html", "title": "\nHope by a factor of x\n"},

September 11. I wondered how I would write an upbeat, positive post on such a tragic anniversary. To acknowledge the date would be somber; to ignore it, when I have been specifically designated THIS day to post, might seem disrespectful. \n \nAbout a week ago, on a day when the stress of Bud\u2019s transition to a new school year manifested in hard-to-manage behavior at home, it occurred to me that my posting date was fast approaching. I wondered how I would write an upbeat, positive post for Hopeful Parents when I was not feeling like a very hopeful parent. To acknowledge my frustration and self-doubt would be somber; to ignore it would be disrespectful to the mission of this site. \n \nAnd that led me back to thinking about 9/11. \n \nOn that day, when the first plane hit the tower, Bud and I were dancing. We were in a Kindermusik class full of parents and toddlers. We were surrounded by baby laughs and mommy hugs, while hundreds of miles away, inconceivable tragedy was unfolding. \n \nI think about those contrasting images often. \n \nThey are images that, through their contrast, capture my world view. It\u2019s a world view that may have started to develop in  my high school science class , because it seems to have its roots in Newtonian physics: To every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. \n \nIn my own mind, it has become this: The universe seeks balance. \n \nIt\u2019s a theme that plays out consistently in my life. \n \nI look at pictures from Bud\u2019s second birthday party, held four days after September 11, 2001. The faces on the adults are ashen, fixed in still-fresh shock and disbelief. And yet, there we were, gathered with joy, gathered in love, gathered because a two-year-old\u2019s birthday mattered, despite the horror we were all still trying to process. We gathered to meet our grief with an equal and opposite reaction. \n \nI think about Bud\u2019s birth itself \u2013 the birth in which  his twin brother was stillborn . I think about the hours and days that followed \u2013 hours and days of profound sadness, made livable - made powerfully joyful - by the healthy baby boy I held in my arms. Equal and opposite. \n \nI think it\u2019s the way that each of us processes the balance \u2013 the way we frame the moments and events in our lives that stand together in juxtaposition \u2013 that really defines our experience. I could, I suppose, reflect on my life and feel cheated - angry that the sorrow of x diminished the joy of y. Instead, I reflect on my life and feel fortunate - grateful that the joy of y sustained me through the sorrow of x. \n \nSo, I cling to my memories of the earliest moments of 9/11 - those moments in which something was stolen from us that we\u2019ll never reclaim - and I remember the dancing. I remember the joy \u2013 and I believe that the people who were dancing, who were laughing, who were kissing, who were living with compassion and kindness at that first terrible moment of impact, created an equal and opposite force that kept us all moving forward, that allowed us to preserve something that can never be stolen. \n \nIt\u2019s the same world view that keeps me moving forward through Bud\u2019s darkest days of anxiety and aggression \u2013 because as challenging as his behavior can be, as powerless as I can feel in the face of it, I know without question that soon we will experience equal and opposite progress \u2013 equal and opposite joy. \n \nThe universe seeks balance. Better days are coming. And there\u2019s nothing more hopeful than that.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.hopefulparents.org/blog/2010/9/11/on-balance.html", "http://www.science20.com/mom_not_otherwise_specified/physics_parenting_autism_spectrum"], "link": "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2011/09/remembering.html", "title": "\nRemembering\n"},

I am intensely private (which makes exercises like this almost physically painful.) It took me months to talk about my blog to anyone who knows me personally. Since then, several people have said that they've learned more about me in the months they've been reading the blog than they did in years of knowing me. 2. I loathe talking on the telephone. I adore long face-to-face coffee-sipping conversations with friends, but move those same conversations to the telephone and I start to itch. 3. I enjoy reality television. People often seem surprised by this. I must give off some sort of poseur intellectual PBS vibe or something, but give me So You Think You Can Dance any day of the week. 4. When I go out to dinner with a group of people I like to be the last person to order in case someone else orders something that sounds more appealing than what I had in mind. I especially like it when the person right before me orders something that sounds good, so that all I have to say is \"I'll have that, too.\" 5. I have  this thing with words . An additional weird thing about me is that I want everyone I know to feel loved, included and appreciated, and the practice of \"tagging\" particular individuals feels so much like choosing sides in third grade kickball that it ties my stomach in knots and makes me sweat.
