As a parent of a child with special needs, specifically\u00a0Down syndrome, I\u2019m always\u00a0encouraged when I see\u00a0employers hiring people with special needs. Our son Noah is only five years old at the time of this blog post, but as a father I have high hopes that my son will one day be able to use his gifts, talents, experience and passions in a job that allows him to make a contribution to his community. I\u2019ve seen several articles online about companies that hire people with Down syndrome / special needs, but I wasn\u2019t able to locate a master list if you will, so I thought I would put one together. I will continue to add to this list over time as I become of aware of other\u00a0companies / organizations\u00a0that hire people with special needs. Companies That Hire People With Special Needs \n Kroger \n Texadelphia \n Howdy Homemade \n Park Cities Ford \n Minyard Sun Fresh \n Home Depot \n H-E-B \n The Kalahari Resort \n The Chocolate Spectrum \n Hugs Cafe \n Publix \n Target \n Acme \n McDonalds \n Walmart \n Lowes \n Goodwill \n Chick-fil-A \n Sunflower Bakery \n Wegmans \n Furnace Hills Coffee Company \n Delta Sonic Car Wash \n Panera Bread \n Walgreens \n Ikea \n Market Street \n Schnucks \n Stop and Shop \n SuperLo Foods \n Lifetime Fitness \n Puzzles Bakery \n The\u00a0Power Cafe \n Shaws \n Market Basket \n Cameron\u2019s Coffee and Chocolates \n Fazoli\u2019s \n What\u00a0companies have you noticed that hire with\u00a0special needs?

{"date": ",August,24,2015", "body": "Today our four year old boy, who we love dearly, rode the school bus for the first time. The  short  school bus.  The short bus. Four years ago ( before Noah was born ) I would have never\u00a0imagined that we would one day have\u00a0a child that would\u00a0literally\u00a0ride\u00a0the \u201cshort bus.\u201d But the truth is, you never know what curve balls life is going to throw\u00a0you. All you can do is  trust that God is writing a way better story for your life than you ever could , and live\u00a0life to the fullest. Every. Single. Day. That\u2019s what we try to do in the Smith house! The Short Bus Noah started school at our\u00a0local PPCD program (preschool program for children with disabilities) today, which involves him taking the bus to and from the elementary school.\u00a0It was surreal putting\u00a0our little boy on the school bus today. You have to have  a lot  of trust to put your child on a bus with someone you don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s another post for another day. Riding the school bus is part of the experience. It teaches Noah independence. It helps him\u00a0connect with other kids. And is super fun for him.\u00a0But this isn\u2019t any school bus\u2026it\u2019s the \u201cshort bus.\u201dI knew he would be riding\u00a0the short bus when he started to school for some time, but I have to admit I had an odd feeling in my stomach when I actually saw the short bus waiting for him. It wasn\u2019t necessary a bad feeling, just an odd one. I think about all of the jokes people make about \u201cthe short bus\u201d and how that phrase has an entirely new meaning for me now. (I also have a whole new understanding of the \u201c R-Word .\u201d) I don\u2019t want anyone to ever people\u00a0to say things that will\u00a0my hurt my little boy, but it\u2019s going to happen one day, and we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there. One Proud Dad Today, we aren\u2019t thinking about the hurtful things that people may say to him sometime\u00a0in his future. Or bullies. Or meanies. Or whatever. Today we\u2019re thinking about how our son rode\u00a0the short bus\u2026and\u00a0 loved it ! Take a look at the video above and check out these pictures. He had a blast, and I had a ton of joy watching him have a blast! This little boy has hit a ton of  milestones , and today was another huge one. I was so proud today to see him be so independent as he\u00a0rode the bus to and from school. He did so well on the bus, and is really going to enjoy it riding it this year. I love this little boy more than words can say, and I am so proud to be his daddy! By the way, we met Noah after school today before he boarded the bus just so he wouldn\u2019t be scared (he would have been fine even if we didn\u2019t show up\u2026.he loved the bus)\u00a0and I loved how he ran out to give me a hug as soon as school was over. Be sure to watch the end of the video I posted above to see for yourself! Yelp, we have a little boy that rides the short bus\u2026and it\u2019s all good! Here\u2019s to a great school year! If your child started school this week, how did it go? Be sure to post your back to school pictures in the comments below!

{"date": ",September,14,2015", "body": "It\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been almost  three years  since Noah first started to school (and we wrote  our first letter to his teachers )\u2026time really does fly! A lots changed in those three years. Noah has a new little brother. He was grown in leaps and bounds. We moved to a new city.\u00a0And Noah started a new school while we were on the waiting list for the school that he started today. Noah now attends a private Christian school that is 100% inclusive for the entire day (in fact, I believe Noah is the only child with special needs in his class.) At 11:50  the (short) bus comes and picks him up  and takes him to our public school\u2019s PPCD program (which is a program for children with special needs) and then brings him back at 3 pm. He is doing really well and really having a blast learning and interacting with his peers. We are so proud of our little boy. My wife stayed up late last night working on a letter to send to school with Noah today at the private school he\u2019ll be attending, and I\u2019ve attached that\u00a0letter below for anyone that may be interested in reading it. Feel free to share it / pass along. Dear Teachers I would like to take a moment to help introduce you to Noah. First of all we are so excited for him to be a part of your class. We know that he can present some challenges, but I think you will find that he is a welcomed addition to your room. He is able to wrap most teachers around his finger and the kids end up giving lots of hugs by the end of the day. Noah has  down syndrome , which means that he has an extra copy of his 21st chromosome. I don\u2019t know if you have had the pleasure of knowing someone with Down syndrome, so I hope that you don\u2019t mind if I tell you a little bit about what the means. Noah has certain  characteristics which are common for children who have Down syndrome  including upslanted eyes, low set ears, and being smaller than you would expect for someone his age. He also has hypotonia which means that he feels floppy. This however doesn\u2019t mean that he is weak. He has developmental delays as well. His biggest battle right now is learning to talk. He has a lot to say but it is difficult to decipher. He knows several signs and has a growing vocabulary. He has difficulty putting words together in a sentence but is very good at \u201cI want\u201d. He works with a speech therapist and occupational therapist weekly. He will not be present on most Wednesdays because we will be at therapy. He attends the preschool program for children with disabilities at [a local\u00a0elementary]\u00a0in the afternoons. The  bus will pick him up and drop him off . He seems to really enjoy it, with his favorite part being the bus. When he started this program, it caused him to start skipping his nap. While he can survive without a nap, we did notice that he was a bit more sensitive to his friends and if frustrated would act out against them with pushing or biting. I think he was trying to communicate that he was tired. It is something to just be aware of when he returns in the afternoon. He does really well in a group setting. He will mimic the behaviors of others and usually wants to do what his friends are doing. He is quite stubborn but understands choices. If you give him two options he will usually choose one. Distraction works for him as well. As mentioned he can be quite stubborn initially but with patience he will usually start doing what is being requested of him even it involves just sitting quietly with him for a moment. We understand more than anyone how easy it is to cave and let him do what he wants, however we hope you expect of him what you would expect of other children. His difficulty with language makes you think of him as much younger and that he doesn\u2019t understand, however he understands the majority of what is said to him. If he does something he shouldn\u2019t he will say I am sorry. He also knows thank you and please. It is hard to know exactly what he understands when it comes to his letters, colors and shapes. He can match them easily, but he will not say them when asked. He will repeat what you say, but will not say them spontaneously on his own. He has difficulty with fine motor skills so has only recently started drawing circles. He works on these tasks with his occupational therapist. If you help him hold his pencil/pen he can do a much better job of tracing and writing letters, but  on his own is just starting to be able to do this. He is also just starting to work on using scissors which is a difficult task for his hands. Repetition is very helpful for him. When it comes to songs, if you are a bit patient and slow it down he will try his best to keep up and do the hand movements and what not. One challenge for us is potty training. He will go on the potty, however he has a hard time realizing that he needs to go. He does pretty good with a schedule. He however has come to enjoy putting his clothes in the toilet, so you will want to keep an eye on him. He finds it fun to change clothes, so he knows that if they are wet he gets to do that. While if his clothes are soaking, we understand changing, but feel free to leave him a little bit wet so he doesn\u2019t keep doing it. We will start in pull ups here but we have a stockpile of underwear ready. Down syndrome is only part of our son and we hope you get to know other parts of him as well. He loves books, trains and cars. He is a big fan of Buzz Lightyear right now and has always loved Mickey Mouse. He knows all the parts of Mary Poppins and Frozen. He loves to give hugs and has a contagious smile and laugh. Our view can be reflected in the way that we talk in that he is a child with Down syndrome and not a Down\u2019s child. We refer to a child without delays as typical rather than normal. We are happy to answer any questions you may have and are here to assist him in any way you think is needed. I hope these tips about him help you understand him a bit better. We again are so thankful that he gets to be a part of this classroom and are excited to see how he grows.

{"date": ",June,7,2016", "body": "A friend of mine  sent me  an article  today about a year long clinical study that \u201cshowed a\u00a0chemical in green tea seems to improve memory, speaking and behavior\u00a0in people with Down syndrome.\u201d The article goes on to say that \u201cbrain scans revealed that the compound, called epigallocatechin gallate, altered the way brain cells connect with one another\u201d and \u201cWe hypothesised that administration of a green tea extract containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) would improve the effects of non-pharmacological cognitive rehabilitation in young adults with Down\u2019s syndrome I\u2019m not a fan of organizations that try\u00a0to \u201ccure\u201d Down Syndrome ( as I\u2019ve mentioned before Noah\u2019s life is a huge blessing to us)  but I am however a fan of studies that could possibly help children like Noah\u00a0reach their full potential. I\u2019m also not a fan of\u00a0putting children on a lot of unnecessary\u00a0medications (Noah takes no medications or supplements) especially ones that we aren\u2019t sure what they actually do or what the side effects are. What is an encouraging (and exciting) about this study is we aren\u2019t talking about a medication, rather something natural, green tea. We aren\u2019t talking about \u201chealing\u201d children with Down syndrome, rather helping increase their cognitive abilities in a natural way. That to me is something at least worthy of exploring more. I\u2019m not ready to give Noah gallons\u00a0of green tea ( although green tea has lots of health benefits ) and as the article says these findings\u00a0will require further validation, but this is still an exciting development, and one I\u2019ll be paying attention to.\u00a0 You can read the full text of the research study here , and  the article I reference here .

{"date": ",May,31,2016", "body": "I was recently contacted to share our story about how we are using technology to make an impact in the world as part of AT&T\u2019s \u201cBeyond Limits\u201d campaign. The Beyond Limits campaign \u201c celebrates the victories of some incredible individuals with disabilities who are pushing the limits of what they \u201cshould\u201d be able to do, and proving it with AT&T\u2019s technology .\u201d  If you check out the Beyond Limits website , you\u2019ll see various ways that technology is truly helping people reach their full potential. Although Noah isn\u2019t in a wheelchair, without any of his limbs, or in need of hearing aids \u2013 technology has been a huge part of helping us make an impact and (hopefully) help change the world. If you\u2019re reading this blog post you\u2019re a perfect example of that! I thought I\u2019d take a few (hundred) words to share with you how we use technology to change the world. Be sure to hit play on the video below to learn a bit more about how we\u2019re using technology to make an impact! Why Stories Matter When Noah was born  we found out that, sadly,  a mother\u2019s womb is the most dangerous place for a child with Down syndrome . We wanted to change that.  We knew that stories have a lot of power , but only if they are shared. Stories also have the power to take away the unknown, and when you take away the unknown you take away some of the fear, and when you take away fear people can step forward in courage. So we decided to tell our story, but not with a pen and a pad, rather 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s. 3 Ways We Use Technology To Share Our Story 1. We set up a blog as a home base One of the very things we knew we wanted to do was find a place to tell our story, a place where we could document his life and let people in. The easiest way to do this was to set up a blog. We created this site and the idea was to post a short video of his life every day. That quickly became easier said than done! However we have documented  a lot of his milestones \u00a0and have shared his story along\u00a0the way. We\u2019ve fallen behind, but hope to get back to posting on a more regular basis. 2. Use Our iPhones To Take And Share Pictures And Videos On Social Media If you follow us on  Facebook  or  Instagram  you know that we post there on a much more regular basis than our blog. It\u2019s so easy to pull the phone out, snap a picture or video, and upload it to one of the social networks. What\u2019s great about this is we\u2019re able to connect with our families as they leave comments, send messages, and even share their own pictures in the comments. The power of social media is really incredible as we are able to connect with thousands of people from around the globe every day! 3. Use Our iPhone and Facebook to Interact With People In Real Time Live streaming as something that is becoming more and more popular, and something that we really enjoying doing. For about a year we\u2019ve been able to pull our phone out and use Facebook live or Periscope and let people in to our world. What I really enjoy about live streaming is it\u2019s real time. We\u2019re able\u00a0to answer questions and respond to people as they leave comments. Just this weekend we were on vacation and were able to live steam the \u201cDuck Race\u201d there are boys were a part of. I\u2019m excited to see how live stream evolves and grows! How Do Use Technology?  We truly live in an amazing time in the history of the world. Many of us carry a worldwide platform in our pockets, and at any given time you can capture moments and tell your story! But you may also use technology to help walk, run, learn to talk, hear, or in a number of other awesome ways. AT&T wants to hear from you (and give you a chance to visit the U.S. Olympic training center! By the way, we\u2019ve been there before\u00a0and it\u2019s a lot of fun!)  Check out their site where you can create a video, share your story, and enter to win a trip to visit the U.S. Olympic Training Center! Be sure to leave a comment below letting us know how you use technology to share your story, or do awesome things!

{"date": ",August,21,2016", "body": "Noah, wow! I can\u2019t believe you start your first day of elementary school tomorrow. I just finished putting you to bed and wanted to share a few things with you before your big day. First, you need to know I\u2019m a little scared. It takes a lot of trust in other people (and God) to let other people be responsible for you all day. Sure you\u2019ve been in preschool before, but this is different. This is a big elementary school! At dinner tonight I thought about how the playground at your new school isn\u2019t fenced in all the way, and you like to run away sometimes. I worry about the teacher not paying attention and you\u00a0running to the street and getting hit by a car, or kidnapped. I worry about other kids making fun of you, or wondering why you\u2019re still in diapers, or can\u2019t talk as well as they probably can (yet!) I worry about you needing help with your lunch box, or name tag, or backpack, or shoes, or a million other things. I wonder if you\u2019re ready for this. You are. I\u2019ve seen you cross so many  milestones . I remember  the moment you were born . I remember\u00a0 bringing\u00a0you home from the hospital for the first time . The remember  all of those physical therapy sessions on the treadmill to help you learn to walk . I remember when you  sat up for the first time . I remember when you  pulled yourself up for the first time . When you  crawled for the first time . When you  took your first steps , and countless other milestones. Tomorrow is just another one of those milestones for you, and it\u2019s a big one. I love you so much. So much. And I\u2019m\u00a0so proud to be your dad, more than you will probably ever know. I wouldn\u2019t change one chromosome\u00a0about you. From the second I lied eyes on you\u00a0at the hospital I\u2019ve been your biggest fan (your mom is a close 2nd\u2026!) You\u2019ve crushed so many of your milestones, you\u2019ve worked as hard as any little boy I\u2019ve ever know, and I know you will do well as you start kindergarten! As you start the first day of what will be a long journey of your education I want to share a few thoughts with you. These thoughts not only apply for\u00a0tomorrow, but for the rest of your life. \n You were created by God, in the Image of God, to do amazing things! Genesis 1:27 says that God made all people (including you) in His image. Psalm 139:13 says that God knitted you in your mother\u2019s womb. And Ephesians 2:10 says that God created\u00a0you to do good works! These are some of the most\u00a0important things I can tell you. You were made specifically by the God of the universe and He loves and cares for you greatly. If you forget everything else, remember this.  God loves you greatly, son. \n God is control. Nothing in this world is a surprise to God. He runs the show, and He runs it well. Even when things happen in life that we don\u2019t understand (and the odds are they will) He understands. God doesn\u2019t tell us we will always understand everything, but He does tell us to trust Him in everything that happens. This is a lesson that you\u2019ll have to learn over the course of your life, but trust me son, You can trust God. He knows what He\u2019s doing. \n Your parents love you greatly. We aren\u2019t perfect parents by any means, but man, oh man, do we love you. We\u2019re crazy about you. \n People can be mean. Don\u2019t let this surprise you. And as much as you can, don\u2019t let it bother you. This is really hard to do, especially when your young. But you\u2019ve got to learn to shake the haters off, and there will be haters. \n Extend grace to people as much as you can. People are probably going to say things they don\u2019t mean. People are probably going to make comments because they\u2019ve never meet anyone with Down syndrome before. Some of these comments may be mean, some of them may be made out of ignorance. As hard as it can be, try to give people mountains and mountain of grace. (Even the mean people.) \n A lot of people have never met anyone with Down syndrome. You look different to others who do not have Down syndrome. You sound different than others you don\u2019t have Down syndrome.\u00a0It\u2019s ok. You\u00a0need to let people know it\u2019s okay to ask questions. Let people know they don\u2019t have to walk on egg shells around you. Give them the freedom to talk with you about Down syndrome. People can be afraid of what they don\u2019t know, so help them to get to know you. (This will be hard to do tomorrow since you\u2019re only in kindergarten, but I wanted to put this one on the list.) \n God has given you a personality that gives others joy. I love watching you give high-fives to others, or sing, or  dance . You\u2019re a fun little boy. I love the joy that you have. When people get around you, you help bring out their joy. That\u2019s awesome. Keep doing that! \n Your mom and dad worry about you\u2026your dad way more than your mom! \ud83d\ude42 You\u2019re our  little  boy, and so we worry about you. We worry about how other people will treat you. Or you doing something that you don\u2019t know what your\u00a0doing is unsafe (like running to the street when no one is watching.) We have to keep going back to number 2 on this list and remembering that God is in control and we can trust Him. He loves you even more than we do, and we trust Him. (But know, we\u2019re still going to worry.) \n I\u2019m proud of you. Like crazy, over the top, can\u2019t even put it in words, proud. \n You have to keep your shoes on in school. Please. \n God is in control. He loves you. And you can trust Him. \n I\u2019m only a phone call away. Seriously, if you want to come home, call me! I know, I probably shouldn\u2019t say this, but I am. And I mean it. \ud83d\ude42 \n I\u2019m going to be eating a lot of lunches with you. Get ready. (I also hope you\u2019ll let me do that when it\u2019s not so cool to have your dad come eat lunch with you.) \n Oh, and you rocked those Chuck Taylor\u2019s today! \n I\u2019m sure I\u00a0could think of many other things to share with you, but these are some of the biggies. I love you son. A lot. I have this strange mix of fear, excitement, and love going on inside me right now, but I can sleep well tonight knowing that God holds the whole world in His hands, and that includes you. I can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds for you. You\u2019re a special kid, Noah, and not just because you were born with Down syndrome. I know that God created you to do something amazing with your life, and I\u2019m thankful I have a front row seat to watch it all unfold. Sleep well tonight \u201clittle\u201d man. You\u2019ve got a big day tomorrow. (And so do I.)

{"date": ",June,28,2011", "body": "Today  Noah  and I decided to  play  around with some green fabric and Final Cut Pro X. Considering this was my fist time using key frames, I thought the video ended up pretty cool. I especially like the way the Motion background tuned out. One thing I really like about FCPX is how well it keyed out the green screen. I seriously just put the green fabric over a book shelf in our dining room and shot. It wasn\u2019t evenly light, nor was it \u201ctight\u201d (there were tons of wrinkles in the material), but FCPX didn\u2019t seem to mind at all. Making these daily videos has given me an excuse to dust off the old video editing skills from my Adobe Premier days. It\u2019s been fun making them. I\u2019m also investing some time this summer learning Apple Motion, which I\u2019ve wanted to learn for some time. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see the  fruit  of my work in upcoming videos.

{"date": ",April,3,2016", "body": "I recently announced that I\u2019m going to be running the 2016 TCS New York City Marathon \u00a0(Sunday November 6th) to help raise awareness ( and funds ) for some great  Down syndrome research . \u00a0 You can  learn more about it here , but I thought it would be fun (and maybe helpful for some) if I chronicled my journey to\u00a0the NYC marathon,\u00a0outlining my experience and training plan. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to post a blog every week, but I\u2019m going to try! Also I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to blog about my marathon training on this website since the\u00a0goal of this blog is to tell Noah\u2019s story. However, since I\u2019m hoping to raise awareness and funds for Down syndrome research (which will ultimately affect his story) I decided to go ahead and go for it. Not to mention, I hope to run a race with Noah at some point! So here we go with week number 1. Week 1 Pre-Training Since this is my first time to attempt to run a marathon, I thought it would be a good idea to sign up for a marathon training program. (I have used the Nike Training App to train for both a 5K and a 10k and think I could have also used it to train for this marathon. However, I thought it would be more fun to have a community of people to run with, especially toward the end of the training program when it gets time for the\u00a0really long runs. This is just one of several reasons I decided to sign up for a group training program.) The marathon training program \u00a0I signed up for doesn\u2019t start until May 14th, so I am calling the next few weeks a \u201cpre training\u201d program. I\u2019m actually thinking about running a 5K towards\u00a0the end of May that a friend was telling me about so I set up an advanced 5k training program in the Nike Running App and am going to be using that between now and May 14th. I like the structure of a running program, I feel like it helps keep me on track. New Running Gear Almost all of my shoes are Nike. I like they look and feel. However I decided to go into a local running store to have them take a look at the way I run and perhaps make a suggestion on some running shoes that were specific to my running style. I was informed I\u00a0pronate as well as have high arches so they suggested some running shoes with more stability. After trying on a few pairs I went with the  Saucony Guide 9s . tank top This Week\u2019s Training As I mentioned I am using a plan in the\u00a0Nike Training App until my official marathon training program begins. Throughout my training I want to share all of the details. My mileage, my times, etc. I\u2019m not trying to beat a record, I\u2019m just trying to make it to the finish line, so you\u2019ll see that as I share my stats. Also by sharing my stats and\u00a0story from now until the race in November we can monitor my progress together between now and the race. It will be fun to come back to this blog post in November\u00a0and see how my times have (hopefully) gotten better. \n Monday 4.01 Miles. 9\u201956\u201d per mile \n Tuesday I did a class at  OrangeTheory  (which I really like) a got in 2.92 miles on the treadmill at 10\u201912\u201d per mile. \n Wednesday \u2013 Rest Day \n Thursday \u2013 4.01 Miles. \u00a010\u201917\u201d per mile \n Friday \u2013 Rest Day \n Saturday (long run) \u2013 6.01 miles. 11\u201902\u2019 per mile. \n Total miles \u2013 17 \n For those of you not familiar with long running, each\u00a0week (for the most part) I\u2019ll be adding a mile or so on to my long run with the hopes of getting close to 26 miles sometime near November. you can do so here.

{"date": ",March,30,2016", "body": "Spoiler Alert \u2013 I\u2019m running the 2016 NYC Marathon! Please take a few minutes to watch the short video below to find out why running this race could possibly help all people with Down syndrome, and how you can help me do something awesome!\u00a0If you aren\u2019t interested in reading the back story of why I\u2019m running the NYC marathon and what LuMind Research Down Syndrome does, and would just like to make a donation,  you may do some by clicking here . (Although I hope you will take time to read through this blog post. Thanks!) Why Am I Running The 2016 NYC Marathon? A little back story \u2013 In 2014 I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes and fatty liver disease as a result of\u00a0not eating well (I really enjoyed drinking ice-cold\u00a0Coca\u00a0Cola\u2019s from\u00a0McDonalds and old fashioned donuts from Starbucks)\u00a0and not exercising \u2013 not to mention I was overweight (I was over 200 pounds!). I started\u00a0walking and running to add some activity to my life, and eventually signed\u00a0up for a 5K, started a Nike Training program and finished the 5K. \u00a0I lost weight, felt better, enjoyed running the race with my wife, and felt a sense of accomplishment. (By the way, if you think you could never run a race please leave a comment below, I\u2019d love to give you some tips and encouragement!) I\u2019ve experienced a lot of benefits from running and since that 5K I\u2019ve learned that signing up for a race helps me to stay consistent\u00a0with my running, and a structured training plan helps me to stay focused.\u00a0I recently ran a 10K and as I was nearning\u00a0the end of my training I was curious how someone signed up to the run\u00a0the NYC marathon. I also thought it would be a cool personal accomplishment to run a marathon \u2013 especially the NYC marathon since NYC is one of my favorite places in\u00a0the world to visit. So I googled it. And I read the website. And I realized you had to qualify to enter the race. (That wasn\u2019t going to happen.) Or you could enter the lottery. (The lottery was already over.) Or you could run as a part of a charity team and get a guaranteed entry! So I started looking at the list of charities. As I looked through the list of charities I came across  LuMind Research Down Syndrome , an\u00a0organization that helps raise funds for Down Syndrome research (more on LuMind RDS below) so\u00a0I sent them an email asking about their organization and about running the race. Fast forward a few days and I was signed up to be a part of their running team and the 2016 NYC marathon! What Is LuMind Research Down Syndrome? Of all of the various charity teams listed\u00a0 LuMind RDS  stood out to me for 1. The fact that  we have a son with Down Syndrome , and 2.  Their mission and vision ! The mission of LuMind Research Down Syndrome Foundation is to stimulate biomedical research that will accelerate the development of treatments to significantly improve cognition, including memory, learning and speech, for individuals with Down syndrome so they: \n \u2022 participate more successfully in school and employment, \n\u2022 lead more active and independent lives, and \n\u2022 avoid the early cognitive decline with aging and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. \n VISION: Not a Cure, but Treatments to Improve Memory, Learning, Speech, and Ultimately Independence As a parent of child with Down syndrome I really like that they say they aren\u2019t trying to \u201ccure\u201d Down syndrome, rather help stimulate research that will help our kids lead active and independent lives and  help avoid the early cognitive decline with aging and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease!  (This last part is something I\u2019d especially like to see happen!!!) LuMind RDS helps fund research studies at some great\u00a0universities. Here are a few: \n Johns Hopkins University \n Stanford School of Medicine \n Emory University \n How You Can Help Me Help People With Down Syndrome In addition to  just  running a marathon in November I hope to help people with Down syndrome by raising awareness (and funds) for LuMind (and ultimately Down syndrome research) that will help kids like our little boy, Noah. I\u2019d love for you help me do this as well. Here\u2019s a few ways you can! \n Pray \u2013\u00a0 I\u2019ve mentioned before that  a mother\u2019s womb is the most dangerous place in the world for a child with Down syndrome  and no matter how much awareness and funds we raise it\u2019s all futile unless we pray and ask the Lord to change the hearts of our country.\u00a0That hearts would change and\u00a0see that humans have value not because of anything they can (or can\u2019t) do but simply\u00a0because they are made in the image of God. Pray also for research studies ( like the ones LuMind helps funds ) and wisdom for the folks working to help kids like our son reach their full potential. Pray especially that we would see an end to both abortion and Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u00a0in our lifetime. \n Give  \u2013 All of the research that is being done requires significant\u00a0funds, and so I hope you will help me  help this great organization by making a donation ! When I signed up to be a part of the running team for LuMind I committed to raise 2,500 dollars. At the time of this blog post (only about a week after I signed up for the race!) we\u2019ve already been able to raise over 3,400 dollars!!! I\u2019m blown away by the generosity of our friends both in the \u201creal world\u201d and all of the ones we\u2019ve made who follow our blog,  Facebook , and  Twitter  account. Thank you so much! I would love to triple the goal I committed to, and I need your help.  You can click here to make a donation , and please know any amount goes a long way! I hope you will consider making a donation that\u00a0will go to help fund research studies\u00a0that aim\u00a0to make life even more awesome for people with Down syndrome! \n Share  \u2013 At the top of this blog post you\u2019ll find some social media share buttons. I hope you will click on some of them and share this blog post on your Facebook news feed, Twitter account, or email to friends. The more people we have that know about LuMind and will Pray, Donate, and Share the better! \n Thanks for taking the time to read this post. I\u2019d encourage you to take a few minutes to check out this great infographic that\u00a0LuMind put together.\u00a0This is my very first marathon and just the thought of being in a 26.2 mile race, let alone finishing it sounds crazy! I plan on posting a weekly blog post sharing my experience in training for a marathon and I hope it encourages some of you to run one as well (if you haven\u2019t already.) Have you ran a marathon before? If so please comment below and let me know how it was and if you have any training tips for me! I hope you\u2019ll help me continue\u00a0to increase awareness (and financial resources) to this great organization! Let\u2019s do this! Oh and by the way, I\u2019m going to work on putting together a meet up the weekend of the race for anyone who wants to come \u2013 so if you\u2019d like to come to NYC and cheer me on (and meet Noah and the rest of the family) let me know.\u00a0And if you\u2019d like to stay connected as I share our story please enter your email in the box below.

{"date": ",February,1,2016", "body": "Before this blog was started I wrote about our journey on my personal website (I\u2019ve since have closed that site down, and have focused my blogging efforts here.) If you\u2019ve read  Noah\u2019s birth story  you know we had no idea Noah was born with Down syndrome until several hours after his birth. As we were thinking about ways to tell our friends we decided the easiest thing to do was to write a blog post that we would email out / post on social media..vs calling each one of them. (We did call our closest friends and family, this is just how we let the \u201cmasses\u201d know. Below I decided to post a copy of that blog post for anyone who may be interested. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Spoiler Alert: Our Son Was Born With Down Syndrome (Dec 16, 2010) (Sorry for the spoiler, but if you\u2019re anything like me, this much text can be overwhelming!) Wow. There are no words that can describe the rush of emotions that Abbie and I have experienced in the last 24 hours. We were told on Tuesday that Abbie would be induced at 7 am on Wednesday. We came into the hospital and waited for Noah (our son) to arrive. After almost 12 hours of labor, the doctor decided to perform a C-section on Abbie. (This was not an emergency C-section, and I was allowed to be in the delivery room; behind the curtain, of course). Shortly after, Noah David Smith, was born! We were so happy, excited, thrilled, and all of the rest. Around ten pm, last night, we were informed that Noah was born with Down syndrome. We didn\u2019t see this one coming, and as you can imagine we had even more emotions. (Fear, disappointment, worry, but mixed with the same joy, and excitement that we already had). Noah was able to spend the night in our room, and today we were told that Noah\u2019s heart had an Atrial Sepal Defect (my wife is a Doctor, but for the non-medical people out there, like me, it means that Noah has a small hole in his heart, and that one of the connections is still open as well.) Our cardiologist told us\u00a0that this wasn\u2019t considered \u201cmajor\u201d, and that it could have been much more serious, and in fact may heal itself without surgery. (We are praying that is what happens!) We are waiting for him to take his first \u201cpoop.\u201d He hasn\u2019t yet, we really need him to soon to confirm he doesn\u2019t have any medical issues with that. So PLEASE be praying for that! Noah then passed his hearing screening at 100% in both ears! (Which is great because he has a dad who really enjoys talking!) If you are anything like Abbie, and I you may be at a loss of what to say (we certainly are), or not sure how to respond to us. We are hurting, happy, and confused all at the same time; and are just as confused as you may be. We wanted to just say a few things that we hope would make things more comfortable for everyone. \n We are ok. Seriously. We are extremely happy, and any fear we have is quickly overshadowed by the deep love we have for Noah! So if you were wondering if you should still get us a \u201cCongratulations\u201d card you most certainly may! This is a time to celebrate, not morn. Trust us \u2013 Noah is very, VERY much alive. (You really have to see the little guy, he is full of energy!) \n Please feel free to talk to us about any of this. We are VERY much open to talk about anything we are feeling, so please don\u2019t feel as if you have to avoid the subject around us. You don\u2019t. Feel free to ask anything. Seriously. We mean this. \n Be prepared to see us cry. Seriously we can cry at the drop of the hat. There are just so many emotions going through our hearts right now, but we can also stop crying just as just as quickly as we started. Don\u2019t feel bad, or awkward, really. Just tell us a good joke or something! \u263a \n Yes, you can hold Noah. (Unless you\u2019re a twitter stranger, or cyber stalker). Noah is not broken. He LOVES people, and likes to be held like any other baby. You can touch him, hold him, play with him, and kiss him, everything you would do with any other baby. Down Syndrome is not contiguous, so you don\u2019t have to worry about catching it! \n Keep being our friend, praying for us, and reminding us that God knows what He is doing. Seriously. We really need you guys. More than ever! So every text, phone call, or visit counts! Also, if you are someone who prays, pray for us as often as you remember! We are in a bit of shock about all of this, and really need the Lords comfort. We believe that God is in control of everything, and it is an honor when people pray to God on our behalf. (Oh, and we love hugs!) \u263a \n If you know me at all, then you know I\u2019m very easy-going. I think having a sense of humor is important in everything that we do. So what I\u2019m about to say is my attempt to have some humor with one of the most awkward things about all of this \u2013 what do you say to us? The answer \u2013 whatever you want. However I will caution you that we fully know that Noah is \u201cSpecial;\u201d that we are \u201cblessed;\u201d and \u201cthat things are going to be challenging, but we can do it!\u201d \n I sometimes say these things as sort of\u201dfiller\u201d because I\u2019m not sure what else is appropriate to say. You don\u2019t have to. I am giving you permission to have some fun with us! Let me give you three alternative phrases to give you some more creative ideas; 1.) Wow \u2013 I bet you guys didn\u2019t see this one coming. 2.) Hey did you know Sarah Palin has a baby named Trig that has Down Syndrome? I wonder where she got the name Trig? 3.) Wow \u2013 your baby has fat cheeks! 4.) Merry Christmas! Of course, you can say we are blessed, and he is special to. We just want you to know that you don\u2019t have to watch your words, or feel like you are walking on eggshells around us. You aren\u2019t. Ok, that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got for now. If I think of more, I\u2019ll add them later. We just wanted you all to know you don\u2019t have to walk on eggshells around us, or Noah. We really are ok. We really trust God. We really are excited. We really are nervous. We really love Noah. And we really like Chick-Fli-a. Thanks for your friendship, and support as start on this new journey in our life! Psalm 139: 13-18 -Rick, Abbie, and Noah \u201cFor you created my inmost being; \u2028 you knit me together in my mother\u2019s womb. \u202814 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; \u2028 your works are wonderful, \u2028 I know that full well. \u202815 My frame was not hidden from you \u2028 when I was made in the secret place, \u2028 when I was woven together in the depths of the earth. \u202816 Your eyes saw my unformed body; \u2028 all the days ordained for me were written in your book \u2028 before one of them came to be. \u202817 How precious to me are your thoughts, O\u2019 God! \u2028 How vast is the sum of them! \u202818 Were I to count them, \u2028 they would outnumber the grains of sand\u2014 \u2028 when I awake, I am still with you.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/how-we-told-our-friends-our-child-has-down-syndrome/", "title": "How We Told Our Friends Our Child Was Born With Down Syndrome"},

I shared the video of Noah having a blast watching the band rehearse\u00a0on  our Facebook page  (which you can see below) and I was surprised when I got an email from the Longhorn Band\u00a0Director shortly after saying he had seen the video and inviting Noah (and our family)\u00a0to come down and watch the band in person! A Very Special Thanksgiving It turned out the only University of Texas home game left for the year was\u00a0the Thanksgiving game, and since we were planning on having a low key Thanksgiving at home this year, we decided to take them up on their offer\u00a0and have Thanksgiving in Austin!

He loved it, and so did they. I was really impressed (and grateful) for how kind\u00a0these college students were to our children, especially Noah. Needless to say, Noah get his highfives! I think you can tell from the pictures and videos we had a blast hanging out with the Longhorn\u00a0band for Thanksgiving.

We have a test that can find this out for you early if you\u2019d like to know .\u201d This question sounds\u00a0very innocent. Of course we\u2019d like to know if we\u2019re having a boy or girl before the 18-20 week sonogram. But the truth\u00a0is, the tests are looking for much more than the sex of a person\u2019s child \u2013 they are looking for \u201c chromosomal abnormalities\u201d  which in\u00a0turn  cause many people to abort their child  \u2013 this is heart breaking. I wrote about how  a mother\u2019s womb is the most dangerous place for a child with Down syndrome , that is also heart breaking. A place that is supposed to be a safe, protective place for children, turns in to an unsafe place simply because they have a different number of chromosomes. That hurts my heart. All of that to say, I personally don\u2019t want any part of any sort of parental testing. We did not do any testing when Abbie\u00a0was  pregnant\u00a0with Noah , or  Jaxten , or with this baby. This is not to knock anyone who does them, I think it\u2019s a matter of conscience. At some point I\u2019ll write a blog post talking about how I just don\u2019t think they are helpful ( the tests aren\u2019t accurate, and can cause unnecessary anxiety , for one.) If you\u2019re really taking these tests truly to find the sex of your child, go for it- but you just\u00a0need to be aware that the doctors main goal with these tests aren\u2019t to help you determine the sex \u2013 they are\u00a0to help you make \u201c a choice .\u201d We super excited to find out the sex of this baby in about 10 more weeks and even more excited to see this baby towards the end of October. Our 10 year wedding anniversary\u00a0is on Oct 27th, so this is quite the anniversary present! \ud83d\ude42 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://amzn.to/2o2jJ5F", "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/prenatal-tests-have-high-failure-rate-triggering-abortions-n267301", "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/prenatal-tests-have-high-failure-rate-triggering-abortions-n267301"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/big-big-brother/", "title": "Ice, Ice, (We\u2019re Having a) Baby!"},
{"date": ",January,18,2016", "body": "Last week\u2019s in Noah\u2019s class his teachers wrote out a dream they had for each student. As you can see below their dream for Noah is that he would continue and learn. In other words, that he would never give up, and would keep moving forward in life. My wife and I both\u00a0thought that was a kind gesture on their part and we\u2019re thankful for the role they play in his life. It also made me think about some of the dreams that I have\u00a0for Noah, and for every person on this planet\u00a0with Down syndrome. One of the first \u201cdreams\u201d in Dr. King\u2019s famous speech is I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\u201d My wife and I think Dr. King certainly would have included people with  special needs\u00a0 in his dream, and we appreciate all of the work he did to promote  equality  for all people.\u00a0Since\u00a0today is Martin Luther King Jr day I wanted to share a few of the\u00a0dreams I have for my son (and others like him.) I Have A Dream..For Everyone With Down Syndrome I have a dream that our world would come to value all human life. From the moment of conception to the moment of natural death. I have a dream that all babies known to have Down syndrome in the womb will be brought to full term. That all Doctors, everywhere,\u00a0will deliver a Down syndrome diagnosis  the right way . I have a dream that mommies and daddies everywhere will let truth trump fear and give their little children the right to life that they all deserve. I have a dream that all educators will do all they\u00a0can to help children with Down syndrome grow, develop, and reach their full potential. That they will take time to listen to parents, and explain any concerns they have. That they will understand the unique ability of every child, realizing that they want to be included, loved, and encouraged just like any other. I have a dream that as a child with Down syndrome grows into his teenage years that they will\u00a0grow up being accepted and invited in by their peers. That they wouldn\u2019t be looked at as someone who is \u201cdifferent\u201d but accepted as someone who is unique, like every other people on the planet. I have a dream that as a teenager with Down syndrome grows into his adult years they\u00a0will be given\u00a0responsibilities\u00a0and allowed them to make meaningful\u00a0contributions to their families, churches, communities, and jobs. That people would\u2019t stare at them or be afraid of because of what they don\u2019t know, but that they would ask questions and get to know them. That they would make and develop friendships and be welcomed by others. I have a dream that people wouldn\u2019t like at people with Down syndrome and\u00a0think about all the things they think they can\u2019t do. Instead they would look at them and understand the sky\u2019s the limit for them, and parents (like my wife and I) find great hope in that. I have a dream that medical research would continue to grow and that we would find cures for diseases like\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, and congenital heart defects. I have a dream that our society would value ever person on this planet, not because of what they look like or what sort of contribution they can make, but simply because they are a human being. Most of all I have a dream that\u00a0every person\u00a0with Down syndrome would come to know and understand that they were fearfully and wonderfully made in the very image of God, and that God has a plan and purpose for their life. They are loved by the King of Kings. And my dream (and prayer) is that they would come to know the God who created them through a relationship with Jesus Christ. This is my dream and my prayer, what dreams do you have for your child?

{"date": ",June,29,2011", "body": "Today was a  big  day for Noah!  At his  physical therapy  appointment he  sat up  on his own for the first time ever!!!  Granted it wasn\u2019t long (about five seconds) but he did it!  Yeah\u2026!!! This kid works harder then most adults I know; between his  physical ,  occupational , and  speech therapy  appointments, he never stops.  However, God has really used all of these therapies  to help him get stronger. Children born with  Down Syndrome  have hypotonia, which is basically low muscle tone.  This is why it\u2019s very important for them to start early intervention as soon as possible in order to maximize their growth and development.  I must say we have been very happy with Noah\u2019s progress since starting  Our Children\u2019s House At Baylor  at  three weeks old!  Noah will be seven months old on the 15th of this month, and he has been working s0 hard at all of these appointments pretty much his entire life!  But it isn\u2019t just Noah\u2026we too have been going to what seems like endless appointments since Noah was  born \u2026but it\u2019s ok!  However, I can\u2019t explain how it feels when a day like today happens, and you see all of your sons hard work pay off!  He sat up on his own for about five seconds\u2026but let me tell you, those five seconds were priceless to us!  What a cool feeling is was to see this little guy sit all on his own after months of us having to hold him up! It\u2019s the little things (like five seconds of your kid sitting up) that really mater. Later that night Noah got to have his first ever squash!  As you can see (and hear) in the video, this kid really enjoys squash (and  peas , and  bananas !) He is doing so well eating from a spoon\u2026.it\u2019s so fun to watch! Tomorrow (actually later on today) we have a weight check at Noah\u2019s pediatrician. The last time we saw her for his  six month  visit he hadn\u2019t gained any weigh so we upped his feedings, and are praying for a weight gain at today\u2019s visit. -Rick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.baylorhealth.com/PhysiciansLocations/OCH/Pages/Default.aspx"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/sitting/", "title": "Sitting And Squash \u2013 A Big Day For Noah!"},

{"date": ",July,30,2011", "body": "Occupational therapy  is needed to develop  fine motor skills . The first step of this is actually sight and tracking. It also involves hand movements such as clapping and grabbing objects that hang over head as well as sensory integration. Eventually it will include activities of daily living like putting on clothes, brushing teeth, and holding a pencil. Developmental Delays For Children Born With Down Syndrome I am currently studying for my pediatric boards and learning quite a bit about development. If there is a delay in visual development it is followed by a delay in gross and fine motor development. We saw this with Noah as it took him awhile to track us. Once he was doing that his motivation increased significantly and his motor skills improved. Many Different Therapies, But One Great Goal! Children born with Down syndrome  are often involved in many different types of therapies, that involve many different techniques. The important thing to keep in mind is that they are all meant to achieve one great goal \u2013 to help your child become everything that God created him or her to be! All of the  therapies  are connected. Fine motor helps with gross motor which can help with speech. We had such difficulty feeding Noah because his gross motor skills and stability in his  core  needed help. He was wobbly and constantly shifting around to the point where even our speech therapist thought that Noah was one of her more difficult patients to feed. \u00a0We even had a  barium\u00a0swallow study  preformed to determine if Noah was\u00a0aspirating while he was eating. \u00a0(Thankfully he wasn\u2019t.) Once he was more sturdy he could eat so much better! \u00a0In fact, once he was able to eat from a  spoon  we were able to graduate from  speech therapy \u2026for now. We are seeing more and more each day how we have to look at his development from the stand point of the whole child rather than focus on one thing. Never Forget That What You Do Is Very Important! I also recently learned that for those with a language delay due to oral motor dysfunction (ex: apraxia) the most accurate indicator of future cognitive function is problem solving ability. Without the dysfunction, language is the best indicator. \nI have a feeling that a lot of families think their kids with  Down syndrome  excel in problem solving ability, so hopefully this will encourage you a bit. Language is such an obvious delay but typically the delay is because their mouths are trying to figure out how to say what is going on in their brain. \u00a0Just because your child is not able to speak clearly at the moment does not mean they are not  BRILLIANT!  \ud83d\ude42 \u00a0Unfortunately the general population may not realize this. I hope that you are able to take encouragement that  WE DO! We also know all the  hard work  your child puts in, and if a kid is working hard that means that there is a parent working just as hard. \u00a0I feel that doctors don\u2019t say good job enough to their parents. So  GOOD JOB!! All your hard work is paying off. And remember\u2026.stay encouraged! Your child appreciates your hard work and effort more than you will ever know! What\u2019s an area of development that you are currently working on? \u00a0How\u2019s it going?

{"date": ",September,22,2011", "body": "I know there are lots of good reasons to make your own baby food. \u00a0I\u2019d like to share with you my two favorite reasons: One, I like to cook. Two, it is WAY  cheaper  than buying it at the store. Organic is not a big deal to me, but saving a dollar or two sure is. From a one dollar bag of frozen green beans I was able to make  10\u00a0\u2013 2 oz jars of puree! \u00a0 When I saw that one jar can cost at least that, I was pretty impressed. Organic is however important to my friend Rachel whom has quite the cutie who also just happens to have  Down syndrome . We met through our local  down syndrome support group  and it has been great going on this adventure together. She has two great  blogs , one about her  kiddos \u00a0and the other about  making your own baby food . This is where I have gotten all of my recipes and figured out what  food  to offer and when. I have the page bookmarked and have been working my way through all the choices. I have been using some cheap  individual baby food containers , and they have worked great. \u00a0I like that they are individual and not the ice tray version as I can get it out, thaw it and then use it to feed from. \u00a0She told me about getting the glass mason jars at the store with the plastic tops, but I haven\u2019t gotten those yet. Today we tried blueberries. Blueberry \u2013 Basic Puree Stage 3 (8-10) months+ Ingredients 1/2 pint of blueberries (fresh or frozen) 4 c. water Directions Bring water to a boil. Add blueberries and simmer for 15 minutes until soft. Reserve liquid and use a slotted spoon to transfer blueberries to blender/processor/mixer and puree. If needed, add some of the liquid to blueberries. Add cereal (if desired) to thicken up *You can save the liquid to serve as juice or to blend in with cereals etc.. Pretty easy right? That\u2019s what I thought. We only got about two servings of blueberries out of my stash. I was trying to use up what I had left in the fridge before it spoiled. I have found that I get my dollars worth more from vegetables than fruits just due to water content. I am waiting for October to try pumpkin \ud83d\ude42 Imagine how many jars I could get from that\u2026 Did you make your own baby food? If so, what was your favorite to make?

{"date": ",August,31,2011", "body": "[This is part six of our \u201c New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome \u201d series. Be sure to check out the  other posts !] As a  new parent  to a child  born with Down syndrome \u00a0it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed trying to find the  best Down syndrome resources and\u00a0information.  You may have questions like:  What is Down Syndrome ? What are some of the best books on Down syndrome? What\u2019s it like raising a child with Down syndrome? How to I\u00a0find\u00a0the  best physical\u00a0therapist \u00a0for my child with Down syndrome? There is an\u00a0abundance\u00a0of websites and  blogs about Down syndrome \u00a0available\u00a0at your fingertips, day and night, but where do you start? How do you prioritize this massive amount of resources you find online? \u00a0How do separate the  accurate information  from the inaccurate information? First, take a deep breath.\u00a0Second, bookmark this post.\u00a0You\u2019ll find it to be a great starting point as you explore the various\u00a0 Down syndrome resources \u00a0we\u2019ve listed for anyone\u00a0wanting\u00a0to learn more. Take your time and look through the suggested resources mentioned in this post; there\u2019s a\u00a0lot of information here so feel free to digest it at your leisure. Top 6 Down Syndrome Resources For New and Expecting Parents 1. \u00a0Local Down Syndrome Support Groups If you only do one thing on this list of resources,\u00a0 find your local Down syndrome\u00a0support group first! I feel that finding other families going through the same thing is one of the most encouraging things you can do. You\u2019re not alone, and these groups can get you in contact with other moms and families who know what it\u2019s like to be a parent of a child with Down syndrome. They can also help guide you in the right direction, and give you parenting tips, since they are speaking from experience. This is not their first rodeo, but it\u2019s likely yours, so learn from the local experts. Why local support groups are the best resource for new parents I honestly think Local support groups are\u00a0 the best\u00a0resource  for new and expecting families of children born with Down syndrome. The internet is a scary place when you are expecting a baby, especially one that comes with a bonus\u00a0 21st chromosome . There are more messages boards,  Facebook pages , and online support groups than you could every read in a life time. And although each of those online resources have their place, there\u2019s nothing like\u00a0getting\u00a0to meet other families face to face (it\u2019s also hard to hug someone online.) Our local Down syndrome support group ( Down syndrome guild of Dallas )\u00a0offers various programs and\u00a0educational\u00a0seminars\u00a0including a  Mommy and Me  class which is the  best thing  I ever did to deal with my emotions. These women knew EXACTLY how I felt and provided a safe place for us to talk.\u00a0 Local support groups can help you meet new friends It is nice to find a mom who has a child just a little bit ahead of your baby so they can share their experiences. When Noah was  born , our friends at\u00a0 The Fun House \u00a0reached out to us. They had a then 2 1/2 year old who was running around, playing basketball, and a dancing machine. We have a bond now with this family that is beyond explanation. Their encouragement and guidance in the beginning was like rays of sunshine that helped changed our mix of emotions into  celebration  and excitement. We hope that our son Noah, and our daily videos is an encouragement to you\u2026but we also hope you find a family you can hug in person. One quick way to find your local Down syndrome support group There are\u00a0several\u00a0ways to find your local Down syndrome support group, but this one is\u00a0perhaps\u00a0the easiest. Simply go to  google , type in your city, followed by the word \u201cDown syndrome.\u201d As you can see in the picture below, before we even finished typing the word \u201cDown syndrome\u201d our local support group popped up! Done, and done! 2. \u00a0National Down Syndrome Organizations There are two national organizations that are great Down syndrome resources and can be a tremendous source of information for you and your family. Take a second to browse the recourses and information on their website, and feel free to even give them a call if you want. 1.\u00a0 National Down Syndrome Congress : 1.800.232.ndsc (6372) \n The mission of the NDSC is to provide information, advocacy and support concerning all aspects of life for individuals with Down syndrome \n You can find lots of great information on their new parent\u00a0page. \n 2.\u00a0 National Down Syndrome Society : 1.800.221.4602 \n The mission of NDSS is to be the national advocate for the value, acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome \n 3. \u00a0Down Syndrome New Parent Books / Guides It is probably wise to get a book or two to thumb through. There are countless books about Down\u00a0syndrome, but we listed two that are give great overviews of almost every topic you need to know about concerning Down syndrome. They may not be as comprehensive as some of the other books about Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0out there, but you\u2019ll find them to be a great starting point. \n Babies with Down Syndrome: A New Parents\u2019 Guide, \u00a0J. Skallerup \n A Parent\u2019s Guide to Down Syndrome: Toward a Brighter Future \u00a0Siegfried M. Pueschel \n 4. \u00a0Down Syndrome Medical Resources The medical side can be a little overwhelming. \u00a0 It can also not apply to your child,  so please try not to get to stressed out over all the medical jargon likely being thrown around .  There are a variety of  medical conditions that occur in Down syndrome , but your child is not guaranteed to have these conditions. I recommend reading only what is applicable to  your child  as the other stuff will bring unnecessary worry. However, there are  blood\u00a0tests  and specialists that your child will need to see despite how well they are doing. Being  proactive  in your child\u2019s health will make their life that much better. Instead of spending time reading various forums that are likely filled with  inaccurate  medical information, let me suggest three great online resources with\u00a0 medically\u00a0accurate information  about Down syndrome that you can trust. 1.\u00a0 American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Health Supervision of Children with Down Syndrome \u00a0( 2011 ,  2001 ) This is what your pediatrician should be using to care for your child. It has the schedule for tests, specialists, etc. \u00a0The 2011 is obviously new and your pediatrician may not know about this yet and is using the 2001 version. \u00a0If you are not having these things done at the time recommended, print this out and bring it to your doctor. \u00a0Your doctor can always learn something new \ud83d\ude42 2.\u00a0 Children\u2019s Hospital of Boston\u2019s Down Syndrome Page : CHOB is the hospital where  Dr. Brian Skotko \u00a0trains and works. They have put together a great resource for your doctor as well as you. Fun Fact: Dr. Skotko also wears awesome\u00a0 pants . \ud83d\ude42 3.\u00a0 Down Syndrome Health Issues : Another pediatrician helping us understand health issues found in children with Down syndrome. 5. \u00a0Down Syndrome Developmental Books And Resources We have listed several books that are great resources to help you figure out what your  therapists  should be working on in order to help your child with Down syndrome reach their\u00a0 developmental\u00a0milestones . If you don\u2019t have the greatest resources in your area, it provides a  complete therapy plan  that you can do yourself. They are each laid out a little differently, but help you attack development in an organized fashion. I can\u2019t recommend these books enough! By the way, we have an entire\u00a0category\u00a0of posts dedicated to  therapy  on our site. Be sure to take some time to make your way through those as well. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find lots of helpful ideas you can use right away. \n Speech Therapy : Early Communication Skills for Children with Down Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals , Libby Kumin \n Occupational Therapy :  Fine Motor Skills for Children with Down Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals , Maryanne Bruni. This one has a GREAT toy guide for each stage \n Physical Therapy :  Gross Motor Skills in Children with Down Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals , Patricia C Winders \n Down Syndrome Education Online : My absolute  favorite  website about development and helping our children learn. \u00a0They have the most detailed  milestone list  I have found. \u00a0They also have a free  reading program  developed for children with Down syndrome (how cool is that?) \n 6. Personal Stories By Families Raising Children with Down Syndrome People will tell you to read personal stories or biographies. I want to  warn  you about this in the beginning.  Every child is different , and the children written about in these books (and the one this website is about) are\u00a0 not  your children.\u00a0Your child will have different gifts, talents, abilities, and will climb the developmental ladder differently than any other child. Every child is unique (regardless if they do or don\u2019t have a disability.)  Don\u2019t ever forget that.  \u00a0Please resist the temptation to play the  comparison game  that so many parents play. If you commit to starting off on the right foot now, and not comparing your child\u2019s development and ability to anyone else\u2019s you\u2019ll thank me later. Remember, despite how well the children are doing in these personal stories, it will not be what you had envisioned for your own child. You will celebrate these stories and be encouraged by them eventually but it may be overwhelming at first and maybe even a bit discouraging. But when you are ready, the following books are good resources: \n Common Threads: Celebrating Life With Down syndrome , Cynthia S.

As you can read in Noah\u2019s birth story, we had no idea Noah had Down syndrome until about four hours after he was born. \u00a0As  new parents  to a child with Down syndrome we quickly learned all we could about Down syndrome. We Quickly Became \u201cExperts\u201d on Down Syndrome During the first few weeks we learned much about the  physical characteristics of a child born with Down syndrome , the  labs a child born with down syndrome  has to endure, and some of the major  medical concerns for a child born with Down syndrome . We were quickly introduced to the many different\u00a0 physical ,  occupational , and  feeding therapies  we would soon be spending a lot of time at. But above all of this we fell further in love. Further in love with our new son. Our first son. A son that was born with Down syndrome. Down Syndrome Isn\u2019t As Scary As It Seems At first Down syndrome seems scary. It isn\u2019t. \u00a0Seriously. If you are a new parent of a child born with Down syndrome\u00a0you may think it\u2019s the scariest thing in the world. You may be confused, sad, hurt, disappointed, unhappy, curious, happy, joyful, etc. \u00a0You may feel like all of the emotions you are feeling will never go away. They will.\u00a0 This May Be Our First Video, But It\u2019s Certainly Not Our Last In your head you always wonder what it will be like when you bring your first (or any) child through your front door. You dream about the day that you get to take all of those fun home videos. (Isn\u2019t it odd how in our dreams we never dream about bringing home a child with Down syndrome?) I wonder why\u2026 Anyways, our life is great! God is way to good to us. We are so happy to be baby Noah\u2019s parents, and we wouldn\u2019t change one little chromosome about him. Seriously. In fact we love him so much we want to share him with the world! We will be doing a daily one minute video to show the world that Down syndrome is \u2018ok.\u2019  Yes, everyday!

Rick went to see a midnight  movie , so Noah and I just hung out on the floor and read some  stories . \u00a0I love my husband, but it is fun to have Noah all to myself sometimes (he would say the same!) One thing I have started to notice about Noah is his determination. He is setting his eyes on objects and trying to figure out how he is going to get there. Rolling is his prefered method of transportation at the moment. \u00a0 Do you see him eye the ball in this video? He becomes transfixed and wants to get after it. I had to help him out this time but I am fairly certain he will be getting there on his own before we know it. \u00a0When he is able to crawl and walk, there is no telling what he is going to get into. I am already contemplating how I will safety proof my house. This determination and focus has been quite helpful during our  therapy sessions ; Noah is motivated by objects and  toys  to do his activities. By following toys he will roll over, try to  sit up , reach, use his hands, and engage every  abdominal muscle  he has. \u00a0You may remember my post on vision being important to reach  developmental milestones , as once you are able to focus and track you can use that to encourage your baby into certain positions. Noah also is turning out to be a bit like his dad in that he enjoys technology or anything with light. If an iPhone or  iPad  is near him he wants to touch it, grab it, or figure out how to get the objects out of the screen. It is pretty funny. \u00a0I wish I could find an app that didn\u2019t turn off or open ads when Noah is putting his hands all over the screen. \u00a0It was actually hard to get any video or pictures tonight because Noah was trying to get the iPhone \ud83d\ude42 We finished the night with a story and Noah quickly fell  asleep , and I was not too far behind.

(Wow, that\u2019s a lot of lots!) They did this because today is 3/21, World Down Syndrome Day. The reason this date is significant is because people who were born with Down syndrome (like you)\u00a0were born with  3 copies of their 21st chromosome . As I\u2019ve watched you grow up these past six years my heart has also grown up in ways that I can\u2019t even explain. Life with you is so much fun. I love watching the way you live life. You\u2019re a fun kid. Like, super fun! One of my favorite things to do with you is take you\u00a0to Disney World. I love watching the joy on your face as you meet Mickey Mouse (over, and over again.) I love watching the way you approach those\u00a0rides with such bravery, and the way you anxiously\u00a0applaud when those same\u00a0rides come to an end. I love watching you interact and play with your brother. You are such a great big brother, and I can\u2019t wait to see you be a big, big brother to our new baby who is coming this November.

{"date": ",March,22,2017", "body": "Lauren Potter (who played Becky on the TV show \u201cGlee\u201d) recently appeared in a short video for World Down Syndrome day called, \u201c#NotSpecialNeeds.\u201d The video explains (in a VERY funny way) why\u00a0people with  Down syndrome  do not have \u201cspecial needs.\u201d I seriously encourage you to take a few minutes to watch the video below. It is FUNNY! I think this video has a great message! Not only does their video have a great message, so does the content on their  website : People with Down syndrome, like everyone else, have basic human needs \u2013 to eat, drink, breathe and sleep \u2013 to be nurtured, loved, educated and sheltered \u2013 to move, communicate, contribute and work \u2013 and to share, love and live. \nSure, people with Down syndrome may need extra assistance. Sometimes they even need significant assistance, and adjustments, to meet a particular need. But that doesn\u2019t make that common human need \u201cspecial.\u201d \n For example, a person who requires some help in speaking, writing or being understood, is still meeting the same human need that we all share \u2013 the need to communicate. The only thing that is different is the degree of assistance or the way they meet that need, not the need itself. \n It is time to recognize people with disabilities, including Down syndrome, as equal siblings in our family of human diversity \u2013 as people with the same rights and same fundamental human needs as everyone else, even if they may require extra assistance or a different way of meeting a particular human need. \nWe shouldn\u2019t just replace \u201cspecial needs\u201d with another euphemism like \u201cadditional needs,\u201d \u201cchallenged,\u201d or \u201cdifferently-abled.\u201d \nBut what words should we use instead? \nWell, it depends on the context. \nHow about just the person\u2019s name? It is not always necessary or appropriate to refer to someone by a label. \u201c How about just the person\u2019s name? \u201d \u2013 #BOOM #TRUTH Our Parenting Journey Is More The Same Than Different I think many people think it\u2019s really hard raising a child with Down syndrome, much more difficult than a \u201ctypical\u201d child. The truth of the matter is,  raising a child\u00a0isn\u2019t easy . No matter if that child is born with Down syndrome, or not.\u00a0All children have needs, just different ones. Instead of focusing on the differences, it\u2019s also important to focus on the similarities. People with Down syndrome  have jobs ,  get drivers licenses ,  go to college ,  get (and stay!) married ,  like to dance , and  go on fun trips  \u2013 just like everyone else! Does Noah have needs? Sure. Do All children? Absolutely. His needs are \u201cspecial.\u201d They are just different. And that\u2019s all good. I hope this video (and post) is a reminder to stop using words like \u201cSpecial Needs\u201d and the \u201cr\u201d word. What are your thoughts on this video? Leave a comment below and share them!

{"date": ",March,23,2017", "body": "On March 22,  the Supreme Court of the United States of America made an\u00a0unanimous ruling  that will (hopefully) allows children that require special education to receive a  proper  education. The 8-0 ruling in the Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District case states that schools must do more than provide a \u201cmerely more than de minimis\u201d education for students with disabilities and instead must provide them with an opportunity to make \u201cappropriately ambitious\u201d progress in line with the federal education law. As a parent of a child with Down syndrome,  who recently started kindergarten , I\u2019m thrilled to see the Supreme Court pass this ruling \u2013 especially by an unanimous vote! Honesty, having a child in the public school system has been eye opening for me. The first few months of Noah\u2019s schooling was stressful and frustrating. It felt like everything was such a fight to get Noah what the law says the school has to provide, which is simply; \u2026to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are not disabled, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. My wife and I had to escalate things all the way to the school district\u2019s office in order to help Noah get the resources that he needed to stay in the LRE (least restrictive environment.) At some point we\u2019ll write a blog post about that experience, but it did teach me that the education system for children with \u201cspecial needs\u201d is a mess and something needs to be done. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Noah\u2019s principal, his teach, his aids, etc are fantastic, but it doesn\u2019t seem like everyone is aware of what the laws are and how those laws apply to children like Noah. Teachers and staff aren\u2019t always aware of the laws, and if they are they may not know how to apply the law on a case by case basis. (For instance, the law says that they can\u2019t deny you services because they don\u2019t have the \u201cbudget\u201d \u2013 therefore someone from the district level must help these local schools obey the law by hiring staff, providing resources, etc.) Our story isn\u2019t unique. The horror stories I\u2019ve heard form parents are frustrating, and quite frankly exhausting for parents who have to basically study for the LSAT just to get their child what is required under the law. But I\u00a0digress\u2026 What I especially like about this ruling\u00a0is that\u00a0\u201ca student offered an education program providing a \u2018merely more than de minimis\u2019 progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.\u201d This is great! Now that Noah is included in the \u201ctypical\u201d classroom for a good portion of the day, I want to make sure that he is actually learning. Not simply playing with toys, or coloring in a coloring book. I want him to learn, and this court case says that schools  must  do that! I do believe Noah is learning, but I do sometimes struggle with knowing exactly what he is learning, how they are adapting the curriculum for him, etc. I want him learning, not simply being promoted from grade to grade \u2013 which is what this ruling specifically addresses. If you\u2019re a parent of a child with a learning disability reading this, take hope! The law is on your side. Don\u2019t give up. Spend some time reading up on the  IDEA Act , and don\u2019t be afraid to take things to the district level if need be. How do you feel about this new ruling?

{"date": ",August,31,2011", "body": "When you have a child you have to be very strategic about when (and where) you go to the movies. \u00a0We\u2019ve taken Noah to several movies, and my  wife  often takes him on\u00a0 mommy dates , so this isn\u2019t his first rodeo. \u00a0He typically does pretty good in movies\u2026.until the last twenty minutes I don\u2019t know how he does it, but he seems to always get hungry right before the big reveal. I seriously think he is  laughing  to himself every time he does it. It\u2019s Winnie The Pooh Time, And We\u2019re Excited! Since the moment I saw the  winnie the pooh trailer , I couldn\u2019t wait to see it! \u00a0I was a huge fan of Christopher Robin and the gang growing up so as soon as we got back from our two-week  road trip \u00a0we took Noah to see it! \u00a0We purchased our movie tickets online for a local movie theater we\u2019d never been to before (but it was the only place showing it on a Friday night) and headed out the door. We arrived at the  Highland Park Village Theatre  expecting to walk into a normal sized, stadium seating, movie theater. \u00a0Not so much! \u00a0It turns out the entire \u201cviewing room\u201d we were in only had seating for 16 (two rows of eight leather chairs!) It was very small, and intimate; it felt like we were sitting in someones cozy living room. \u00a0It was seriously one of the coolest movies theaters I\u2019ve ever been to. After I got over the cool factor I became nervous that Noah may, in a very cute way, annoy some of the other folks. \u00a0He\u2019s in a  fun  stage where he likes to  laugh  a lot and randomly likes to make wacky  mouth sounds ! \u00a0 We think it\u2019s super  cute , but I doubt our movie going friends would think the same. \u00a0To my surprise he did great! \u00a0He got a little excited towards the end, and as you can see in the video, was wound up by the time the credits rolled, but he made it all the way through! \u00a0Yay!!! It\u2019s so fun to see Noah interact with the images he sees on the screen. \u00a0He is certainly aware of what\u2019s going on, and as I watched his expressions while the movie was running I saw him smile and laugh during certain parts, open his eyes really wide during some scenes, and over wall have a sense of wonder as he watched (and tried to figure out) the shapes and colors that filled the screens. This little boy is growing up. Two Suggestions, And Two Questions Two Suggestions For You \n Go see Winnie the Pooh. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0If you have kids, take them also. \u00a0It\u2019s great! \n If you are in the Highland Park area go visit the Highland Park Village Theatre. \u00a0It\u2019s awesome. \u00a0Oh, and if you are a single guy\u2026this is a  great  place to take a date! (You can thank me later.) \n Two Questions For You \n \u00a0If you have kids, do you take them to the movies with you? What sorts of things do you do to keep them from distracting other people? \n If you don\u2019t have kids, do you get at people like us, or are you pretty laid back when you see parents bring their children to the movies? (I\u2019m not talking about what movies you are ok with, but any movie in general, for instance Winnie The Pooh. By the way, it\u2019s ok if you say you dislike it. \u00a0Before Noah was born I could never figure out why there was so many \u201cbad parents\u201d who thought it was ok to bring their young children into a movie theater\u2026I\u2019ve since changed my view on that.!) \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbFz--GCkOM", "http://www.hpvillagetheatre.com/"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/winnie-the-pooh/", "title": "Winnie The Pooh Movie Night!"},
{"date": ",March,27,2017", "body": "Last week I was eating lunch at a local Chick-Fil-A when I noticed a young women with  Down syndrome  working at this particular\u00a0location. (As a parent of a child with Down syndrome I\u2019m hyper aware anytime a see someone with Down syndrome,  especially when they are working.  It encourages me!) As I was getting my lunch I overheard another employee\u00a0ask her to\u00a0wipe off a huge stack of\u00a0plastic trays and place a paper tray liner on them. I sat down to eat my lunch and watched as the\u00a0women\u00a0with Down syndrome faithfully preformed the task assigned to her. I started to think about my own son. How I deeply desire for him to do something \u201cmeaningful\u201d with his life. Something more \u201cimportant\u201d than wiping off plastic trays. \u201cMeaning\u201d Is Much More Than What You \u201cDo\u201d I confess that I sometimes have\u00a0a very small minded view of what it means for one to do something \u201cmeaningful\u201d with ones life. Having \u201cmeaning\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you have to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or a pastor, or wear a suit everyday to work. No, meaningful work is something much deeper than that. Webster\u2019s directory defines \u201cmeaningful\u201d as: \u00a0having a meaning or  purpose Did you catch that? Meaningful work means that  you  have meaning or that  you  have a purpose\u00a0as you work. It\u2019s not about your specific job description or tasks assigned to you \u2013 it\u2019s about  you!\u00a0 No matter what you do in life, if you wake up everyday with a purpose, your work  is  meaningful! It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re wiping down plastic trays, or preforming heart surgery \u2013  you  can determine if your work is meaningful or not. Your meaning doesn\u2019t come from what you do, it comes from who you are! What\u2019s Your Purpose? The question you have to ask yourself is, \u201c Why do I do what I do? \u201d Why do you get out of bed every morning and do what you do? If you say, \u201cfor a paycheck\u201d I want you to think bigger than that. I want you to ask yourself  why do you do what you do?  Answer that question, then \u00a0 wake up every day and live that\u00a0out! For the girl with Down syndrome working at this Chick-Fil-A I bet she would say something like, \u201d to contribute to society,\u201d or to \u201cshow the world that people with Down syndrome can work just like everyone else\u201d or something to that effect. Her work  is  extremely meaningful. Every day that she goes to work she has go deal with people starring at her, or talking down to her, or maybe even being afraid of her because they have never met anyone with Down syndrome before \u2013 yet she does it. She shakes off all of that, goes to work, and her\u00a0life (and work) has great  meaning , no matter what \u201ctask\u201d she is doing. Answer\u00a0the question of \u201cwhy\u201d and not\u00a0\u201cwhat\u201d and you\u2019ll find much more \u201cmeaning\u201d in whatever you do. Noah\u2019s Probably Not Going To Be a Doctor, Or a Lawyer, Or an\u00a0Astronaut\u2026and That\u2019s Ok. Noah has Down syndrome, and one of the  characteristics\u00a0of Down syndrome  is cognitive delays. Unless there is some medical miracle in Noah\u2019s lifetime that helps people with Down syndrome with this, his cognitive ability will more than likely prevent\u00a0him from becoming a Doctor, or a lawyer, or an astronaut. Sometimes we say things like, \u201cHe can do anything he wants to.\u201d As nice as that statement is, it isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s not putting a limit on Noah, it\u2019s defining reality. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if he really wants to try to become a Doctor, I\u2019ll stay up with him and help him study for the MCAT every night, all night \u2013 that would be awesome! The truth of the matter is, he\u00a0may end up working at Chick-Fil-A, at a  car dealership , or at  one\u00a0of the many other companies that hire people with \u201cspecial needs.\u201d \u00a0 As long as he goes to work\u00a0every day understanding that his purpose doesn\u2019t come form what he does, but from who he is , I\u2019m good with that. In fact, at only 6 years old,\u00a0Noah\u2019s life already has tremendous meaning, purpose, and impact. He reaches people all around the world through this blog,  our Facebook page , and  Instagram \u00a0as he shows the world what life is like raising a chid with Down syndrome. To the Girl Working at Chick-Fil-A\u2026 To the girl working at Chick-Fil-A, thank you. Thank you for working hard and for showing the world every day just by your presence that people with Down syndrome are capable\u00a0of working just like anyone else. Thank for probably putting\u00a0up some ignorant people every day who say rude things (both knowingly and unknowingly.) Thanks for reminding my idea\u00a0of \u201cmeaning\u201dis pretty small sometimes. Thanks for paving the way for children like Noah to have jobs as they grow up. I don\u2019t know you, but I appreciate you. To Noah \u2013 you may not be able to do \u201canything\u201d you want to do, but you\u2019ll be able to have meaning in whatever it is you do. In fact, as I said above your life already has great meaning. I love you so much and so I\u2019m proud to be your dad. I\u2019m proud of all the  milestones  you\u2019ve already achieved, and am thankful to have a front row seat to all that God is going to do in and through your life (and already has!) I hope I do a good job of teaching you that meaning comes from who you are as a person created in the image of God more than anything you\u2019ll ever \u201cdo.\u201d \u2013 I love you! \u2013 Dad To parents of children with Down syndrome, or other \u201cdisabilities;\u201d how do you feel about the future for your children?

It\u2019s had it\u2019s fair share of challenges, but all and all it\u2019s been great for Noah. One thing that really gives Noah a since of joy is being able to exercise\u00a0independence.

{"date": ",January,31,2016", "body": "One of the best things about the stage of life we\u2019re in right now as parents is watching out two boys play and interact with each other. In fact, few things make my heart smile more. Click play on the video below\u00a0to see\u00a0a quick video of what I get to see day in, day out. Noah\u2019s five years old now, Jaxten is almost two, and these two boys really are becoming best friends. Noah is really enjoying having a little brother, and Jaxten is loving have a big one. One fun thing about their relationship is watching them teach each other new things. For instance in the video you can see Noah jumping off his hat, and Jaxten then wanting to do the same. I love that. I love seeing the bond\u00a0that is already forming between these two little guys. These guys love each other, and I love that. I love that they can also\u00a0just hang out and watch moves as well\u2026 As I see them grow up in age, my hope is that these two will continue to grow up in their relationship with each other as well, and as I watch them today, I\u2019m sure it will. It will be fun to watch them grow up together. To play together. To be there for one another. To love one another. It\u2019s fun watching them be brothers. I\u2019m consider myself incredibly\u00a0blessed to be a daddy to these two brother. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Not every moment of the day is hugs, and laughs, and smiles. In fact, shortly after I recorded the video in today\u2019s post, Jaxten had to come sit next to his dad for a bit because he kept messing with Noah. Then before dinner tonight Noah had to come sit next to his dad for taking the iPad away from his little brother while he was watching a movie on it. But at the end of the day they hug each other and tell each other they love the other. And I love that. How many children do you have? How do your siblings interact with each other?

It\u2019s so neat seeing all that hard work pay off. \u00a0My wife and I are so proud of our son, and couldn\u2019t be happier with how well the\u00a0therapists\u00a0at  Our Children House at Baylor  have worked with him. \u00a0Noah will be seven months old next month, and we are hoping that will be the month he can sit up for as long as he wants! Breaking his sitting record wasn\u2019t the only great thing that\u00a0happened\u00a0today. \u00a0At his  six month  check up he hadn\u2019t gained any weight the previous month, which of course worried us. \u00a0We upped his calorie intake with things like  green beans ,  bananas , and\u00a0supplemental\u00a0formula, and have been praying like crazy that for him to gain weight. \u00a0Well I\u2019m happy to report that today (two weeks later) at his weight check he has gained 11 ounces\u2026!!! \u00a0We were so happy. \u00a0God has been so good to us since Noah\u00a0arrived, it\u2019s really been\u00a0incredible!

{"date": ",July,29,2011", "body": "You The cheapest development or therapy tool is yourself. Simply interacting with your child with  song  or play helps your child develop. Getting them to focus on you and follow you around with their eyes is quite the achievement. Once they are able to do this, it is easier to work on other tasks as they are very interested in what you are doing. Plastic Ball Our recent favorite therapy tool is the big plastic ball available almost any where in those huge cages. For 3 dollars you have an exercise ball \ud83d\ude42 You can see in the video there are lots of activities that you can do on the ball. It helps with  core strength  and balance. It also helps the body learn how to react to different positions, take for example if you are \u201cfalling\u201d to the left to reach out and catch yourself. Cheap tool number one is useful with the ball as you keep them entertained and using different muscles. Maracas Another cheap tool we learned about at our very first  occupational therapy  visit was the maracas you can buy at  Party City  or  Amazon . For 49 cents a piece you have a  rattle  that actually fits in the hand of your child and is light enough for them to shake. I don\u2019t know if you felt the same way, but the rattles in the store are HUGE. Granted Noah\u2019s hands are small, but I don\u2019t know how any child gets their hands around those in the beginning. \u00a0Textures One last cheap therapy tool is the different  textures  that are available at your house from your clothes, to furniture, to outside. Noah loves to feel things right now with his hands and feet. We notice him rubbing his hands and feet against everything.

I was pretty impressed with this juicebox and would recommend it for first attempts with the straw. \u00a0A Pediatrician\u2019s Two Cents On Juice Just because juice is named after fruit does not mean that it is healthy. In hact it is LOADED with sugar. During my clinic while I was a  resident , I frequently saw kids for obesity. Juice is usually a child\u2019s worst enemy when dealing with weight. Parents will come in with their overweight child and I find out they are drinking 24 ounces (3 cups) or more of juice per day. That is over 300 calories. A child should drink 4 oz of juice per day, yep you heard me correctly, 1/2 cup. I always give the kids options for goals they should set to help with weight control. The first goal they usually choose is to elimnate ALL calories from things they drink. This means NO JUICE. Flavored no calorie water (or low calorie) is a great substitute for juice. Five calories vs 120 is a pretty impressive change. Just cutting out juice would save the above child over 2100 calories per week!!! I am sure that you have heard, eat the fruit rather than drink the juice. Kids can see a significant change in their body mass index just be doing this one step. By eating the fruit they will get the nutritional value for much less calories, if there was any true nutritional value in the juice in the first place. Children should never be encouraged to lose weight unless advised by their pediatrician to do so. The main goal is to maintain a weight while they grow taller. This is why the body mass index is helpful as it puts weight in relation to their height. If you look at a growth chart, you will see that if a child were to maintain their weight as they get older they would cross into lower percentiles. We want to halt the acceleration of growth that is making them surpass into higher and higher percentiles. A Juice \u201cBonus\u201d Another fun present that too much juice can give your toddler is diarrhea. Juice typically contains sorbital. Some of you may recognize this name as it is the sweetner used in sugar-free candies. You and your toddler can\u2019t digest this form of sugar and when it is left in your GI tract it also draws in water and thus you end up with diarrhea. What Does This Mean For A Child With Down Syndrome Children with  Down syndrome  are at risk for obesity. For one, they usually have a slower metabolism (meaning they will not need as many calories to maintain their weight) and two they tend to be less active due to either physical restrictions or there is nothing offered for them to do. I don\u2019t know about you but we faught for  Noah  to  gain weight  at the beginning, and I find it slightly funny that we will eventually be changing our view of trying to keep weight off of him. We as parents have to make a major mental change when it comes to our child\u2019s weight. Hmm, maybe that is another reason our little guys struggle with weight \ud83d\ude42 Some of your ears might have perked up with the idea of juice causing diarrhea. Juice can be a helpful tool with constipation as well. The juices that are most helpful tend to be apple and pear (and yep they have a high level of sorbitol). However you should use juice in limitation to help with constipation, 4 oz or less per day. The better way to help is that once a child is able to  eat fruits and vegetables  to use that rather than juice to help with constipation. Has your child tried to drink out of one of these juice boxes, or tried a straw? \u00a0How did it work for you? \u00a0Also, how much juice do you allow your little one to drink?

{"date": ",September,18,2011", "body": "Another day another  therapy session . Isn\u2019t it weird how this is just a normal part of your life? I remember when we came home from the hospital I cried. It was not the coming home I had envisioned. One of the reasons I was so sad was that I knew with  Noah  coming home it meant that countless therapists would also need to cross our threshold. This was something I didn\u2019t think would be necessary in our new adventure. Maximizing a child\u2019s potential has always been one of my goals as a pediatrician. Whether it be by keeping them healthy, getting them  resources  or just educating their parents. I\u2019m a fan of  early childhood intervention , but I like early childhood intervention that actually does some intervening (is that a word?). As a pediatrician in our booming city, I have experienced the frustrations of parents who were not provided the services they were promised. Parents have told me about their therapists who only have time to come once a month because there are so many kids that need help in their community. Or they end up getting the coordinator doing the majority of intervention because they actually have the time. The coordinator is not a therapist! They may have child  development   training , but they have not done their  higher education  in  physical ,  occupational  or  speech  therapy. \n \nSome early childhood intervention programs are excellent, especially the ones in suburbs. However I was not quite getting the response I wanted early on. It was taking weeks for them to come evaluate Noah, and I needed to get started as soon as possible. It was just something that I needed to do. So we ventured outside of the standard intervention that is initially recommended, and began  private developmental therapy  \u2013 which has been great! Reasons to switch \n Your child is  6 months  or older and the therapists can\u2019t come more than once per month. \n You are not seeing your child make progress, or you notice they are not correcting the bad habits a child with  Down syndrome  creates on their own such a not  sitting up  straight. \n You are requesting evaluations in speech, occupational, or physical therapy and someone not trained in these fields is telling you that your child does not need those services yet or at all. \n Services stop because they are doing so  well . (See the recent  goals  post for why this is a bad idea) \n Reasons Not to switch \n You love your therapists and they are awesome! \n You are seeing great progress in your child and are happy with how things are going. \n You have other children and making multiple trips per week to a center is not the best scenario for you. \n Your insurance does not cover it, or the costs you pay out of pockets will be a burden to your family. \n There are only government provided resources in your area \n If 3-5 apply to you, but 1 and 2 do not, do not  fear . The point of therapy is to teach  you  what  you  are supposed to do at home. If you are not getting taught this, there are  books and videos  you can get to become your child\u2019s best therapist. Check out our  resource  page to see some great starting points for gross motor and  fine motor skills . Those books will walk you through what I see our therapists doing every day. You can also check out a lot of our videos for some ideas of what we are working on. It may be  hard work  on your part, but I am willing to bet you will find it worth the effort. Options For Intervention There are 3 options when you first start looking for intervention: \n Government provided in-home therapy \n Private in-home therapy \n Private center-based therapy \n The majority will take your insurance, and some will even take Medicaid. After I was told it would be about 2 months before our government provided resource would come look at Noah, we looked at private in-home therapy. This is something to look at if you need to stay at home due to other children. We tried one and I was not impressed so I went to a place I trusted rather than searching through the other home-based therapy providers I knew nothing about. I have referred countless children to  Baylor Our Children\u2019s House , and I love what they offer to children and the progress I have seen children make. We met\u00a0our first  occupational therapist  (Ashley) here. She was going to do both physical and occupational therapy for us initially because they are so intertwined when your child is 3 weeks old. Once Noah started getting good head control, begin to develop his  core , and was putting some weight on his arms be decided it was time to venture into separating his therapies. We spent a brief period in  speech therapy  there but will likely use another resource (Lynn Campbell with  Campbell and Foster ) based on a number of excellent recommendations we have received as Noah gets older. If you are just starting the therapy journey I want you to know that you have options. You are most likely told only about one, so I am here to do my little part with education. I recommend starting with number 1 and seeing how it goes. If that goes poorly move to 2 or 3 based on what you are looking for. The best way to find good options is to ask your new friends in your  Down syndrome  group if they are going outside of the standard. Hopefully your pediatrician also knows about certain resources in the area as well. How do you feel your child\u2019s therapists are doing? Did you know that you had other options?

{"date": ",June,27,2011", "body": "[This post is a part of the \u201c New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome \u201d blog series. Be sure to check out the  other posts! ] What is Down Syndrome: Genetics If you are a new parent one of your first questions may be \u201c What is Down syndrome?\u201d  (This by the way, was one of my husbands first questions when Noah was  born .) Down syndrome \u00a0(Trisomy 21)\u00a0is a  chromosomal abnormality  where a child is born with three copies of the  21st chromosome  (Just like in the picture!) Chromosomes hold our genetic information, and there are 23 types of chromosomes. One set of those being your sex chromosomes (X, and Y), and the others labeled 1 through 22. When babies are created, they receive 23 chromosomes from their mom contained in her egg and 23 chromosomes from their dad contained in his sperm, totaling 46 chromosomes. Children with Down syndrome are born with an extra 21st chromosome. Three Types Of Down Syndrome: 1. Nondisjunction:  This is the most common reason. Cells containing 46\u00a0chromosomes are split equally to create eggs and sperm, which then contain 23 chromosomes. Nondisjunction means that the cells did not equally divide the genetic information. This creates a sperm or egg that contains 24 chromosomes with two copies of the 21st chromosome. That egg/sperm joins with a typical egg/sperm with 23 chromosomes making a cell that has 47 chromosomes and three copies of the 21st chromosome. This is known as Trisomy 21. This is a  random  occurrence. \n 2. Translocation:  The egg or sperm have 23 chromosomes, however part\u00a0of the 21st chromosome has attached itself to one of the other chromosomes during the division processes that occur when the egg or sperm were made. Therefore, even though they have the right number of chromosomes there is actually extra 21st chromosome material. This CAN be (not always) an inherited condition, which can increase your risk of having another child with Down syndrome. Your doctor will want both parents to be tested to see if this is a possibility. \n 3. Mosaic:  Not all of the cells are affected, so the baby would have cells with\u00a046 chromosomes and also 47. This can occur in two ways. The baby either started with 46 chromosomes, however nondisjunction occurred with further cell division in only part of the cell lines creating some cells with three copies of the 21st chromosome. The other way is that the baby started out as trisomy 21 and nondisjunction occurred creating cells that now contain 46 chromosomes. This is a  random  occurrence. This is a very basic overview, but hopefully helps you understand that a  child born with down syndrome  isn\u2019t  sick \u00a0or  suffering . He or she simply has an extra copy of their  21st chromosome . [This post is a part of the \u201c New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome \u201d blog series.

{"date": ",September,21,2011", "body": "You may notice that Noah is  sitting , rolling,  stretching , and grabbing\u00a0 rubber exercise balls \u00a0in the majority of his  therapy  sessions. Today he got to play on a giant, textured  rubber peanut exercise ball . They come in a lot of sizes and a few different shapes. \u00a0I am fairly certain we have tried them all. So,what\u2019s the  goal  of using these exercise balls? Balance The ball is probably most helpful for balance. \u00a0By working on balance Noah is having to engage various muscles to  sit  on the ball. \u00a0When he is on the floor, he can use fewer  muscles  and rely on stronger ones. \u00a0This lets others like his  obliques  hide, which does not help those muscles out. \u00a0Once on the ball, Noah has to rotate muscles in response to shifts in order to maintain his sitting position. \u00a0This helps with his postural response so that when he is on the floor he  sits like a champ ! Reaction Another good reason to use the ball is it helps Noah learn how to react. If he is slipping one direction, he has to correct himself. Noah does not have much of a protective response currently, which is common with  hypotonia . \u00a0The ball helps him learn that. \u00a0 A protective response is putting your hand out to catch yourself, or using the opposite muscles to maintain a position if you are falling. \u00a0The  therapists  can cause those actions, which should provoke a protective response, easily and safely on the ball. Strength He also uses the ball to do sit ups. You have seen how Noah\u2019s abs are\u00a0 stronger than his mom\u2019s . I have noticed that it is much easier for the therapists to target certain muscles when he is on the ball rather than on the floor. Those  obliques  are not ignored when they do  sit up s with Noah on the ball. Propping One last good reason to use the ball is that it is a good tool to prop your hands on while  sitting . It allows Noah to roll back and forth and  sit  up straight. He loves the  textures  of the ball so it keeps him entertained. \u00a0It also provides a higher surface for him to prop his hands on so that he sits up straighter and doesn\u2019t do the  dreaded bad habits . You can buy these rubber balls pretty cheap at your local  Target , or online at  Amazon . \u00a0We have two. \u00a0A large  yoga balance ball , and a smaller  rubber  one. \u00a0We have found them to be\u00a0fun (and cheap) developmental tools to have around the house. Have you guys been using  exercise balls  in your therapy? \u00a0What sorts of  developmental toys  do you, or your child\u2019s therapist use?

I thought I\u2019d take a few minutes to update you on what happened to this blog and what\u2019s coming up in 2016! What Happened To This Blog? If you\u2019ve been following this blog for a while you may have noticed that the posts have slowed way down\u2026like way down. In fact I only posted  three new blog posts in 2015! \u00a0When I started this blog back in 2011 I was in grad school, working part time, and we only only had one child. My goal at the time was to post a video a\u00a0every\u00a0day giving the world a window into what life is like rising a child with Down syndrome. And if you check back on our old posts (or our  YouTube channel ) I did just this. However, it was a lot of work.  A lot.\u00a0 I shot the videos, edited the videos, uploaded the videos, wrote the blog posts that went with those videos (and some of them were really long,,.just check the  archives ) then\u00a0shared the posts and tried to reply to the comments on those posts\u2026on top of all that\u00a0I also managed\u00a0all of our growing social media channels. Then I  graduated from grad school , jumped into a full time job, had another child, and this site just became impossible to keep up. Our  Facebook page  and  Instagram  account\u00a0became the main place we posted updates on our life (simply because it\u2019s much faster to post updates to those channels) and this blog became sort of a ghost town of the world wide web! What\u2019s Next? Despite the fact that I rarely post on this blog any more, it still receives a tremendous amount of traffic. People from all of the world come to this blog every day wanting to learn more about what life is like raising\u00a0a child with Down syndrome, looking for hope, encouragement, and\u00a0wanting to stay connected to our story, and so my goal for 2016 is to resurrect this blog.

{"date": ",January,9,2016", "body": "Over the Christmas holiday we took a trip to see Noah\u2019s grandparents (who happen to live in the beautiful mountains of Colorado) and one of the things that we knew we wanted to do this year was get Noah a ski lesson! Noah loves adventures and having fun, but I didn\u2019t know how he was going to do with skis on his feet, in the\u00a0super cold weather, on top of a mountain! But he did great!  I literally\u00a0felt like my heart was going to explode watching him ski!  Check out the video below to see for yourself. When Noah was born \u00a0I dreamed about him doing things like this, and so it\u00a0was a ton of fun actually seeing him get to do it! I think the thing\u00a0that amazes me the most, is that Noah\u2019s only  five years old! \u00a0I think I would be amazed seeing any five year old learn to ski, but I would be especially amazed seeing a five year old with Down syndrome ski! Days like today remind me that having Down syndrome really is  no big deal.  Noah can do many of the same things any other five year old can do. He may have to work a little harder, it may take him a little longer, and he may get tired easier, but in the end he can do it! If you\u2019re the parent of a child with Down syndrome (or another \u201cspecial need\u201d) I hope you are\u00a0encouraged! I hope you remember that the sky really is the limit for our kids. And I hope you  remember to celebrate  all\u00a0of the little  milestones  that your child reaches each day. I\u2019m so proud of this little boy!!! 5 Tips For First Time Skier We really had no idea how Noah was going to do skiing for the first time, or what to expect. I thought I\u2019d share a few of the lessons we learned with anyone taking their child skiing for the first time. Many of these tips will\u00a0apply to any young first\u00a0time skier,\u00a0regardless of if they have Down syndrome or not. I hope they are useful to you! 1. Take a lesson! I can\u2019t stress this enough. My wife grew up in Colorado and knows how to ski and snowboard, and we still wanted someone else to teach Noah how to ski. We wanted someone who was specifically trained to teach young kids how to ski, and who does it every single day, to work with Noah. No matter how equipped you feel you are to teach your own child how to ski (unless you yourself are a ski instructor), there is just something relaxing about letting a pro do it. \u00a0Trust me on this, call the ski resort and sign your child up for a ski lesson. You\u2019ll be able to enjoy it more (and you can take more pictures and videos.) \ud83d\ude42 (See also tip #8.) 2. Call the ski resort and ask their\u00a0programs for children with disabilities. (DO THIS WELL IN ADVANCE OF YOUR TRIP!) We thought we could just roll\u00a0into town and get Noah into a ski lesson when we got there\u2026we were wrong! Little did we know that a child has to\u00a0be potty trained to go into a typical ski school for little kids. And since Noah isn\u2019t potty trained yet (we\u2019re working on it, but it\u2019s a slow process) he couldn\u2019t go into a typical kids class without a ski buddy. What we found out was that the mountain we went to, Snowmass, actually partners with  Challenge Aspen \u00a0who will provide a ski buddy\u00a0for people with special needs so that they can enroll in a typical ski\u00a0class. This is awesome!!! However, you have to call and set it up in advance (which we didn\u2019t do.) When we called we found out they were all booked up and\u00a0couldn\u2019t provide a ski buddy for Noah during the time we were in town. (Bummer.) So it\u2019s important that you call whatever ski resort\u00a0you are planning on visiting in advance and asking about their programs for kids with special needs, and getting your child signed up  before  your trip. We didn\u2019t know how we were going to get Noah a lesson, since we couldn\u2019t get a buddy (and didn\u2019t want to pay 600 dollars for a private lesson, which you can do without a buddy) but thankfully last minute a friend of ours who is a ski instructor offered to give Noah a private lesson as a gift! How awesome is that!? 3. Rent your equipment You may tempted to buy your child a lot of expensive ski gear before your ski trip, but I\u2019d suggest going to ski store and renting your gear first, for a couple of reasons. 1. A lot of time the equipment rental is included in the price of the ski school, this is the case at any of the four Aspen\u00a0owned mountains we were at. 2. Your child is going to grow, quickly. So what you buy today, may not fit next season. (Especially ski boots.) 3. Your child may not like to ski, and then your stuck with equipment your kid will never wear. Again, all of this is personal preference, but I\u2019d suggest renting your child\u2019s ski gear before going out and purchasing it. 3. Get there early and let your child walk around in the equipment before their lesson. I wasn\u2019t sure how Noah was going\u00a0to react with big skis attached to his feet while skiing, but one thing I wasn\u2019t expecting was how heavy the ski boots were, and how he\u2019d react\u00a0with those on his feet (even without the skis attached.) On the day we went skiing we pretty much got Noah suited up in his gear and headed straight to this lesson. This wasn\u2019t a smart idea because the ski boots alone were much different than the typical shoes he wears, and he didn\u2019t really like walking around in them. If I\u00a0had a time machine I\u2019d\u00a0have gotten there an hour before his lesson, put him in his ski boots, and allowed him to walk around a bit indoors getting used to the heavier boots on his feet. On a side note, he loved learning his ski helmet! I\u2019m pretty sure he wanted to take it home. 4. Don\u2019t take an all day lesson. Noah likes to go, go, go..and I was planning on signing up for an all day lesson (with a lunch break) but since we ended up getting a lesson from a friend that didn\u2019t work out, and I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t. After about an hour in the super cold weather (there was also a snow storm on the day we were there) he was ready to call it a day. His face was red from the wind and cold, his nose was running, and he was done. Quick note: if you enroll your child into a ski school most of them are full day, but I found out most of that day isn\u2019t actually up on the mountain. They are inside playing, eating, etc, and typically only spend about an hour on the mountain, and the rest of that time indoors. So this type of all day lesson would be fine. Just call ahead and ask how long they will actually be out in elements. Every kid is different, and only you\u00a0know how much your child can tolerate, but our\u00a0child is very active and he was done after about an hour outside. Take it for what it\u2019s worth. 5. Find the right gloves! I actually had no idea how important the right gloves are before Noah went out on the mountain, but  gloves are important!  Every child\u2019s hands are different, so you\u2019ll want to try several on and make sure you purchase gloves that fit well and don\u2019t come off easily. We originally bought Noah some  North Face mittens  last year, and they just didn\u2019t fit very well. We picked up some  Burton gloves  this year after we were leaving\u00a0that worked much better! We didn\u2019t have them while he was taking his lesson, but we\u2019ll be all set for next year! The North Face gloves didn\u2019t fit Noah well and he kept wanting to take them off while we was learning to ski, and eventually didn\u2019t want to wear gloves at all. When he fell down (your child will to, a lot!) and his bare hand touched the cold now, he wasn\u2019t happy\u2026which added to his grumpiness for the day. Having better fitting gloves would have eliminated\u00a0one of Noah\u2019s distractions for the day. In summary, don\u2019t skimp when it comes to glove. Buy a good pair! (This is something I\u2019d suggest buying vs renting. You\u2019ll want to go to a ski shop in your area and try on a few pair before your trip.) The great news is, your child can wear nice gloves all the time when it\u2019s cold outside, so these won\u2019t be a waste of money if your child decided he / she doesn\u2019t like skiing. 6. Be flexible. Right now I want you to stop and imagine how the\u00a0day (or hour) of watching your child learn to ski is going to go. Got it in your head? Good. Now forget all about it. It\u2019s not going to be anything like that. \ud83d\ude42 You\u2019re going to park in the wrong spot (we did). The lines are going to be longer than you thought (they were). It\u2019s going to be colder than you thought (it was!). It\u2019s definitely going to cost more than you thought. And your child may not like it as much as you think he /she will. It\u2019s ok! Just be flexible and don\u2019t let any of the unexpected ruin your day. If you go into the day expecting things to not go as planned you\u2019ll have a much better day. 7. Have fun! See also tip #6. You\u2019re there to have fun, so be sure fun is had! If you get frustrated or mad because things aren\u2019t going as planned, your kids will pick up on it, and that\u2019s not fun. You want skiing to be a fun experience for your kids, so no matter how the day is going, it\u2019s your job to keep it fun! So be positive, go with the flow, be flexible, and make some awesome memories! 8. Take some pictures and videos! Speaking of making some awesome memories, you\u2019re going to want to take some pictures and videos! I don\u2019t typically take my  DSLR  with me unless it\u2019s a special occasion (like today) but I ended up not using it at all. I like to the images it takes, but it was snowing (which means the snow was getting on the lens and not taking good pictures). My hands were cold and I wanted to gloves (you can\u2019t wear gloves when using a DSLR.) And the bag and lenses were bulky and just got in the way. I ended up taking pretty much all of my pictures and videos with my iPhone and I wish I would have just left my DSLR bag back at home. All of that to say, don\u2019t forget to pull whatever camera you choose to use out and capture some of these memories. It will be fun sitting around the (warm) dinner table at night looking at them, and you\u2019ll also be glad you did a few years from now! We had a blast watching Noah learn to ski. It\u2019s fun watching his face when he \u201cgets it.\u201d (Make sure you watch the video above all the way to the end to see what I mean.) And it\u2019s even more fun to watch him accomplish a huge goal like this! If you\u2019re a new parent of a child with Down syndrome I hope this post encourages you, and remember the sky\u2019s the limit for kids like ours!

What\u2019s the best exersaucer?  Jumperoo versus Exersaucer? \u00a0 Exersaucer or Jumperoo? \u00a0It\u2019s enough to make your head spin. And as a parent the last thing you need is another thing to stress out about. I\u2019ve got great news; your online search for\u00a0information\u00a0ends here.\u00a0Take a deep breath, sit back, watch the super cute video above, take a second to check out our son\u2019s  story ) and take\u00a0pleasure\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0fact that after you read this post you can check \u201c buy an exersaucer  (or jumperoo)\u201d off your to do list. \ud83d\ude42 By the way, be sure to check out the\u00a0 top 10 toys  that have really worked out great for our baby. While your there be sure to add any of your child\u2019s favorite toys to the list. Exersaucer Versus Jumperoo Vs Jumper \u2013 Which One Is Best For Your Baby? Before Noah was born I had no idea there was such a heated debate among parents regarding the use of an exersaucer or jumperoo. \u00a0A quick google search will bring up countless pages (and arguments) about the pros and cons of using one or the other. Our son was  born with Down syndrome , and\u00a0my wife and I are strong supporters of  early childhood intervention , to help them reach their  milestones . Our son gets to spend a lot of time with some of the  best\u00a0physical\u00a0and\u00a0occupational therapists  in the world. So you better believe when it came\u00a0time for us to make a\u00a0decision regarding a jumperoo or exersaucer we picked their brains. I mean why not, their experts when it comes to this sort of stuff! After talking to the experts about the use of an\u00a0exersaucer or jumperoo it was clear that  an exersaucer was the best option . I\u2019ll list some of the best\u00a0exersaucers\u00a0you can buy, and finally tell you which one we bought our son and three reasons why we really like it. Top 3 Exersaucer\u2019s For Your New Baby 1.  Evenflo Splash Mega Exersaucer \u00a0\u2013 This exersaucer by Evenflo gets great review\u2019s from parents, and has lots of fun\u00a0activities\u00a0to keep your baby\u00a0entertained. 2. The  Baby Einstein Around The World Discovery Center \u00a0: This\u00a0discovery\u00a0center (another name for exersaucer) by Baby Einstein is another great choice. It\u2019s very colorful, lots of fun items to engage your baby, and very easy to put\u00a0together; which make it a traffic choice. 3. The  Evenflo Triple Fun Exersaucer \u00a0is a very popular model due to the fact that not only are you purchasing a great exersaucer for your baby, but included in the box is a playmat and activity table. So you get three\u00a0excellent\u00a0items for your baby in one\u00a0convenient package.\u00a0Talk about a triple  win ! So which one did we buy for our son? While all three of these exersaucer would suit your babies needs well, we actually went with the\u00a0Baby Einstein Exersaucer. The model in the video is actually the older model of the one we linked to. In fact Noah gets a ton of use out of it, and it even helped him develop the  core\u00a0strength \u00a0needed to meet some of his  developmental milestones . 3 Reasons Why The Baby Einstein Exersaucer Is Great For A Child With Down Syndrome (or any child!) 1. Supportive Seat:\u00a0 One of the  physical characteristics  of children born with Down syndrome is low muscle tone (hypotonia.)\u00a0This is especially true early on as they are working hard on developing their core\u00a0and learning how to  sit up . Oddly enough many  developmental toys  are designed for  typically  developing children, and don\u2019t work well for children born with Down syndrome. It was particularly difficult to find an exersaucer that had a seat capable of providing proper  support for his neck and head . And we actually ended up returning another model, before we landed on this one. Thankfully we found the seat in this exersaucer to provide excellent upper body support (for any child.) 2. Sensory Development:\u00a0 After Noah\u2019s first visit to the physical therapist we learned how much he enjoys anything that makes noise and lights up. The louder and brighter the better! \u00a0In fact, all children can greatly benefit from the excellent  sensory development  that bright and loud (and perhaps sometimes annoying) toys provide. 3. Variety of Fun Activities :\u00a0It addition to the great sensory stimulation mentioned above, this\u00a0exersaucer has 7 other excellent \u201cstimulation\u00a0stations\u201d Noah seems to enjoy all of them, and doesn\u2019t get board while he is hard at work playing. Bonus 4th Reason: Free Babysitter\u2026! \ud83d\ude42 The exersaucer makes a great babysitter while you are cooking dinner, or need to get a little work done. We keep our exersaucer close to the kitchen, and have found it\u2019s perfect for entertaining Noah for a few minutes while mommy puts something yummy in the oven. We don\u2019t leave Noah in his there\u00a0more than 20 minutes or so at a time, but for those 15-20 minutes it can be very helpful.. The\u00a0Developmental\u00a0Office I\u00a0once heard a mom refer to an exersaucer as their baby\u2019s\u00a0 office , and after watching the way Noah handles his (fun and playful) business in his I can see why! Noah really enjoys hanging out and playing in his developmental\u00a0 office \u00a0and knows it\u2019s his own little space. It\u2019s so much\u00a0 fun \u00a0watching him enjoy it.

My wife and I are  first time parents , so we are learning new things about\u00a0parenthood\u00a0every day. \u00a0For instance, today I learned that pushing a stroller thorough a crowded dining room is fun. \u00a0( Not! ) \u00a0By the way, being a parent has opened my eyes to all kinds of\u00a0architectural fails\u2026..such as the lack of\u00a0elevators\u00a0and stroller (wheelchair) ramps at malls! \u00a0Ugggg\u2026.! \u00a0But I\u00a0digress. We hung out at In-N-Out burger for a while enjoying our\u00a0delicious\u00a0burger and fries\u2026..and thinking about how many hours on the\u00a0elliptical\u00a0machine it\u2019s going to take to work this lunch off! \u00a0After lunch we took Noah  swimming  at Baylor  Tom\u00a0Landry\u00a0Fitness Center , which by the way, he really enjoys! \u00a0This was one of\u00a0Saturdays I really enjoy. \u00a0The schedule was empty. \u00a0My wife and I were both off from work. \u00a0We got to hang out. \u00a0Rest. \u00a0 Play .

{"date": ",January,6,2011", "body": "Due to the l ow muscle tone  that is common in children\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with  Down Syndrome \u00a0Noah was having difficulty drinking from a bottle, and we were\u00a0concerned\u00a0he was aspirating. \u00a0We brought him to Baylor Medical Center to have a barium swallow study preformed, which would\u00a0essentially\u00a0tell us if everything was going down the right pipe. The results of the swallow study came back to show  no aspiration , and everything was indeed going down the correct pipe (Thank God!) However it did\u00a0reveal\u00a0some incoordination with his suck and swallow which led us to begin weekly  speech therapy . At Noah\u2019s age (3 weeks old!), speech\u00a0therapy is basically feeding therapy since many of the same\u00a0muscles involved\u00a0in talking are used\u00a0while eating. In\u00a0addition\u00a0to the weekly visits to the\u00a0speech\u00a0therapist, we were taught how to use a tool called a  Z-Vibe , and given a series of simple, but very\u00a0effective exercises known as  The Beckman Oral Motor Program . \u00a0As a result of God connecting us with this great program, Noah\u2019s ability to eat\u00a0dramatically improved! \u00a0We are so thankful for all of the great\u00a0therapists\u00a0at  Our Children\u2019s House at Baylor ! \u00a0(We also use them for Noah\u2019s  occupational , and  physical\u00a0therapy , and are just as happy with the progress we is making.)

{"date": ",June,27,2011", "body": "Wow, I can\u2019t believe the  weekends  already over.  This has been one of those rare ones that I love so much.  We did a lot of hanging out, resting, a  little  bit of cleaning, and enjoyed lots of  Noah time!  As I\u2019ve said a million times, it\u2019s so fun watching this  little  guy grow up. \u00a0I feel like every day we get to see a different  expression , or learn something new about how God designed our little  Noah . \u00a0It\u2019s been a blast! Without a doubt, one of my favorite things t0 do is listen to my Noah\u2019s  laugh . I mean\u00a0seriously, when\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve heard (or seen) a laugh as cute as his! \u00a0Over the last few months Noah has started to laugh pretty much all day. He is either\u00a0crying\u00a0( hungry , or wants to  cuddle ), sleeping, or\u00a0smiling, laughing, and  playing \u2026I love it! \u00a0One thing that\u2019s especially neat is that now Noah will smile and laugh at us anytime we pay even the smallest amount of attention to him (which is all the time!) \u00a0The way you see him laughing while playing paddy cake in the video, is the way he laughs and smilies all day long\u2026which it makes it hard to get anything done around the house! \u00a0Think about it; would you be\u00a0motivated\u00a0to do laundry with a little boy like this in your house\u2026? Abbie and Noah got to have a  mommy and baby lunch  with some friends we met through the  Down Syndrome Guild Of Dallas  this afternoon. As you can tell they had a lot of fun! Shortly after Noah was born  Abbie  and I went to a  new parent  meeting put on by the guild, and I\u2019ll be honest, we weren\u2019t ready for it. \u00a0Don\u2019t get me wrong. \u00a0It was great to be surrounded by other new parents who were\u00a0experiencing\u00a0some of the same emotions that we were. However, it felt sort of like when you\u2019re learning to swim and someone throws you into the deep end of the pool. \u00a0You always knew that one day you\u2019d have to go into the deep end..but you never really feel ready for it. \u00a0Then the day comes when you get pushed in. \u00a0 SPLASH\u2026!  After the shock of the cold water wears off you\u2019re fine\u2026.but boy that first plunge into that cold, deep water is a doozy. \u00a0 Perhaps\u00a0how I felt that day will make it into another post, but let me just say this: If you are a  new parent  of a child born with  Down Syndrome  I\u2019d highly\u00a0encourage\u00a0you to connect with your local guild (support group.) \u00a0By the way, if you are anything like me, you may be thinking a few of the things I thought before going to that first meeting. \u00a0Here are a few of them: \n It\u2019s going to be\u00a0weird. (It was. A little.) \n I don\u2019t really need to go, I\u2019m fine. \n I won\u2019t have anything in common with anyone there. (I don\u2019t think I have to explain how dumb that thought was.) \n It\u2019s going to be a\u00a0boring\u00a0meeting with a\u00a0vegetable\u00a0tray and ranch dip in the back. (Actually they did have a vegetable tray..and it was  good !) \n I\u2019m to busy. \n I don\u2019t even have time to hang out with the friends I already have, there\u2019s no need to go meet  more  people. \n It\u2019s to far of a drive. (It was actually just 15 minutes from our house.) \n Man\u2026Undercover Boss is on tonight. \n I can get all of the same information on Google. \n It\u2019s going to be weird. \n I\u2019m married to a  Doctor \u2026she already knows everything about  Down Syndrome ! (She doesn\u2019t. \u2014She\u2019ll even tell you that.) \ud83d\ude42 \n Those are just a few of the thoughts I had\u2026but I\u2019m a little\u00a0weird. On a serious note, we not only went to the meeting, but we went to a picnic a few months later, and it was awesome! \u00a0I\u2019ll have to write about that in a future post as well, but it\u00a0involved\u00a0some sweet\u00a0Karaoke! \u00a0I say all of this\u00a0because\u00a0there is a special bond I feel whenever I met another parent raising a child born with  Down Syndrome . \u00a0It\u2019s like we\u2019re on the same road\u00a0together. \u00a0Like I just found a travel mate.

{"date": ",January,8,2016", "body": "My wife and I like to vacation differently. I like large crowds, lots of excitement, and seeing lots of different things while on vacation. (Think  New York , or Disney World!) My wife, on the other hand, likes to relax and take it easy while on vacation (think of a beach, or hotel pool.) In fact, my sweet wife often jokes that we need a vacation from my vacations. \ud83d\ude42 Well, this past summer we decided to compromise and go\u00a0on a beach / Disney World vacation\u2026and it was  amazing ! In fact, it was so awesome I think I\u2019ve found one of my new favorite places to visit. The plan was to drive from Texas to Florida and stop at a beach on the coast for a long weekend then spend the rest of the week at Disney World. My wife and I researched hotels\u00a0along the coast and to be honest I couldn\u2019t find any I really liked. They all seemed old / out dated / and just not in a good location. We connected with the\u00a0 Hilton\u00a0Sandestin \u00a0and they invited us out for a weekend, and I have to say \u2013 it was awesome! We woke up super early in the morning and made the drive to Florida (to be honest, it wasn\u2019t that bad of a drive at all\u2026totally doable in a day from where we live!) We got to the hotel a little before sunset so we got the kids dressed in their beach gear, and headed to the beach! Noah has actually  been to the beach before , but this was the first time Jaxten had ever stepped foot on one! Here\u2019s a Facebook live stream video we took the first night we made it to the beach! We hung out at the beach until it got dark, then visited the hotels indoor pool for a while (which was amazing!) Then headed back up to the room to change and head to dinner. One thing Noah really liked about the room was the bunk beds! This room really is great for a family. In addition to the bunk beds there was a large king sized bed as well. We were actually a little nervous with Noah sleeping on the top bunk so we allowed him to sleep on the bottom bunk and Jaxten sleep in the pack and play at night. The next two days we basically just hung out on the beach and hotel pools. One thing that was important for us when choosing a hotel is\u00a0easy accesses to the beach. We didn\u2019t want to cross any streets when going to the beach, we just wanted to walk out the hotel doors and be on the beach, and this was the case at the\u00a0Hilton Sandestin! \n Here\u2019s a Facebook live stream we did on our second day! It was so much fun watching Noah explore the beach and build sand castles. This \u201clittle\u201d dude is growing up so fast! I felt like my heart was going to burst out of my chest watching these two boys play with each other. They are really developing a special bond, and I hope it continues to build throughout their entire life. \n \n I couldn\u2019t\u00a0believe this, but I actually thought about shortening\u00a0our Disney trip and staying at this hotel for a few days longer! Our family had such a great time on the beach with the boys, that we didn\u2019t want to go.

{"date": ",July,24,2011", "body": "\u201cThey grow up so fast.\u201d You\u2019ve heard every parent say that. \u00a0Granted, Noah is growing up fast but I feel we get to savor his  development  a little longer than a  typical  child.\u00a0 We are enjoying his milestones at a leisurely pace. We attempted the jumperoo at four months (like the box says), but our  therapists  quickly scolded us and told us he wasn\u2019t ready.\u00a0 It was quite obvious he wasn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0 He did not have the  core strength  to do anything in the jumperoo and his tiny little feet couldn\u2019t touch the ground. And as you can see in the video, they still can\u2019t. \ud83d\ude42 We Each Have Our Own \u201cNormal\u201d It is easy to get frustrated because sometimes you just want your family to be \u201c normal \u201d or better known as  typical  in our world.\u00a0 I am trying to remind myself to cherish each moment and to not rush Noah through his stages. Don\u2019t get me wrong mommies who have children with  Down syndrome  are just as competitive (better known as  comparative ) as the best of them.\u00a0 We will try anything to help our bambinos reach their milestones ASAP.\u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s why I was at  Our Children\u2019s House at Baylor  when Noah was just  three weeks old . 1/2 Prayer And Trusting God + 1/2 Lots Of Very Hard Work =\u00a0Our Developmental Recipe We  work hard  to get our babies to hold their head up, to roll over, to even just stare at us.\u00a0 We were in a dark room with lighted objects to help with his tracking.\u00a0 Noah spent countless minutes on his belly multiple times per day.\u00a0 You should see how  hard  this kid works just to do what is supposed to come naturally. So now at seven months we attempted the  Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center \u00a0(Yay, Craig\u2019s List!), and you will notice his feet still do not touch. But guess what, that didn\u2019t matter one bit to him, because as you can see in the video and pictures, Noah can now enjoy these toys with the best of them! \nSo we are learning not to rush God. \u00a0Instead we just continually give Noah over to God, use all that available  resources  that we have, and have a lot of fun with Noah and all the little blessings  Down syndrome  brings with it. \ud83d\ude42 For those of you that has a  child with Down syndrome  (or any disability) what\u2019s been one of the surprise blessings you have experienced?

{"date": ",July,26,2011", "body": "Poor Noah has to deal with a  pediatrician  as a mom. That means that he didn\u2019t get  fun  bumpers on his crib. (Not to mention that the crib must be following the new guidelines.)\u00a0He won\u2019t get a walker.\u00a0He will get  every   immunization .\u00a0And we will attempt to wean off that bottle by one year of age. This may be asking a lot of my little man, but I believe he can do it. Why the sippy cup is bad for oral motor development The sippy cup has become the go to cup after the bottle. This may be great for a  typical  child, but to help with  oral motor development  we need a regular cup or one with a straw. You saw us try with the  straw  a few weeks ago. First attempts are not meant to be successful and we have five more months to go right? We tried just a regular cup tonight. Noah wanted to grab it right out of our hands and get his tongue on that pear juice. He thought it was  awesome!\u00a0 Granted the majority of it ended up on the\u00a0burp\u00a0cloth underneath his chin, but it was a great start. \ud83d\ude42 When should my baby stop using a bottle? Why do we ask parents to be off the bottle? For one it is really bad on the teeth. It allows the sugary substances to hang out in the mouth a little longer than they should. It is also thought that if once a child is older and feeding themselves that if they are walking around with a bottle in their mouth all the time they will not use their mouth to  communicate . If you\u2019re baby is under one year old be sure to check out this post on how to choose the  best bottle  for your child. Straw cup vs. the sippy Cup The straw is important for proper tongue placement in the mouth and helps build strength for\u00a0their  oral motor  skills. The sippy cup does not promote proper tongue placement. You can always buy a straw cup but other methods for trying a straw are using a juice box or capri sun. This way you can squeeze the fluid into the mouth.  Seth\u2019s mom  taught me this trick. I have yet to try it, but it will likely occur soon at our house and we\u2019ll be sure to post a video for you. Drinking from the cup as Noah is doing also promotes good  tongue placement  and oral motor skills. While it may be messy, we\u2019ll gladly \u00a0put up with it to help Noah with his  speech development . We love the heck out of this little guy.

{"date": ",August,23,2011", "body": "Today is the last day with our family. We were not too proactive in leaving as we were trying to spend as much time with Guy and Gigi (Noah\u2019s  adorable cousins ) as possible. Guy and I played our own version of  angry birds  in the living room with his stuffed bird we picked up while at  Build a Bear  yesterday. \u00a0Sadie (Noah\u2019s aunt) let me rummage through a few more things before leaving. Again, hand-me-downs are AWESOME. \u00a0Gigi rocked out on her horse while we were getting the car ready. \u00a0And eventually it was time to leave \ud83d\ude41 Guy was pretty cute when we said goodbye. He was nice enough to  sing  Noah to sleep before we got in the car. He sang his favorite song,  \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star\u201d . It worked like a charm. So we were off\u2026or so we thought. Stop #1: Castle Rock Rick and I are pretty good procrastinators. When looking at a 12 hour drive, one will come up with all sorts of excuses to avoid the excruciating  drive  which is Texas. \u00a0So why not do a little shopping before we were staring at nothing but highway?! We stopped in Castle Rock at the  outlet mall  just to look around. Well\u2026by the time we got in our car it was way past 2:00pm. Knowing that we were not going to make it home that night, we started contemplating where we wanted to  sleep . We wanted it to be at least a little bit  fun  since we are on  vacation . I don\u2019t know how many of you have made the trip between Texas and Colorado, but there is not a lot of fun between those two states. Stop #2: Colorado Springs We drove about an hour (yes just an hour) and decided to stop in Colorado Springs for the night. We were now 1.5 hours from my brother\u2019s house. We are awesome, I know. We checked out the  Broadmoor  but they were booked for the night (and possibly a bit out of price range) so we then looked at\u00a0 Cheyenne Mountain Resor t. It was  beautiful  (and cheaper) so we decided to stay. It was a lot like summer camp in that the outside looked like cabins and there was a lake as well as a resort  pool . The inside was nothing like summer camp and surprisingly nice. That night they were having a seafood buffet so Rick felt that God was looking out for us in our hotel choices. Lakeside Beach We already know how much Noah enjoys  swimming  so we ventured down to the lake and Noah experienced sand for the first time. He wanted to put it in his mouth, as he does everything. He thought it was pretty cool and enjoyed the  texture . He enjoyed rubbing his feet and hands on the sand. It also loved him, as we kept finding pieces of sand on him even after he got a bath. We also played in the splash park and hung out in the pool. \u00a0While we were in the pool, a woman came up to us and commented on how strong Noah was. \u00a0This should have triggered my  Down syndrome  parent radar as Noah looks far from strong to other parents. \u00a0When her 19 year old daughter Angie sat down, I got a little excited as Angie had Down syndrome. \u00a0Angie had just graduated from high school (Woo Hoo! Go Angie!) and was enjoying her vacation. \u00a0This mom had adopted Angie as well as another boy with Down syndrome. \u00a0 HOW AWESOME IS THAT???  \u00a0This was a such an encouragement to us and we are very thankful we met them. All-You-Can-Eat Seafood Buffet Rick and I went to dinner, and Rick ate enough crab legs and shrimp to cover both of our dinners plus some. He is very smart about his choices at buffets and goes straight for the good stuff rather than wasting stomach space on things like salad. While we were sitting there, we made a very spontaneous decision. Why not continue our vacation here at this resort? We were planning on taking a separate vacation once we returned, but this would be much easier and cost effecient than what we were considering. Plus, Colorado Springs had a lot to offer and our hotel was pretty awesome. So, we decided to unload the car and enjoy a little more vacation. Have you ever made a spontaneous decision to travel?

You did not  cause  Down syndrome. There\u2019s\u00a0Nothing You Did To \u201cCause\u201d Your Child To Be Born With Down Syndrome First let me reassure you, there is nothing you could have done to  cause  your child to be born with Down Syndrome. Nothing you ate, didn\u2019t eat, got exposed to, vitamin you forget to take or activity you did that caused\u00a0your baby to be born with\u00a0Down syndrome. If that thought has\u00a0ever crossed\u00a0your mind you can take a deep breath, and let go of any guilt or anger you may be feeling, because Down syndrome isn\u2019t your  fault . It is very likely that you were  surprised  by this diagnosis at delivery as I was. You had no idea that your child was carrying that extra chromosome throughout your pregnancy. You are not alone,  85% of children born with Down Syndrome are diagnosed after delivery . Your OB did not miss anything either. You could have had an ultrasound every week (like myself) and there were  no clues  that your child would be born with Down Syndrome. That being said your child has had that extra 21st chromosome since conception. Before you even knew you were pregnant their genes were set in place and there was nothing you, or your Doctor, could have done to prevent that extra chromosome. God knitted your little one together just as He intended. You Don\u2019t Control Your Eggs We had one very pleasant lab technician ask us \u201cWhich one of you gave him the  extra chromo ?\u201d (And yes she said  chromo!)   It is most likely that the extra chromosome came from me.\u00a0 DO NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THIS!  You had no control over what happens at conception, and cannot pick and choose which egg will be used.

{"date": ",September,15,2011", "body": "I\u2019ve heard it said a thousand times that there\u2019s a special bond that exists between parents of children with special needs. \u00a0After almost nine months into this exciting journey and meeting countless parents along the way, I can honestly say I agree. (Although I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s as equally true for all parents.) Two (False) Fears About Raising A Child With Down Syndrome When Noah was  born  one my many fears about raising a child with Down syndrome was that my wife and I were left to this world of  Down syndrome  all alone. (Well, not  really  alone. \u00a0God was well aware of and very active in what we were going through. \u00a0After all He knew about Noah\u2019s  extra chromosome  well before we did.) \u00a0We had lots of friends who had children, but none (at the time) who had  children with Down syndrome . \u00a0And now we were  that  family. \u00a0All of our friends told us they  understood , but they couldn\u2019t  really  understand. \u00a0While we were thankful to have such a wonderful group of friends, the thought of not having anyone in our life that could  really  understand what we were going through saddened me. Another fear I had was that our family was going to be so much different than a  typical  family. \u00a0I imagined all of the parents of  typical  children playing at the park with their children talking about whatever it is parents of  typical \u00a0kids talk about (spoiler alert: they talk about the exact same stuff) while my wife and I struggled to find a way to join in on the conversation with them. to them. \u00a0I imagined it going something like this; \u201cWow\u2026your little guy has two arms?! Cool! Our son Noah has two arms also!\u201d After all, our life was going to be so different from theirs. \u00a0Right? \u00a0It was going to be so hard to find things that our family had in common with other families. \u00a0Right? It turns out I was wrong on both accounts. In fact I learned some valuable lessons about parenting in the first few months after Noah was born. \u00a0You may (or may not) have a child with born with\u00a0Down syndrome, but I think these two lessons are useful to any parent. Lesson 1 \u2013 Your Imagination Is A Much Lonelier Place Than Reality Shortly after brining Noah home from the hospital we got linked up with a  couple  whose middle son, Seth, was born with Down syndrome as well. We spoke over email,  Facebook , telephone, and text message and quickly became close friends. \u00a0Several months later we took Noah on his  first vacation  down to Houston so we could all hang out. \u00a0I\u2019ll never forget how they treated us like we were part of their family. I\u2019ll be honest, there were tears that day. \u00a0My wife and I had a lot of emotions, and it was good to cry with someone who  really  understood what we were going through. \u00a0In fact as I was writing this I realized something; that was the last time I cried as it relates to Noah and his Down syndrome diagnosis. \u00a0That also happened to be the first family that we had been around since Noah was born who could  honestly  say, \u201cI understand.\u201d \u00a0Hmmm..maybe there\u2019s something to that. We continue to be close friends with Joel, Emily, and their family. \u00a0In fact Noah and I got to take Joel to  In-N-Out Burger  today while he was in town visiting family. \u00a0As you can see Noah loves Joel (and vise versa.) Since then I have met literally hundreds of families who are on the same journey as us. \u00a0Some of them may have different pit stops along the way, but we\u2019re on the same journey none the less. \u00a0I\u2019ve met them in person. \u00a0I\u2019ve met them through this website. I\u2019m met them on Facebook. \u00a0I\u2019ve met them on  Twitter . \u00a0(I\u2019ve even met them at a  resort  in Colorado!) It doesn\u2019t really matter  where  I\u2019ve met them, what matters is  that  I\u2019ve met them. \u00a0They exist! \u00a0 We\u2019re not alone! \u00a0 And if you are a parent raising a child born with Down syndrome (or even if you\u2019re not) you aren\u2019t alone either. \u00a0Although it may seem at times like you are at time, you aren\u2019t. \u00a0I promise. \u00a0(Just visit  Noah\u2019s Facebook \u00a0page if you ever doubt that. \u00a0There are lots of great parents just waiting to met you!) Lesson 2 \u2013 Your Family Is Much More \u201cNormal\u201d Than You Think As we got to know Joel and Emily I would often say to my wife; \u201cWow\u2026their family sure looks normal!\u201d I mean after all, they have a child who was born with Down syndrome; aren\u2019t they supposed to be \u2018taking care of him\u2019 or something? \u00a0How can they be playing the Wii\u2026? They have a sick kid..! (Oh, and it turns out Down syndrome isn\u2019t a  sickness . \u00a0The flu is a sickness. \u00a0The chicken pox is a sickness. \u00a0But Down syndrome isn\u2019t a  sickness . Turns out it\u2019s actually a  blessing ! \u00a0See, I told you I didn\u2019t much much about all of this at first. \u00a0I\u2019m learning, just like you.) After getting to know Joel and Emily (and about a thousand other families) I quickly realized our family wasn\u2019t all that different than a  typical  family. \u00a0Sure we may go to a few more  therapy  appointments than a  typical  family. \u00a0We may met our medical deductible quicker than a  typical \u00a0family. \u00a0We may have to go to more parent teacher conferences then a  typical  family. (If you don\u2019t have a child with Down syndrome I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s sort of an inside joke!) \u00a0And we may be much more sensitive to the  \u201cR word\u201d  than a  typical  family. \u00a0But the truth of the matter is we have much more in common with a  typical  family than I initially assumed. If you\u2019re a  new parent ,\u00a0and you were hoping having a child with Down syndrome automatically qualified you to be the strangest couple in your neighborhood, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you. \u00a0 You\u2019re still going to have to wake up at all hours of the\u00a0night to  feed  your crying baby. \u00a0You\u2019re still going to have to change diapers (yes, kids with Down syndrome poop and pee just like  typical  babies\u2026Gasp!) \u00a0You\u2019re even still going to have to give him  baths \u2026.yes, like with real water! \u00a0Don\u2019t worry, contrary to what you may read on the internet, they won\u2019t melt\u2026! When Noah was first born I spend countless hours reading \u201cstuff\u201d online trying to figure out what sort of special things you had to do to take care of a \u00a0child with Down syndrome. \u00a0I figured there had to be a  special list , right? \u00a0I imagined it looking sort of like this: \n Never expose him to bright light. \n Never get him wet. \n And the most important thing, the one thing you must never forget: no matter how much he cries, no matter how much he begs\u2026never, never feed him after midnight. \n Turns out that once again my initial assumption was wrong. It should be noted, that I have also met a lot of  weird \u00a0families since Noah was born. \u00a0Let me assure you, in the kindest way I can: \u201c\u2026those families aren\u2019t weird because they have a child born with Down syndrome.. \u00a0Those families are weird because they\u2019re just weird.\u201d Straight up. If you are a parent raising a child born with Down syndrome (or other special need) please know that although it may feel at first like your family is going to be  that  family, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you. \u00a0You aren\u2019t. \u00a0(At least not because of your new addition. See paragraph directly above.) Those are two fears of mine that didn\u2019t come true. What about you? What are some of the fears you had when you first became a parent of a child born with Down syndrome that never came true? \u00a0Please take a second to leave a comment; what you have to say could be just what someone else needs to hear. \ud83d\ude42 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://funhouseblog.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/NoahsDadcom", "http://twitter.com/noahsdaddotcom", "https://www.facebook.com/NoahsDadcom", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T549VoLca_Q"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/fears-2/", "title": "Two Fears I Had About Raising A Child With Down Syndrome That Never Came True"},

In that short time I\u2019ve been in awe as I\u2019ve watched him learn to do so many things for the first time. Laugh . Cry. Eat . Eat with a spoon. Eat cereal. Ride an Elephant Eat yams. Eat a banana. Roll over. Talk. Sit up. Run a 10K (just seeing if you were paying attention.) And the list goes on, and on. Being a first time dad is amazing. Being A Dad Is Dangerous Noah is dangerous. Seriously. I have to be very careful when I am around him because I know if I pick him up I will instantly be transported to midnight. seriously. Every time I pick up Noah I find myself in a baby time warp. \u00a0It never starts that way. I reach down to pick him up to give him a hug and a kiss before I head out to take care of something that I need to do. Then I sit down for a second to love on him a little bit. And the next thing I know, it\u2019s time for dinner. \u00a0Then it\u2019s time for bed. \u00a0(I keep loving on him.) \u00a0Then\u2026it\u2019s midnight! \u00a0If I want to get anything done I have learned I have to walk out of the house without even looking at him. \u00a0(I haven\u2019t done a very good job with this .) I\u2019m just amazed at every little thing that he does. Every smile, every look, every new expressions. \u00a0It leaves me in awe. Most of all I\u2019m reminded of how great of a God we have. \u00a0I simply can\u2019t believe he would give a guy like me such an amazing boy (and wife) like this. \u00a0Everything that Noah does reminds me the unique ability that only God has to create something amazing as a baby Noah. It\u2019s humbling. \u00a0And forever grateful to our great God.

{"date": ",September,13,2011", "body": "After a busy of week full of  physical therapy  appointments, and  sitting marathons  it was nice to simply hang out and home and enjoy the sweetness of fatherhood. \u00a0Some of my very favorite times of the day is the time right before Noah goes to  sleep . \u00a0When my wife and I just hold and cuddle our wonderful son. \u00a0I love it! Time Flies When Your Having\u2026\u2026 I don\u2019t about you, but our days seem to fly by. \u00a0It\u2019s hard to believe that in just a few short weeks the local department stores will laced with holiday decorations, and shoppers will be setting their alarm clocks extra early in order to assure their spot in the Black Friday lines. It\u2019s also hard to believe that in the midst of all of that Christmas shopping and holiday fun, our little boy will be turning one year old. \u00a0Wow. Time really does go by fast, which is why it\u2019s so important that we are intentional about slowing down and enjoying the sweetness of parenting. Fatherhood Is Sweet I love being dad. \u00a0Seriously.  Before Noah was  born  I would dream about what fatherhood would be like. \u00a0It all seemed so awesome: The thought of having a little boy (or girl) living with us. \u00a0Having  toys  scattered throughout our house. \u00a0Being able to sneak into his nursery late at night and watch him sleep. \u00a0Teaching Him about  The Bible . \u00a0Giving him gifts. \u00a0All of the  laughing . \u00a0The fun. \u00a0The cuddling. \u00a0It all seemed so surreal to me. \u00a0So fun. \u00a0So great. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t wait! When my wife was pregnant I suddenly became very aware of parents out with their children. \u00a0I\u2019d see dads at the mall with their kids and it seemed like they\u2019d give anything to not be there (or be with them.) \u00a0 I\u2019d talk to dads at the driving range who were there not to hit golf balls, but to \u201cescape\u201d their wife and kids. (That reminds me, I haven\u2019t touched my clubs since Noah was born. \u00a0It\u2019s all good.) \u00a0And I can never forget\u00a0the numerous times I saw parents  screaming \u00a0at the top of their lungs for their children to, \u201c Put that down! \u201d while\u00a0we were at\u00a0 Toys R Us \u00a0buying items for Baby Noah\u2019s arrival. I understand that sometimes kids need to be corrected, and that parenting is often difficult and tiring; \u00a0but come on. \u00a0Can\u2019t we agree it\u2019s still sweet? \u00a0Very sweet! I wish I had a time machine and could go back to the future to see those same parents when they were registering for baby items (perhaps at the same store) for the same children they are screaming at now. \u00a0Their faces full of joy in anticipation of their beautiful baby that would soon be here. \u00a0I wonder if they would have ever guessed in a few short years they\u2019d be back at that same store, but instead of joy, their faces would be covered in frustration? \u00a0I bet not. It\u2019s Hard Work, But It\u2019s Sweet Parenting is  hard work , and being a parent to a child born with Down syndrome brings with it additional responsibilities and challenges, but it\u2019s sweet. Sweeter then a\u00a0 Cinnabon  with two extra icings. \u00a0Don\u2019t every forget that. \u00a0When times get hard, and stress seems to be the only visitor knocking at your door, don\u2019t take it out on your children. \u00a0Take time to stop, and remember what you saw your precious little child for the first time. \u00a0Maybe take a look at some of those old photos or home videos again. (Just not the one of you having the baby. \u00a0I still don\u2019t know why people record that\u2026does anyone actually go back and watch that? \u00a0Seriously..? ) No matter how tough, stressful, or busy things become, parenting is a sweet privilege. \u00a0Will you take a few minutes today to stop and remember the sweetness of parenthood? Parents, what are some of your best tips and tools for other parents who need some help in this area? \u00a0How do you stay calm, and not take your stress and frustration out on your children? \u00a0What keeps you fouled on the sweetness of parenthood?

{"date": ",August,25,2011", "body": "You already know Rick\u2019s fondness for  seafood buffets , but I prefer breakfast buffets. Rick and I went to Maui for our honeymoon and they had THE BEST  breakfast buffet  ever. We thought that we would check out the  Cheyenne Mountain Resort\u2019s  version. I love that I don\u2019t have to chose between egg or sweet. I can endulge my love of every breakfast choice. Their brunch was pretty awesome and we even let Noah have a  sip or two of juice  which I think he enjoyed. Sand Is Quite The Developmental Helper We spent the afternoon enjoying our resort. We took Noah  back to the pool and lake . Today we actually got in the water of the lake. Lakes are a lot different than pools, we didn\u2019t last long in that water. I am fairly certain that there is going to be a sandbox in our backyard as Noah really enjoys the  sand . Not only that but it helped him reach a new  sitting record ! He was a rockstar on the beach. If we are able to keep him entertained with something in front of him, he sits so much longer and sand did just the trick. Honey Mustard Meets Mexican Rick and I ventured outside of the hotel for dinner tonight. The concierge had recommended a Mexican place,  Carlos Miguels , that was not too far away. Rick always wants to know what are the most popular dishes when we are a somewhere new, which is a great way to figure out what to choose. I tried their Honey Mustard Burrito thanks to their suggestion. It tasted just like how it is described, a burrito with a honey mustard sauce. It was good, but not exactly my favorite meal. \u00a0The chips, salsa, and bean dip (better known as refried beans) made up for it. Seven Falls My  mom  recommended that we go to a place called  Seven Falls . We had seen advertisements on our  road trip , so after a little bit of\u00a0convincing we decided to make the trip. It was well worth the short drive and only $11/person cost. They recommend you go at night,\u00a0which at first seemed silly as you are going to look at a waterfall. How could you see a waterfall at nigh right?? Well, this one has multicolor lights illuminating the seven different falls. It is actually one waterfall with seven drop points, hence the name. \u00a0I was totally expecting seven seperate waterfalls, so I am giving you fair warning. It was way cooler than I was expecting from the description and pictures. You first take an elevator and are able to see the entire waterfall from the opposite mountain. It was a great show of different lights including all colors of the rainbow. \u00a0Sometimes the entire waterfall is one color and other times the colors are flowing from one section to the next. \u00a0It was impressive, and I am so glad we decided to come. You can then take the 224 steps to view the waterfall up close and personal\u2026if you can catch your breath. I think that I should get bonus points for hiking up the stairs with  Noah  strapped to me. It may be the best stair stepper ever. I was sure I was going to be sore (and I was!). For those of you who find the hike easy, please don\u2019t comment below, let me relish in the fact that I did it and was quite proud of myself. This was probably my favorite day of the Colorado Springs vacation. \u00a0It included all the things I enjoy, good food,  relaxation , the outdoors and my two favorite boys.

{"date": ",June,25,2011", "body": "One of the best parts of our day is getting to read and pray with Noah right before tucking him in for a good night\u2019s  sleep . We have collected a nice library of  children\u2019s books \u00a0since Noah was born, including this really cool  Goodnight Moon Hallmark Recordable Book \u00a0you see in today\u2019s video. \u00a0What makes this book so special is that Noah\u2019s\u00a0 grandmother \u00a0and two of his uncles are actually reading the story to him. \u00a0Fun, huh? The Hallmark Recordable Storybook Is A Win In Any Child\u2019s Library! Hallmark has  lots of recordable books to choose from (but why wouldn\u2019t anyone want to buy Goodnight Moon?!) and all you have to do is hit a little record button, read the page out loud, and hit the record button once more when your done. \u00a0Simple! \u00a0If you are\u2026ummm\u2026how shall I say this\u2026. technologically impaired , don\u2019t worry\u2026.this is one\u00a0gizmo you (or your child\u2019s grandparents!) won\u2019t have any trouble figuring out. \u00a0Trust me, If you knew Noah\u2019s Grandmother (either one) you\u2019d know if they can do it, so can you! \ud83d\ude42 This book would be an awesome gift to give to your child when you can\u2019t be with them\u2026like when you\u2019re at work, or on a  date night \u00a0with your significant other! \u00a0Or if your child\u2019s grandparents are anything like Noah\u2019s their always asking you for  gift ideas  to spoil your little one rotten with (which is ok\u2026..that\u2019s what Grandma\u2019s do!) \u00a0If that\u2019s the case feel free to forward this post on to them; \u00a0I think one of these Recordable books makes a great grandparents to grandchild present. \u00a0This actually makes a great grandparent gift for Noah because neither of his grandmothers live near him, so these books make a great way for Noah to stay connected to his grandparents. And if you\u2019re looking for another fun and creative book idea be sure to check out this video of Noah being introduced to  The Tickle Monster ; it\u2019s another can\u2019t miss book! My Wife Is A Mommy Super Hero I love watching my wife be a mommy. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0It\u2019s awesome! \u00a0There are no words to describe how great of a mom, wife, doctor, etc\u2026this women is. \u00a0There\u2019s no one I would rather journey through life with then my wife. \u00a0She\u2019s simply great. \u00a0I can honestly say I have never met another person that works as hard (and with such excellence) as she does. \u00a0I think God\u00a0designed\u00a0her with super powers\u00a0because\u00a0she never stops. I know there are many views on the topic of working mothers, gender roles, etc\u2026.and that\u2019s ok. \u00a0However I\u2019ll say this, I\u2019ve watched my wife for the last three and a half years go through residency (grueling), manage our house (seriously, she\u2019s an\u00a0incredible\u00a0chief!), support and love her husband (that\u2019s me), and shatter every\u00a0expectation of what\u00a0I\u00a0imagined\u00a0a good mother would be (to sweet little Noah) \u2014 all at the same time! \u00a0Wow..! Don\u2019t Worry, Be Happy! Some people look at our family, and feel sorry for us. \u00a0I know they do. \u00a0I can sense the \u201csorry-ness\u201d in their voice when they find out our son was  born with\u00a0Down Syndrome . I hope one thing is clear as you browse this website and see our daily\u00a0videos and pictures \u2013 (and the headline of this  interview ) there is\u00a0 no reason  to feel sorry for us. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0I mean it. \u00a0For real. \u00a0Pinky swear. \u00a0Cross my heart, and hope to\u2026..you get it\u2026? \u00a0Our life has never been better. \u00a0Ever. \u00a0We are in a great place. \u00a0Our family is having a blast. \u00a0God is way, way, way, way to good to us! Our friend\u2019s who are also raising a child born with Down syndrome have nicknamed their house \u201c The Fun House \u201d so I don\u2019t want to infringe on their trademark, but I hope it\u2019s clear that our house is full of love\u2026..and fun\u2026.and  God .

With so many organizations (like  GQ Magazine ) printing and promoting ill-informed views, and\u00a0false\u00a0 facts \u00a0about  Down syndrome , I\u2019m grateful for companies like  Nordstrom  that understand and embrace the truth that people with Down syndrome are not \u201c ruined ,\u201d by any means! Rather they are 100% complete. \u00a0Lacking\u00a0nothing. (In fact, they even have a little  something extra .)\u00a0Oh, and as you can see\u2026are very fashionable. I must confess that it wasn\u2019t until after Noah was  born  that my eyes were open to the lack of inclusion of those with \u201cspecial needs\u201d in our  modern  society. \u00a0I often joke with my wife when we\u2019re in Babies R Us that I\u2019m going to ask\u00a0someone, \u201cHey, I noticed that none of your\u00a0advertisements\u00a0have any pictures of babies with Down syndrome in them. \u00a0How come?\u201d \u00a0I\u2019d wait about five seconds before I told them I was just joking around (sort of.) \u00a0The\u00a0awkwardness\u00a0would be priceless! But I\u2019m nice. Down Syndrome Is Ok On a serious note I\u00a0applaud\u00a0organizations\u00a0like Nordstrom, and shows like Glee that do a great job of helping to educate the public that Down syndrome is ok. That people with Down syndrome deserve to be included in every single area of life. \u00a0That they just as much of a human as you or I. \u00a0That you don\u2019t have to be talk down to them. \u00a0That they like to play. \u00a0They like to have  fun . \u00a0And yes, some of them even like to model. They like to do all of the same things that any other person on this planet likes to do. \u00a0They don\u2019t need to be \u201cbabied\u201d or treated like they have some sort of strange sickness. People often tell me they \u00a0praying for Noah, and most of the time I love that! \u00a0We can use all the prayer we can get. But sometimes when people say they are praying for our\u00a0son\u00a0they have this tone in their voice like they are praying for him to be \u201chealed\u201d of the swine flu, or the chicken pox. I jokingly (and I really do say this) say to them, \u201cNo! \u00a0Please don\u2019t pray for our son to be \u2018healed\u2019 of Down syndrome. We really like our son, and would prefer to keep him!\u201d By the way, thanks Nordstrom for showing the world that  inclusion , not  exclusion  is important. \u00a0I saw that Babies R Us also uses Down syndrome models\u2026but only in their \u201cspecial needs\u201d toys catalog. What the heck is a \u201cspecial needs toy\u201d any way? \u00a0A toy is a toy. \u00a0I promise you that an extra\u00a0chromosome\u00a0doesn\u2019t keep a child with Down syndrome from\u00a0wanting to play with\u00a0Legos, Barbies, and G.I. Joes. \u00a0Oh, and Nordstrom, if you ever put out a \u201cspecial needs\u201d clothing\u00a0catalog I\u2019m taking back everything I said in this blog post! \ud83d\ude42 Genetic\u00a0Lesson #021 If you were to \u201ctake away\u201d Down syndrome you would take away our son. \u00a0He would have a\u00a0completely\u00a0different\u00a0genetic\u00a0code, thus being a completely different person. So pray for him to behave, pray for him to come to know God through Christ, pray for him to develop into everything God has created him to be, pray for him to be loving, and kind,\u00a0and pray for the small hole in his heart to close up before we go back to the doctor. But  please  don\u2019t pray for him to be \u201chealed\u201d of Down syndrome. I hope and pray that more\u00a0organizations\u00a0will use a slice of their time,\u00a0energy, resources and platform to showing the world that people with Down syndrome are as fully human as any other person on this planet.

{"date": ",July,23,2011", "body": "[This is part five of our \u201c New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome \u201d series. Be sure to check out the  other posts !] 5 Physical\u00a0Characteristics Of Children Born With Down Syndrome Looking at your precious new addition you may or may not notice anything out of the ordinary about their appearance. \u00a0Your pediatrician however likely knew instantly when they saw your baby that something was  different . They have been trained to pick up on these sometimes subtle differences. A  syndrome  is characteristics that are consistently found together. Frequently this is associated with a change in genetics. \u00a0 Down syndrome  was \u201cdiscovered\u201d by finding consistent features and  physical characteristics  that were consistently together along with a mental disability. The features listed below when present  alone  do not indicate Down syndrome, but when found together suggest this diagnosis. There are several other\u00a0Down syndrome markers at birth, but the ones I\u2019ve listed are some of the easier ones for  new parents  to pick up on their own. I am including the pictures that I used to diagnose Noah. There were two pictures specifically that I saw in the delivery room and recovery that I am fairly certain convinced me that Noah was born with Down syndrome prior to holding him in my arms. In Rick\u2019s version of Noah\u2019s  birth story  he is unaware of my concern as I kept this to myself until my pediatrician came to confirm my  fears . 1. Up Slanted Palpebral Fissures The outer corner of the eye will be turned up rather than down. \u00a0This is sometimes referred to as  almond shaped eyes . \u00a0The shape is also very similar to that of someone of Asian descent. \u00a0 This will likely be the most predominant\u00a0physical feature of Down syndrome as your child grows up. We love these eyes as you can tell by the top of our blog, and it\u2019s actually the best picture to see how the outer corners are pointing up rather than down. Look at your own eyes in the mirror to see how the fissure typically points down. Another beautiful addition to the eyes are  Brushfield spots  which are the white flecks that can be seen close to the periphery of the iris (the colored part) of the eye, and are often described\u00a0as stars. Up\u00a0slanted\u00a0palpebral fissures are one of the most\u00a0obvious\u00a0down syndrome markers at birth. (Noah\u2019s are pretty obvious as you can see in his pictures.) 2. Flat Profile Looking at your baby from the side there will not be much curve from the nose, cheeks or mouth. There is also not much shape to the cheeks when looking at the baby from the front; the cheeks seem to hang on the face. \u00a0This is due to the poor tone in the muscles of the face and is actually a characteristic of  hypotonia  rather than a true\u00a0 Down syndrome marker . \u00a0You can see below that there is not much definition to Noah\u2019s face and his cheeks are just kind of hanging there. \u00a0He frequently has his mouth hanging open as well with his  tongue sticking out , which brings us to the next feature. 3. Protuberant Tongue New parents of children born with Down syndrome often ask \u201cWhy does my baby stick his / her tongue\u00a0out?\u201d The child is frequently sticking out his/her tongue either because of a small mouth, large tongue, or simply poor tone. \u00a0There are some good debates on what causes this which I am not going to get into. \u00a0I got extremely worried when my entire family couldn\u2019t stop talking about how Noah kept sticking his tongue out and how cute it was. Rick likes to repeat my comment (which I said in my head) of \u201cThat\u2019s not cute\u2026.that\u2019s Down syndrome.\u201d \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 There will likely be many  speech therapy  appointments to help your child with Down syndrome keep their tongue in as well as work on speech development. 4. \u00a0Single Palmar Crease People will tell you the  single palmar crease  or  simian crease  is the hallmark physical characteristic of a child born with Down syndrome. It\u2019s a  single crease across the palm of the hand . Despite the theory that this is so common,  only 45% of children  have a simian crease. The absence of this physical characteristic doesn\u2019t mean that your child does not have Down syndrome, but people (including yourself) will try to convince you otherwise while you await  testing . Noah is part of the 55% who  does not  have a simian crease. \u00a0This is again a result of hypotonia as the hand was not held in a tight fist while he/she was growing in the womb.

{"date": ",August,27,2011", "body": "We\u2019ve had a great time this week hanging out in Colorado Springs. I had no idea there was so many  fun  things to do in here. \u00a0We\u2019ve already climbed to the top of  7 falls , went on the  olympic training center tour , played on the  beach , and today we decided to check out the  Focus on the Family campus , and the  United States Air force Academy . Focus On The Family Was Lots Of (Free) Fun We saw a pamphlet for Focus on the Family in our hotel lobby and wasn\u2019t really sure if we wanted to go our not. \u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure what they had other then a really nice bookstore, and since we wanted to maximize our time while on  vacation , I wasn\u2019t really sure if I wanted to take the time to drive down I-25 to their office. We ended up going, and I\u2019m glad we did because it has much more then a large bookstore. \u00a0Best of all it is  free ! \u00a0We were surprised to find out they had a large, fun kids area that felt like you were inside of a cartoon while walking through it. As we were walking around this engrmous place, we saw a sign for an old fashioned soda shop on the wall. \u00a0We assumed it was just a prop since the entire place was themed, but as we turned the corner we were standing inside of an old fashioned soda shop! We decided to order a couple of treats and relax for a minute. \u00a0I ordered their special chocolate shake which they made with old fashioned soda as opposed to milk, and it was great! There was an entire Chronicles of Narnia area, that was really neat. \u00a0As you can see in the video we entered Narnia by walking through the large wardrobe closet! \u00a0They also had a slide that was several stories high and I really wanted to go down it, but you can see that Noah was a little to short to go on it\u2026this time. \u00a0But we will be back! If you are ever driving through Colorado Springs and looking for a fun activity to do with your family, I highly suggest visiting Focus on the Family. \u00a0Not only is it fun, it\u2019s free! \ud83d\ude42 United States Air Force Academy After having fun in Narnia we stopped by the United States Air force Academy. \u00a0I asked via twitter if anyone knew of any fun places to visit in Colorado Springs, and several people said the chapel at the Air Force Academy was a must see, and I agree! \u00a0Even though the chapel was built in 1962 I thought it looked very modern. The inside of the chapel was filled with gorgeous stained glass windows. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t\u2019 get over how amazing the sun shinning through stained glass windows looked inside of the chapel. \u00a0It was so bright and magnificent it seemed fake. The pictures don\u2019t do it justice. As we left I just couldn\u2019t get over how stunning this entire place looked. \u00a0The architecture mixed with the huge white clouds, and bright blue sky sat to the backdrop of the mountains just remind me of how big and powerful God is. \u00a0His creation is simply breathtaking. I typically come to Colorado in the winter and so I mostly think of it as a place you go to ski (or snowboard in my case!) But I\u2019m becoming a fan of Colorado in the summer, there is so much to do and coming from Texas I couldn\u2019t stop taking pictures of the landscape! It was so beautiful. All Vacations Have To Come To An End Today\u2019s the last day of our vacation, and we head back to Texas tomorrow. It\u2019s been nice for Noah to get a break from all of the  physical therapy appointments  and just have some fun. It\u2019s also been nice just to get away and have some fun as a family. I can honestly say I would have never imagined in a million years my life being as fun as it is. There is nothing on Earth that compares to having a family that loves God, and each other. The joy that comes form that is deeper then words can express. We seriously have a great time living this life together. There is no one else on Earth I would want to live this journey with more the my wife and son. I am truly blessed. What do you think about when you think of Colorado? \u00a0Skiing and snowboarding, or do you know about all the summer fun?

{"date": ",September,12,2011", "body": "Today was a big day at our house. Noah beat his all time  sitting record , and sat up so long that I lost count! It nice to see all of those  sitting marathons  and three times a week  therapy  appointments paying off! \ud83d\ude42 Since Noah is our first child I honestly have no idea when a  typical  child is supposed to hit certain milestones. I honestly like not knowing because it allows me to just enjoy Noah for who God created Him to be. I don\u2019t get caught up on comparing my son to other children. \u00a0Instead I find it much more productive (and fun) to spend my day celebrating Noah\u2019s wins! As my wife likes to put it: \u201cWe celebrate, not compare!\u201d I like that. Celebrating Is Fun And today I celebrated. I celebrated all of the wins this little boy has accomplished in his short, eight month life. I celebratedall of the obstacles he has overcome. I celebrated all of his  hard work . While  typical  children are busy taking naps, or holding their own bottle, or doing what ever it is  typical  kids do; \u00a0Noah has been putting in countless hours at his physical therapy sessions. \u00a0He works so hard just to \u201ckeep up\u201d with  typical  kids. My wife, Noah\u2019s\u2019 therapists, and I \u00a0have spent countless hours sitting him in  bumbo chairs , using the  z-vibe , riding  rody horses , and reading  developmental books . I\u2019ve got a front row seat to his three tri-weekly \u00a0therapy appointments. \u00a0I get to see the look on his face as he strains to hold his little head up. I wipe the throw up off of him at almost every appointment because he is working so hard. I\u2019ve watched him fall backwards, forwards, scrape his nose, and bump his head more times then I can remember as he continues to develop his  fine motor skills . This little boy works hard. I remember asking my wife just a few days before I shot this video if she noticed if Noah was had made any big gains in his development . He has been working so hard, surely he should at least be able to stay sitting up on his own by now\u2026right? I felt a little discouraged, but that happens to everyone sometimes. Noah Is Winning Then on the first night of my wife\u2019s new job at the  children\u2019s hospital , it happened. A Win! A big, big,  WIN ! I was holding Noah in a sitting position in front of one of his favorite  toys ;\u00a0\u00a0holding him steady so he didn\u2019t fall backwards. And just like a father teaching his son to ride a bike I started to loosen my grip a little bit. Then a little more\u2026 and a little more\u2026 and just a little bit more\u2026. until my hands weren\u2019t holding him up at all anymore\u2026.! Noah was sitting all by himself\u2026! I couldn\u2019t believe it. \u00a0It was awesome\u2026! I was so excited. I called my wife. I shot video. I texted video. I emailed video. I took pictures. I posted pictures on  Facebook . Tweeted pictures out via  twitter ! I stopped and praised God for how He has worked in Noah\u2019s life. As a dad I can tell you my cheer was louder then ever; not only because I was happy my son finally did it, but because I was sincerely happy for my son. \u00a0I could feel his happiness, and I was deeply happy because I knew he was happy! \u00a0He has worked extremely hard, and had bumped his head countless times. I\u2019m sure he wanted to give up, but he didn\u2019t. \u00a0All of that hard work paid off. \u00a0The moment he relized I was no longer holding on to him I could see it in his little eight month old face\u2026.he knew he had just accomplished something huge. \u00a0He had just accomplished a win! \u00a0And he also knew his daddy was celebrating his win like he had just caught the game winning pass at the Superbowl! \u00a0And I was. I was excited for my little boy, and I let him (and our neighbors) know it! A Win Is A Win No Matter How \u201cSmall\u201d One of the greatest things about being a parent is celebrating wins with your child. \u00a0Sadly, most parents have a hard time with this. \u00a0Let me explain. Most parents do well with celebrating \u201cbig\u201d wins like crawling, walking, sitting up, making the football team, scoring all A\u2019s on their report card, or beating Contra without entering in up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, a, b, a,b, select, start. (If you know what that last one is, congratulations on being a geek like me. And\u2026if you have beat Contra without entering in that code please let me know because I\u2019ve never heard of person who has been able to do it!) Although many parent\u2019s do well celebrating the big wins, they often struggle to celebrate the seemingly  small  wins. (They also usually fail at giving them the three most important  gifts  a parent could ever give their kids.) The wins that happen every day in your house. The ones that require us parents to be extra observant of our children. Maybe it\u2019s catching your child saying \u201cplease, and thank you\u201d to someone, seeing them hold the door open for a mother pushing a stroller into the local grocery store, or something as seemingly simple as their \u00a0baby finally getting the hang of drinking from a  straw . Those are all wins. And all wins deserve to be celebrated. How To Loose At Being A Parent If you want to loose at being a parent (and spouse), here\u2019s how: Always be on the look out to catch your kid doing something wrong. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0Continually tell them what they are doing wrong, how they messed up, and how disappointed you are in them. \u00a0That will do the trick every time! I\u2019ve worked with teenagers for over a decade and I\u2019ve learned that parents often have no problems finding mistakes their kids make. I\u2019ve met a lot of parents who are quick to tell me about all of the things \u00a0\u201cwrong\u201d with their children. How poorly they are doing in school, or how they are grounded for \u201cgoing over\u201d234,000 text messages on last months phone bill. Parent\u2019s seem to have no trouble \u201ccatching\u201d their children doing \u201cbad.\u201d After listening to them tell me about all of the things wrong with their kid, I typically respond by asking them this (convicting) question: \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you caught your kid doing something good?\u201d They are taken back at first when I ask them the question; so I clarify: \u201cInstead of always catching your kids doing something bad, why not try real hard to  catch  them doing something good?\u201d (By the way, I also know some of their children well enough to know this isn\u2019t easy. \u00a0Some parents have to become Dick Tracy if they want to catch their kids doing something good\u2026. but it is possible! ) In fact, the \u201cworse\u201d parents think their children are, the more important it is for parents to celebrate their children\u2019s wins. My next challenge to them is to  catch  their child doing  nine positive wins for \u00a0every one \u201cbad\u201d thing they caught them doing. It\u2019s hard work, but it has rich dividends. The idea of catching and celebrating wins is something I want to make a priority in our home. When parent\u2019s take the time to seek out and celebrate their children\u2019s wins. Everybody\u2019s wins. And that\u2019s what I call  Winning ! Parents, how are you doing in this area? What are some of wins you have caught your children doing, and how did you celebrate them?

{"date": ",September,15,2011", "body": "I\u2019ve heard it said a thousand times that there\u2019s a special bond that exists between parents of children with special needs. \u00a0After almost nine months into this exciting journey and meeting countless parents along the way, I can honestly say I agree. (Although I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s as equally true for all parents.) Two (False) Fears About Raising A Child With Down Syndrome When Noah was  born  one my many fears was that my wife and I were left to this world of  Down syndrome  all alone. (Well, not  really  alone. \u00a0God was well aware of and very active in what we were going through. \u00a0After all He knew about Noah\u2019s extra  chromosome  well before we did.) \u00a0We had lots of friends who had children, but none (at the time) who had children with Down syndrome. \u00a0And now we were  that  family. \u00a0All of our friends told us they  understood , but they couldn\u2019t  really  understand. \u00a0While we were thankful to have such a wonderful group of friends, the thought of not having anyone in our life that could  really  understand what we were going through saddened me. Another fear I had was that our family was going to be so much different than a  typical  family. \u00a0I imagined all of the parents of  typical  children playing at the park with their children talking about whatever it is parents of  typical \u00a0kids talk about (spoiler alert: they talk about the exact same stuff) while my wife and I struggled to find a way to join in on the conversation with them. to them. \u00a0I imagined it going something like this; \u201cWow\u2026your little guy has two arms?! Cool! Our son Noah has two arms also!\u201d After all, our life was going to be so different from theirs. \u00a0Right? \u00a0It was going to be so hard to find things that our family had in common with other families. \u00a0Right? It turns out I was wrong on both accounts. In fact I learned some valuable lessons about parenting in the first few months after Noah was born. \u00a0You may (or may not) have a child with  born with\u00a0Down syndrome , but I think these two lessons are useful to any parent. Lesson 1 \u2013 Your Imagination Is Much Lonelier Place Than Reality Shortly after brining Noah home from the hospital we got linked up with a couple ( Joel and Emily ) whose middle son, Seth, was born with Down syndrome. \u00a0(No offense to any of you with a 3 year old, but Seth was seriously the cutest 3 year old we had ever seen! ) \u00a0We spoke over email,  Facebook , telephone, and text message and quickly became close friends. \u00a0Several months later we took Noah on his  first vacation  down to Houston so we could all hang out. \u00a0I\u2019ll never forget how they treated us like we were part of their family. I\u2019ll be honest, there were tears that day. \u00a0My wife and I had a lot of emotions, and it was good to cry with someone who  really  understood what we were going through. \u00a0In fact as I was writing this I realized something; that was the last time I cried as it relates to Noah and his Down syndrome diagnosis. \u00a0That also happened to be the first family that we had been around since Noah was born who could  honestly  say, \u201cI understand.\u201d \u00a0Hmmm..maybe there\u2019s something to that. We continue to be close friends with Joel, Emily, and their family. \u00a0In fact Noah and I got to take Joel to  In-N-Out Burger  today while he was in town visiting family. \u00a0As you can see Noah loves Joel (and vise versa.) Since then I have met literally hundreds of families who are on the same journey as us. \u00a0Some of them may have different pit stops along the way, but we\u2019re on the same journey none the less. \u00a0I\u2019ve met them in person. \u00a0I\u2019ve met them through this website. I\u2019m met them on Facebook. \u00a0I\u2019ve met them on  Twitter . \u00a0(I\u2019ve even met them at a  resort  in Colorado!) It doesn\u2019t really matter  where  I\u2019ve met them, what matters is  that  I\u2019ve met them. \u00a0They exist! \u00a0 We\u2019re not alone! \u00a0 And if you are a parent raising a child born with Down syndrome (or even if you\u2019re not) you aren\u2019t alone either. \u00a0Although it may seem at times like you are at time, you aren\u2019t. \u00a0I promise. \u00a0(Just visit  Noah\u2019s Facebook \u00a0page if you ever doubt that. \u00a0There are lots of great parents just waiting to met you!) Lesson 2 \u2013 Your Family Is Much More \u201cNormal\u201d Than You Think As we got to know Joel and Emily I would often say to my wife; \u201cWow\u2026their family sure looks normal!\u201d I mean after all, they have a child who was born with Down syndrome; aren\u2019t they supposed to be \u2018taking care of him\u2019 or something? \u00a0How can they be playing the Wii\u2026? They have a sick kid..! (Oh, and it turns out Down syndrome isn\u2019t a  sickness . \u00a0The flu is a sickness. \u00a0The chicken pox is a sickness. \u00a0But Down syndrome isn\u2019t a  sickness . Turns out it\u2019s actually a  blessing ! \u00a0See, I told you I didn\u2019t much much about all of this at first. \u00a0I\u2019m learning, just like you.) After getting to know Joel and Emily (and about a thousand other families) I quickly realized our family wasn\u2019t all that different than a  typical  family. \u00a0Sure we may go to a few more  therapy  appointments than a  typical  family. \u00a0We may met our medical deductible quicker than a  typical \u00a0family. \u00a0We may have to go to more parent teacher conferences then a  typical  family. (If you don\u2019t have a child with Down syndrome I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s sort of an inside joke!) \u00a0And we may be much more sensitive to the  \u201cR word\u201d  than a  typical  family. \u00a0But the truth of the matter is we have much more in common with a  typical  family than I initially assumed. If you\u2019re a  new parent ,\u00a0and you were hoping having a child with Down syndrome automatically qualified you to be the strangest couple in your neighborhood, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you. \u00a0 You\u2019re still going to have to wake up at all hours of the\u00a0night to  feed  your crying baby. \u00a0You\u2019re still going to have to change diapers (yes, kids with Down syndrome poop and pee just like  typical  babies\u2026Gasp!) \u00a0You\u2019re even still going to have to give him  baths \u2026.yes, like with real water! \u00a0Don\u2019t worry, contrary to what you may read on the internet, they won\u2019t melt\u2026! When Noah was first born I spend countless hours reading \u201cstuff\u201d online trying to figure out what sort of special things you had to do to take care of a \u00a0child with Down syndrome. \u00a0I figured there had to be a  special list , right? \u00a0I imagined it looking sort of like this: \n Never expose him to bright light. \n Never get him wet. \n And the most important thing, the one thing you must never forget: no matter how much he cries, no matter how much he begs\u2026never, never feed him after midnight. \n Turns out that once again my initial assumption was wrong. It should be noted, that I have also met a lot of  weird \u00a0families since Noah was born. \u00a0Let me assure you, in the kindest way I can: \u201c\u2026those families aren\u2019t weird because they have a child born with Down syndrome.. \u00a0Those families are weird because they\u2019re just weird.\u201d Straight up. If you are a parent raising a child born with Down syndrome (or other special need) please know that although it may feel at first like your family is going to be  that  family, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you. \u00a0You aren\u2019t. \u00a0(At least not to because of your new addition. \u00a0See paragraph directly above.) Those are two fears of mine that didn\u2019t come true. What about you? What are some of the fears you had when you first became a parent (or a parent of a child with special needs) that never came true? \u00a0Please take a second to leave a comment; what you have to say could be just what someone else needs to hear. \ud83d\ude42 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://funhouseblog.com/", "http://facebook.com/noahsdadcom", "http://twitter.com/noahsdaddotcom", "http://facebook.com/noahsdadcom/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T549VoLca_Q"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/fears/", "title": "Two Parenting Fears That Never Came True"},
{"date": ",July,21,2011", "body": "A funny thing happened  when I had Noah . My abdomen, which was not all that impressive to start, became an uninvited stranger. I hardly recognize what I see in the mirror. I swear there\u2019s not a baby in there despite what people may think. I haven\u2019t been able to start a consistent exercise routine, so my abdomen continues to be a problem. \u00a0Noah, however, inspired me today. Noah did some moves in  physical therapy  that I am fairly certain I could not do myself. The crunches he performed on the ball were nothing but impressive. My abdomen ached for him. We have seen such advancements in his  core strength  while mine remains the same. \u00a0If you put him at a little bit of a slant, he is able to pull himself up the rest of the way with his core strength. \u00a0If my little man has been able to develop this type of strength, what the heck have I been doing. What Is Diastasis Recti A very common finding in  Down syndrome  is  diastasis recti . When you are looking at your baby\u2019s belly you see a strip or ridge running up the middle. It is a separation between the left and right side of the rectus abdominis muscle (muscle running right down the middle of your abdomen) It is just another sign of weakness in the core. Noah has a very obvious one at times. \u00a0It is one of the  physical characteristics of Down syndrome  but is seen frequently in premature and typical infants. \u00a0It is not something to worry about as it will most likely correct on its own as the muscles  develop . So, does anyone have a favorite post-pregnancy workout to help a momma out? I need to keep up with my son. \ud83d\ude42 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/core/", "title": "Noah\u2019s Abs Are Stronger Than His Mom\u2019s"},
{"date": ",September,11,2011", "body": "If you\u2019re a parent of a child  born with Down syndrome  chances are you\u2019ve been to so many physical therapy (and occupational therapy, and speech therapy!) appointments you feel like you could be a physical therapist yourself! \u00a0Just trying to remember when the appointments are can be a job itself, and then there all are those exercises. \u00a0(Has anyone else ever left a thearpy appointment asking their self, \u201cNow what did she say I was supposed to do?\u201d \ud83d\ude42 One Major Goal Of Physical Therapy It\u2019s easy to fill overwhelmed and stressed out about your child\u2019s development. \u00a0But have you ever wondered what the goal of all that hard work is? I recently came across a great article about physical therapy for our kids that helped me to understand what I should hope for when it comes to Noah\u2019s physical therapy. \u201c The Goals and Opportunity of Physical Therapy for Children with Down Syndrome \u201d is by Patricia Winders. \u00a0(Who also wrote a fantastic book on  gross motor skills \u00a0which I mentioned on the\u00a0 resource pag e.)\u00a0Her article put things into perspective for me since I really did consider  physical therapy \u00a0as an aid in helping Noah achieve his motor milestones at an  advanced  pace. Her article says: \u201cThe  goal of physical therapy  is to  minimize  the development of the compensatory movement patterns that children born with down syndrome are prone to develop\u201d. So that\u2019s what they have been doing!! \u00a0They could care less  when  Noah achieves his milestones, they just want to make sure that he is doing them  correctly! What\u2019s The Point Of All This Sitting? It also helped explain a lot of what I am seeing in physical therapy lately with what we like to call the \u201c sitting marathon .\u201d \u00a0I\u2019ve\u00a0mentioned earlier that we are working on Noah  sitting up straight  and developing his  core . \u00a0The article says: \u201c\u2026children with down syndrome typically learn to sit with a  posterior pelvic tilt , trunk rounded and the head resting back on the shoulders.\u201d Imagine a giant C with their head propped on their back. \u00a0The article goes on to explain that the physical therapists will provide this support until the child is able to do this on their own. They will work their way down the trunk until they get to the waist and eventually the pelvis, while the child is learning to keep proper alignment and stability. Hmm, this is all starting to make sense now! \u00a0I don\u2019t want Noah  sitting  the wrong way, I want him sitting the right way\u2026so I\u2019ll continue to be patient. \ud83d\ude42 A Bonus of Physical Therapy I Never Knew About The article leaves you with one other benefit you can get out of the experience of  physical therapy  (or any therapy). He helps you to understand early on how your child learns. By watching your child achieve their milestones  THE CORRECT WAY  you will figure out what methods work and what doesn\u2019t to help your child in other areas of his/her life. I\u2019m a very visual learner. \u00a0If you show me something, I usually have no problem replicating it. \u00a0It\u2019s why I excelled in the clinical stages of my medical training rather than the sit-in-the-classroom part. \u00a0From what I am reading, this tends to be common in children with Down syndrome as well. Noah is motivated by  toys  and by people\u2019s faces. This boy will sit up to grab our faces any day of the week. I know that children born with Down syndrome may learn  differently  than a  typical child , but they are  fully capable  of learning that task or information if you figure out  how  to teach them. \u00a0This is why eventually an  individualized learning plan  (ILP) will be your best friend, as the school  HAS  to teach your child the way  they  will best learn. If you are a little ahead of the game by knowing what works for your child, imagine how much more you will get out of your ILP. Those are posts for a later time though \ud83d\ude42 The article I referenced in this post contains a list of things Patricia has noticed in her experience with Down syndrome on how they learn. It was great read. Thanks Patricia for all of the helpful information!! What were some of the surprises you experienced as a result of your child physical, occupational, or speech therapy \u00a0What are some of the ways you are learning about how your child learns?

{"date": ",September,10,2011", "body": "We work on  sitting  every time we go to our  physical therapy  sessions. Noah has hit new  sitting records , has found great assistants such as  sand  and  toys , and has knocked his head more than once. Do you ever ask youself if all this practice really helps? \u00a0Is it worth it? Practice Makes Perfect I was cruising around my favorite  resource  on the internet  Down Syndrome Education Online  and found some interesting  down syndrome facts . For one, your child  WILL  learn how to sit. Woo Hoo for us. They  will  learn how to walk, and do  all  of the  fine motor  tasks that you EXPECT them to do. However, it is not at the same pace as a  typical  child.  Children born with Down syndrome  will learn their milestones in the same sequence as a  typical  child but at a slower rate. They will also require more practice to get it perfect. Hence us practicing sitting every single day. There are multiple studies showing that with a little more practice a child with Down syndrome will learn and be able to perform that specific task. This will be true with everything, they just need a little extra practice. Celebrate Don\u2019t Compete Another fact is that there is a greater variability for when chidren will achieve their milestones. For example a  typical  child may  sit up  from 5-9 months, but a child born with down syndrome has a span of 8-16 months. The main reasons for this variability is that: One, we are a smaller population and, two, there is a large chunk of that population that is getting surgery or having  medical concerns  in the first few months which delays  development . Rick and I frequently say that each child is an individual and will develop at  their  own pace. They will reach their milestones when  they  are ready. Some will do it faster or slower than others, but be sure to  celebrate \u00a0every achievement your child makes (no matter how seemingly small) and try your best not to compete! I know it\u2019s a hard temptation to resist, but you can do it. \u00a0Early Intervention And Down Syndrome \u2013 Is It Worth It? An interesting fact on the site I mentioned above stated that their is no evidence that early intervention works. WHAT???? I actually kind of  laughed  at this. They have done studies which show that those in early intervention and those who are not involved  will  achieve milestones at the same rate. They think the biggest benefit from early intervention is, one you practice a lot, and two you encourage. Both of those aspects have been proven to help with development. Interesting huh? Expectations My favorite quote from the article that I read was: \u201cDown syndrome did affect the rate at which new skills were mastered, it did not affect the upper limit of the skills achieved.\u201d You better watch out Noah, your mom is on to how much you are capable of achieving, and we are just getting started! \ud83d\ude42 Are you sick of practicing anything yet?

The first of these goodbyes is Jill. \u00a0Jill\u2019s a\u00a0 physical therapy  student touring this side of the country doing clinicals. \u00a0She worked with Noah (and us) all summer at  Our Children\u2019s House at Baylor \u00a0and\u00a0sadly her time in Dallas is coming to an end. We were  blessed \u00a0by her love for our son, and all of the encouragement she gave us. \u00a0Noah adores her, especially her hair. He always lights up when she comes to get him from the waiting area prior to his physical therapy appotinment. Jill\u2019s Job Jill was a great motivator for Noah. She was able to keep him focused on the task at hand such as doing  sit ups , playing with  toys , or walking on the  treadmill . One of Jill\u2019s tasks was to look into the various research that has been done on the use of using a\u00a0treadmill\u00a0in physical therapy for \u00a0children  born with Down syndrome . She got to hold him over the treadmill for his  first attempt  as we put all her research into action. \u00a0Today she had her work cut out for her as she was doing a  Peabody assessmen t on Noah. \u00a0(Be sure to check out tomorrow\u2019s post, as I\u2019ll be explaining what the Peabody assessment is all about.) Medical Professionals Couldn\u2019t Do It Without You I don\u2019t know if any of you have been involved with the education of medical professionals. As a Doctor, I can tell you we can only learn so much from  books . \u00a0We have to get first hand experience, and we get this by doing clinicals just like Jill. I would not have learned much in my career if people refused to let students or residents be a part of their care. It was always fun to let little patients know they were my teachers, however I know it can be  scary  (and sometimes annoying) for parents. It usually means that you\u2019re going to have to  tell  your  story  3 different times as each level comes to assess your child. It also means you\u2019re going to  hear  3 different explanations of what\u2019s going to happen to your child. Ok parents, now for the good news: I promise there is  someone  there overseeing everything that\u2019s going on with your child. \u00a0I speak from experience when I say I know it can be frustrating at times trying to figure out who that  someone  is. \u00a0But you can take a deep breath and trust that your child will be taken care of. \u00a0I want to say  thank you  to all of those parents who trusted me to learn from their children. I hope you also take pride in the fact that you have helped shape their (and my) future. \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 Thank You For Everything Jill! I am glad that we were a part of Jill\u2019s education. I hope we were able to teach her a little something about  Down syndrome  and how much  fun  it is to help these children attain their  goals . I am positive she will go on to make a significant impact on other families. We will miss her bright smiling face, her love for our family (and our son), and the genuine care she had for the families she got to work with\u2026and Noah\u2019s definitely going to miss her long blonde braid! \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 \u00a0We want to wish Jill the best of luck in her future career!

Before Noah was\u00a0 born , I saw a movie about every week. I think I\u2019ve only seen four since Noah became my entertainment. Noah\u2019s way more fun than a movie, so I\u2019m not complaining. \ud83d\ude42 Noah\u2019s first movie was Gnomeo and Juliet. I convinced my  best friend  that she needed to take her\u00a0two younger sisters to the movie as well. My theory was that there would be other kids there and if it ended in disaster everyone would understand. I wrapped him in the  Moby  and he  almost   slept  through the entire movie. \u00a0He started fussing during the last 15 minutes but I was able to calm him down as I walked in the hallway. So\u2026I was able to watch the entire movie\u2026.just not from my seat! Despite how well he did, I was nervous the entire time and didn\u2019t enjoy the movie as much as I usually do. \u00a0So basically I decided that all of that worry wasn\u2019t worth the ten dollars it cost! Besides\u2026we\u2019d have more  fun \u00a0just hanging out at home. I Should Have Listened My love for movies gets the best of me and I\u2019m convinced that I\u201dll be able to enjoy a movie the next time we go. \u00a0So Itry again\u2026 Rick and I have tried to go to the movies twice with Noah. \u00a0Both times I\u2019ve had to leave during the movie to\u00a0feed Noah. (I was breastfeeding so I was in the hallway or the bathroom\u2026I know I know.) I have no idea how those two movies ended. \u00a0Not only did I miss the endings, but the parts I did get to watch I couldn\u2019t really enjoy. \u00a0I was on the edge of my seat the entire time due to Noah. \u00a0Any movement or squeak he made took my attention away from the movie and on to Noah as I searched for a pacifier, considered\u00a0 feeding  him, or taking him out and rocking him to try and keep him from having an  outburst . \u00a0 He has never had an outburst, but I\u2019m convinced the movie will be the first place this will occur. New Ideas I have figured out two other methods to try (notice I am still refusing to listen). One is to take the baby in the evening when they are typically down for the night. Noah is nearly impossible to wake once he is asleep. I\u201dll  never  judge the late night moviegoers again. The baby will likely sleep through the entire movie. \u00a0We have not tried this method yet, so my opinion may change. The other method I tried today. We went to a movie that opened weeks ago\u2026 on a weekday\u2026 in the afternoon! Noah and I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean on Monday afternoon. \u00a0I was only able to get a few seconds of video of our adventure as I did not want to be accused of pirating. \ud83d\ude42 We were the only ones in the theater so we could be as loud as we wanted. Who cared that he wanted to  talk  to Johnny Depp. I also swear that he was actually interested in what was occurring on the big screen for about five minutes. It was similar to being at home and I enjoyed every minute of the movie. That was until the credits started rolling and an older gentleman exited the theater\u2026where in the world was he hiding the whole time!? Play Time After the movie, Noah and I went home. \u00a0He continues to love playing on the  texture blanket  my best friend made. \u00a0He may not be close to crawling but he can get anywhere he wants by rolling. \u00a0One day I left him for about 30 seconds and when I came back in the room he had rolled under the sofa\u2026! This day gave me a glimpse of the days to come as my schedule will be more of Noah and less of  work . \u00a0I cannot wait for all of our future dates. Have you tried taking your baby to a movie?

It never fails that someone in my family cries during goodbyes. I am not going to lie, it is often me and it has only increased since Noah was  born . It seems like only yesterday we were having a  party in the backyard , but sadly today we had to say good bye. We were able to fit in some quality time before hitting the road. Noah got to check out the boat for the first time. Grandpa can\u2019t wait to take him fishing. It may be a little while before we let him be in a boat on actual water. \u00a0Grandpa has a pond in his backyard so they can fish to their heart\u2019s content out there. Grandparents are pretty helpful when you have a baby and I appreciate all that they do for us. They stayed with us when Noah was  born , and I am not quite sure how we would have survived without them there. They made sure we ate and kept the house functioning while we were dealing with everything.

Next Stop: Noah Needs a New Friend We were a little ahead of schedule so we stopped and did some shopping. We thought that Noah needed a  Build-A-Bear  to celebrate his first real vacation.

His wife is an AMAZING cook so she whipped up quite the meal for us. One very nice thing about family is  hand-me-downs . Sadie was nice enough to look through her stuff and pass down clothes and  toys  to Noah. There is plenty more for the future too, we just couldn\u2019t fit it in the car (or our apartment right now). Guy and I hit up the  iPad  while Sadie entertained Noah with one of his new toys. As we have mentioned he loves things that light up so this was right up his ally. I rarely get to hang out with my brother on my own, so this was a nice treat before heading home. \u00a0He is a pretty awesome big brother. \u00a0He used to invite me up to stay with him when he was in college, how many big brothers do that? \u00a0Hopefully he will venture down to Texas one of these days (hint, hint) Sweet, Peaceful, Sleeping Baby\u2026 Noah was  resting peacefully  with his new blankie (thanks to Guy nicely passing this down to him), when all of sudden he did something he has not done in months. HE WOKE UP!!!! Oh wait, his father picked him up and cuddled with him which just happened to also wake the poor child up. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??? So now Noah wanted to  eat ,  play , and act like it was the middle of the afternoon. \u00a0After about an hour, Noah was back peacefully sleeping as were his parents.

We want to apologize for our lack of updates on the site. \u00a0There are lots of exciting things going on in our world (which you will be hearing about in coming updates!) and we have had to limit our time on the site while we work on them. \u00a0Rest assured we have continued to daily capture\u00a0videos and images and will be posting them (hopefully in rapid succession) soon so that we stay true to our vision to create and post a daily one minute video about what life is like raising a son  born with Down syndrome !

Noah however, thinks it is  fun  to get his hands all over the pages and what better way to help out his  sensory  development then with touch and feel  books . I am a huge fan of Priddy Books, who published \u201c B is for Bear .\u201d I like this book because there are 26 pages of fun rather then just a few. Each page has its own large picture, and the majority have  textures . Noah seemed to like W is for wet the best. He especially like touching the fascinating  textures  \u201cbubbles\u201d made of glitter all over the page. I don\u2019t know if Noah likes pounding the hard pages or actually feeling the tectures. \u201c Pat the Bunny \u2018 is another classic touch and feel book. I remember being facinated by this book as a kid as the beard felt just like my  dad\u2019s . \u00a0I however don\u2019t know whose finger fits in that ring. \ud83d\ude42 We are finding all sorts of ways to help Noah with his  sensory development , but more on that later. \u00a0You will have to wait in suspense for our future posts.

Without a doubt this has been the best seven months of our lives. I can\u2019t even explain to you how fun it is to live life with my amazing wife, and sweet little son. \u00a0I seriously wish I had time to tell you about all the incredible ways God has been working in our life. It\u2019s mind-blowing! Fun With Friends Noah had a busy (but fun) day today. During the afternoon he and my wife had a  play-date  with Lilly and Laura. \u00a0Laura\u2019s making Noah a really fun (and very useful) texture quilt. Sensory development is important for any child during the first year of their life. A texture quilt is basically a quilt made out of many different kinds of fabrics; smooth, rough, soft, plush, etc, that touches the babies skin as he plays on it. It\u2019s perfect for sensory development. Thanks, Laura! Noah Hangs With The Big Boys Abbie had to work a late shift tonight so Noah, my friend J.D, and I headed to Ft. Worth for a night on the town. One of my favorite restaurants is  Joe T. Garcias  in Ft. Worth. I\u2019ll be honest, it doesn\u2019t have the best mexican food in town, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a cooler atmosphere. You eat in someone\u2019s huge backyard surrounded by pools, music, and gardens\u2026how cool is that?

I\u2019m pretty sure this was the first time Noah has ever been out past 9 p.m. and I have a confession to make. \u00a0I used to judge parents who had their kids out  late\u00a0 (or brought them into a movie.) I don\u2019t any more. \ud83d\ude42 Now on to Dad lesson #203, which I learned tonight. No matter how manly of a dad you think you are, two guys wearing  Sperry\u2019s , and khaki shorts while hanging out downtown without their wives, pushing a baby stroller (with a baby in it) and carrying a diaper bag, will cause both of you stand out from the crowd. So be prepared. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about that. \ud83d\ude42 What\u2019s one of the most embarrassing (or just plain odd) situations you\u2019ve been in since becoming a parent? \u00a0I want to hear your story !

{"date": ",August,20,2011", "body": "Grandpas  are pretty awesome. My dad would do just about anything for Noah. One thing that is important to him is to learn how to communicate with Noah as he gets older and is learning to  talk . \u00a0There is a lot of research showing the effectiveness of sign language in children born with  down syndrome , so our entire family is in the process of learning a new language \u2013 sign language! He was insistant on bringing home the  Baby Signing Time videos  during our library storytime visit so he could catch up. We have one of the videos at home and have been trying to figure this stuff out. (Fun Fact: Rick \u201crandomly\u201d took a year of American Sign Language while earning his undergraduate degree. \u00a0Pretty neat to see how God had this planned out all along.) We sat back and watched the videos with his grandpa and Noah \u00a0started signing away\u2026just kidding. Noah is not quite into TV so he just enjoyed sitting with Grandpa. Incorporating signing into our daily life is HARD. Grandpa was always reminding us to sign when we offered him milk. I wish he had come home with us as we don\u2019t do too hot on our own. Baby Sign Language: To Do, Or Not To Do? That Is The Question. I am not going to lie, but as a  pediatrician  I am torn on the idea of baby signing. There are three theories, one that it will slow speech progression as there is no need to learn your words since you have a sign for them, and the others being that there is no delay to it helps advance speech development. If I had a  typical developing  child, I would not have bothered with sign language. The studies cannot state clear conclusions on the benfit or harm of sign language for a typical child yet. However there are promising studies for  children born with Down syndrome . You are likely familiar that children with Down syndrome can learn language slowly, however a nice scientist named Miller showed that when sign was added there was no difference in aquired language between typical children and those with Down syndrome. Language being either a sign or a word. Pretty awesome conclusion. \u00a0That information encourages me to try sign language\u2026if I could just remember to actually do it! We want others to be able to communicate with Noah as well and that fact that his grandparents are already learning sign means the world to us. One of the reasons that the studies are not giving clear conclusions for typical children is that it is hard to determine if other factors are impacting speech development. Things like parent-child interaction including simply singing or reading bedtime stories can improve speech. \u00a0The studies are finding it hard to control for these conditions and determine that sign is the real reason these children have advanced speech development. Langauge is definately an individualized learning experience and I am fairy certain that you will be able to figure things out to help your child. Hanging Out In Downtown Aspen We spent the day singing, signing, and playing in downtown Aspen. I can\u2019t wait until Noah can strap on some skies (or a snowboard!) and have some real fun. One of Rick\u2019s favorite lunch items is a BLT and  Boogie\u2019s Burgers  in downtown Aspen makes some of the best! After lunch we ended up at one of the most  fun  places in all of downtown Aspen \u2013  The Aspen Candy Company ! I wanted one (or two) of everything. Ok,so \u00a0maybe there was one thing in the store I didn\u2019t want to try. As you can see after finding Noah a cute hat, he was ready to go home. And\u2026it\u2019s time to go! And by the time we got home it wasn\u2019t long before Noah was sound asleep, looking as  cute  as ever. What are your thoughts on Baby Sign Language?

{"date": ",September,8,2011", "body": "The time right before Noah goes to  sleep  is the sweetest time of my day. \u00a0My wife and I take time to hold him and read to him from  The Jesus Storybook Bible  (which by the way is awesome!) \u00a0Afterwords we hold his tiny little hands and pray with him. \u00a0We look forward to it the entire day. \u00a0It\u2019s such an amazing time we get to share with our child as he is growing up. \u00a0This is what we call keeping the main thing,  the main thing ! Before I tell you about the three free gifts any parent can give their child (for free) I want to tell you about of the greatest gifts a  child  can give to his  parents. \u00a0 This gift is awesome, and trust me\u2026you\u2019ll want this gift! A Parent\u2019s Greatest Gift One of the greatest gifts a parent receives from their children is the opportunity (and responsibility) to see their children come to know and understand God. I often imagined what it would be like one day to cuddle up next to my little one and read to him the great historical accounts of how God has worked in centuries past. Creation. The faithfulness of Noah. The great flood. The splitting of the Red Sea. The passover account. God\u2019s faithfulness to Israel despite their unfaithfulness. The incredible Gospel narratives. The choosing of the disciples, and the great hope that brings to guys like me. God\u2019s incredible conversion of Paul. The understanding of God\u2019s new covenant with us. How we are no longer strangers, but friends of God. How only God can taken something broken and useless, and make it into a Masterpiece. How God completely and totally redeems our life, and gives a joy that few on Earth can totally understand. The Bible is very clear about our responsibility as parents to foster our children\u2019s Spiritual growth (Deut 6:5-9) and trust me when I say it\u2019s a responsibility that brings with it deep joy. It\u2019s awesome how God planned the whole thing out. It\u2019s a gift to us to our children grow in their understanding of God, and it\u2019s a gift to our children to understand God. \u00a0Amazing! Another crazy thing about all of this is you don\u2019t get your  gift  before you give your children theirs. \u00a0In fact your  gift  is dependent upon  giving  these three  gifts . \u00a0Don\u2019t worry they\u2019re free! Oh, and trust me. \u00a0Your kids will like these three gifts even better then an  iPad ! You ready? \u00a0Here we go. Free Gift #1 \u2013 Teaching Your Child To Have Total Dependance Upon God\u00a0 When Noah was  born  I made a commitment to pray for him every single day. Now God isn\u2019t going to get upset at me if I forget, or get a headache and turn in early. I don\u2019t get earn some kind of  God brownie points \u00a0or anything wacky like that (to quote Chris Rock, \u201cYou don\u2019t get brownie points for something your\u00a0 supposed \u00a0to do!) \u00a0\u00a0I just know how powerful, and priceless prayer is. When we pray we are showing our dependance upon God. \u00a0As you pray with your children you are modeling that dependency \u00a0for them. Children watch their parents like a hawk, and they learn to develop their habits (both good and bad.) \u00a0As they watch and learn from you the hope is they to would develop a life long attitude of dependance on God. It changes ours (and our children\u2019s life). \u00a0It\u2019s epic. And it costs you and I nothing (expect some time.) \u00a0What a great privilege we have as parents to interact with the Creator of the cosmos on our child\u2019s behalf! Pray for your children\u2019s future. Pray for their present. \u00a0Pray for their  love  of God to grow \u00a0Pray when they are sick. \u00a0Teach them to pray for others who are hurting. \u00a0Teach them to confess when they blow it (which means you to have to confess when you blow it. \u00a0And yes, we parents sometimes blow it.) Do you have a habit of praying with your children? I hope so. Free Gift #2 \u2013 YOU I have worked with teenagers for over a decade now and it saddens me to see so many dads miss out on this incredible season of life. \u00a0I\u2019ve met countless teenagers would tell you the gift they want\u00a0more then anything else in the world (even more then an iPad or Playstation) is simply a dad who they can have a relationship with. I would add to that, a dad who is\u00a0 committed\u00a0 to the Spiritual\u00a0development of their family. Sadly, I don\u2019t have a single childhood memory of my father reading The Bible to me, praying with me, or taking me to church. While I certainly missed out on something special, it was my dad who really missed out. So dads my challenge to you is this: take time every day to teach your kids about God. Pray with your children. Go to church with your children. Read The Bible with and to your children. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything super \u201cspiritual\u201d or \u201cweird.\u201d (People always want to seem to get weird when The Bible is involved for some reason\u2026Don\u2019t be weird.) Just make it a part of your daily routine. Noah is a  baby  now, so I don\u2019t have many choices other than to hold him in my arms while we  read  and pray. As he gets older we\u2019ll certainly change that up. Variety is important in anything,\u00a0So get creative! Maybe go for a walk to the local McDonalds for an  ice-cream  cone with your 11 year old. \u00a0As you are walking ask him to tell you his top three questions about God/The Bible (which also means you have to spend some time reading yourself!) As you give your little one year old girl a bath, talk to her. As you scrub his her arm and legs remind her that God created those little limbs. That she was made in the very image of God, and that God specifically and purposely knitted her to together in her mommies womb. Remind her that she is  greatly  loved by God. \u201cEach day of our lives we make depostis into the memory banks of our children.\u201d \n -Chuck Swindoll I know there are lots of parents who are already living this out, and to you say, keep it up! Your investment now will reap great dividends that will stick with your children for the rest of their life! For others, this is an area that has been a struggle. You haven\u2019t been consistent with your walk with God in your own life. Guess what? \u00a0With God (as long as you are still living) it\u2019s never to late! Never. Free Gift #3 \u2013 Two Words To my fellow parents, let me give you two words that you need to memorize and say often: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d You may have to apologize to your children for not stepping up and fulfilling your God given responsibility to develop them in their Spiritual journey. However, it\u2019s worth all of the  hard work . \u00a0Your life (and your children\u2019s) will never be the same. There\u2019s no perfect family, and no two families are the same. God is interested in telling a very unique story through  your family . A  story  He isn\u2019t any telling through any other family on this planet. \u00a0He wants to use your family. \u00a0Your  story . In a way you will never understand this side of Heaven. No matter what your past five years (or past fifteen years) have been like why not make a commitment  today  to invest in your child\u2019s spiritual journey. Turn the tv off. Unplug the internet. Shut the phone down. Do whatever you have to do to be certain you (and your child) don\u2019t miss out on one of the best gifts a parent could ever give a child; a parent who helps cultivate their child\u2019s spiritual journey. You can do it! In fact God created you to do it.\u00a0 And I promise, even though they may not know it now, your children will come to appreciate these three free gifts more than any\u00a0 i device . \u00a0I promise. What are some of the things your family has done to help your children grow in their relationship with God?

{"date": ",September,5,2011", "body": "This time last year I remember wondering what it would be like to take our little boy to birthday  parties . It seemed so far away. It seemed like something reserved for \u201colder\u201d people. Little Kid Parties, Grown Up Talk I wondered what parents did while their little munchkins were consuming countless pounds of birthday cake. \u00a0 I attended my fair share of birthday parties growing up, and if my memory served me correctly all the mommies would hang out in the  play  room with their little ones, while the dads gathered in the back yard to drink Coors Light, talk about grills (the kind you cook on), how hard their latest home improvement project was , and how bad things have been at the office. Yuck! I don\u2019t drink beer, thankfully don\u2019t have to run the corporate \u201crat race\u201d at some  office , and my last home improvement project involved me spending four days trying to recover 1.5 Terabyte of data from one of my hard drives! \u00a0Not to mention I still take bubble baths (seriously!) \u00a0So I\u00a0imagined being doomed to a life time of taking to Noah to parties while I sat in the corner reading RSS feeds on my  iPhone . Awesome. Thankfully I had it all wrong\u2026.. Nerds Make Everything Better Turns out that nerds have kids. And those kids have birthdays. \u00a0And those birthdays need parties! \n WINNING! John Dyer  is one of my best friends, and author of  From The Garden to the City: The Redeeming and Corrupting Power of\u00a0 Technology \u00a0 is one of the nerdiest guys I know. \u00a0If you want even more proof, check out his  web development  site. \u00a0 Even I need an interpreter  to translate some of the stuff on there! (By the way, I\u2019m using \u201cnerd\u201d in its greatest sense!) Not only is John a nerd (like me) but he also has two adorable children, and an amazing, caring wife. When Noah was  born  she put together a  care calendar \u00a0which arranged for three months of meals while we processed everything. Those first few months were one of the hardest times of our life, and we\u2019ll never  forget  how much she  blessed  us by taking the time to do that. Noah Rocked His First Birthday Party! Noah was super pumped when he got an invite to attend their daughters first birthday party!  And it rocked!  \u00a0 Noah had a ton of  fun , and I learned something new about John, he bakes awesome birthday cakes! One of the things they did that I thought was really cool was make several cakes, one being a \u201csmash cake.\u201d What\u2019s a smash cake? Well, it\u2019s just what it sounds like. It\u2019s a cake\u2026that you can smash! They made one cake for everyone to eat, and another for their daughter to SMASH! It was awesome. I think I\u2019m going to steal that idea. After all, creativity\u00a0 is \u00a0forgetting where you saw it. \ud83d\ude42 By the way, when geeks have birthday parities for their children things are a lot different then I first imagined. It turns out\u00a0the husbands gather and drink  juice boxes (and coffee), talk about the latest RAID back up system they built, and\u00a0compare cameras and flashes! Now that\u2019s my kind of party! I\u2019m looking forward to lots more just like it. Being a dad is awesome. Being a dad to Noah is even awesomer.

{"date": ",September,9,2011", "body": "Our  occupational and physical therapists  sometimes want  Noah  to show off his muscles so they can see which ones he is engaging. Noah compensates with the wrong muscles to do certain activities, especially whe he is  tired . Our  occupational\u00a0therapist \u00a0is able to help Noah use the right muscles when she visualizes what is going on. You can easily be tricked when he is fully clothed that he is doing a great job of holding his head up or  sitting , when really he is using the wrong muscles to maintain the activity. \u00a0 Children born with\u00a0Down syndrome  have a hard time keeping a muscle contracted for a long period of time. \u00a0We want to make sure the right muscles are contracting and holding his position. Coordination Noah is learning how to use his muscles together.  So he may be able to hold his head up well, but holding his torso with his head while moving his arms is a total different  story . He has to build the stability in his trunk in order to be able to use his arms and hands as a separate movement. \u00a0His oblique muscles get a workout every session in order to help him build this stability. He  works hard  to develop that  core ! I was reading one of the handy books from the  resource page  about  fine motor skills  that said if you put a child with poor tone in a chair which stabilized the trunk (think bumbo or high chair) they can then focus on using their hands more, but when  sitting  alone they likely cannot work on those activities until sitting alone is mastered Do my eyebrows count? The OT is also working on Noah  sitting up  straight and not hunching over and looking up at us by resting his head on his back. Noah gets his eyebrows up and I am fairly certain he thinks that means his entire head has been lifted up. That or they are going to drag the rest of his body up with them. It is pretty  cute , and our occupational therapist cannot get enough of that face. \u00a0He just stares at her confused wanting to know why she doesn\u2019t think he is doing what she is asking him to do. \u00a0 Patience I remember waiting patiently for Noah to first look at us and then actually follow us around the room. \u00a0It seemed like it took weeks for him to figure out where we were. \u00a0I actually think it was around 8 weeks before he really did this well, and it worried me. \u00a0A  typical  infant fixes on their parents instantly and wants to stare at them. \u00a0We had to train Noah to do this. \u00a0The  light up toy  being used in the video is actually ideal to work on the skill of tracking. (Here are some more cheap, but effective  developmental tools !) \u00a0If I had just had patience it would have saved me a lot of  worry , as Noah can\u2019t get enough of us now. I asked our  occupational therapist  the other day when can we expect Noah to be able to hold a bottle on his own. \u00a0It is one task I would love for him to pick up as I get a little jealous when I see other kids drinking their bottle all by themselves (for my own benefit). \u00a0How nice it must be to just hand your bottle to your baby and he can take it himself. \u00a0I was thinking I would get an answer like use a smaller bottle, or we can adapt this way. \u00a0Nope, I have to be patient. \u00a0We can\u2019t work on those tasks because we have not perfected the stabilization mentioned above. \u00a0We are getting there though, and I will continue to be patient, as I am beginning to discover Noah is  determined  to do anything we challenge him to do in his own time.

We try to worship,\u00a0 laugh , eat,  sleep , and play as hard as we can\u2026.and I think we do a pretty good job at it! This Sunday we went to visit our friend  Mark Matlock  preach which meant Noah had to visit a new\u00a0 nursery . But, as you can see in the video he did fine (notice he was eating in the video!)\u00a0I think I\u2019m going to nickname Noah, Audrey ii,\u00a0because\u00a0he loves anyone who will  feed him!  \u00a0If you get that reference you\u2019re awesome. By the way, whenever I\u2019m not sure if this is just a  new parent  thing, but whenever I have to leave Noah somewhere for the first time I have this sudden urge to put on a trench coat, and talk into my watch. Dick Tracy style!! I want to ask a million questions, make a copy of the drivers license, ask them to let me see what\u2019s on their iPod playlist, and if they are a MAC OR PC. But I resist the urge. \u00a0Man, being a new parent is tough. Tough Choices After church we hung out at  Chipotle  for bit (steak burrito bowl anyone?!) \u00a0If you\u2019ve ever been to  Chipotle  then you know about that awkward moment just before your yummy meal is finished the serving line. It\u2019s the question you\u2019ve been thinking about the entire time, \u201cWould you like guacamole with that?\u201d You think to yourself, \u201cAhhh, I want to but, it\u2019s almost two dollars extra. (and they never tell you it\u2019s extra! Anyone ever been duped their first time?) Now all that stands between you and that incredible guacamole is two bucks, so you start\u00a0bargaining\u00a0with yourself\u2026. \u201cHmm\u2026.If I get a water instead of a Sprite I guess it\u2019d be ok to splurge on the guacamole today.\u201d It\u2019s ok..we\u2019ve all been there! We\u2019ll I went with the water today, and I\u2019m glad I did because Noah got to try his first ever guacamole! \u00a0I think he really liked it! (Actually I\u2019m pretty sure he likes anything we feed him\u2026.but it\u2019s all good!) Oh, and before all of you internet child experts start sending me messages, my\u00a0wife is a\u00a0doctor and she told me avocados are great for babies! So I\u2019m safe! Breads Make For Good\u00a0Sensory\u00a0Development I think I\u2019m going to need to grow a beard because Noah really like playing with Marks\u2019s. Actually, I think I\u2019m just going to ask Mark if he will shave off his so we can put it on Noah\u2019s texture blanket. It\u2019d\u00a0be sort of like that ministry where ladies give their hair away\u2026only this will be for sensory development! Winning! Bonus Footage I put a little something extra on this video\u2026.so, if you are the sort of person that reads all of this text before watching the video, consider this your warning. And if you like to watch the videos first, read second (or never)\u2026I put a warning in the video for you. \u00a0You can thank me later. Anyway, the important thing is that  you\u2019ve both been warned! By the way, I wouldn\u2019t normally put something like that on a video, but it was my first time to have ever a kid explode on me. I\u2019ll be honest, I threw up in my mouth for about a second, then I praised God that our little boy was popping like he should\u2026.! Gosh, being a parent is weird What about you? \u00a0Is Sunday your day to relax? If not, \u00a0when\u2019s your \u201cchill day?\u201d Oh, and so since I told you my gross parent story, now you get to! Let\u2019s hear it. Be sure to leave it in the comments below.

{"date": ",June,22,2011", "body": "When our son Noah was  born  we were surprised to learn that he had Trisomy 21; better known as  Down syndrome . We experienced many emotions, and had a lot of fear. To be honest I didn\u2019t know a lot about Down syndrome, and so I spent a lot of time searching the web for some  down syndrome resources . \u00a0In fact, I even wondered if it was my  fault  the our child was  born down syndrome . (By the way, it is no one\u2019s \u201cfault.\u201d) After coming home from the hospital I begin to spent a lot of time learning the  facts about down syndrome ., and the truth is it isn\u2019t as scary as I thought. In fact there was never been a better time for a child to be born with down syndrome. In fact one of the first things I learned is that the correct way to refer to what my child was born with is \u201cDown syndrome,\u201d not  downs syndrome ,  down\u2019s syndrome ,  down syndrome ,  down syndroms ,  downe syndrome , or  downs .\u201d Since I had referred to it as \u201c down\u2019s syndrome \u201d my entire life; I knew I had a lot to learn. One of the reasons we wanted to create this site was to provide a resource for new and expecting parents to come and see that things will be ok. \u00a0That families raising a child born with Down syndrome are much more like other families than they may think. \u00a0We post a daily video, and my wife (a pediatrician) writes great  medically accurate  information like our  New Parent Guide to Down Syndrome . \u00a0I\u2019d highly suggest checking it out! Early Intervention For Children With Down Syndrome Has Come A Long Way! I think Noah must have been sore from his hard-core  occupational therapy  workout yesterday because he wasn\u2019t feeling it today! \u00a0Actually I\u2019ll be transparent, the problem wasn\u2019t soreness it was hungriness! \u00a0We have been trying to develop a schedule for Noah, and it hasn\u2019t been easy to keep!\u00a0You may think creating a schedule for a  six-month old  baby would be easy, but it isn\u2019t. For starters,  Noah  can\u2019t eat forty five minutes or so before any of his therapy appointments, otherwise it\u2019s spit-up city! (Imagine yourself scarfing down an extra large vanilla milkshake, then going to the gym and doing a power session \u2013 YUCK!) To further complicate things, Noah\u2019s schedule differs from day to day, and week to week since he goes to  occupational therapy  every other week, and  physical therapy  two times  every  week! Add to that work, appointments, studying, and all the other demands of life and you\u2019ll quickly see that developing a steady schedule for Noah is sort of like playing one long (but very  cute ) logic game! \u00a0All that to say, some days we do a great job, while  other days  (like today) we do a not so great job. It\u2019s  hard work  being a  parent , but such is life. Can I get an amen from any other parents out there! \ud83d\ude42 All of Noah\u2019s  therapists  tell us he is progressing extremely well. (I\u2019m sure they say this to all of the parents, but it\u2019s ok!) Because of that they have been giving him  new excerises . In the video above Noah was using a soft, wedge. This is the first time he has used the wedge, and he did a great job with it! In fact, they said as soon as he starts to  sit up  on his own they are going to use a new technique involving a bench and a treadmill. This should make for a great video! However, I think his very favoriate is the  elephant  they let him ride! Tomorrow is Wednesday and we wake up and do it all over again. But it\u2019s ok, as I\u2019ve said a million times; it\u2019s seriously a joy raising Noah. Multiple appointments and all! I\u2019d gladly take him to a million appointments if need be. I love being  Noah\u2019s Dad ! \u00a0 What ways have you found to help you manage the multiple appointments, meetings, feedings, etc? \u00a0We\u2019d love to hear your ideas! \ud83d\ude42 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/down-syndrome-blog/", "title": "Down Syndrome, Physical Therapy, And The Start Of A New Blog"},
{"date": ",November,14,2011", "body": "We\u2019re always on the look out for fun books we can  read   with  Noah. \u00a0He enjoys  touch and feel books , The  Jesus Storybook Bible , an his bookcases full of other ones, but tonight we introduced our son to something epic. \u00a0Something awesome. \u00a0Something known as\u2026\u2026 The Tickle Monster! My mother in law (knowing my personality all to well) gave me  The Tickle Monster Laughter Kit  as a Christmas gift last year (which was only a few days after\u00a0 arriving home  from the hospital with Noah!) \u00a0As soon as I unwrapped the package and slipped on the  included  Tickle Monster gloves I couldn\u2019t wait to introduce Noah to the awesomeness known as The Tickle Monster\u2026.! Baby Noah may not have been ready for The Tickle Monster at 2 weeks old, but he is now and I\u2019m happy to announce the start of a wonderful  friendship . \u00a0It looks like The Tickle Monster will be a regular guest in our house..! 3 Reasons You Should Invite The Tickle Monster Into Your Home \n The Tickle Monster is interactive. \u00a0 We like to find books we can read  with  (not to) our son. \u00a0One is passive. \u00a0The other is  interactive . When it comes to being a  superhero parent  to your children, interactive  always   wins . \u00a0This books screams interactive. \u00a0You just slip on the gloves and assume the role of The Tickle Monster. \u00a0Which means you get to spend 20 minutes (or more!) watching your little one wiggle and  giggle . Can you say awesome\u2026? \u00a0I can. \n The Tickle Monster is packed with colorful and fun illustrations.  \u00a0 Sensory stimulation  is very important for infants which is why they enjoy books with a variety of  textures  and bright, colorful illustrations (ever wonder why all of those infant toys are so loud with so many flashing lights\u2026? \u00a0Now you know!)\u00a0 Kevan J. Atteberry did an\u00a0 incredible  job illustrating in this book (Think your favorite Pixar movie!) \u00a0Your child (and you) will really enjoy taking in each page. Noah really enjoys running his hands across each of the Disney-like filled pages. \n The Tickle Monster is full of fun lines that will have you laughing as you try to read them (in your best Tickle Monster voice!) \u00a0 This book is fun, fun, fun to read! \u00a0Josie Bissett (random fact: the author played Jane Mancini on the 90\u2019s show  Melrose Place !) did a great job creating an  experience  \u00a0you\u2019ll really enjoy reading  with  your child. \u00a0But don\u2019t take my word for it; try saying one of my favorite sentences from the book three times real fast: \n \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m all in a tizzy, quite frizzy and dizzy, My finger are squiggly, your piggies are wiggly.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for something  fun  and new to read with your child, I highly suggest visiting  Amazon  and picking up The Tickle Monster as soon as you can. \u00a0Don\u2019t worry, you can still keep Goodnight Moon in your  storytime  rotation! Have you come across any interesting, or unique children\u2019s books lately? Please let us know in the comments\u2026we\u2019re always on the lookout for new ones!

{"date": ",July,19,2011", "body": "To Jim Nelson, Editor-In-Chief I am writing you concerning a comment that appeared in your recent online article \u201c The Worst Dressed Cities In America .\u201d In the blurb regarding city number 40, Boston, I was extremely disappointed and hurt by this very insensitive, and ignorant statement: \u201c[Boston] is a bad-taste storm sewer\u2026[Boston] suffers from a kind of Style Down Syndrome, where a little extra ends up ruining everything.\u201d As a parent of a child  born  with  Down syndrome  I will assure that your assumption that a person living with Down syndrome is \u201cruined,\u201d is wrong, hurtful, insensitive, and ignorant. People born with Down syndrome have three copies of their 21st chromosomes; compared to the two copies that someone without Down syndrome has. So technically people with Down syndrome do have a little something \u201cextra\u201d if compared to someone born without Down syndrome. So the \u201cextra\u201d part of your statement is true. However, your article goes on to imply that that little something extra \u201cruins everything.\u201d I would like to know what you mean by that statement. Was your article implying that all people with Down syndrome are \u201cruined?\u201d If so, can you please define \u201cruined\u201d for me? I have no problem if you want to attack a city for the way their citizens dress. Go for it. But I refuse to remain silent when you cross the line and make hurtful and dehumanizing comparisons about individuals living with  Down syndrome. It is clear that some of your writing staff does not have a clear understanding of Down syndrome. I would suggest they spend some time learning about Down syndrome so that they might have a clear and educated view. I would like to suggest a few resources to help equip your staff to become educated on the facts of Down syndrome: \n What Is Down Syndrome  \u2013 My wife is a  Medical Doctor  and has put together this quick and easy read for anyone to be able to understand the facts about Down syndrome. \n National Down Syndrome Society  \u2013 This website has a lot of great information that will help you and your staff understand more about Down syndrome. In addition, the NDSS had a fantastic campaign going on right now called  My Great Story  where you can read many great stories about individuals with Down syndrome. (I think after reading some of these stories you\u2019ll quickly see they aren\u2019t ruined at all, in fact their life is very full!\u00a0Complete\u00a0with\u00a0 fun , and  laughs .) \n National Down Syndrome Congress  \u2013 This is another very informative website. THe NDSC actually puts on an  annual conference  with various speakers, and workshops that I would highly suggest you and your staff attend. I think you will find it very informative and useful in your understanding of Down syndrome. \n National Down Syndrome Society Buddy Walk  \u2013 This is a yearly event that takes place all across the globe that celebrates all of the many achievements of the over 340,000 people living with Down syndrome. I took the the time to look on the Buddy Walk \u00a0website for you, and I found out that that there are eight  Buddy Walks  left in New York (where you headquarters are located) this year. I would high encourage you to get involved with one so that you can meet many some great people living with Down syndrome. I think after spending some time with some people who have Down syndrome, you\u2019ll agree with me that they are full of life, and much more like you and I, then different. And certainly, as you suggested, \u201cruined.\u201d \n Noah\u2019s Minute \u2013 In addition to the above resources we post a daily one minute video of our son who was  born with Down syndrome . The idea behind this is that we wanted to give the world a window into what it is like raising a child with Down syndrome. We know there is a lot of misinformation out there, and want people to see that our life is much more \u201cnormal\u201d then un-normal.  I think after watching a few of the videos you\u2019ll quickly agree with me that people with Down syndrome are not \u201cruined\u201d at all, rather they are fully human, created by, and in the very image of God, and deserve the exact same dignity and respect as every other person on the planet. \n I see that you have you edited your online article and have removed the statement about Down syndrome. However in the age of the internet simply deleting something does not delete it out of the minds of those who are aware of it. We live in a day and age where much is being done to increase awareness about Down syndrome, and ultimately put in end to inaccurate, hurtful, and ignorant statements like the one in your article. When media outlets such as yours continue to publish ignorant and uneducated comments about people with Down syndrome it reverses the work that so many of us are trying to do. It is very important that we educate the public with correct information, not make hurtful jokes and comparisons at the expense of the over 340,000 people living with Down syndrome. I demand an apology for the hurtful, inaccurate, insensitive, and ignorant statement made in this article. Not only to the entire Down syndrome population, but to the parents, families, and friends of those living with Down syndrome as well. I hope you will take this letter seriously, and work towards providing Down syndrome awareness training to your staff. By providing this training your writers will have access to true and accurate information concerning Down syndrome, which will allow GQ magazine to be certain that they only publish true and accurate information concerning Down syndrome. In doing so you will ultimately be helping the cause (instead of hurting it) to see that every human being on this planet is treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve. (By the way, I have inserted a picture of our son  Noah  at the top and bottom of this post. Pretty cute kid, huh? But he isn\u2019t just cute, he is also as fully a person as you are I, knitted together in his mother\u2019s womb. \u00a0I hope that this letter, and the resources contained within, will help your staff to\u00a0think and speak about all people with Down syndrome as you would your own mother from this point forward.)

{"date": ",November,9,2011", "body": "October was\u00a0National Down Syndrome Awareness Month (Don\u2019t feel bad if you didn\u2019t know. I had no clue until our son was  born !) and to celebrate the National Down Syndrome Society created a yearly, multi city event that takes place over several months known as  The Buddy Walk . You can read more about The Buddy Walk on their website, but in a nutshell; \u201cThe Buddy Walk\u00a0was created to\u00a0celebrate National Down Syndrome Awareness Month in October, and to promote acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome\u2026last year alone 285,000 people participated in a Buddy Walk, and raised more than $11.2 million to benefit local programs as well as the national advocate initiatives that benefit all individuals with Down syndrome. \u00a0It is an\u00a0\u00a0inspirational and educational event that celebrates the many abilities and accomplishments of people with Down syndrome. Whether you have Down syndrome, know someone who does, or just want to show your support, come and join a Buddy Walk in your local community!\u201d Doesn\u2019t that sound awesome, and something that an amazing person like  you  would want to be a part of? I thought so! \u00a0Let me tell you how. 3 Ways You Can Be A Part Of The Buddy Walk 1. \u00a0Come to the Buddy Walk. \n Come on out! \u00a0Seriously.  Join our team ! \u00a0The Buddy Walk is this coming Sunday (November 13, 2011) from 11-1 pm at  Flag Pole Hill  around White Rock Lake. \u00a0We would love for you to come and be a part of the walk. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019ve never, only  met online, or if we\u2019re long time friends\u2026.if there\u2019s anyway possible you can join us, please do! \u00a0Be sure to leave a comment, or send me a message if you plan on coming so I can be on the look out! 2. \u00a0Give a small (or large) donation. (You can  donate here .) \u00a0It seems like everyone is asking for a  small donation  these days, but this is the first time you\u2019ve ever heard me ask you for one. \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 As I mentioned above The Buddy Walk is the \u201cpremier advocacy event for The National Down Syndrome Society\u2026with one of its purposes to raise funds for local programs and services as well as national advocacy initiatives.\u201d \u00a0Let me just say from personal experience that  any  money you choose to donate  will be used for good . \u00a0When Noah was born Abbie and I received more information, support, and  resources  from our local Down syndrome guild than we did from the hospital or the doctor who delivered our son. \u00a0They helped make a  scary  and confusing time in our life much easier. \u00a0We are very grateful to them, and if it wasn\u2019t for donations given by people like you, it\u2019s likely that support would not have been available to us. I want to stress that  any   donation  you make is important. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 5 dollars or 50,  any  amount you can give will go a  long\u00a0 way! \u00a0(By the way, we are very close to meeting (and beating) or rather small goal of 750 dollars.

For all of you out there who are new to this whole baby thing like we are, let me just say this\u2026 a lot  goes into learning how to crawl !  She spent months helping him develop some much needed  core  strength (which allowed him to  sit up  on his on) before moving on to the stage he\u2019s in now, learning how to prop himself up (and stay) on his hands and knees. It\u2019s so much fun watching him learn, and grow, and develop.  Even though he\u2019s only 9 months old I can tell he already feels a great sense of accomplishment because of all the  goals  he achieves every day.  And he should. As I said a million times, I\u2019m so  proud  of this little boy.  It\u2019s as if God baked in an extra spoon full of  hard work  and determination into that extra  21st chromosome  of his.

My parents invited all of their closest friends to meet the grandkids in person. We dined on BBQ ribs and Olathe corn (google it!) \u00a0to name just a few of the yummy things on the menu. The party was a huge success! \u00a0There was no doubt Noah, Guy, and Georgiana were the stars of the party!

I\u2019m excited to see what this experience is like. Watching them love on Noah was awesome. I was also excited to hang out with my nephew (Guy) and my niece (Georgiana) whom I had never met.

He could play games, his favorite being  Angry Birds  and could pick out videos to watch. \u00a0His parents have put videos of him when he was smaller on the iPad and they are some of his favorite things to watch. He was showing me all sorts of events like his first  birthday ,  swimming  in the pool in the backyard, and Christmas. \u00a0He seemed to like those more than his cartoons that were also on there. \u00a0It made me wonder just how much fun Noah will get to have.

I\u2019ll never forget a few weeks after Noah was born when a\u00a0representative\u00a0from the  Down Syndrome Guild of Dallas  called me to help us get connected to our local Down syndrome  support group.

I always thought that she would own a bookstore one day, but she found an even better way to be around books. She is THE Children\u2019s Librarian at  Basalt Regional Library. She  works hard  creating GREAT programming like bringing the circus and a magician for summer reading. She even does science experiments! \u00a0Just hearing about it makes me want to read. We got the prilvedge of attending her storytime while we were in town. She typically doesn\u2019t do the baby storytime but she made an exception for a  special guest . It was awesome! Noah is starting to like peek-a-boo so imagine how much he enjoyed the story  Peekaboo Bedtime . Grandma  even let him ring bells during a song! (We won\u2019t talk about what happened during  patty cake ) \ud83d\ude42 I was extremely proud to be the daughter of the fantastic storyteller among MANY other things. \u00a0I know that Noah had a great time and can\u2019t wait until he gets to go again. Heartbreaker Noah was quite the little ladies\u2019 man during story time. \u00a0He was meeting all sorts of new friends, whom just happened to be all girls. He got to play in the toy box and he was paying close attention to this  sitting  business. I am fairly certain he left a lasting impression with his cuteness. \u00a0 First Step in Speech Development Since Noah was born, my mom continually asks if we are  reading  to Noah. Of course we are mom!!\u00a0I had a great example. The first step you can do for  speech development  in any child is read to them. You can get the whole family involved. I often tell families to have their school-age children read to the younger ones. This way both benefit. And who doesn\u2019t love a  bedtime story ? This will help kids hear how to use words as well as build their vocabulary and imagination. Extra Time with Grandpa Noah got to hang out with his grandpa and dad in the afternoon while his mom and grandma went shopping (our favorite past time). Grandpa got introduced to the  iPad  and wanted to play \u201cthat bird game ( Angry Birds ) that Guy ( Noah\u2019s cousin ) was so interested in\u201d Noah was kind enough to teach his grandpa all about the iPad.

We\u2019re (well Noah is) actually working  very  hard. Don\u2019t Believe A Toy Is Just A Toy We\u2019ve spent countless hours at different  therapy  appointments since Noah was  born , and I\u201dm amazed at the creative ways the\u00a0therapists\u00a0come up with to help our little boy develop into everything that God has created him to be. At first glance their office looks like an enormous playpen stocked with more toys,  swings , and  elephants  then a 7 month old would know what to do with. However, those toys, are tools. \u00a0Tools those\u00a0therapists\u00a0use to help our little boy get stronger. Pretty neat, huh? For instance, banging on the little toy drum helps Noah to develop tactile feedback and stimulation; important for any growing boy or girl. And what looks like a fun swing with a yellow balloon hanging from it actually serves a much greater purpose. As the swing gently moves from side to side, and back and forth Noah has to use his tummy muscles (his core) in order to keep his balance. Adding the yellow balloon adds an even greater degree of difficulty to the exercise. Now Noah not only has to work hard to maintain his balance as the swing moves, but also as he tries to reach for the bright, yellow balloon that\u2019s begging for his attention. Sounds Fun, huh? It\u2019s actually really hard work. By the way, we are so proud of this little boy, and love him so much. While other seven month old babies are napping, our little guy is working hard at  physical therapy , or\u00a0 occupational\u00a0therapy , or  speech therapy . And he does it all with a  smile . Gosh, we love this little guy. \u00a0God could not have given us a more\u00a0perfect\u00a0son. 1 Minute Down, 1,439 Not To Show It\u2019s true that we post a daily\u00a0 one  minute video (yes, everyday!) giving the world a window into the life of our family. Most of those minutes seem so awesome! So fun! Like we\u2019re the perfect family! But \u00a0remember\u2026.there are  1,439 more minutes  of our day that we don\u2019t post. \u00a0That you\u2019ll never see. The one minute of video we post is usually one of the few minutes of the day where everything just happened to go  right . Those other 1,439 minutes are filled with outtakes. Filled with the kinds of pictures you don\u2019t put in the coffee table photo album. Like yesterday for instance. Some Days Go Like This. \u00a0And It\u2019s Ok. Noah goes to physical therapy on Tuesdays and Wednesday every week, and yesterday I was going to be taking him to his appointment. I also had a few errands I\u00a0needed\u00a0to run after the\u00a0appointment\u00a0so I asked my wife to trade cars with me for the day. (Her car is bigger then mine, and it\u2019s much easier to get the stroller and car seat in and out of.) About forty-five minutes before Noah had to be at his appointment; I fed him, put a fresh diaper on him, dressed him, buckled him in his car seat (which we keep inside), prepared a bottle for him to eat after therapy, packed it in his little elephant cooler, got his diaper bag ready, and started to head out the door. I slipped on my shoes, grabbed my wallet, and reached my hand in the small silver bowl by our door where our keys call home. No keys. No biggy. I started to look for the spare. Not on the kitchen table. Or the living room table, or the mantel, or the bathroom counter (either of them), or\u2026.nowhere else. I tried to call and text my wife, but she was seeing patients and I couldn\u2019t reach her. All the while our two dogs are barking like it\u2019s the end of the world (as they always do whenever one of us goes out the door) and Noah is just hanging out in his car seat looking cute (as usual) and playing with his  Sophie . After spending twenty minutes in search of the key\u2026my wife called. She had both of her keys. (And mine.) We didn\u2019t go to physical therapy, or run errands. We cuddled. We played. \u00a0We ate dinner. So it was a win regardless. That\u2019s one minute you\u2019ll never see posted, but they happen. Often. And it\u2019s ok.

So I\u2019ve known Noah when I thought he had the same number of chromosomes as you and I, and I\u2019ve known Noah after learning he was built with a little something extra. And I can say with absolute certainty that there is no difference in the way I see him. \u00a0Not at all. \u00a0It\u2019s 100% same. \u00a0He\u2019s my son.

We saw him no differently. He wasn\u2019t \u201cour son who has Down syndrome\u201d. He was simply \u201cour son.\u201d Sure, we had to take Noah to a few more\u00a0 appointments \u00a0than other babies. But it just sort of became our new normal. We didn\u2019t think about it much. \u00a0Down Syndrome faded into the background of our life, and to be honest we don\u2019t even really give it much thought. Noah just became Noah.

In fact, if you happen to know of a nice worry rehab clinic somewhere (preferably in Hawaii, or the Bahamas) please let me know, I\u2019ll be glad to go. \ud83d\ude42 We had an interesting first few weeks of Noah\u2019s life. It seemed like every appointment we went to presented us with a new challenge. I usually don\u2019t even think about them (since we schedule them so far in advance) but when I see that little reminder pop up on our calendar, my stomach starts to tighten up a little bit. I try really hard to just trust God and not be anxious, but that\u2019s easier said then done. \u00a0 I worry about the doctor finding some new issue. I worry about him not gaining weight. I worry about his cbc test coming back positive for leukemia? I worry about the hole(s) in his heart not closing up on their own. (Which then causes me to worry about what if they have to do heart surgery on my little boy\u2026.) I worry about hearing tests\u2026.What if he is deaf? I worry about vision tests\u2026What if he can\u2019t see? I worry about speech tests. What if he can\u2019t talk? I worry about a million other what if\u2019s? Like I said, on most days I totally forget that Noah has Down syndrome. \u00a0I don\u2019t even think about it\u2026. \u2026except on Doctor appointment days, I do.

Oh\u2026let me get to the good news\u2026 God showed his amazing grace to us again today with two fantastic doctor\u2019s appointments. Noah\u2019s hearing test came back great, as did his visit to the urologist. God is good.

Although he isn\u2019t ready for a full on high chair quite yet, the fantastic  feeding chair  that my wife bought for him seems to work well for now. Noah has a tendency to occasionally slide down in the chair while his eating. His  occupational  and  physical therapist  suggested that we use some foam inserts inside of the chair to help give him support until he can fully sit up on his own.

In fact it was nice just to be at the table. I\u2019m not sure about your family, but it can sometimes be difficult for us to have a  normal  meal time. Especially since Noah was  born . It seems like life has been going 110 miles an hour since December 15, 2011. Which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but it does mean our dinner times can be pretty sporadic. Sometimes we eat at 5:30, and other times at 10:30. Most of the time we sit on the coach, with little Noah wedged in between us (we like looking at him!) while we watch Teen Mom, or So You Think You Can Dance (or maybe Dog The Bounty Hunter.) Resting. Praying. Eating. Talking. \u00a0Life is good. I\u2019m not suggesting our method is the best method. In fact I think it\u2019s probably ideal for a family to turn the television off at 6:30, gather around the dinner table, and have dinner without the distractions of pop-culture blaring in the background. \u00a0You know, just the people.

We were glad that Abbie\u2019s brother, wife, and their two kids could hang out with us this during our vacation.

A few days ago I posted a video of Noah trying to  move forward  as I held one of his favorite (and cheapest!) toys in front of him as motivation. \u00a0But as you can see in that video, as badly as he (and I) both want him to crawl (or even just a little inch-worm action) he just isn\u2019t there yet. \u00a0And that\u2019s ok. \u00a0If there is one quality about Noah that stands out (other then his beautiful blue eyes, and super  cute laugh ) it\u2019s that this little boy is  determined !

Things that come easy for most babies, like  sitting up , rolling, holding their own bottle, crawling, walking, etc, don\u2019t come easy for him. (or any child born with Down syndrome.) \u00a0He has to work, and work, and work.  Hard. \u00a0 In fact, at almost every one of this physical thearpy appointment he exercises so hard he throws up\u2026but does he cry? \u00a0Nope. \u00a0He smiles, and  laughs , and keeps going. At only 9 months old this little boy is determined.

That is all helping him learn to play. Granted these abilities do more for him then simply help him learn to play, but I think Noah will appreciate playing the most. Toys: Motivators And Entertainers Simply watching Noah realize that objects are inside the container and having fun getting them out is pretty awesome. He  likes to get his face right up to the opening and look inside before he takes anything out. I often view the toys in our therapy sessions as  motivators , but I realize that it is equally important for him to learn how to use all of these toys for pure entertainment. One of our  goals  in occupational therapy is for Noah to learn how to take off and put on the rings on a ring stacker\u2026all in the name of playing appropriately with a  toy .

(For instance the chart says that a child born with Down syndrome should  sit up  on their own sometime between 6 and 30 months!) \u00a0With this in mind it\u2019s great that Noah\u2019s physical therapist is so patient with him. \u00a0She never rushes him. \u00a0She never makes us (or him) feel bad if he isn\u2019t getting something. \u00a0And she doesn\u2019t mind working on the same thing over, and over, and over again until he gets it (and when he does she cheers as loud as we do!) \u00a0We love it! \n She is invested. \u00a0 I can\u2019t tell you how many times Noah\u2019s therapist has greeted us with comments like, \u201cI was doing some research last night\u2026\u201d, \u201cI was reading this article that said\u2026\u201d, I came across this research study that talked about\u2026\u201d. \u00a0It\u2019s great knowing that Diana (Noah\u2019s therapist) doesn\u2019t view our Noah as just a chart, but she is invested in his life. \u00a0She genuinely cares about our son, and wants to see him become everything that God created Him to be. \u00a0Now, that\u2019s a great therapist! \n How To Find A Therapist You (and Your Child) Will Love If you live in the United States, and especially if you live in a large city like we do, pediatric therapists are a dime a dozen. \u00a0There are clinics everywhere. \u00a0There are private therapists. \u00a0There are therapists assigned to your child by the state. \u00a0There are therapists that come to your house. \u00a0There are therapists that require you to drive to their office. \u00a0There are therapist offices that have large gyms. \u00a0There are therapist offices that have small gyms. \u00a0There are therapists that incorporate small  elephants  into their training. \u00a0And therapists that do not. \u00a0And the list goes on, and on. So how does a loving parent who wants the best for their child choose a pediatric therapist? I\u2019m going to let you in on a little secret\u2026 they all use the same text books.  (Well, maybe not  exactly  the same, but you get my point.) \u00a0In order to be a licensed therapist they have to had gone to school, and most schools teach the same material (although they may use different methods to teach it.) \u00a0Since all pediatric therapists will generally have the same education, what you really want to look for is a therapist that displays the above three qualities. Encouraging. Patient. Invested. It will probably take a few visits (or maybe just one!) with a therapist before you know if they have the qualities you and your child are looking for. \u00a0That\u2019s ok. Don\u2019t be afraid to change therapists if you (or your child) isn\u2019t happy with their current one. \u00a0I know how frustrating it can be to make changes once you are in a rhythm, but I\u2019ll assure that once you have a therapist that you (and your child) are happy with, you\u2019ll view taking your child to their therapy points as a  fun  experience, instead of a dreaded one! What has been your experience with your child\u2019s therapists? What do you like best about your child\u2019s therapists. \u00a0Does he or she display the sort of characteristics I mentioned in this post?

{"date": ",November,6,2011", "body": "One of my favorite cartoons growing up was  The Muppet Babies . \u00a0Basically, the show was about little kid versions of the muppets all living together in this huge nursery (I assume they lived there since there\u2019s\u00a0never any mention of their\u00a0parents, or them ever leaving the nursery!) \u00a0When their nanny (the only adult ever mentioned on the show) stepped out of the room they would let their imagination run wild. \u00a0Every item in their nursery could be transformed and used for there many adventures. Boxes could turn into race cars, umbrellas into light sabers, and blankets could turn into magic carpets. It was an epic show! 3 Gifts That Everyone Has, And That Never Go Away One strong theme of the Muppet Babies is the strong sense of wonder, curiosity, and imagination that children are  born  with. \u00a0You probably have many  memories  from your own childhood of playing cops and robbers with your brothers, or dress-up with your sisters. \u00a0What I find fascinating is that these traits don\u2019t just come about when you started your first day of kindergarten (nor were they taken away when you became an  adult !) \u00a0No, they were given to you long before that. \u00a0They were given to you by the Creator of the Universe when as He was knitting you together in your mother\u2019s womb. \u00a0He created in you and I a passion for wanting to explore, and change, the world around us. You come out of the womb full of wonder, curiosity, and imagination. \u00a0 And it never goes away  (even if you  feel  as if it does!) Noah\u2019s Adventure In Crib Land It happens almost every day. \u00a0My wife or I lay Noah down for a  nap , walk out, and within a few minutes hear what sounds like a mini-cirucs coming from Noah\u2019s room. Laugher. \u00a0 Music. \u00a0Movement. \u00a0 Fun . It\u2019s funny because when we took this video Noah couldn\u2019t even crawl yet, but he someone finds a way to wiggle, and roll, form one end of his crib to the other (and turning on every  toy  along the way!) I was curious what Noah did as soon as we laid him down, so I sort of tip toped in his room just after lying him down\u2026and today\u2019s video is what I saw. It was great. \u00a0You can see in the video that it took him a few minutes to realize I was there. \u00a0I can only imagine what sort of \u00a0fun adventure he was having before he realized I was there. I\u2019m looking forward to a life time of intentionally creating and finding ways for Noah to develop his God-given sense of wonder, curiosity, imagination, and creativity. \u00a0 It\u2019s so much fun watching this little boy become the person God has created him to be. \u00a0I\u2019m one  lucky  dad. \u201cIf a child is to keep his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement, and mystery of the world we live in.\u201d \n \u2013 Rachel Carson What sort of activities do you do in your home to cultivate your child\u2019s sense of wonder and creativity?

{"date": ",November,5,2011", "body": "So What\u2019s The Big Deal Anyway? Today was a big deal for comic book fans everywhere as it was the start of DC Comics New 52. For those of you not in the  comic book know ( which I\u2019m assuming is just about all of you \ud83d\ude42 DC Comics is what you call a \u201cbig dog\u201d when it comes to comic books. \u00a0They publish many of the big name titles like, Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Justice League of America, The Flash, and many more, and starting this month they are starting all of their 52 titles over\u2026 from the beginning \u2026.as in issue number 1. \u00a0This may not sound like a big deal to you, but it\u2019s never been done before in the history of comic books. \u00a0Ever. One \u00a0reason they are doing this is because comic book story lines have been going on for decades, which makes it hard for today\u2019s teenagers to get into them. \u00a0There\u2019s to much of a back story to catch up on. \u00a0So they are taking a gamble and rebooting their entire line up, and starting their story lines over, in hopes of attracting lots of new readers. Here\u2019s one of their first new readers, my son. \u00a0Baby Noah. Don\u2019t Make A Tradition Of Having No Traditions I\u2019ve always been a fan of comic books and have been looking forward to the launch of the New 52 since I first heard about it. \u00a0I was especially excited to introduce Noah to one of my favorite super heroes (Superman) with issue number 1, and for all the monthly trips we would surely make to the comic book store to pick up the latest issue.! \u00a0It\u2019d be a  fun  father and son tradition! Sadly, my father and I didn\u2019t have any traditions. \u00a0I have no memories of my father ever telling me a  bedtime story , praying with me, or  reading the Bible  to me. \u00a0I\u2019m not really sure why he never did those things, because he missed out on one of parenting\u2019s  greatest gifts ; pouring into your kids. \u00a0I want to be a different kind of dad. \u00a0I want to pour into my child. \u00a0I want to have lots of fun traditions. \u00a0I want to pray over him every day. \u00a0I want to teach him something new and exciting about God every day. I want to have the kind of relationship with my son that my dad never had with me. The great thing about starting a fun, new tradition is\u2026it\u2019s easy! \u00a0It\u2019s never happened before, so essentially you could make anything you wanted into a tradition. \u00a0Since this was the fist time comic books have ever started over, I thought comic books would make for a perfect father and son tradition! \u00a0I have this idea in my mind of picking up Noah from school when he\u2019s in the 3rd grade, and heading down to the local comic book shop to pick up the latest Superman comic so that we can go home and  read  it together. \u00a0On  road trips  we can talk about what our favorite issue was, what our favorite superman super power is, and what we think will happen in future issues. I\u2019m sure it will be great! It\u2019s Not About The Comic Book Of course it may not happen  just  like the image in my head. (When it comes to parenting, I don\u2019t think anything does.) \u00a0Noah may grow up liking Batman more than Superman, or not liking comic books at all (shudder!) \u00a0That\u2019s ok. \u00a0We\u2019ll do something different. \u00a0We\u2019ll start a different tradition. \u00a0I\u2019ll find a different way to create fun experiences that we can share. It\u2019s not about the comic book. \u00a0It\u2019s about the experience. Parents, never forget that when it comes to your children, it\u2019s  always  about the experience, and those experiences can often turn into traditions. \u00a0It\u2019s  never  about the item, the vacation, the money, or the stuff. \u00a0It\u2019s  always  about the experience. \u00a0Always. One of the greatest gifts you can give your children is a lifetime of wonderful, loving, experiences with their parents. \u00a0Depending on your child\u2019s age it may seem that that\u2019s not what they want\u2026but it is. Every. Single. Time. The Greatest Tradition You Could Ever Start For Your Family Your children aren\u2019t yours. They are God\u2019s. \u00a0He has loaned them to you, and you won\u2019t have them forever. Never forget that . Make sure to keep the  main thing  the main thing, and daily look for ways to give your kids experiences. \u00a0Experiences are  cheap , anyone can afford them. (Superman comics cost 2.99 cents a month.) \u00a0They can even be  free . \u00a0You can go on a weekly walk with your child and talk to them about their week. \u00a0You could have a Friday-night-camp-out-in-the-living-room-night. \u00a0You could take your son or daughter to McDonalds for a 99 cent ice cream cone on Fridays. \u00a0Be creative. \u00a0You\u2019re the parent. It\u2019s up to you to do this. \u00a0I hope you will. If you\u2019re a Christian I hope that prayer is already a tradition in your house. \u00a0I hope you are daily taking your child in your arms and praying for them. \u00a0Thanking God for them. Asking God to protect them. \u00a0For their lives to reflect our great God for a lifetime. \u00a0This is perhaps the most important tradition a family could ever have. \u00a0This comes before Superman comics, walks, ice cream cones, and living room camp outs. \u00a0It\u2019s the tradition that can have the greatest impact on the life of your family. If prayer and Bible reading isn\u2019t a tradition in your house, I\u2019d urge you to make it one. \u00a0Today. \u00a0(We like to read to Noah from this awesome children\u2019s  storybook Bible .) Special Note To Christian Dads If you are a Christian dad, let me remind you that you are  commanded  to do this. I like what the Apostle Paul says to fathers in Ephesians 6:4: \u201cFathers\u2026.take [your children] by the hand and lead them in the way of [God.]\u201d I\u2019ve worked with teenagers for over a decade, and I can tell you that there aren\u2019t many fathers doing this. \u00a0Fathers today are often harsh, angry, busy, mad, overworked, underpaid, and stressed. \u00a0They spend more time trying to grow their  business , than growing in their  relationship with God . \u00a0This is sad. \u00a0If you aren\u2019t taking time to grow in your relationship with the Lord each day, you\u2019re going to have a hard time leading your children in the way of God. \u00a0I assure you. \u00a0If you want to be the kind of dad that turns their children into world changers, you are going to have to cultivate your relationship with God. If you need help with this, please  contact  me. \u00a0I\u2019m growing in this area just like you, but I can suggest some good books, or tools to help you in this area. Don\u2019t Let My Story Be Your Story I don\u2019t recall my dad every praying or reading the Bible with me. \u00a0Ever. \u00a0I was short-changed by my dad. \u00a0He was supposed to \u201clead me in the way of God.\u201d \u00a0Sadly, he didn\u2019t. \u00a0Thankfully, the Lord put other men into my life that did what my dad should have. \u00a0And while I praise God for those men, my heart still hurts that those men weren\u2019t my dad. \u00a0My dad passed away several years ago, and in a way we both lost. \u00a0He\u2019ll never have another chance to do what God had called him to do, and I\u2019ll never have one memory of my dad praying with me, or reading the Bible to me. \u00a0Ever. Dads, I tell you this because for two reasons: \n If you\u2019re reading this you\u2019re still alive!  (Unless you are reading this from beyond the grave somehow. \u00a0And if that is the case,  please  leave a comment because the would be pretty cool!) \n You still have time to do what you\u2019re supposed to do . \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter how old your child is, or how long you haven\u2019t done this. \u00a0Start today! \u00a0 Make today the day you start praying with your children. \u00a0The day that you start reading the Bible to them. \u00a0The day that you start teaching them the way of God. Remember, you are a  superhero  to your son or daughter\u2026! \n A Final Warning To Dads As dads we often think we have to be the tough guy all the time. \u00a0The guy who can fix anything (I\u2019m actually ready to give up this role!). \u00a0The guy who never cries. \u00a0Blah, blah, blah.  Don\u2019t believe this garbage\u2026!  \u00a0The mostly manly man is the dad who gets on his knees with his son or daughter and prays. \u00a0Who can say he doesn\u2019t know it all, but He knows the One who does. \u00a0A dad who holds a high regard for God, for pray, and for The Bible. This is the sort of dad that  wins  with his kids! Dads, I urge you to not let another day go by without taking time to pray for / with you child, and to teach them about God. \u00a0This may mean you have to start praying and reading the Bible  yourself . \u00a0It may mean you need to start getting up a little earlier (or staying up a little later) so that you can make time for your own personal growth. \u00a0It may even require you to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d to your children for not being the dad you were called to be. But it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s so, so worth it. Don\u2019t let another dad be the dad you should have been! What sort of traditions do you have your kids? If you don\u2019t have one that\u2019s ok. \u00a0What\u2019s a tradition you\u2019d like to start but never have; today\u2019s a great day to start it!

{"date": ",February,24,2012", "body": "Noah is rocking out in  supported kneeling  today. I had no idea all of the different positions children born with Down syndrome had to work on in order to learn how to move their bodies the right way. They have to go through these various positions to help build strength in certain muscles before advancing to the next stage. 1 Must Have Book For Parents Of Children With Down Syndrome Gross Motors Skills in Children with Down Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals \u00a0by Patricia Winders is by far one of my favorite  down syndrome resources . It gives me the guidance I want when I am confused in physical or occupational therapy, or what to work on when I get frustrated with certain tasks. It shows me why I need to slow down and let Noah go through the motions that he needs to  move forward . That next stage for us is going to be  crawling  if we can get there. (Note to readers, this video is from October and if you follow us on  Facebook  you know that we reached that milestone recently). It also comes with handy check lists, which every mother loves. Supported Kneeling\u2026What\u2019s The Purpose? So why is supported kneeling important ? As you can find out in the above book it  builds strength in the thighs, buttocks and stomach . Holding the knees together and putting pressure on the legs with knees bent prepares the legs for standing. Once they are stable in supported kneeling you start working on going up and down, so from  sitting  on your heels to pushing up. \u00a0Again this is  strengthening  those muscles. Noah is working a little bit harder in this video as he is actually going to the side and isolating a leg to build strength. (We\u2019re so  proud  of this little boy.) A Quick And Easy Supported Kneeling Exercise Patricia gives lots of great activities to do to help a child born with Down syndrome though each of the developmental stages. The one for supported kneeling is to put your child in front of the sofa with the cusion removed. Place your child on their knees in front of the sofa with their arms on top of the seat of the sofa. Sit behind your child. Make sure the legs stay together and support them if they cannot hold this position. Put toys on the sofa seat and encourage them to play. Over time they will start to move up and down. It\u2019s great exercise, but remember you should only do this if your child\u2019s physical therapist has given you the ok.) For those of you who are frustrated with therapy and want to know what you need to be doing at home this book is a must have for your library. \u00a0I cannot recommend it enough.

{"date": ",June,20,2011", "body": "We take Noah to\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapy\u00a0every other Monday at  Our\u00a0Children\u2019s\u00a0House at Baylor \u00a0in Dallas. \u00a0We use OCHB for Noah\u2019s\u00a0 physical \u00a0and\u00a0 speech\u00a0therapy \u00a0as well, and have very happy with his progress. Early intervention is very important for children\u00a0 born with Down Syndrome , as they are often\u00a0delayed\u00a0in reaching their developmental\u00a0 milestones . Noah Rocks Some New Occupational Therapy Exercises Noah\u2019s previous occupational\u00a0therapist took a new job out of state, so today was our first\u00a0appointment\u00a0with his new one. \u00a0Noah\u2019s leg and back muscles are getting really strong, but he still has some work to do on\u00a0developing\u00a0his  core  (stomach) and arm\u00a0muscles. \u00a0So the next step for him is\u00a0developing those two important areas as they help him  sit up  (which he needs to do to  eat ),  grasp  objects, and eventually crawl and walk! In the video you\u2019ll see the\u00a0 occupational\u00a0therapist  doing several new exercises with Noah. \u00a0In the first one the goal is to get Noah to press up on the small  exercise ball  in order to help develop his arm and core muscles. In the second one the\u00a0therapist\u00a0is moving her head from right to left and trying to get Noah to\u00a0follow\u00a0her. The goal is for Noah to track with her, and move his body in the\u00a0direction\u00a0she moves her. This also helps\u00a0develops\u00a0those core\u00a0muscles! \u00a0One of the many things we\u2019ve learned from Noah\u2019s occupational therapist is how occupational therapy can help a child born with Down syndrome  learn to\u00a0play . And who doesn\u2019t like to play?\u00a0 In the last exercise Noah is arched across his\u00a0therapist\u2019s\u00a0legs while he tries to push up with his arms, and hold that position for as long as he can (think half push-up!) \u00a0This is very hard work, and obviously\u00a0helps to develop strength in his tiny arms! \u00a0Even though it\u2019s hard, our little guy did an\u00a0incredible\u00a0job! This little boy is a real trooper. \u00a0He goes to so many\u00a0appointments, and has to work so much harder then a\u00a0 typical  child. \u00a0Tomorrow, and\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0we will spend more time at OCHB when we go back for his\u00a0physical\u00a0therapy visit. \u00a0I sure wish Noah\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0have to do so much  hard work , and could just get stronger on his own (without all the\u00a0therapy\u00a0appointments)\u00a0like  typical  children. \u00a0But It\u2019s ok. I\u2019m thankful to live in a place with so many great resources to help him grow and develop. My wife and I don\u2019t mind taking him to a million\u00a0appointments\u00a0if need be. If fact, we consider it a joy! \u00a0Noah is our second\u00a0priority, with only God being the first. \u00a0Everything else is in our life is of little importance. \u00a0Man, oh man, we love this kid! Every day the Words of Psalm 127:3 ring more true to me. \u00a0We are surely blessed. \u201cChildren are a gift from The Lord, They are a reward from Him.\u201d While your here, please take a second to receive our daily post via  email .

{"date": ",February,27,2012", "body": "Today was one of those days where I just sat in awe as I watched Noah play, grow, and develop. It\u2019s so much fun watching him\u00a0 bang on blocks ,\u00a0 sit up ,  laugh , and tries  his hardest  to crawl. He\u2019s soooooooo close. Any day this little boy will be on the move\u2026.I can\u2019t wait! I  love  every second of being this little boy\u2019s dad! 1 Parenting Lesson I\u2019ll Never Forget I\u2019ll never forget a conversation I had with a friend,  classmate , and former offensive tackle for the Denver Bronco\u2019s\u00a0just a few months before Noah was born. This friend of mine was doing a fantastic job of raising his two children, and as a  new parent \u00a0whenever a  seasoned pro  offers to give me parenting advice, I listen. We discussed many different aspects of parenting that day, but there was one sentence my buddy told me that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to forget: \u201cWhatever preconceived ideas you have about what your child will be like, I promise you, he will be totally different.\u201d Boy was my friend right. That sentence was one of the first things that came to my mind when we found out that our son was  born with Down syndrome .\u00a0I\u2019m glad he took the time to offer that piece of parenting advice to me, because that sentence gave (and still gives) me a lot of comfort. And it\u2019s a great reminder to all of us parents (and soon to be parents) out there\u2026.parenting will  never  be 100%, totally, just like you expect it to be. Never. And that\u2019s ok. When It Comes To Parenting, You Just Have To Dive In\u2026Well Sort Of. Of course neither my friend nor I knew that Noah would be born with 3 copies of his  21st Chromosome  when we had that talk. He was simply making the point that parenting is  nothing  like we expect it to be before we have children. Down syndrome, or no Down syndrome. There\u2019s no class, no weekend retreat, no seminar, no conference,  no nothing  that someone can go to in order to help them\u00a0 win at parenting . They just have to dive in, and trust God. Or maybe that should be; trust God, and dive in.* * \u00a0I add an asterisk here to say that  diving in  to parenting doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t  prepare , and be  responsible. . All of the above resources I mentioned above all all good tools, although none of them are the end all solution. Further, a child needs a stable environment.  They need a mom and a dad.  Trust me, I understand that sometimes in life things don\u2019t always work out the way we intend for them to. Sometimes men don\u2019t step up to the role they are called to fill. Sometimes women don\u2019t. Sometimes people don\u2019t take responsibility for creating a life. And that\u2019s tragic. I could write much about this, but I digress\u2026. Just please know when I say you have to  dive-in  to parenting there\u2019s a  huge  asterisk attached. Different Isn\u2019t Difficult, It\u2019s Just Different. And That\u2019s Ok. People (including me when Noah was born) often assume that raising a child with Down syndrome is  more  difficult than raising a  typical  child. I remind them that parenting  in general  is  difficult . Parenting a child with Down syndrome doesn\u2019t make it  more difficult t  per se , it just makes it different. And although it\u2019s different, it\u2019s sooooooo\u00a0 worth it .\u00a0\u00a0In fact, different can often be a\u00a0 blessing . I\u2019m sure some people will disagree with me. And that\u2019s ok. Noah is our first (and as of today, only) child, and so  different  is all we know. Different is our  normal . And we are ok with it.\u00a0Very ok with it. What\u2019s one area of parenting that turned out to be totally different from what you thought it would be like before you had your first child?

{"date": ",January,23,2012", "body": "Today Noah got to visit his pediatrician, whom we love. She\u2019s so encouraging. She gets excited when she sees Noah and shows him off. She also takes time to  listen  to us, because even though I too am a pediatrician, I still have questions. There are no words to express how much we appreciate her and what she does for our son. The Flu Shot: Separating Fact From Fiction Noah received his first flu shot today. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have heard that the flu shot gives you the flu. I thought I would give you MY reasons why I think the flu shot is important and some myths about the flu shot. I know you all have your own reasons about why or why you don\u2019t get the flu shot. My goal as a doctor is that you have  accurate  information  when making these decisions, but realizing that it is YOUR decision. \u00a03 Reasons To Get The Flu Shot \n \u00a0Getting the flu is awful; why not try to avoid it. You feel miserable, you miss work or school, and you can\u2019t do the things you enjoy. One little poke could help you stay healthy. \u00a0Shoot you don\u2019t even have to have a poke if you fit the criteria it can go up your nose \ud83d\ude42 \n Getting the flu can be deadly, especially those with underlying  health conditions , such as heart conditions (which is quite common in  Down syndrome ) or asthma. It is also more risky for those who are simply young or old. During my training, I saw several previously healthy kids  die of the flu  and if a shot can prevent that how awesome is that. \n When you get the flu you put other people at risk of getting the flu and having the above happen. You can\u2019t get the flu shot until you are  6 months old . So those who can\u2019t be vaccinated are actually probably the most at risk for severe complications. We have to do what we can to protect them and the flu shot is one way to do it. \n Flu Shot Myth: I Get The Flu Every Time I Get The Flu Shot \n It is actually  impossible  for you to get the flu from the flu shot, as the virus in the shot is  dead . Only  live viruses  can get you sick. Now the nasal spray is a live WEAKENED virus and that is why those with immune compromise should  not  get the nasal spray. \n You may feel awful for the 24 hours after you get the flu shot. Your body is creating an immune response to the dead virus so that when you meet the real thing your body can attack it. You may have a fever or feel achy, but that is not being sick with the flu. \n You actually do have the flu because you were exposed when you went to get your flu shot. It takes about two weeks for your body to be ready to fend off the flu, so if you are exposed during that time you can still get sick. I am sorry if this happens to you as you had the best intentions \n The flu shot didn\u2019t cover for this year\u2019s flu is another reason you may get sick. A few years ago the  World Health Organization  projected the wrong strain and a lot of people ended up getting the flu. They do a lot of research, but they can\u2019t guarantee anything. Based on their research the flu vaccine contains the most likely strains projected to happen that year. There is not just one strain. They usually include a type A and type B strain as well as the H1N1 (swine flu) now. All can be present during the flu season. \u00a0Based on what I have seen (or not seen this year) I think the chances are good we are covered. \n A Few Warnings About The Flu Shot As with everything involving a medical decision you should consult with your own doctor and not just listen to me. \u00a0There are things that will change what type of flu shot you get, what office you are sitting in when you get it, and if you should even get it at all. Flu Mist The flu mist should not be given to those less than 2, people over 50, those whose immune system is not up to par either due to illness or medication, ASTHMA, or any wheezing prior to age 5, chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, kidney failure, children/adolescents receiving aspirin, pregnant women, egg allergy, and those with a history of Guillain-Barre (a condition where you become temporally paralyzed from the legs up). \u00a0 So in other words the flu mist should only be given to healthy individuals age 2-49 (that means no chronic illnesses). \u00a0 The reason behind all those warnings is that the flu mist IS a live virus and there is a chance you can get sick from the vaccine. \u00a0However, it actually has been shown to work better than the shot, so if it is an option go for it. \u00a0It also does not contain any thimerosal so for those of you concerned about that it is a great option. Egg Allergy Yes the flu vaccine is created by using chicken eggs. \u00a0So if you have an egg allergy there is a chance you may react to the flu shot. \u00a0However, you can go to your allergist and they will do a skin test to see if you will react to the vaccine. \u00a0If there is no response, you are good to go to get the shot. \u00a0It is actually more common to not react even with an egg allergy. \u00a0If there is a response, you and your doctor have to discuss if the benefit outweighs the risk. \u00a0Allergic reactions can be treated so even with a reaction you can get the flu shot. Previous Adverse Reaction If you have had a severe allergic reaction, a serious reaction, or if you have ever had Guillain-Barre (temporary paralysis that moves from the feet up) you should have a lengthy discussion with your doctor if you desire the flu shot again. \u00a0My best guess is that no one would be interested in the flu shot again after those types of reactions. A Word On Thimerosal I did not write this post to argue about mercury or the causes of Autism. \u00a0It is a never ending argument and one that I feel has greatly effected the protection of our children. \u00a0In all honesty I probably shouldn\u2019t have gotten myself started as I get fired up about this topic. \u00a0 Single dose vaccines  (meaning they only use one vial per child and don\u2019t stick it back in the fridge)  do not contain thimerosal . \u00a0Those vials that do have multi-doses use thimerosal as a  preservative . \u00a0In 1999 there was a decision to  remove thimerosal from all vaccines  despite their being any evidence that it actually causes problems. \u00a0For children under 6 the only chance at exposure is with the multi-dose flu vaccine. There has been no evidence to show that thimerosal or mercury for that matter is associated with causing Autism. If you guys want more information the expert on vaccines in my opinion is  Paul Offit, MD , and I recommend you at least read his standpoint by either what is provided on the internet or in his books before you finalize your decision on vaccines. \u00a0As for my experience, I have  never  in my career as a medical doctor seen a case of H. Flu (Hib), measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), Polio (IPV), or tetanus. \u00a0I have seen maybe 5 cases of Chicken Pox which were all mild. \u00a0I was hospitalized myself at 6 months of age due to Chicken Pox and a staph infection. \u00a0Those who have trained me have seen all of these diseases and watched children have brain damage, become crippled and die because of them. \u00a0The fact that I have not treated one child with these conditions is a MIRACLE in my opinion. \u00a0 I have watched children die from pertussis and the flu, both which can be prevented with vaccination.  \u00a0 It is something I hope no parent has to experience. Noah Has To Go Back For One More When your child gets the flu shot for the first time they usually have to get two. Noah will be going back in one month to get his second flu shot to be fully covered. The Day Didn\u2019t End After The Flue Shot: Therapy and Food Time! Our day continued after our visit to our primary care physician (PCP). We went to  therapy , where Noah continued to act like a rock star despite having to get shots earlier in the day. \u00a0By the way, you\u2019ll notice the toy Noah\u2019s physical therapist is using in this video was also featured on our  best gift ideas  post\u2026.this is seriously one of the best toys you can can buy under 10 dollars! Feeding Advances We also did some advances in his  feeding . We have been using  pureed fruits  or vegetables for the last few months and today we thought we would try meats. They don\u2019t smell nearly as good. I haven\u2019t mastered the art of pureeing meats so I am using store bought versions. I have heard that a lot of kids aren\u2019t fans (I really can\u2019t blame them based on the smell), but Noah seemed to not mind. He gobbled it down just as he usually does. We also thought we would try some  Gerber Baby Puffs \u00a0and let Noah attempt to feed himself. This is when knowledge of  grasp  would have been helpful. Noah could not quite figure out how to pick these up. If I had only known better, I would have realized that his grasp was not ready to pick up the puffs as it requires a  pincher grasp  where at this point Noah only consistently uses the  palmar grasp.  (If you\u2019d like to learn more about grasping, I discussed the various grasps in a post entitled:  Learn To Grasp: A Cheap And Easy Fine Motor Skills Exercise Your Child Can Do At Home .) \u00a0Oh well, he still liked it when we put these in his mouth. It was a new experience for him to have something crunchy. They dissolve quickly so they are easy for the child to swallow. \u00a0We will keep practicing and someday soon, Noah will be chomping on these all by himself. We sure packed a lot into this day. \ud83d\ude42 Do you have a memorable day of how many things you were actually able to accomplish?

{"date": ",January,29,2012", "body": "What were your thoughts on this movie? Tonight ABC aired the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie \u201c A Smile As Big As The Moon .\u201d \u00a0The movie is based on a  book \u00a0about a high school special education teacher (Mike Kerjes) who took his class of special education students to  Space Camp  despite all of the obstacles that stood in their way. \u00a0If you didn\u2019t get a chance to catch the movie, you can purchase the film on DVD from  Amazon . A Smile As Big As The Moon: My Thoughts My wife and I watched  A Smile As Big As The Moon  tonight, and I must say it was very touching. Mike (the teacher) seemed like such an great guy, and I can\u2019t tell you how many times my wife and I wanted to scream out, \u201cGo Mike!\u201d as we were watching the movie! \u00a0I loved how he stood up for the kids, and didn\u2019t let anyone tell them they \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d \u00a0I hope that Noah has teachers like Mike Kerjes when he gets in school. Being that Noah is only 13 months old I still get a little teary eyed seeing older children with  Down syndrome \u2026.sometimes. \u00a0I\u2019m not really sure why. \u00a0I just do. Maybe it\u2019s because I have a hard time thinking about the possibility of kids picking on him one day. \u00a0Maybe it\u2019s the thought of someone taking advantage of his innocence one day. \u00a0I have a wild imagination, and sometimes I think of things I never want to hear Noah say. \u00a0Things like; \u201cHey dad this kid at school said he would be my friend if I gave him my iPhone, so I did. \u00a0Now he is my friend.\u201d Please Lord, never let that sentence never come out of Noah\u2019s mouth. \ud83d\ude42 Maybe in the very back of my mind I have this hope that Noah will be the \u201call star person born with Down syndrome.\u201d \u00a0That our son will talk, walk, and play just as typical as a  typical kid . \u00a0At 13 months old, we almost  forget  Noah was born with Down syndrome. \u00a0Watching movies like this sort of reminds that he does. And it\u2019s ok. \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 \u00a0God\u2019s been in the business of making people for a long time, and He knew just what He was doing when He made Noah. \u00a0We live in a good  story . \u00a0Not a sad one. If you have a child with Down syndrome, I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m trying to say. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m making any sense. \u00a0It\u2019s hard to articulate the emotions that a movie like  A Smile As Big As The Moon  stirs up within me. \u00a0I\u2019m thankful for teachers like Mike Kerjes, and so many others who believe in the potential for kids like my son. \u00a0I\u2019m also encouraged after watching this movie for our son. \u00a0I know he his capable of doing great things, and I can\u2019t wait to watch the story of his life unfold. \u00a0I think God has some pretty important things for this little guy to do. \ud83d\ude42 I also want to say thanks to  Hallmark  for investing so much in this movie. \u00a0It was shown commercial free where we live (with the exception of a few Hallmark spots) on prime time. \u00a0I know that must have cost Hallmark a pretty penny, so thank you Hallmark, as a dad of son born with Down syndrome I really appreciate it. \u00a0I\u2019m also putting you on my list of organizations-that-are-helping-to-break-the-false-stereotypes-about-children-born-with-special-needs, right next to  Target  and  Nordstrom , so your in good company. If you are new here, we started this site to show a daily one minute video about our son who was born with Down syndrome. We hope to give the world an inside look at what life is like raising someone like Noah, and in turn will see that Down syndrome is ok. \u00a0We invite you to sign up to have our posts come directly to your  inbox , subscribe via  RSS , and join us on  Facebook \u2026and most of all we ask that you would help us share our  story . \u00a0We think it\u2019s a story worth sharing.

{"date": ",February,15,2012", "body": "If you\u2019ve been watching our daily one minute videos about our son who was born with Down syndrome you may have thought to yourself: \u201cDo these people do  anything  other than take their son to physical and occupational therapy appointments!?\u201d If so, I don\u2019t blame you. We post a lot of videos of Noah\u2019s various physical therapy,  occupational therapy , and even a few of his speech /  feeding therapy  sessions. Our daily one minute videos only show  one minute  of our day; there are 1,339 more minutes of our day that you  don\u2019t  get to see. We typically post a video every day and if Noah happened to go to one of his therapy appointments on the day of that video, that\u2019s usually what we show on that day\u2019s video. Make sense? But to answer your question, yes, we do have a life outside of therapy\u2026.I promise. \ud83d\ude42 Why so many therapy videos? Heck, wya so many videos, period? One of the reasons we started this website was to give the world an inside look at what life was like for parents raising a child born with that extra  21 chromosome . (For those of you that have no idea what I just said, children with Down syndrome are born with a 3rd copy of their 21st chromosome, as opposed to 2.) Initially there were two groups of people I really wanted to reach with this website. Group One: I just got a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome\u2026.now what!? So many parents who receive a  prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome  are led to believe that their life is going to be sad, or  exceptionally\u00a0 difficult if they choose to bring their child with Down syndrome to full term. (Parenting\u00a0is difficult in\u00a0general. Having\u00a0a child with Down syndrome doesn\u2019t\u00a0necessarily\u00a0make it  more \u00a0difficult,  per se .) Many of these parents spend  countless hours  online researching information about down syndrome pregnancy,  down syndrome cures ,  down syndrome causes ,  down syndrome resources , and all the rest.\u00a0They are  scared . Nervous. Anxious. Confused. But most of all they are hungry to know what it means to have a child with Down syndrome. Hungry to find out what their life will be like if they  choose  to bring their child to full term? Hungry to find out how different\u00a0their life will be as a result of their new baby\u2026who just happens to have Down syndrome. In other words; they are hungry to learn what a down syndrome diagnosis means. My hope was (and still is) that as those moms and dads are desperately searching the internet for information, they would come across this website and see Noah. See our videos. See a sneak peek into the life of one family raising one child with Down syndrome. And that they would see that our story isn\u2019t a sad one. In fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite. (Then I hope they visit our  Facebook page  and meet thousands of  incredible parents  doing an awesome job raising a child with Down syndrome!) Group Two: \u201cSurprise! I have more chromosomes than you.\u201d \u2013 Noah The second group of people are those parents who (like me) were  surprised  to learn that their child was born with Down syndrome.\u00a0When Noah was born I remember spending countless hours in our cold hospital room with my trusty  MacBook Air \u00a0trying to find some  videos about Down syndrome . I remember going to  YouTube ,\u00a0typing in \u2018Down syndrome videos\u2019 or \u201cvideos about Down syndrome\u201d (I don\u2019t recommend doing this by the way) and hoping to find 20 bazillion\u00a0 encouraging  videos about Down syndrome. Boy was I wrong. Sure, there were  some . But there were also  lots  of not-so-encouraging ones. Comedians making hurtful jokes. Super-outdated videos. Super-sappy videos. Super-long videos (I don\u2019t want to watch 10 minutes of anyone\u2019s home video\u2026Down syndrome, or no Down syndrome.) \ud83d\ude42 Super-weird videos (If you ever worry that you and your family are weird, just spend a few minutes on YouTube. You\u2019ll quickly find out that you are not nearly as weird as you think you are.\u00a0Trust me.) In other words it was hard for me to see the tree in light of the forest. The needle in the haystack. The polar bear in the snow storm. Waldo on the beach\u2026Waldo on a ski slope\u2026.Waldo at a sports stadium\u2026Waldo at the\u2026..I think you get the idea. Sure, there were lots of great\u00a0 blogs about Down syndrome , but I\u2019m a  visual  person. I wanted to watch (not read). I wanted videos. I wanted a window into the life of a family raising a child with Down syndrome. The Power Of Story To make a long story short, a few months after\u00a0 bringing Noah home \u00a0from the hospital I came across a video that  encouraged me greatly . After watching that one short video I wanted more. A lot more. But once again I had a difficult time finding them. However, watching that one video reminded me of something very important; the  power of story . So I decided to tell ours. I decided I would create for others what I had a hard time finding for myself. Videos. Lots and lots of videos. In fact I would do a video every day (or at least try to.) I would create an online narrative of our son\u2019s life. I would tell his story by posting a daily one minute video of what life is like for a family raising a child born with Down syndrome. My hope was (and still is) to reach the two groups of people mentioned above; parents receiving a  prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome , and parents surprised by a  Down syndrome diagnosis after birth . To show them that life goes on. That the rush of emotions fades. That\u00a0stereotypes are whack. (To new parents: sorry to disappoint you, but despite what you\u2019re about to hear pretty much every day of your life;\u00a0 people with Down syndrome aren\u2019t angels .) That our story isn\u2019t a sad one, it\u2019s a beautiful one. In other words I want to show them the power of our story. Ok\u2026But Why So Why So Many Physical Therapy Videos? Because it\u2019s part of our story\u2026..and he gets to ride a  elephant  sometimes, why not! \ud83d\ude42 But on a serious note, when we first started on this journey I had no idea what Noah\u2019s therapy visits were going to be like. Were they going to mega hard for him? Could I come? Was it going to make him cry? Was it going to make me cry? (I can seriously cry like a little girl at any given moment, I promise.) Was it going to be boring (to him, or me!) Was was he going to do during his visits? I was clueless. I would have liked to have known what to expect. Sure, I could have read a number of the fantastic blogs that are out there, and that may work for most people, but I\u2019m not like most people (really, I\u2019m not) I wanted videos.\u00a0As it turns out we receive a lot of emails from families who enjoy  seeing  some of the things Noah is doing in therapy with their own eyes. They find it helpful. (Which is good, because it\u2019s a lot of work.) \ud83d\ude42 In addition to that we receive\u00a0emails from people all over the world (literally,  all over the world ) asking me to post more (and longer) videos of Noah\u2019s therapy sessions. Many of these parents have  no therapy resources  where they live, and they actually use the videos to get ideas of things to do with their own children. (This of course comes with its own dangers since you should  never  try out anything you see on any of our videos without the  explicit permission  of your pediatrician and pediatric physical/occupational therapists. But still, that\u2019s powerful.) Each and every one of these emails do 3 things for me: \n Breaks my heart for those families. \n Reminds me how incredible blessed we are to\u00a0live in an area with so many resources available to our son. \n Causes me to think (often) about creative ways on how to get pediatric therapy services to these families and their children. But that\u2019s another blog post for another day\u2026\u2026\u2026 \n Anyways, sorry for the long blog post today. I just wanted to take a second (or a half hour!) to shed some light on why we post so many videos. I hope what you see (and read) here is encouraging\u2026.and shows you that the story isn\u2019t as bad as some OBGYN\u2019s would lead you to believe. In fact it\u2019s not sad at all. It\u2019s beautiful. I wouldn\u2019t want to live in any other story. I really mean that. (And if need more proof there are over 12,000 families  here  that will tell you the same thing.) To parents of children with Down syndrome: What are some of the things you searched for online when you first found out that your child had Down syndrome? What things were helpful? What things did you have a hard time finding? \u00a0What things did you want to find, but couldn\u2019t? And if you\u00a0really want to be super awesome, I\u2019d be interested in hearing what some of the exact phrases you typed into google were. Don\u2019t worry we won\u2019t judge.

{"date": ",February,19,2012", "body": "I don\u2019t know how many of you played a musical instrument but I played the piano and saxophone. I was much more talented in the musical department than I was in sports, so if Noah isn\u2019t good at sports it has nothing to do with  Down syndrome  \u2026.but possibly everything to do with his mother. I however, thought that basketball was way cooler than the piano, so at 15 I decided it was time to focus on basketball after  9 years  of piano lessons! WHAT WAS I THINKING?  (Yes mom I know you are reading this, and you were right\u2026) I went on to quit the basketball team my senior year as I had better things to do then sit on a bench of a coach who didn\u2019t really think I had game. It was one of the hardest things I did as I had never quit anything in my life, but it was the right decision. Can I still play the piano, yes, but who knows what I would have gone on to achieve had I stuck to what I was good at. Brain Hemispheres and Their Function My piano teacher believed firmly that music connected both sides of the brain. The right side of your brain thought to be creative, artistic and musical; and the left to be speech, comprehension, math, and writing. There are several benefits of music for children with learning disabilities, but I am going to touch on just one today as I promise you this is not Noah\u2019s last exposure to a musical instrument and more will come. Music Training And Its Effect On The Brain There have been a few studies out of Hong Kong that focus on music\u2019s effect on learning. One study showed that individuals who had musical training tended to have an enlarged left temporal lobe. I thought this a bit weird considering music is supposed to be on the right side of the brain. There are studies that show that as your musical experience increases it shifts from the right to left side of the brain. The left temporal lobe has a lot to do with speech and verbal memory. As you can probably guess, those with musical training have been shown to have  improved verbal memory  than those without. Once musical training is stopped the improvement in verbal memory also stopped, they still remained above those without any training, but they did not continue to progress as those still involved. I think this can help us understand why music helps us learn verbally, and why songs get stuck in our head rather than the last book chapter we read. Noah loves to make music. He will pound on keyboards, drums, shake  maracas  and jam with the\u00a0 tambourine . I think the tambourine may be one of his favorites. What ways do you incorporate music with your child? What benefits have you seen?

{"date": ",December,29,2011", "body": "When Noah was born one of my biggest  fears  was that he would never be able to do normal-kid type stuff. \u00a0(Or as we\u2019re supposed to say in the \u201cworld of special needs parenting\u2026.. typical children.)  \u00a0I remember sitting in the hospital room wondering if Noah would ever want to play with me, go to the zoo with me, spend afternoon at the playground with me, or do a million other things that  typical kids  do. After all, he was\u00a0 born with Down syndrome , didn\u2019t that mean he was going to be sick all the time? \ud83d\ude09 Boy was I wrong\u2026.. (By the way, before Noah was born everything I knew about Down syndrome I learned from\u00a0Corky on \u201c Life Goes On \u201d and the cheerleader,  Becky , on Glee, so you\u2019ll have to excuse my ignorance.) I say this all the time, but the fact that Noah has  Down syndrome \u00a0just fades into the background of our life. \u00a0We don\u2019t even really think about it all that much. \u00a0Sure, we go to a few more  therapy appointments  than a  typical  family (what is a  typical , or  normal\u00a0 family anyway?!) \u00a0Sure our son gives way better hugs than a  typical  child ( hypotonia !). \u00a0Sure, there are some unique challenges that we have (and will deal with as the come up). \u00a0But our life is much more  typical  than I would have ever imagined it would be 9 months ago. Noah likes to do the same things as every other child I\u2019ve ever met (regardless of a disability). Noah likes to play. To Laugh. To Hug. To Cuddle. To Cry. To Explore. To Sleep. To Eat. To Poop. To Love. To Smile. To have Fun. And swing sets. Noah likes swing sets. \u00a0A lot.

{"date": ",November,3,2011", "body": "In medicine, the term \u201cevidence-based\u201d hold a lot of weight. \u00a0 It is how every doctor should make decisions. \u00a0This means that the result of a certain intervention, may it be a drug, a therapy, or surgery, has been proven by research studies. \u00a0 You want your doctors to use this kind of medicine as it is most likely to lead to the best result. The treadmill is one of these fantastic evidence-based tools and the article  Treadmill Training of Infants with Down Syndrome: Evidence Based Developmental Outcomes  gives us a method as well as expected results of this intervention. \u00a0You may wonder why these babies are being put on treadmills long before even a typical child would be expected to walk\u2026well this article shows that this intervention helps our children with Down syndrome walk a little sooner. Why Walking Is Important The average age of walking for a child with Down syndrome is  23 months , whereas a typical child is 12-13 months. \u00a0Walking is an important part of  development  as it changes the way the child is able to interact in their environment, specifically with other people like playing with children. \u00a0I have heard from other mothers that as soon as a child learned to walk they blossomed in many other areas including  language . \u00a0I am ok with Noah walking when he is ready to walk, but I also want to give him every opportunity to explore on his two feet. \u00a0He is already a  rolling  adventurer\u2026you gotta watch out for this kid or the next thing you know he is under a couch. Stepping Reflex Our  physical therapist  brought up treadmill training to us and we got very excited. \u00a0Her fabulous student Jill was doing research on the topic just for us. \u00a0The idea behind treadmill training is to create the stepping reflex. \u00a0The stepping reflex is making a stepping movement when the sole of the foot hits a hard surface. \u00a0It is present at  birth  and is supposed to disappear around 2 months. \u00a0 Noah never had a stepping reflex when he was born which is common in children with  hypotonia . \u00a0There is research that shows that if a child has the stepping reflex continue past this point it can help them learn to walk a little bit sooner than expected. \u00a0The baby learns a \u201cpracticed pattern\u201d that he or she can apply once they are ready to walk. When Can We Start? The one hinderance to evidence based medicine is that you can only use the statistics if you fit the criteria that the article used. \u00a0One of their criteria is that the child can  sit for 30 seconds  prior to starting treadmill training. \u00a0The treadmill was dangled in front of us for a few weeks before we were able to use it. \u00a0Thank you  sitting marathon , you are paying off today! \u00a0This was used as a measurement of time assuming that children were developmentally similar at this time and the next major  milestones  would be what was encouraged by the treadmill training. \u00a0The average age was about 300 days when the kids started the study. Treadmill Method The article actually used parents as the treadmill trainers and provided treadmills in each of the parent\u2019s homes. \u00a0They were tiny treadmills made just for this study. \u00a0The parents were to use it 5 times per week for 8 minutes at 0.2 meters per second which is almost 0.5 miles per hour. \u00a0When first starting, the children were not walking consistently for 8 minutes. \u00a0They would walk for 1 minutes, rest, and try again until they could achieve the full 8 minutes. \u00a0The parent supports the child over the treadmill so that their feet touch the ground and are moved back by the treadmill. \u00a0The hope being that when their foot is too far behind them they will lift it up and put it in front of them. \u00a0Eventually this will become a practiced pattern that the child has mastered. Results Now on to what we really care about\u2026the results. \u00a0The children getting the intervention were compared to children not getting treadmill training. \u00a0This makes for the \u201cperfect\u201d study: a randomized controlled trial. \u00a0This is the best of the best when it comes to looking for evidence. \u00a0Of the three outcomes, two were statistically significant meaning that the results were not by chance based on the statistical analysis. \u00a0Raising self to stand occurred at day 134 (from enrollment in the study or from when they were sitting for 30 seconds), which was 60 days earlier than the control, this however was NOT statistically significant. \u00a0Walking with help occurred at 166 days, 73 days earlier than the control. \u00a0And lastly, walking independently occurred at 300 days, which was 101 days earlier than the control. \u00a0Both of these were found to be statically significant. Now that may not seem like a huge difference, but a little over 3 months is a huge difference when you are not even 2 yet. \u00a0The average age of walking for those who went through treadmill training was 19.9 months and for the control group it was 23.9 month. \u00a0The 4 months difference now is because we are not talking days from sitting anymore, but the actual age of the infants when they walk. \u00a0The control group was slightly older. Small Insight Seen In the Article One of of my favorite things about this study were not just the results. \u00a0Not one parent dropped out. \u00a0Whether it was the control or the or treadmill training group they stuck it through to the end. \u00a0Not many studies can boast that kind of result. \u00a0I think that says a lot about the parents that raise children with Down syndrome; they don\u2019t give up and they are willing to put in the work. \u00a0Go team! We Will Be Patient We are far from following the method as we only have a treadmill at therapy and we go twice per week, but we are trying to help Noah learn to put one foot forward, \u00a0and when he is  ready  may it be at 19 months or after his 2nd birthday we will celebrate him walking independently.

{"date": ",November,2,2011", "body": "The Heart Doctor Today is a day that the majority of parents of children with  Down syndrome  will encounter. It is our day to visit the cardiologist. One of the most common  medical concerns  for  children born with Down syndrome  is congenital (being born with it) heart defects. This encompasses a variety of different conditions. The most common for children with Down syndrome are  atrial septal defects  and  ventricular septal defects , and there is a third type that is seen significantly more\u00a0in children with Down syndrome as compared to the general public and that is the  atrioventricular canal defect . There are a variety of others but these are the most common. Future Ambitions When I was in medical school I was convinced I was going to be a pediatric cardiologist. I was obsessed with the career path and did everything I possibly could to get exposure. I got extremely lucky in landing a preceptorship with one of the top pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons in Houston who taught me the basics. It was the first time I got to see a beating heart the size of a strawberry. I know a heck of a lot more about pediatric cardiology then the average pediatrician thanks to my experiences. I started to reconsider during residency and finally decided that it did not hold my interest the way a career should. I also knew that my family (and future family members) were a priority to me and I was not willing to sacrifice my time with them to follow a career that I was only somewhat interested in. Which leads me to today, where I know a lot about cardiology but am living it up doing shift work in the emergency room and spending the majority of my time with the cutest little man I know, happy as could be. Mom\u2019s Heart Fears In The Beginning I will never forget when our cardiologist visited us in the hospital. After our pediatrician told us Noah had  features consistent with Down syndrome , I remember clutching my chest and trying to get the words out \u201chow is his heart?\u201d. She reassured me, but said the cardiologist would be by in the morning. It was torture waiting because I was contemplating all of the possibilities. He walked in during the mid morning and started with excellent bedside manner trying to get to know my family and then explaining to us the normal heart. All I wanted to do was shout  \u201cstop making small talk and spit out some acronyms so I know what is going on\u201d . He finally cut to the chase and told us that Noah had a  patent ductus arterious  (PDA) and an atrial septal defect (ASD). I think my sigh of relief may have been audible. \ud83d\ude42 Our Appointment His PDA was closed by his first check up, 2 months after he was born, praise the Lord! \u00a0Today\u2019s appointment was to check on his ASD. At his last visit we were given a 50/50 chance for it to close on its own. When we go to our visits they start with an EKG (electrocardiogram). This is when Noah looks like he is jump starting a car or in a torture device of some sort. I promise those are just stickers and they don\u2019t hurt at all. An EKG looks at the electrical forces the heart makes. It can show arrhythmias, if certain areas are larger than normal or if areas are not getting enough blood supply (like heart attacks) and that is just a few of its purposes. \u00a0There are certain changes that are seen with ASD\u2019s so you can get hints that it is still open with just this test. The next step is getting an echocardiogram. This is a fancy word for an ultrasound of the heart. They use the same machine as what is used when you were pregnant to look at the baby. They can get detailed views of all of the chambers and vessels, tell which way blood is flowing (blue and red colors are directions not oxygen) as well as how the heart is pumping. \u00a0 If you knew your child had Down syndrome prior to delivery there is a chance your little one had this even before they were born. \u00a0I don\u2019t like to fess up about a lot of my knowledge as I could always be wrong and I don\u2019t know everything, but I was fairly certain I saw the little jet go from his left atrium to his right atrium during his echo. This meant that his ASD was still open. We then waited for our cardiologist. I think it was only 5 minutes, but it felt a lot longer. She\u2019s very nice and does an excellent job of explaining things. She confirmed that Noah\u2019s ASD was still open. HOWEVER it was ONLY 2MM!!!! The last time we got it measured it was 5mm. It is shrinking and that is fantastic news. We were told the last time that if it were smaller or the same size chances would improve that it would close without intervention. Being only 2mm was such good news that we don\u2019t even have to be seen until next year. She told us if he had been born with one that size she would not have even followed him as it would almost always close on its own. We were doing some serious praising after this!! What\u2019s The Big Deal With A Small Hole? You may wonder why do we want these holes to close so badly. Surgery would be indicated if the holes were not able to close on their own. They are closed \u00a0to protect the heart from volumes of blood and pressures it was not meant to experience. An ASD puts increase blood volume on the right side of the heart and can in 20-30 years cause the lung vessels to get stiff causing pulmonary hypertension. I promise you this is not something you want. It would require not just a heart transplant but a lung heart transplant to fix the problem. So that is why we worry about a hole that allows more blood on the right side of the heart. \u00a0Granted no cardiologist who is following your child will let it get to the point where you need a heart transplant which is why an ASD is repaired between the ages of 3-5 years old if needed \u00a0You can imagine how relieved we were to hear this news. Praising God Rick and I had been praying daily that Noah\u2019s ASD would be closed or getting smaller and God came through for us in a big way. We are beyond grateful for all of our answered prayers. I can\u2019t even begin to list them all as the list is too long. \u00a0But we say thanks every day for what He is doing in our lives. Our little man is pretty tough as his day did not stop there, he continued on into  therapy  as if it were no big deal. He worked out just like he always does, even doing push ups on the  ball . I don\u2019t know how he does it all at 8 months old as his parents were sure exhausted. What good news have you had lately? \u00a0Is there anything we can pray about for you? \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pediatricheartspecialists.com/view/76", "http://www.pediatricheartspecialists.com/view/63", "http://portal.childrens.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/b0/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfIji0sSK8tTc3KsAgwMzc3M9cP1o_SjSioLUvUjLQ30C3JzHQGRN5Kh/", "http://www.pediatricheartspecialists.com/view/79"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/cardiologist/", "title": "A Day Full Of Cardiologists, EKGs, Hearts, And Praise!"},
{"date": ",January,23,2012", "body": "Today Noah got to visit his pediatrician, whom we love. She\u2019s not only super encouraging, but she has all of the\u00a0 qualities\u00a0we are looking for  in our son\u2019s pediatrician. She gets excited when she sees Noah and shows him off to everyone in her office She also takes time to  listen  to us, because even though I too am a pediatrician, I still have questions. There are no words to express how much we appreciate her and what she does for our son. The Flu Shot: Separating Fact From Fiction Noah received his  first flu  shot today. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have heard that  the flu shot gives you the flu . I thought I would give you MY reasons why I think the flu shot is important and some myths about the flu shot. I know you all have your own reasons about why or why you don\u2019t get the flu shot. My goal as a doctor is that you have  accurate  information when making these decisions, but realizing that it is YOUR decision. \u00a03 Reasons To Get The Flu Shot \n Getting the flu is awful; why not try to avoid it. You feel miserable, you miss work or school, and you can\u2019t do the things you enjoy. One little poke could help you stay healthy. \u00a0Shoot you don\u2019t even have to have a poke if you fit the criteria it can go up your nose \ud83d\ude42 \n Getting the flu can be deadly, especially those with underlying  health conditions , such as heart conditions (which is quite common in  Down syndrome ) or asthma. It is also more risky for those who are simply young or old. During my training, I saw several previously healthy kids  die of the flu  and if a shot can prevent that how awesome is that. \n When you get the flu you put other people at risk of getting the flu and having the above happen. You can\u2019t get the flu shot until you are  6 months old . So those who can\u2019t be vaccinated are actually probably the most at risk for severe complications. We have to do what we can to protect them and the flu shot is one way to do it. \n Flu Shot Myth: I Get The Flu Every Time I Get The Flu Shot \n It is actually  impossible  for you to get the flu from the flu shot, as the virus in the shot is  dead . Only  live viruses  can get you sick. Now the nasal spray is a live WEAKENED virus and that is why those with immune compromise should  not  get the nasal spray. \n You may feel awful for the 24 hours after you get the flu shot. Your body is creating an immune response to the dead virus so that when you meet the real thing your body can attack it. You may have a fever or feel achy, but that is not being sick with the flu. \n You actually do have the flu because you were exposed when you went to get your flu shot. It takes about two weeks for your body to be ready to fend off the flu, so if you are exposed during that time you can still get sick. I am sorry if this happens to you as you had the best intentions \n The flu shot didn\u2019t cover for this year\u2019s flu is another reason you may get sick. A few years ago the  World Health Organization  projected the wrong strain and a lot of people ended up getting the flu. They do a lot of research, but they can\u2019t guarantee anything. Based on their research the flu vaccine contains the most likely strains projected to happen that year. There is not just one strain. They usually include a type A and type B strain as well as the H1N1 (swine flu) now. All can be present during the flu season. \u00a0Based on what I have seen (or not seen this year) I think the chances are good we are covered. \n A Few Warnings About The Flu Shot As with everything involving a medical decision you should consult with your own doctor and not just listen to me. \u00a0There are things that will change what type of flu shot you get, what office you are sitting in when you get it, and if you should even get it at all. Flu Mist The flu mist should not be given to those less than 2, people over 50, those whose immune system is not up to par either due to illness or medication, ASTHMA, or any wheezing prior to age 5, chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, kidney failure, children/adolescents receiving aspirin, pregnant women, egg allergy, and those with a history of Guillain-Barre (a condition where you become temporally paralyzed from the legs up). \u00a0 So in other words the flu mist should only be given to healthy individuals age 2-49 (that means no chronic illnesses). \u00a0 The reason behind all those warnings is that the flu mist IS a live virus and there is a chance you can get sick from the vaccine. \u00a0However, it actually has been shown to work better than the shot, so if it is an option go for it. \u00a0It also does not contain any thimerosal so for those of you concerned about that it is a great option. Egg Allergy Yes the flu vaccine is created by using chicken eggs. \u00a0So if you have an egg allergy there is a chance you may react to the flu shot. \u00a0However, you can go to your allergist and they will do a skin test to see if you will react to the vaccine. \u00a0If there is no response, you are good to go to get the shot. \u00a0It is actually more common to not react even with an egg allergy. \u00a0If there is a response, you and your doctor have to discuss if the benefit outweighs the risk. \u00a0Allergic reactions can be treated so even with a reaction you can get the flu shot. Previous Adverse Reaction If you have had a severe allergic reaction, a serious reaction, or if you have ever had Guillain-Barre (temporary paralysis that moves from the feet up) you should have a lengthy discussion with your doctor if you desire the flu shot again. \u00a0My best guess is that no one would be interested in the flu shot again after those types of reactions. A Word On Thimerosal I did not write this post to argue about mercury or the causes of Autism. \u00a0It is a never ending argument and one that I feel has greatly effected the protection of our children. \u00a0In all honesty I probably shouldn\u2019t have gotten myself started as I get fired up about this topic. \u00a0 Single dose vaccines  (meaning they only use one vial per child and don\u2019t stick it back in the fridge)  do not contain thimerosal . \u00a0Those vials that do have multi-doses use thimerosal as a  preservative . \u00a0In 1999 there was a decision to  remove thimerosal from all vaccines  despite their being any evidence that it actually causes problems. \u00a0For children under 6 the only chance at exposure is with the multi-dose flu vaccine. There has been no evidence to show that thimerosal or mercury for that matter is associated with causing Autism. If you guys want more information the expert on vaccines in my opinion is  Paul Offit, MD , and I recommend you at least read his standpoint by either what is provided on the internet or in his books before you finalize your decision on vaccines. \u00a0As for my experience, I have  never  in my career as a medical doctor seen a case of H. Flu (Hib), measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), Polio (IPV), or tetanus. \u00a0I have seen maybe 5 cases of Chicken Pox which were all mild. \u00a0I was hospitalized myself at 6 months of age due to Chicken Pox and a staph infection. \u00a0Those who have trained me have seen all of these diseases and watched children have brain damage, become crippled and die because of them. \u00a0The fact that I have not treated one child with these conditions is a MIRACLE in my opinion. \u00a0 I have watched children die from pertussis and the flu, both which can be prevented with vaccination.  \u00a0 It is something I hope no parent has to experience. Noah Has To Go Back For One More When your child gets the flu shot for the first time they usually have to get two. Noah will be going back in one month to get his second flu shot to be fully covered. The Day Didn\u2019t End After The Flu Shot: Therapy and Food Time! Our day continued after our visit to our primary care physician (PCP). We went to  therapy , where Noah continued to act like a rock star despite having to get shots earlier in the day. \u00a0By the way, you\u2019ll notice the toy Noah\u2019s physical therapist is using in this video was also featured on our  best gift ideas  post\u2026.this is seriously one of the best toys you can can buy under 10 dollars! Feeding Advances We also did some advances in his  feeding . We have been using  pureed fruits  or vegetables for the last few months and today we thought we would try meats. They don\u2019t smell nearly as good. I haven\u2019t mastered the art of pureeing meats so I am using store bought versions. I have heard that a lot of kids aren\u2019t fans (I really can\u2019t blame them based on the smell), but Noah seemed to not mind. He gobbled it down just as he usually does. We also thought we would try some  Gerber Baby Puffs \u00a0and let Noah attempt to feed himself. This is when knowledge of  grasp  would have been helpful. Noah could not quite figure out how to pick these up. If I had only known better, I would have realized that his grasp was not ready to pick up the puffs as it requires a  pincher grasp  where at this point Noah only consistently uses the  palmar grasp.  (If you\u2019d like to learn more about grasping, I discussed the various grasps in a post entitled:  Learn To Grasp: A Cheap And Easy Fine Motor Skills Exercise Your Child Can Do At Home .) \u00a0Oh well, he still liked it when we put these in his mouth. It was a new experience for him to have something crunchy. They dissolve quickly so they are easy for the child to swallow. \u00a0We will keep practicing and someday soon, Noah will be chomping on these all by himself. We sure packed a lot into this day. \ud83d\ude42 Do you have a memorable day of how many things you were actually able to accomplish?

He\u2019s a million times cuter then me, and probably makes a lot more sense.

Six Months Is All It Takes To Become A Superbaby Noah is our first son, so I had no idea that on a babies\u00a0six month\u00a0birthday they transform into a super baby! Seriously, I feel like Noah went from just lying around and being a mega-cute baby, to  sitting up  (sort of),  eating ,  playing ,  talking ,  swimming , grabbing my face,  laughing  all the time, etc. I feel like there is a celebrity in my house! I\u2019m star-stuck by all of his emotions; every smile, every laugh, every cry\u2026.it\u2019s all memorizing to me. Being a dad has deepened my relationship with The Lord like no other point in my life. Every time I look at my son I\u2019m reminded of Genesis 1:21: \u201c\u2026God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him\u2026\u201d There are simply no words that would allow me to adequately describe to you how  real  that verse is to me. And how much more \u201crealer\u201d it gets with each little laugh, cry, smile, and poop (yes, even poop! ) The best I can do is to simply say that Noah reminds me of God. More then any other person, seminary class, or pastor in my life. Not in some weird  religious  way or anything. Our Son Is A Masterpiece It\u2019s just just I see the masterpiece (workmanship) that Paul talks about in Eph 2:10 in my son. Noah reminds me that God is very much in the business of creating masterpieces. Which in turn reminds me of two more things that all parents must never forget: 1. God must love me a lot to trust me with one of his masterpieces. \n 2. Being responsible for a masterpiece is a great responsibility. A Room With A View Almost every night, after all the world has long been asleep, I quietly go into Noah\u2019s nursery, kneel by his crib and watch him  sleep  (actually, a lot of the times I\u2019m being paranoid and want to make sure he is still alive! (Any  new parents  out there feel me?) It takes me a few seconds for me to to see his tiny tummy move move up and down in the darkness, but once I see it, I feel better. I\u2019m reminded once again that God is in control. Then I gently put my hand on his small chest so that I can feel his little heart beat. And I\u2019m reminded once again that God is in control. I stay there for a while, give him a small kiss, and thank God for him. That breath, that heartbeat, that life\u2026it all comes from God. Not me. Not his mom. God. How about you?

{"date": ",February,13,2012", "body": "\nThe first thing we wanted to do in  our new backyard  was get our little man a swing. Our trees aren\u2019t quite big enough so we are using our pergola over our back patio. Noah loves the swing. We use a very large one at our  therapy sessions , and Noah has seen his fair share of swings in  other people\u2019s backyards . We have been waiting patiently to have a swing of our very own and today is the day. My favorite part of swinging is Noah\u2019s  laugh . He does it every time he gets in the  swing , and I can\u2019t get enough of it. He just giggles away like he is having the best time ever. The laugh also encourages us to keep pushing to continue the fun. He has trained us well. Think swings are just for fun? Think again. We didn\u2019t buy this swing for any other purpose but for Noah (and us) to have fun. However there are some great side benefits to swinging, not only for children with  Down syndrome , but for all kids. We will often start our\u00a0 occupational\u00a0therapy  sessions with swinging as it helps wake up Noah\u2019s muscles and get him to activate his  core . The movement forces him to engage his core to keep him sitting up. It helps him be aware of his body and the different movements he needs to make to maintain his balance. Sensory Integration And Swinging Swinging helps with sensory integration. Two sensing systems we have (and no I am not just talking about taste, touch, smell, hearing, sight) are our vestibular system and proprioception. All of our systems intertwine so we can move with ease and experience our environment. These two senses are vital to be able to do this. 1. Vestibular System Our vestibular system is in our inner ear and helps us know if we are moving and which direction we are going. It is essential to balance. It is the reason we get motion sickness or feel like the room is spinning if you are every diagnosed with vertigo. \u00a0 We actually have three loops in our inner ear and the direction of the fluid inside tells our brain how we are moving. God\u2019s design always blows me away. If you apply this to swinging, you are moving in multiple directions and having to balance on the seat, all integrating our vestibular system to figure out what in the world is going on. 2. Proprioception Proprioception is our sense of knowing our body and where our different parts are located in relation to each other and how they are moving. It can be described as body awareness. There are constant messages being sent from our peripheral body (through proprioceptors and nerves) to our brain and ears telling them where these parts are located and what they are doing. Again apply this to swinging, and the body has to figure out where you are in space and how to control a moving object. Movement involves so many different messages from our body and swinging is just one tool used to help our little guys figure out how to interpret those messages and use their bodies to the best of their ability. Have you discovered any \u201chidden\u201d benefits of using your child\u2019s favorite toys or activities. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/swings-help-children-sensory-integration/", "title": "2 Ways Swings Help Children With Sensory Integration"},
{"date": ",February,14,2012", "body": "Yelp, it\u2019s that time of the week again. Another fun-filled day of physical and  occupational therapy  for Noah. As you can see in today\u2019s video his  physical therapist  is using  treadmill training  to help him learn to walk. Noah\u2019s actually been doing it for a few months now, and it\u2019s been neat to watch his little feet take more and more steps with each visit. Therapy \u2260 Hassle If you\u2019ve been following our  story  than you\u2019ve probably noticed that we post  a lot  of videos from Noah\u2019s various therapy appointments; that\u2019s because we bring him to therapy 2 -3 times a week\u2026so therapy has become a big part of our life. In fact, as often as we visit I feel like we should have our own parking space by now. \ud83d\ude42 When we first started taking Noah to therapy I wondered how long it would be before all of these trips became a huge hassle. He has to be here several times a week, and it isn\u2019t like we have buckets of spare time just sitting around our  house . The actual therapy sessions are the easy part (for us at least.) It\u2019s the getting ready, driving across town, fighting traffic, scheduling our day around his appointments, and trying to remember to put shoes on his feet (this little boy does not like shoes) as we hurry out the door that\u2019s difficult. But you know what, now that we\u2019re a little over a year into this journey, I can honestly say it\u2019s no hassle at all. Sure there are days when we\u2019d much rather stay at home (and days when we actually do stay home! Shhhhhh\u2026.don\u2019t tell anyone) and lots of days where we don\u2019t manage to leave our house in time and end up being super late, but at the end of the day I don\u2019t mind one bit. Really I don\u2019t. I\u2019m thankful for the investment these occupational and physical therapists are making in our son. I\u2019m thankful to live in an area with so many  resources  at our fingertips. And I\u2019m thankful that day by day, step by step Noah is growing and developing. It\u2019s amazing to see this little boy grow up\u2026.he makes me  drunk with pride ! \ud83d\ude42 How many times a week is your child in therapy?

{"date": ",February,3,2012", "body": "You may have noticed at one point in today\u2019s video Noah was motivated by a paper towel\u2026yep, a paper towel. It\u2019s a lot\u00a0like playing with the box that the toy  came in  rather than the toy itself. Thank goodness I have these at home. I don\u2019t seem to be using them for cleaning, so motivating my child it is\u2026! Motivators are essential in Noah\u2019s therapy and  development . They help turn hard work into play,  core  work into entertainment, and frowns into  smiles . And most importantly help them to meet their  developmental milestones! Let Your (Child\u2019s) Eyesight Be Your Guide Infants can see color, but they are more entertained by  strong contrasts  such as  black and white . These will be the  best toys  to help with motivation. You will notice several toys in the baby aisle\u00a0have strong contrasts. You will also be able to find  sensory books  that are only black and white. \u00a0Noah really enjoyed those and I did notice that he focused on them with more intensity than the brightly colored books. Around 3-4 months of age you may notice that they are much more interested in things that are  brightly colored  and  toys  that make noise. Now you get to start breaking out the lights and action for motivation. Our  occupational therapist  recommended sitting in a dark room with lighted toys such as one of our favorites the  light wand  and going from side to side to help Noah stay focused and work on tracking. We have found it to be quite the motivator for other tasks now as you have seen us use it to try to get him to move forward as well. Motivators Are Great\u2026umm\u2026Motivation! One of the best things you can do for your child to help them make the most of their therapy sessions, and hit their  goals , is finding out what motivates them. It may be you, it may be lights, music, or even your family dog. \u00a0Every child is different, and what works for one child, may not necessarily work for another. \u00a0You will eventually find something that your child loves (like our wand for Noah), and that is the one you have to save for the  big wins \u00a0like\u00a0helping them get through a task they don\u2019t enjoy doing or motivating them to  move forward . \u00a0 One of our friends just discovered that their child would crawl forward if his mom threw him up in the air once he got to her. That is a pretty awesome motivator that I may have to try myself. What motivates your child? \u00a0Do you have an ultimate motivator? \u00a0What has (and hasn\u2019t) worked for you?

{"date": ",August,10,2011", "body": "After a long  road trip , and a fun day of  celebrating  Noah\u2019s mom yesterday, we decided to use day three of our vacation as a chill day! A Little Swimmer Noah\u2019s  grandmother  suggested we spend the afternoon at the  Aspen Recreation Center , and I\u2019m glad she did because it\u2019s awesome! The Aspen Recreation Center has tons of really  fun  (and affordable) activities for a family to enjoy. If you are ever in Aspen, and looking to take a break from the slopes (or the hiking) I highly suggest the Aspen Recreation center! Ever since we took Noah for his  first swim  he\u2019s been hooked. \u00a0We wanted Grandma and Grandpa to see this little guy in full swim action; thankfully, the Aspen Recreation Center had a super fun heated indoor pool with several slides, water toys, and my personal favorite\u2026a lazy river! This was my first time taking Noah on a lazy river, and he had a blast! At first I was holding on to him (very tightly) and we just sort of floated around the river. Then one of the employees handed us a baby raft that Noah could get inside and ride on. \u00a0And he really enjoyed it! One of the  physical\u00a0characteristics of down syndrome  is low muscle tone, and since Noah is still  working hard  on his  core  I was skeptical of him being able to use the raft. Much to my surprise he didn\u2019t sink through the leg holes at all..in fact he did very well. He floated around the lazy river for a while, and was able to keep his head up the entire time! Besides the lazy river, Noah had a ton of fun playing and goofing off with his cousins and grandparents. This was the first time for all of us to be together, and it was a ton of fun. Our little Noah had a full day at the pool, and thankfully he didn\u2019t get cranky at all. I was (and am) super proud of this little guy! Maybe all of that  physical therapy  is paying off after all!:) Like Father Like Son I have always been a fan of the water. In fact, I\u2019ll be completely transparent with you, I take baths. Yelp, full on, bubble baths. Everyday. It\u2019s true. In fact if you are my friend in real life, chances are you have gotten a FaceTime call from me in the bath. It\u2019s how I roll! Thankfully It looks like my son is following in his father\u2019s footsteps. Because this kid likes water! iPad Bedtime Story Time Our iPads get a lot of use in our home. Beside having some great  developmental apps , they also produce some fantastic story books for the iPad. Noah and his cousin Guy had some fun interacting with one of my childhood favorites,  There\u2019s A Monster at the End of This Book . If you have an iPad I highly suggest checking out this incredibly awesome  iPad story book , it\u2019s a lot of fun! Two questions for you\u2026does your little one like the water? Can you tell yet?

We visit the physical\u00a0therapist weekly on Tuesday and\u00a0Wednesday. \u00a0Their goal is to help Noah develop gross motor skills; crawling, walking, jumping, running, etc. \u00a0When we\u00a0began\u00a0Noah\u2019s\u00a0therapy\u00a0there was a lot of overlap between  occupational  and  physical\u00a0therapy , therefore we only saw the\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapist. \u00a0 However, now\u00a0that he can (sort of)  sit up  that gap is widening and we see both the\u00a0physical\u00a0and occupational\u00a0therapist. Our\u00a0appointments\u00a0are\u00a0approximately\u00a0thirty minutes long, and consist\u00a0of what looks like at first glance a lot of playing. \u00a0However, all of the \u201cplaying\u201d is actually very strategic, and designed to work on specific areas of Noah\u2019s development. Since Noah\u2019s back\u00a0muscles\u00a0are much stronger then his stomach ones, (his core) the focus for the time being is\u00a0strengthening\u00a0his core muscles. \u00a0This is\u00a0accomplished\u00a0by various activities\u00a0such\u00a0as:  getting him to sit up , having him  reach across his chest to grab objects , and having him lie on his back while we touch his knees to his elbows. \u00a0It\u2019s been fun\u00a0watching\u00a0him grow from a weak, shaky, little three week old, to a strong, (semi) stable, six month old! Today was the first day his physical\u00a0therapist\u00a0used the long, round, soft, \u201cpillow\u201d you see in the video during our time\u00a0together. \u00a0As you can see it, Noah sat up behind the pillow, and sort of rolled it back and forth with the help of his physical\u00a0therapist. \u00a0He did a great job, and didn\u2019t tire out at all! This little guy really enjoys going to all of this\u00a0therapy\u00a0visits. He works hard while he\u2019s there, and thinks it\u2019s a weekly play date! As an added surprise, we ran into Noah\u2019s labor  and\u00a0delivery\u00a0nurse\u00a0while we were out! \u00a0She was\u00a0very\u00a0supportive\u00a0and loving towards us when Noah was born, we like her \u2013 a lot!

After your mom and I wiped the tears off our eyes they brought you in. \u00a0Your mom\u00a0smiled, big time! \u00a0She told me afterward that there was no way she was going to be crying the first time she held her son, and she didn\u2019t. \u00a0Oh man, I don\u2019t think either of us put you down the entire time we were in the hospital. \u00a0Actually , I don\u2019t think we have put you down since you\u2019ve been born! \ud83d\ude42 We came home and learned everything we could about Down Syndrome. \u00a0We prayed for you \u2013 non-stop. \u00a0We still do. \u00a0Most of all we loved on you, and you loved on us. \u00a0Things were starting to settle; until we got that call. \u00a0Your new born test came back positive for GA-1. \u00a0It was going to take three months to to know for sure, and so we\u00a0waited. \u00a0Noah, I\u2019m going to be honest, I was sacred. \u00a0More scared then I had every been in my entire life. \u00a0GA-1 looked scary. \u00a0In fact they said if you had GA-1 in\u00a0addition\u00a0to Down Syndrome you may have been the only kid in the world with both. \u00a0That sacred me even more. \u00a0During those three months I prayed and worried more then I ever had in my entire life. \u00a0I also learned more about God during those three months then in four years of seminary. \u00a0I learned to trust God. \u00a0With everything. \u00a0Including you. \u00a0And so I trusted Him. \u00a0Man it was hard. \u00a0I break down into tears just thinking about it that time. \u00a0I feared for you Noah. \u00a0I wondered why us. \u00a0Why were we going to be the people who had to have a son with Down Syndrome and GA-1? \u00a0Wasn\u2019t Down Syndrome \u201cenough?\u201d \u00a0I googled stuff. \u00a0(By the way, promise me you\u2019ll never google serious medical stuff \u2013 ok? \u00a0Just trust me on this one.) \u00a0The more I googled, the more scared I got. \u00a0The more scared I got, the more I prayed. \u00a0I asked my friends to pray. \u00a0Heck, I even fasted. \u00a0I\u2019m not even sure why I fasted, but I did. \u00a0I just wanted to do anything I could do to show God I was serious. \u00a0(Although \u00a0God was looking at \u00a0my heart, I didn\u2019t  have  to do any of that. \u00a0God doesn\u2019t work on a merit system.)

Happy Half Birthday to you Noah. \u00a0The last six months have been a present from you, to me. \u00a0Thank you for coming into the world and being my son. \u00a0For making my life better. \u00a0 Your life is a gift from God to us. \u00a0I am so proud of you. \u00a0You have to work so much harder then all of the other \u201ctypical\u201d kids. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t seem fair, but you handle it so well. \u00a0I can\u2019t get over how radiant your smile is, and how your face lights up every time I pick you up. \u00a0I LOVE IT!!! \u00a0You were born just perfect for me. \u00a0You are just what I wanted in a son; in fact better. \u00a0I tell your mom often how you are way cooler, cuter, loving and funnier, then I would have ever\u00a0imagined. \u00a0I look forward to of our life\u00a0together. \u00a0Noah, you are the best son a dad could ask for. \u00a0Thank you for letting me be your dad. \u00a0I love you.

{"date": ",June,15,2011", "body": "Wow..! \u00a0Today was so great, I\u2019m not even sure where to start. \u00a0One reason for today\u2019s\u00a0awesomeness\u00a0is: \u00a0 Today is Noah\u2019s six month birthday\u2026 ! \u00a0I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already been six months since God blessed us with this cute little guy \u2013 time really does fly. \u00a0As I\u2019ve said before, this has been the best six months of my life, and what\u2019s even more\u00a0exciting\u00a0is that each day is better then the day before! We took Noah in for his six month well child exam, and were given the results of the  CBC test \u00a0(complete blood count) he took on Monday. \u00a0 Everything was clear\u2026!! NO\u00a0LEUKEMIA!!!  (FYI \u2013 Children born with  Down Syndrome  are at a higher risk of developing leukemia than \u201ctypical\u201d children; therefore they must have a CBC test on a regular basis the first few years of their life.) Talk about being able to breathe. I\u2019ve been dreading the \u201csix month CBC test\u201d every since I\u2019ve known about it. \ud83d\ude42 \u00a0I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over with, and we can move on (at least until it has to be ran again at his one year birthday, but we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there!) \u00a0Everything else at the check up went very well. Noah\u2019s excelling in almost every area; he\u2019s just having a tough time gaining weight, but that\u2019s not a big deal. In fact, I think some of it has to do with his\u00a0frequent\u00a0visits to the  physical  and\u00a0 occupational\u00a0therapist . This little dude burns some calories! \u00a0We\u2019re going to be giving him\u00a0supplemental\u00a0formula in\u00a0addition\u00a0to breast milk to help him gain some weight. \u00a0We take him back to his\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0in two weeks for a weight check, and hopefully the little guy will have gained some weight! \u00a0 We had time to squeeze in lunch at one of our favorite Tex-Mex places, Mi Cocina, before taking Noah to his\u00a0 physical\u00a0therapy  appointment. His\u00a0physical\u00a0therapist\u00a0tried out some new exercises with Noah using a platform swing which he seemed to really enjoy! \u00a0It was so fun\u00a0watching\u00a0his\u00a0expressions\u00a0as he swung back and forth! \u00a0 We really enjoy all of the therapists we\u2019ve worked with at  Our Children\u2019s House at Baylor , and couldn\u2019t be happier with Noah\u2019s progress since going there. \u00a0They all agree that Noah is doing\u00a0incredible, which is very\u00a0encouraging\u00a0for Abbie and I to hear. \u00a0 Finally we ended the day with a huge  milestone  \u2013 Noah being able to eat his first (non-liquid) meal! \u00a0Now, most moms go to the store and buy stage 1 baby food, not my super wife! \u00a0In light of this once-in-a-lifetime\u00a0occasion, she made Noah an\u00a0amazing\u00a0bowel\u00a0of  home made baby food , and as you can see, he really liked it! \u00a0He\u00a0scarfed\u00a0down the entire bowl! \u00a0It was really neat seeing him be able to eat so well, especially after all of his  eating problems  during the first few weeks of his life. \u00a0God has\u00a0really\u00a0brought him a long way\u2026! \u00a0We are so thankful. It\u2019s been an\u00a0incredible\u00a0six months, and we are paying for many, many more six months birthdays! \u00a0We have two big things on our\u00a0calendar\u00a0in the coming months for Noah that I\u2019d love for you to be praying for. \u00a0In August we see Noah\u2019s\u00a0cardiologist\u00a0to see how his\u00a0atrial septal defect (ASD) is doing. \u00a0(Side note:\u00a0an ASD is a small hole in the heart that is common in children born with Down Syndrome.) \u00a0 We are praying that it will be\u00a0completely\u00a0closed when we visit the cardiologist, and no heart\u00a0surgery\u00a0required. \u00a0We also will be seeing an urologist in the next few months about another  small  issue. \u00a0I\u2019d\u00a0appreciate\u00a0your prayers that all goes well on that visit as well. A Huge Thank You! My wife and I are both\u00a0overwhelmed\u00a0with the response we have had to this website. \u00a0We have\u00a0received\u00a0many messages in the short time this site has been up, and have been\u00a0encouraged by them all. \u00a0One that was especially\u00a0meaningfully was\u00a0from a mom\u00a0with a\u00a0pre-born\u00a0baby that had been diagnosed with Down Syndrome. She wrote in to tell me that she was  very\u00a0encouraged  by the daily Noah\u2019s Minute videos, and\u00a0that her and her other small child watched them\u00a0together\u00a0every day. Wow\u2026.that alone makes it worth the time it takes to put up a video every day. \u00a0In fact, one of the reasons I started this site was to  encourage\u00a0new parents  by giving them an inside look at family raising a child born with Down Syndrome.

{"date": ",April,16,2012", "body": "Creeping vs. crawling\u2026what\u2019s the difference? A few days ago Noah started getting into  quadruped  on his own. It wasn\u2019t a  milestone  post, but it was a huge one in our book. Why so big? Well it shows that Noah has the strength to possibly start crawling. As I was researching for this post, I learned an important thing. \u00a0In the world of  physical therapy   crawling  is actually defined as  moving forward with belly on the floor pulling with arms and pushing with legs \u2026who knew.  Creeping  is defined as  moving on hands and knees with stomach up, in quadruped . Thanks again  Patricia Winders  for teaching me more about development than my entire pediatric residency. \ud83d\ude42 Moving Forward With The Inchworm Noah has been mobile for quite a while. (He even turned his crib into a l earning-to-crawl exercise machine .) He gets places by scooting on his back, or his\u00a0preferred\u00a0way which is rolling until he hits something. I have found him under couches, across the room, and of course finding the most dangerous things in the room like outlets. Today he found a way to keep his eye on the prize and  move forward.  We call it  the inchworm . He gets into quadruped, falls forward and is up again. Per Patricia Winders this would be a type of crawling. I am surprised how fast he can do this, it is actually a pretty good way of moving. It also blows my mind how one day Noah is just able to do something. We had no idea this milestone was coming. The video is moments after he did this for the first time, and as you can see, he isn\u2019t just taking one inchworm, he is going across the whole floor. In my opinion it is pretty impressive. 4 Types of Early Crawling Methods Patricia Winders book,\u00a0 Gross Motors Skills in Children with Down Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals , is an\u00a0invaluable\u00a0resource to any parent raising a child born with Down\u00a0syndrome. It\u2019s one of our  top\u00a0resources , and one that I find myself going back to again, and again. In the book she\u00a0states that there are 4 types of early crawling methods which parents need to recognize. Once your child determines  their method  she wants you to encourage that method as much as possible. The four crawling\u00a0methods\u00a0are below, see if any of them describe a method your child seems to be drawn to. \n Reach and roll: reaching with one arm, rolling over that arm, reaching with the other arm, and then rolling to that side \n Pull forward with both elbows at the same time \n Pull forward with one elbow at a time \n Move onto hands and knees and fall forward (Noah\u2019s preferred method) \n Our  physical therapist  is ecstatic that Noah is doing this. Since we know he is strong enough to stay in quadruped, I asked her why he prefers to inchworm, as it seems like it would be easier to just stay up. She believes it is the coordination of muscles to alternate sides and maintaining core strength during that transition. Shocker that it all goes back to the  core  \ud83d\ude42 Proud Parents Noah is pretty proud of himself. His face lights up when he starts moving and gets to the object he is looking at, which most of the time is either Rick or I. We are super  proud  of him too. (By the way, \u00a0we mentioned the Fisher Price Snail in our top ten  gift ideas  post, if you don\u2019t already have it, you should. It really is one of the best\u00a0 developmental\u00a0motivators \u00a0around!) Did your child do any of the alternative crawling methods mentioned in the list above?

{"date": ",June,16,2011", "body": "One of the coolest things about being  new parents  is watching our little Noah\u00a0develop\u00a0his own\u00a0unique\u00a0personality. \u00a0When Noah was just a  few days old  there was no doubt that he was his daddy\u2019s son! \u00a0This kid likes to have fun! \u00a0And he looks really cute in the process. To quote Will Smith in Men In Black, \u201c[He] makes this look good!\u201d When Noah was  born  I thought a lot about what the future would be like. \u00a0I wondered how \u201cdifferent\u201d he would be then a \u201ctypical\u201d child. \u00a0(Spoiler\u00a0alert\u00a0\u2013 not all that different.) \u00a0I wondered if he would laugh. \u00a0If he would play with me. \u00a0If he would like toys. \u00a0(The answer is yes to all of these questions, by the way.) \u00a0My only knowledge about people born with  Down Syndrome  came from  tv , and Corky on the 80\u2019s\u00a0television\u00a0show  Life Goes On . \u00a0However, it had been a long time since I had seen that show, and  Netflix  doesn\u2019t have it\u00a0available on their instant watch library. \u00a0(Side-note: If I had known about Noah in the 80\u2019s I\u00a0certainly\u00a0would have paid much closer attention to that show. \u00a0Oh well. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess.) A few days after Noah was born we were introduced to some  friends  in Houston who have a three year old, Seth, who was born with Down Syndrome. \u00a0We quickly began to  Facebook  stalk them, and watched every video they posted of their son. \u00a0Seth became my 2011 version of Life Goes On. \u00a0Those videos helped me to understand what Noah\u2019s future could be like. \u00a0I quickly\u00a0realized\u00a0that all of my fears about the future were sort of like that monster under my bed when I was six. \u00a0It terrified me until I tuned the light on one day and realized \u201cthe monster\u201d was actually no monster at all. \u00a0 The \u201cmonster\u201d wasn\u2019t a big deal after all. Those videos were like turning the light on, they helped me to see that  Down Syndrome is no big deal  either. What are some of your \u201cmonster\u2019s under the bed?\u201d Is there anything that at first scared you, but now don\u2019t really bother you? \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096635/", "http://netflix.com", "http://facebook.com/noahsdadcom/"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/mouth-sounds/", "title": "Noah\u2019s favorite new mouth sounds!"},
{"date": ",February,2,2012", "body": "Yesterday we picked up the keys to our  new house , and today was the big move. \u00a0Actually it was more like  one  of the big moves. \u00a0Let me explain\u2026. The Never-Ending Move We\u2019ve lived in a two bedroom apartment for the last 3 and a half years while my wife completed her medical residency, and I worked on my  Masters degree . \u00a0The space worked out great for us; we used one room as an office, and the other as a bedroom. \u00a0We didn\u2019t have any children for most of that time, we really liked the location, and we didn\u2019t have to worry about mowing the lawn, and fixing a leaky faucet (maintenance men are awesome!) so it worked out great. When I called the moving company they said it would be a  quick and easy  move since all that\u2019s  typically  required for an apartment our size was one moving truck and a two man moving crew. Keyword:  typically . \u00a0This move was far from  quick and easy . \u00a0I honestly have no idea where in the world we kept all of the stuff we have. \u00a0I have to chalk it up to my wife\u2019s superpower of organization. \u00a0(If the whole being-a-Doctor thing doesn\u2019t work out for her, I think she could easily have a career in closet storage planning!) Talk about maximizing space..you should have seen these guys were pulling boxes out of everywhere\u2026it was like watching a 12 hour magic trick! \u00a0(Seriously, 12 hours!) It turns out that one truck  wasn\u2019t enough . \u00a0I was mesmerized as I watched them  fill up  a huge moving truck with the contents of our 2 bedroom apartment to the point that they could barely close the door! \u00a0The movers kept asking me (as I also asked myself): \u201cWhere in the world did you guys keep all of this stuff!\u201d Like I said before, I honestly have no idea where we kept it are (or that we had that much stuff!) \u00a0We even donated a ton of stuff before the move just to get rid of some stuff\u2026.looks like we still have a lot more to give away. \u00a0(Anyone interested in 55 boxes of baseball cards?) \ud83d\ude42 You\u2019re probably thinking our apartment must have looked like one of those homes you see on  Hoarders \u2026.but I promise it didn\u2019t. \u00a0We just played a lot of  Tetris  in our life, and used every space imaginable (do you see the box under the couch!) Needless to say I was bummed that even after hiring movers, we still had (and have) a lot left to move. \u00a0This is seriously going to be the never-ending move. \ud83d\ude42 A Midnight Traffic Jam\u2026..Really? After spending over 12 hours helping the movers at our apartment with my brother while my mom, Abbie, and Noah (he supervised) worked on painting our new house, we get stuck in a horrible Dallas traffic jam on the way to our new house. \u00a0It was past midnight. \u00a0We were exhausted. \u00a0I missed Noah\u2019s adorable little  laugh . \u00a0And my mom and brother (who needed to get back home) still had a two hour drive ahead of them! \u00a0Today was not a  fun  day. \u00a0Oh\u2026I have to say this one more time: I hate moving. \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 Bad Days Happen. \u00a0You Have A Choice. In life days like this happen. \u00a0Days where you hit a midnight traffic jam. \u00a0Days (sometimes weeks) that are  scary . \u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0inevitable. \u00a0It\u2019s unavoidable. \u00a0There\u2019s nothing you can do about it. \u00a0The only thing you  can do  about it is choose how you  respond  to them,\u00a0and remember that days like this are the exception, not the norm. \u00a0They pass just as quickly as they came. Don\u2019t sweat it. \u00a0This isn\u2019t an easy lesson to learn for any of us. \u00a0Some days I feel like I do great at this, other days not so much. \u00a0But the point is to remember that tough days aren\u2019t forever. \u00a0They really aren\u2019t. So how did I choose to respond to this never-ending move day? \u00a0Well, I bought the movers, my brother, and I some and I some good ol\u2019 unhealthy, open-at-midnight McDonalds (Sidenote: I\u2019m not sure what McDonalds does to their Coke to make it taste so magical, but their cokes are amazing!), turned up the radio, rolled down the windows, and thought about the epic bubble bath I was going to take once I finally made it home! So in summary: don\u2019t worry I\u2019m Proud To Admit, I\u2019m A Bath Guy For those of you who have made it this far, I want to share two things with you as sort of a \u201cget to know Noah\u2019s dad\u201d exclusive. \n Our new house has a awesome bath tub! \n I am\u00a0 bath guy. \n Yelp, that\u2019s right, a bath guy\u2026and not just on those stressful days\u00a0when you  need  a bath to relax (like \u00a0a never-ending moving day). \u00a0Not by a long shot; I take a bath almost every day (sometimes 2!) \u00a0And not one of these lame kinds of baths\u2026no, I go full on with bubbles and everything. I read in bath, eat my breakfast in bath, use my  iPad  in the bath, play a few  classics on my gameboy\u2026. and if we\u2019re  friends  in real life there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ve talked to you on the phone, and maybe even  FaceTime\u2019d  (don\u2019t worry, the bubbles keep it PG) with you while in the bath! \u00a0Yelp. \u00a0That\u2019s right! \u00a0There\u2019s no shame in my bath game. As you can see, I\u2019m a huge fan of the bath! \u00a0(Heck, I\u2019ve even wrote an entire post explaining how baths help me  win as a parent !) It\u2019s true, baths are one of the best parts of my day\u2026.and I\u2019m not afraid to admit it. If you\u2019re a dad reading this I know what you\u2019re thinking; \u201cBaths are for girls!\u201d \u00a0It\u2019s ok. \u00a0No offense taken. \u00a0I\u2019ve been taking baths my whole life; you wouldn\u2019t be the first (or the 1,000th) person to make fun of me for being a bath guy, and I\u2019m very confidant in my bath taking! But\u2026.I would urge you to try one sometime. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0Grab yourself some high quality bubble bath (I personaly suggest  Mr. Bubble Extra Gentle Bubble Bath , or if you really want to step up your bubble bath taking game , do yourself a favor and pick up something from the from the Disney World of  bath stores . \u00a0Yes, I\u2019m 100% sure I\u2019m a man..but like I said, I\u2019m secure in my bath-taking-ness!), get a good book (or a bowl of cereal) and have yourself a nice bath. Quick tip: If you\u2019re a rookie bath taker I wouldn\u2019t suggest using your iPhone / iPad / Gameboy in the bath quite yet. Don\u2019t forget, I have years of bath taking experience\u00a0under my belt, and I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve mastered the art of using electronics while taking a bath. \u00a0There\u2019s seriously an art behind it. \u00a0Feel free to  contact  me if you\u2019d like some tips. (Just know in advance that if you really do email me asking for bath tips, I will probably blog about it since that would be hilarious\u2026and a little weird.)\u201d One quick warning about baths before you dive in (pun intended): It\u2019s easy to become a bath addict. \u00a0You may find yourself having to set your alarm clock an hour earlier, leave work early, stay up a little later than normal, skipping your kids birthday, soccer games, graduation, etc\u2026.just to make time for your bath. You\u2019ve been warned. Wow\u2026today\u2019s blog post is really out of control. Sorry. I haven\u2019t had much  sleep  lately. \ud83d\ude42 Do you have any fun, wacky, horrible moving stories? \u00a0What about traffic stories? Ever missed something really important because of a traffic jam? \u00a0And finally, dare I ask, any bath stories? \u00a0(I\u2019m curious if there are any other proud male bath takers out there who aren\u2019t afraid to admit their love of a good bath. Ladies, do any of you have a bath-taking husband? \u00a0Surely I can\u2019t be the only one! \u00a0Please share in the comments below!

Hello Mr. First Tooth, nice to meet you. Like today for\u00a0instance. There I am just playing and  laughing  with my son like I usually do when I see him do his usual super-cute-mouth-wide-open-baby-laugh. Only this time when he smiled, and his little 10 month old mouth opened as wide (and as adorable) as it usually does,\u00a0I saw a teeny tiny little baby tooth making its way through his gum line.\u00a0 In other words,  I saw his first tooth\u2026.! I know people often wonder where their baby with Down syndrome will get their first tooth, and while I can\u2019t answer for everyone, I can say that our child with Down syndrome got his first tooth at 10 months old.

I have so much fun hanging out with him, and I could seriously spend all day watching (and trying to capture) all of his adorable expressions.

We\u2019re the ones that\u00a0evoke that adorable  laughter  of his. We\u2019re that ones that cause his eyes to open as wide as they can. We\u2019re his  superheros . It\u2019s not an iPad, a new toy, or all the money in the world that makes our little boy light up. Nope, what he longs for is the  free gifts  of love, time, and attention that only a parent can provide.\u00a0I love the fact that I have that sort of effect on my little boy. What a great honor it is to be his daddy. Parenting is hard work, but it\u2019s without a doubt the  best job  in the world, and boy is the pay great.

{"date": ",February,10,2012", "body": "One of my biggest fears when I first learned that Noah was  born with Down syndrome  was that I wouldn\u2019t get to do all of the fun things dads got to do with their sons. Did children with  Down syndrome  still like to play? Did they like  toys ? Did they laugh, smile, and have fun? Would Noah want to play on my  iPad  one day? Would he even be able to use an iPad? I had no idea what to expect. As a dad, it was one of the  scariest  moments of my life. (Spoiler alert: it was a very short moment!) Down Syndrome Is More Than A Character On T.V. My only knowledge about what it was like for someone to live with Down syndrome came from Corky on  Life Goes On , and Becky on  Glee . Apart from that I was left with an imagination full of  false assumptions  about what it was going to be like raising a child with Down syndrome. I guess you could say I wondered if Noah having Down syndrome meant I was going to miss out on some of the best things about being a dad. If you are a  new parent  reading this I\u2019ll get straight to the point; boy was I ever wrong! \u00a0This kid loves to play! In fact I have a hard time getting anything done because of how much fun this little boy is! \u00a0His personality, his smile, his  laugh , the way he likes to roll around on the floor to get my attention; it\u2019s wonderful! I can\u2019t get enough of him! By the way I purposely used past tense verbs on the title of today\u2019s post,\u00a0 everything I knew about Down syndrome I learned\u00a0from watching tv, \u00a0for a reason\u2026.because it\u2019s past tense. I  now  have more experience with Down syndrome than what I learned by watching Glee and Life Goes On (I think those shows are helpful by the way in that they help the world get an inside look at the life of a teenager living with Down syndrome.) So as you read our blog and hear story after story about how great Noah makes our life, please know I speak from experience. \u00a0Not only that, I\u2019m also hoping to give the world an inside look at what life is like for a family raising a child born with Down syndrome. My hope is you\u2019ll see our family is much more  normal  then un-normal. (By the way, I\u2019m still trying to figure out what the world normal means as it relates to a family\u2026.I think every family has a little weird in them\u2026.and that\u2019s ok!) Hindsight\u2019s 20/20 It\u2019s been over a year since we brought Noah home from the hospital; I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to stress out. Not to worry. That I wouldn\u2019t miss out on anything. That I\u2019d be able to do all the things that any dad would hope to do with their son! (Actually a little more considering how often we get to go to  physical therapy !) I wouldn\u2019t change one little chromosome on this boy. As you can in today\u2019s video we\u2019re in the process of moving into our  new house , which means we have a lot of work to do. Tonight I had planned on getting my office unpacked while mom was at work\u2026.But Noah had other plans. I\u2019m pretty sure he was thinking, \u201cLet\u2019s play! \u00a0Let\u2019s play! \u00a0Look at me roll! \u00a0Look at me play with this box! Look at me play with the dog! Let\u2019s play! Let\u2019s play!\u201d And so we did. To parents of children born with Down syndrome, what where were some of the misconceptions you had when you first started on this journey? \u00a0To everyone else; what are some of your assumptions about people with Down syndrome? Don\u2019t worry, you can be honest. I knew almost nothing about Down syndrome when Noah was born, and I\u2019m thankful there were people in my life who were gracious enough to help me learn (and didn\u2019t make me feel like a jerk when I said something inaccurate, and possibly even hurtful.) \u00a0One this I hope this website does is help people become more aware about Down syndrome, and what life is like for families raising children with Down syndrome. Every child is unique, but hopefully between our daily one minute videos, the interaction from people in the comments, and hanging out on our  Facebook page , we (and by we I mean the thousands of families who are on this same journey) can help the world do away with the inaccurate stereotypes, and move forward with a more clear and accurate picture of what raising a child with Down syndrome is like. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Goes_On_(TV_series)", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(TV_series)", "http://facebook.com/noahsdadcom"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/down-syndrome-watching-tv/", "title": "Everything I Knew About Down Syndrome I Learned From Watching TV"},
{"date": ",May,23,2012", "body": "It\u2019s amazing how the entire course and direction of your life can change in an instant. A year ago I didn\u2019t even know what a Buddy Walk was; much less think I\u2019d ever be participating in one as a parent of child with  Down syndrome . But here we were at our first ever Buddy Walk and we had a blast! What Is The Buddy Walk? The Buddy Walk was created to celebrate  National Down Syndrome Awareness Month  (I had no clue there even was a  Down Syndrome awareness month)  and to \u201cpromote acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome.\u201d In addition The Buddy Walk is also one of the largest fund raisers for the various local and national Down syndrome organizations. The way it works is you create a \u201cteam\u201d and then set a financial goal for your team. This was our first Buddy Walk and we were a little late to the game, but  we  still managed to meet 143% of our financial goal! I say we, but I really mean all the awesome people on \u201cTeam Noah\u2019s Crew!\u201d We were humbled by the number of people who gave financial gifts, many of whom we had only meet through this website and our  Facebook page . How cool is that? A few thoughts about our first Buddy Walk experience\u2026 Since this was my First Buddy Walk I didn\u2019t really know what to expect. Actually, let me rephrase that. Since this was my first Buddy Walk, I didn\u2019t really know how I was going to  feel . I knew there were going to be thousands of people (of various ages) with Down syndrome there, and up until this point most of the people we have meet with Down syndrome have been young children. So I wondered how I was going to feel being around so many adults and teenagers with Down syndrome. Let me explain. Before I do, I hope you don\u2019t mind me being a little transparent here, and if I say something out of line or offensive, I apologize in advance. In no way do I mean any disrespect by anything I\u2019m about to type. So I hope it doesn\u2019t come across that way, and if it does I\u2019d like to ask you to extend me some grace. Also, I think much of what I\u2019m about to say relates to any parents thoughts about their child regardless if they have Down syndrome or not. So I\u2019m not 100% sure if the feelings I have come from being a parent of a child with Down syndrome, or simply from being a parent. (I think probably a little bit of both.) \ud83d\ude42 Strange emotions Before the Buddy Walk I wondered how I would feel seeing so many adults with Down syndrome. I had meet a few  older  people with Down syndrome in the last 10 months or so, and after meeting them I always walk away with a strange mixture of emotions. When I met someone much older than Noah, I felt like I was looking at a window into the future of my son\u2019s life. I would pay close attention to every detail of our interaction in order to gain an idea about what the future might be for our son. Did he get my joke? What does he like to do for fun? Does he work? Does he talk? If so, could I understand him easily? Does he walk well? Etc.. Sometimes these interactions made me feel sort of  sad , other times they deeply encouraged me. In the back of my mind I would try to envision what it would be like if Noah was like the person I had just met. I\u2019ve meet a wide variety of people with Down syndrome and I\u2019d often ask myself questions like; How would I feel if he couldn\u2019t talk? And if he did talk, what if only a few people could understand him? How would I feel if he walked with a limp and struggled to keep up? On the other hand how would I feel if he fell in love, and got married? How would I feel If he had a great job that he enjoyed? How would I feel if he changed the world? Of course, like any parent, I think my child is the smartest, cutest, most gifted, most awesome kid in the whole wide world. So anytime I met someone older with Down syndrome who wasn\u2019t as  efficient  in (fill in the blank) as society tells us they should be at that age, in the back of my mind I\u2019d think about how much better Noah\u2019s going to be at (fill in the blank) when he becomes that person\u2019s age. Silly, huh? I should know better. \ud83d\ude42 Learning to get rid of the \u201cI\u201d You\u2019ll notice that almost every statement I wrote above contains the word \u201c I .\u201dHow selfish of me. It\u2019s not about what  I  (think)  I  want. What  I  think Noah wants. What  I  think those nice people  I  met want (or would prefer) for their life. How arrogant of me to think I know what an  optimum  way of life is for a person. In fact, every person I\u2019ve met with Down syndrome seems very content with who God created them to be. (Although they aren\u2019t all  angles !) \ud83d\ude42 ; I\u2019m a  little  behind on our blog, but almost 7 months have passed since the Buddy walk, and I\u2019ve gotten much better at getting these thoughts out of my mind (quickly) when they start to pop up. I\u2019m learning how much of  myself  needs to grow and develop. It\u2019s been great. \ud83d\ude42 Letting go of the future, and trusting the one that holds it in His hands Having a child with Down syndrome has caused me to radically reevaluate my theology of personhood. I\u2019m learning that I\u2019m not the measuring rod of what an  ideal person  should be like. (In fact, I\u2019m  far  from it.) Most of all I\u2019m learning to trust God more. I\u2019m learning that  He is in charge , not me. I\u2019m learning that He knows best. Not me. And these are great lessons to learn. ; In the Bible there is a guy named Job who has a lot of questions for God, some of which are quite arrogant. After listening to Job speculate all day long God finally responds to Job by asking him a series a questions meant to demonstrate how little Job knows, and how wise God is: \u201cWhere where you when I created the Earth? Who tells the ocean how far to come upon the shore? Can you find your way to where lighting is launched, or to the place from which wind blows? Can you get the attention of the clouds? Do you know how the hawk learned to fly? In other words, \u201cYou don\u2019t know near as much as you think you do Job; so just trust me.\u201d \ud83d\ude42 And so that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do more and more. To be honest I still struggle with my emotions when I think about what the future holds for Noah. But not as much. I think God would much rather us enjoy today instead of letting the fear of what might (or might not) happen in the future rob us of today\u2019s joy. In fact that\u2019s exactly what Jesus says in Mark 6:34: \u201cGive your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don\u2019t get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes.\u201d ; If you struggle with the future, I want you to know that God really does have the whole world in His hands (including your families future.) He cares. He knows best. He\u2019s  REALLY GOOD  at what He does. I\u2019m a worrier, so I know how hard it can be to stop playing the future out in your mind as if you already know what it\u2019s going to be like. You don\u2019t. Only God does. I will tell you that He loves you and your child more than you can ever grasp. So enjoy today. Go hug your child. Play with them. Have some fun. Laugh. Enjoy today, and let God handle the future. It\u2019s not always easy, but your not alone on this journey, I\u2019m right there with you. \ud83d\ude42 ; Have you ever been to a Buddy Walk? If so tell me about it! Also, have you ever struggled with your feelings about the future of your child with Down syndrome? If so how have you worked through that. (P.S. \u2013 there\u2019s no judging here, so feel free to be as honest as you\u2019d like. Your transparent comments will help others who may be struggling with the same thing.)

Don\u2019t get me wrong, Noah\u2019s great. In fact I often thank God for creating our boy with so much joy. If you\u2019ve been following our  story  for very long you\u2019ve no doubt seen  countless pictures  of Noah\u2019s contagious smile. That doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Noah being born with  Down syndrome , it\u2019s just his personality. He\u2019s outgoing. Just like his daddy. But even with all of the cuteness, some days  he just ain\u2019t feeling it.\u00a0 \u00a0Some Days You Just Don\u2019t Feel It Like today for instance. Typically Noah does great when his physical therapist helps him  learn to walk using the treadmill . In fact he even does it with a smile (and I\u2019m sure even a hug if he wasn\u2019t strapped into his awesome treadmill outfit!) But as you can see in todays video and pictures,  he just wasn\u2019t feeling it today. In this video Noah\u2019s just a little over 10 months old, and you can easily see he\u2019s knows what it means to be stubborn. Normally when Noah gets on the treadmill he puts one foot in front of the other and crushes it, but not today. Today he decided to relax his legs and do nothing. No matter how loud we cheered, or how many funny faces we made,  Noah just wasn\u2019t feeling it today. And it\u2019s ok. Some Days You Just Don\u2019t Feel It. And It\u2019s Ok. As parents we need to let our children know it\u2019s ok to  just not feel it  some days. That it\u2019s ok to have  off days;  us\u00a0adults certainly have plenty of them. As Noah grows up I want him to know that it\u2019s ok to have days like this, heck, if he were a little older I\u2019d probably just skipped physical therapy all together today and opted for a daddy-son movie date instead!  Winning! There\u2019s a fine line here, because I also want Noah to learn the importance of being responsible and doing the things that are asked of him;  especially by trusted adults  who have authority over him (teachers, therapists, coaches, youth pastors, family members, etc.) As he gets older we\u2019ll continue to help him understand what that means and how to  off days  without being  disrespectful . Off Days. Grace Days. And More Trips To Physical Therapy Today we\u2019ll drive through the rain and traffic to take Noah to two therapy appointments. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll work hard and crush it (as he usually does.) But if he does decide to have another off day today, we may just shut it down early and go see a good movie instead. \ud83d\ude42 Grace.

{"date": ",April,18,2012", "body": "A few months ago I wrote about why I hoped\u00a0 every child with Down syndrome could have a friend like Charlie , well today I want to tell you\u00a0why I hope\u00a0every person on the planet has friends like  Charlie\u2019s parents.\u201d\u00a0 I could tell you a million great things about them, but let\u2019s be honest; since most of you reading this are parents, and parents are always looking for good (or free) deals, let me share a few important lessons I\u2019ve learned from Charlie\u2019s parents. 3 Life Changing Lessons I Learned From Charlie\u2019s Parents 1. Dressing up in tin foil can sometimes get you free food at  Chipotle . (I wish I could find the picture\u2026.) 2. Smart people buy all the diapers they can fit in their car on tax free weekend. (And if they are really smart they combine tax free weekend\u00a0with Babies R Us coupons for an even greater  parent win !) 3. \u00a0You can have a birthday party for your 3 year old at  The Home Depot \u2026.. for free! \u00a0(I\u2019m not kidding\u2026keep reading.) It turns out Home Depot does\u00a0 Kids Workshops \u00a0in their stores on Saturday mornings and parents can bring in\u00a0their\u00a0kids and do fun projects\u00a0together. Which is another thing I learned from Charlie\u2019s dad. I had no idea Home Depot (and  Lowes )\u00a0did this. And basically all they did was ask the store manager if they could invite 20 or so other families to come to a kids\u00a0workshop with them\u2026.on their son\u2019s birthday. And of course they said yes. In fact Home Depot knocked it out of the park for them. They sectioned off a little area for them, gave them tons of supplies, fun\u00a0aprons, and made it a great time for all the\u00a0children\u00a0and their families.\u00a0It was one of the best kids birthday parties I\u2019ve ever been to. Pretty cool, huh? I\u2019m hope I don\u2019t upset Home Depot my talking about all of this, since hosting\u00a0children\u2019s\u00a0birthday parties probably isn\u2019t a business they want to get into. Oh and a little disclaimer for any of you \u00a0attempting\u00a0to try this out at your local Home depot;  your results may vary . Not everyone has the swagger and charm of my\u00a0friend\u00a0 John . So don\u2019t feel\u00a0disappointed\u00a0if the manager looks at your like you\u2019re crazy. \ud83d\ude42 More birthday fun After Home Depot we went to Charlie\u2019s house for some more birthday fun, and to feast on some yummy birthday cake. (By the way, the little girl that you see Noah playing with in today\u2019s video is Charlie\u2019s little sister, who also had a super fun\u00a0 birthday\u00a0party !) Since Noah\u2019s first birthday is coming up soon I was making mental notes of what all goes into throwing a little kid\u2019s birthday party. And I\u2019ve got to say Charlie\u2019s parents did a great job! I especially liked the super cute construction hat, and the tool box full of goodies all the children\u00a0received. One of\u00a0the treats in the box were some baby cookies just for Noah, which he munched on when he got home. In fact, they were actually Noah\u2019s very first cookie! \u00a0 Some more father and son Saturday fun My wife had to work at night, so Noah and I got to have some  fun  at home\u00a0together. I usually pick out the book we\u2019re going to read for his  bedtime story , but tonight he wanted to take full advantage of his\u00a0newly\u00a0acquired skill of\u00a0 inch-worming , and pick his own book out. It was fun (and super cute) watching him roll around (and try to crawl around) the floor playing with different books. I love this little boy so much. I\u2019m so thankful for the all the great friends and family we have that get to be a part of Noah\u2019s life. Life isn\u2019t meant to be lived on an island. I hope that you\u2019re surrounded by a group of positive, loving people that walk through life with you. People make life 100 times more epic. \ud83d\ude42 I have a few questions for you: 1. Did you know about all of this awesome fun kid stuff Home Depot had going on? Have you ever been? 2. What\u2019s the most random / unique /\u00a0strange\u00a0place you\u2019ve ever had (or been to) a birthday party? Leave a comment below and tell us about it.

{"date": ",June,11,2011", "body": "After last week it was clear that our little guy is a  swimmer ! Dallas Theology Seminary  (where I\u2019m currently finishing up my Masters of Theology Degree) gives\u00a0students\u00a0and their families a crazy good deal on a membership to  Baylor Tom Landry Fitness Center . \u00a0Tom Landry Fitness Center also has nice, big,  heated  pools; \u00a0so we decided to take advantage of our\u00a0membership\u00a0today and take Noah for a swim! We had a blast today! \u00a0This kid seriously gets cuter every single day. \u00a0I can\u2019t believe I helped produce a child this\u00a0awesome! I\u2019ve said this a million times, but being Noah\u2019s dad is amazing. \u00a0I love every bit of it, even the countless\u00a0 occupational ,  physical , and  speech\u00a0therapy  appointments! \u00a0I seriously count it all \u00a0joy! \u00a0It\u2019s so much fun watching his unique\u00a0personality\u00a0develop. \u00a0I love when he catches a glimpse of his mother or I, his little face\u00a0lights\u00a0up with this\u00a0radiant\u00a0smile, it\u2019s huge! Every time I see him do it I\u2019m reminded of \u00a0a cartoon character. \u00a0I\u2019m not really sure why \u2013 he\u2019s just \u201cfun\u201d to look at I guess. \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I did however get a little sad when we were leaving though. \u00a0My wife and I were\u00a0talking about his six month check up coming up this week this week. \u00a0At the six month check up the Doctors order a Complete Blood Count (CBC) on our little guy. Children born with  Down Syndrome  are at a higher risk for leukemia then \u201ctypical\u201d children, and the CBC will let us know how is blood count is, and if Noah has leukemia. \u00a0I have known this test was coming since  Noah was born , and I\u2019ve been praying about it often, but I still don\u2019t like thinking\u00a0about it. \u00a0I know that no matter what the results of the CBC is, God is in\u00a0control, but it still scares me. \u00a0A lot. \u00a0But I also trust God. \u00a0A lot. \u00a0I\u2019d like to ask you to pray for Noah this week, and that his CBC would come back clear. \u00a0Either way, God knows what He is doing, and we trust Him fully with our sweet, little son, but I still am begging God like crazy for this test to come back negative. \u00a0Thanks in advance for your\u00a0prayers. This journey we\u2019ve been on the last six months with our son has been awesome. \u00a0My wife and I often wouldn\u2019t change  one thing  about our son. \u00a0Seriously, not one thing. \u00a0God created this little boy. \u00a0He knew all about his extra little chromosome way before we did. \u00a0And he created Abbie, and I to be the perfect parents for this little guy. \u00a0Our life, and our story is so much better because of Noah in it. \u00a0Our\u00a0prayer\u00a0is that our family, and Noah\u2019s story, would make much of our Great God. No matter what comes tomorrow, or 100 tomorrows from now \u2013 God is in control. He runs the show. \u00a0He calls the shots, and we consider\u00a0ourselves\u00a0extremely blessed that God\u00a0considered\u00a0us faithful enough to tell a story like Noah. \u00a0It\u2019s humbling. \u00a0Thank you for loving our family, and our son. \u00a0It means more then you know. -Rick (You can stay connected with us by visiting our  subscribe  page!)

The bumbo seat is a double win! Noah\u2019s\u00a0occupational\u00a0and\u00a0 physical\u00a0therapist \u00a0both suggested we try out the bumbo seat since not only does it help him  learn to sit , it also helps him develop the\u00a0 core \u00a0strength needed to sit\u00a0independently. So it\u2019s a double win! It\u2019s amazing to see how far he has come. When Noah first tried to sit in the bumbo chair (at four months old) he was wobbly and shaky. In fact, we could only leave him in it for a few minutes before he tried out, now he can sit in it for 20 minutes with no problem. I\u2019m so  proud  of this little boy!

Noah turns six months old on the 15th of this month, (wow, that\u2019s hard to believe!) and per his doctor\u2019s orders, we took him to  Children\u2019s Medical Center  to have his CBC tests preformed today. \u00a0(By the way, we are\u00a0regulars\u00a0to the blood lab at  Childrens \u2018 \u2013 if your child ever needs to get blood drawn and you live near Dallas \u2013 this is the place to go! \u00a0They do  great  work!) \u00a0I must admit I didn\u2019t say much on the way to hospital. \u00a0The thought of our son having leukemia scares me. \u00a0A lot. One thing I didn\u2019t know until Noah was born was that children  born with Down Syndrome  respond really well (much better then  \u201ctypical kids\u201d) to cancer treatment. \u00a0In fact, there have even been cases of the cancer curing itself! \u00a0Some scientists speculate that it has something to do with the fact that they have an extra copy of their 21st\u00a0chromosome! \u00a0Pretty cool! Regardless\u00a0of that awesomeness above, I hope you won\u2019t mind my being honest when I say I  really  don\u2019t want Noah to have leukemia. \u00a0I know there are lots of families out there\u00a0journeying\u00a0through the\u00a0realties\u00a0of cancer, and I don\u2019t believe there is anything about our family that makes us exempt from that\u00a0reality. \u00a0If the\u00a0results\u00a0come back, and Noah has\u00a0leukemia\u00a0we\u2019ll put it in God\u2019s hands just like we have done with everything else. \u00a0It\u2019ll be scary, it\u2019ll require faith, but it won\u2019t be the end of the world \u2013 by any means. \u00a0God is still God. \u00a0I\u2019m just letting you know ahead of time that that isn\u2019t the option I\u00a0prefer. \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 It\u2019s mind-blowing to think that in the next 24-48 hours (when we get the results of the CBC back) that there is a chance our little Noah could have cancer. (Actually, when you think about it, we\u2019re actually all only one test away from news like that\u2026. Down Syndrome , or no Down Syndrome. \u00a0We think we have \u201ccontrol\u201d of our own life. \u00a0Control is an\u00a0illusion.) No matter what the results are, we have trusted God since before Noah came into this world, and we\u2019ll keep on trusting Him no matter what we face. \u00a0We\u2019ve found that God does a really good job of being God. \u00a0I\u2019ve said this a thousand times, but \u201cour\u201d children aren\u2019t ours. \u00a0They are on loan from God. \u00a0They belong to Him. \u00a0We are their parents. \u00a0The sooner a person gets that, the better they are. \u00a0(I\u2019m stilling trying to  get  that, by the way.)

{"date": ",April,6,2012", "body": "When you start to think about the muscles it takes to do everyday tasks it will start to blow your mind. When you have a child with  hypotonia , you realize this every day. Simple things we do every day, like sitting, requires  core  and back strength, along with balance and coordination of muscles.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard work! Physical\u00a0Therapy\u00a0Helps Our Son Break Bad Habits One of the  goals  of our therapy sessions is not to just reach milestones, but to avoid bad habits that can form due to hypotonia. There are a lot of bad habits that can happen with sitting, but when Noah  sits  nice and straight with his legs not in the splits, I see the payoff of all his hard work. Like I mentioned in the  peek-a-boo  post, the play of childhood helped us develop a lot of our muscles. I may not have realized what the  swing  set was doing for me when I spent countless hours playing on it as a child, but now I see it as a powerful  developmental tool  that help children learn to grow and develop.. Who knew. Noah\u2019s First Slide Today our son got to go on a slide for the first time. Woo hoo! It was awesome, although It wasn\u2019t how I envisioned my child would go down a slide for the first time.\u00a0We weren\u2019t: outside\u2026. or in a park\u2026. or having playtime\u2026 We were at therapy;\u00a0using the slide as a  exercise machine to take his core workout to the next level!  Who would have ever thought? This journey is full of wonderful surprises. \ud83d\ude42 The reason Noah\u2019s\u00a0therapists\u00a0use the slide is\u00a0because\u00a0when going down a slide you have to hold yourself up against gravity. Not only that, but they stop him halfway down to help him engage those ab muscles, which in turn help him learn to sit up\u00a0independently, and stay there. As usual,  Noah\u2019s abs  continue to be stronger than mine. He rocked the slide, and I think that he probably had a little fun on his way down.

{"date": ",May,10,2012", "body": "Today we had a blast hanging out at Noah\u2019s friend\u00a0 Miss T\u2019s  first birthday party. We met Miss T\u2019s parents through the  Down Syndrome Guild of Dallas  and have become\u00a0good friends with them over the last year. Their little girl was also born with  Down syndrome \u00a0and a month younger\u00a0than Noah, so it\u2019s a lot of fun watching them play\u00a0together. By the way, don\u2019t you just love Noah\u2019s cute little\u00a0Hawaiian\u00a0shirt? This was a\u00a0Hawaiian\u00a0themed\u00a0birthday\u00a0party, so he had to rock one! \ud83d\ude42 One\u00a0awesome\u00a0thing about having children is all of the birthday parties you can attend now (without looking like a creeper.) Birthday parties = cake. And cake = good. That\u2019s what I call a\u00a0parenting\u00a0win! We\u2019ve\u00a0actually\u00a0gotten to know  lots  of great families through the guild, many of which whose children are around the same age of Noah. I like that our son (and all of these other children) has the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to build such a strong group of\u00a0friends (who also have Down Syndrome)\u00a0at such an early age. Don\u2019t get me wrong; Noah also has lots of\u00a0 typical \u00a0friends , but as they get older none of them will be able to\u00a0 really , 100%, be able to relate to him, at least not the way that other children born with Down syndrome can. My hope for our son is that he has a\u00a0 wide\u00a0variety \u00a0of friends in his life who love and\u00a0support\u00a0him, both with Down syndrome, and without. Grandparents have feelings too. This weekend is sort of like  Down syndrome shock\u00a0 therapy \u00a0for my  wife\u2019s parents  who are in town visiting from Colorado. They (like me) had\u00a0 limited\u00a0interaction \u00a0with people born with Down syndrome prior to Noah being born. (My wife is a\u00a0pediatrician so her experience is greater than all of ours\u00a0combined.) But all that was about to change. Today they would meet a\u00a0house full\u00a0of children with Down syndrome, and\u00a0tomorrow\u00a0they would meet  thousands  at the 2011 Buddy Walk (More on that in our next post.) As  new parents  of a child born with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0it\u2019s easy to get\u00a0wrapped\u00a0up in how  we  feel,\u00a0but we have to remember that  grandparents  are going through a lot as well. In fact, I recently had a conversation with a\u00a0social\u00a0worker who reminded me that grandparents are dealing with a  double dose  of worry when a child is born with Down syndrome. Not only do they worry about  their new grandchild , they worry about\u00a0 their\u00a0child  as well. It\u2019s important for us parents to be aware of this as we move forward on our new journey Grandparents make the journey better! I\u2019m gotta say when it comes to grandparents, Noah hit the jackpot! Both my mom (my father isn\u2019t\u00a0alive) and my wife\u2019s parents knocked it out of the park when Noah was born. I mean seriously, when we\u00a0received\u00a0Noah\u2019s  down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis \u00a0they didn\u2019t miss a beat. From the  second  Noah was  born  they\u2019ve been right by our side, encouraging and supporting us every step of the way. They have read up, studied up, asked questions,  Facetime\u2019d , Skype\u2019d, called,\u00a0visited, and have done everything they can to learn about Down syndrome, support our family, and be a part of Noah\u2019s life. I love it! This little boy\u2019s grandparents\u00a0truly\u00a0spoil him, and not just with stuff. Sure, they like to buy him fun clothes and toys, but better than that they spoil him with their love. And I love that. I couldn\u2019t be more  proud  of Noah\u2019s grandparents. What if MY child\u2019s grandparent\u2019s aren\u2019t supportive? Sadly, I know that not everyone has had the same experience with their child\u2019s grandparents as we have. Some of you have been\u00a0deeply\u00a0hurt by how your parents (your child\u2019s grandparents) have responded to your child\u2019s Down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis, and reading about other people\u2019s\u00a0supportive grandparents\u00a0just adds salt to your wounds. If your child\u2019s\u00a0grandparents\u00a0are having a difficult time accepting and supporting your new child with Down syndrome, I\u2019d want to remind of you a few things that I hope will encourage you. First, I want you to know that I am\u00a0truly\u00a0sorry for what you are going through, and how this is making you feel. Second, I want you to know that  it\u2019s  not your fault . You have done nothing wrong. You are  not\u00a0responsible \u00a0for their actions.\u00a0The painful actions of a family member have the ability to hurt us deeply. But I want you to  have hope . People can  change.  Wounds can be  minded.  Hearts can be  healed. I\u2019d encourage you to  pray for them often , shower them with grace, and remember that  you  can\u2019t change anyone. But you can choose not to let  their actions  steal  your joy . I know it\u2019s difficult, but God is able to break through the hardest of hearts. Just keep being an awesome parent yourself, and let your  actions  speak louder than your  words . And remember,  you aren\u2019t on this journey alone!  Not only are we here to support and encourage you any way we can, but there are thousands of\u00a0other\u00a0families on our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page just waiting for the chance to get to know you. Be sure to leave a comment below, send us a  note , or post a picture of your family on our Facebook page, we\u2019d love to meet you.

Please take a minute to leave a comment below and tell us what you\u00a0appreciate\u00a0about your child\u2019s grandparents. Is it their support you\u00a0appreciate the most? Is it the way they love on your chid? They way the bake the  best \u00a0chocolate\u00a0chip cookies? Maybe it\u2019s the way they would do anything for them (like  build them a swing set !)

{"date": ",May,1,2012", "body": "Today marked a huge  milestone  in the life of our little boy, and one of the biggest and best purchases of his life\u2026 His very first swing set! A first swing set is a rite of passage in the life of a child. It\u2019s the day they cross over from being a baby to being a boy. The day they trade their\u00a0pacifier for a\u00a0safety\u00a0slide. The first day of the rest of their life. And today\u00a0was that day for our son! If you\u2019re in the market for a swing set, or\u00a0perhaps\u00a0you\u2019ve already  been there, done that,  and\u00a0just want to laugh at a first time parent\u2019s experience. Either way. Decisions,\u00a0Decisions\u2026. When we first started looking for our first swing set we stopped by a place that sells  swing sets  like the one in the picture above. While that\u00a0backyard\u00a0play set\u00a0is certainly  awesome  (and if you\u00a0happen\u00a0to have one like it please let me know so we can come over and play on it) we decided to go a more\u00a0 minimalist \u00a0route. In fact for those of you\u00a0looking\u00a0for a great swing set for your younger kids, we\u00a0really\u00a0like the  Step2 Play Up Gym Set \u00a0(which is the model we ended up going with.) It all boils down to what I\u00a0learned\u00a0as Boy Scout; Be\u00a0Prepared\u2026 To all you parents out there who may think purchasing a swing set for your boy or girl is as simple as driving down to your local  Babies R Us , picking out the best one, paying for it, sticking it in the back of your car, coming home, opening the box, and instantly transforming your backyard to a jungle gym wonderland, I\u2019ve got some\u00a0disappointing\u00a0news for you. But this is your lucky day. I\u2019m going to give all of your would be swing set buyers some helpful tips you won\u2019t find in any  new parent  books. Oh, and keep in mind that this is my first ever swing set purchase which makes me  super qualified  to be giving tips. I guess you could say I\u201dm sort of like a swing set pro! \ud83d\ude42 # 1 \u2013 Your car isn\u2019t big enough. Unless you drive a huge diesel truck, you\u2019re going to need a bigger car. We thought my wife\u2019s  SUV \u00a0would do the trick, you know, as long as we  folded the seats down . Guess what? Folding the seats down may work if you\u2019re trying to bring home a  Billy Bookcase  from Ikea, but it\u2019s not going to work if you\u2019re trying to bring home a swing set from Babies R Us! It didn\u2019t take long to\u00a0realize\u00a0the swing set wasn\u2019t going to fit in our car, but thankfully there was a Home Depot nearby. By the way, if you don\u2019t\u00a0already\u00a0know, Home Depot  rents trucks  by the hour for\u00a0 super cheap  which is great if you have something you need to get from point A to point B; like a swing set. (Oh, and they also throw  epic birthday parties !) # 2 However long you think it will take you to\u00a0assemble, double it. I don\u2019t care if you have a garage full of tools, or only a lone Phillips head screwdriver just sitting in your junk drawer; it\u2019s going to take longer than you think to put your first swing set\u00a0together. There are over a billion\u00a0pieces, that span over two huge boxes; hard to follow instructions; a missing\u00a0piece\u00a0or two (that will require you to go  back  to Home Depot) and of course will require a tool that don\u2019t have, or can\u2019t find (which may also require trip  back  to Home Depot.) Rest assured that it will take you all day to put this thing\u00a0together, and you\u2019ll need more than one person. Thankfully in my case my father-in-law (who is much stronger and manly than me in\u00a0general) helped me put this thing\u00a0together. Otherwise I\u2019m not sure how it would have turned out. Actually\u00a0when I say he  helped  me, what I\u00a0really\u00a0mean is I read the\u00a0instructions, then handed him the tools and bolts needed to do the job. Sort of like what happens when you visit the Dentist. Yah, moving on\u2026.. # 3 Prepare yourself for EPIC CUTENESS After a long day (or two) you finally get to enjoy the fruit of all your hard work; which is getting to see the look on your child\u2019s face when they mount up on a swing, or slide down that slide. It\u2019s\u00a0priceless. (Get your camera ready!) This actually wasn\u2019t Noah\u2019s first time on a swing though, that\u00a0happened\u00a0 months ago . In fact, he has been using one at his physical\u00a0 therapy \u00a0appointments\u00a0since before he could  sit up  on his own, and we have another attached to our back deck (which is great for  sensory\u00a0integration .) He really enjoys\u00a0swinging, and I enjoy seeing his face light up and\u00a0hearing\u00a0that awesome laugh of his as he flies through the air\u2026so it\u2019s a double win! And for parents who are raising a child with  Down syndrome  (like us) swing sets are a fun and cost\u00a0effective way to work on some of those\u00a0developmental milestones in the\u00a0comfort\u00a0of your own back yard. In\u00a0addition\u00a0to all of developmental\u00a0benefits\u00a0of the swing, the slide is great for helping children born with Down syndrome\u00a0strengthen\u00a0their\u00a0 abdominal\u00a0muscles . Bouns Tip: Replace one of the swings with a baby swing The two swings that came in the box were just your typical swings, not the kind designed for a baby. And since we have a 10 month old that didn\u2019t work for us.\u00a0So we replaced one of the swings with the\u00a0 Little Tikes High Back Toddler Swing , and it worked great. It fits perfectly where one of the other swing would go, and we can swing along right next to Noah.\u00a0On a\u00a0side note\u00a0we have the  Fisher-Price Infant To Toddler Swing \u00a0on our back deck (the one Noah in this  video ) and much prefer it to the little tikes\u00a0one. One of the  physical\u00a0characteristics\u00a0of children with Down syndrome  is  hypotonia , which basically means they have low muscle tone. If you\u2019ve ever hugged Noah you may have noticed how he just sort of\u00a0melts\u00a0into you. That\u2019s hypotonia. (\u2026and an\u00a0extremely\u00a0cute hug.) All that to say they can have a hard time holding\u00a0their self\u00a0up, and I think the Fisher-Price swing has much better support than the Little Tikes one. So if you\u2019re looking for a swing, I\u2019d suggest the Fisher-Price one. It\u2019s great, and Noah has a ton of fun it it. Swinging Is Hard Work, But Somebaby\u2019s gotta do it! As I mentioned Noah\u2019s\u00a0grandparents\u00a0are in town visiting this weekend, and of course Noah has them wrapped around his 10 month old finger. He loves them, and they love him. And I love that. \ud83d\ude42 Noah is finally holding his own bottle, which is a pretty big milestone in my book. Granted they may not be the big\u00a0bottles (they actually look sort of like the ones that come with a girls doll, lol\u2026) but he can actually hold it  on his own!  I know he feels a sense of accomplishment since it\u2019s something he can actually do on his own, and that makes me one  proud  daddy. After his bottle his grandmother took over and read him on his all time favorite bedtime stories,  Goodnight Moon  (Although, T he Tickle Monster  ranks pretty high on Noah\u2019s bedtime story list as well.) \u00a0Noah\u2019s grandma is a  master storyteller , and could listen to her read stories all day (and night) long. And after a very long, but fun, day Noah is out for the count. I could watch this little boy sleep all day/night long. I\u2019m so in love with this kid. Even though putting together his first swing set was a lot of work, it was so much fun doing it. \u00a0And\u2026swing sets are so  typical . \ud83d\ude42 I want to hear your swing set story\u2026.keep reading\u2026. Well, I hope my swing set tips are helpful to an  first time buyers  out there. Please take a second to leave a comment below and let me know if you\u2019re planning to buy a swing set in the near future. Or if you already own one, tell me about your first swing set buying experience.

And I\u2019m sure there is someone out there who took the easy (and probably wiser) route and simply  hired someone  to put\u00a0their\u00a0swing set together.

{"date": ",June,7,2011", "body": "My mom came to visit today to pick up  my brother  who was in town visiting, and also to love on our son. \u00a0 Noah   loves  when either of his  grandmothers  come to visit\u00a0because even at almost  six months old , he knows that there is a good chance he will be getting spoiled! When  Noah was born  we quickly become aware of the many new  surprises  accompanied\u00a0 down syndrome  brought with it. \u00a0One of those surprises was low\u00a0muscle\u00a0tone which effected his ability to  drink from a bottle . \u00a0This required that\u00a0Noah ( at just 3 1/2 weeks old!)  visit a  speech\u00a0therapist  on a weekly basis! \u00a0(Whom, by the way, did an\u00a0incredible\u00a0job with our son!) Watching this short video and remembering how scared we were just\u00a0five\u00a0short months ago, caused me to reflect on the overwhelming faithfulness that God has show towards our family. In seems like only yesterday that my wife and I put on a pair of matching cold, heavy, lead vests, and stood in an ice-cold\u00a0examination room\u00a0watching a \u00a0radiologist\u00a0preform a\u00a0 swallow study  on our sweet, little, four week old. \u00a0We were scared. \u00a0We were worried. \u00a0We were afraid. \u00a0There was so much going on in our life at that time, and on top of that we were worried about our little boy not being able to get the food he needed. \u00a0To be honest, it was  terrifying . However, even through our life had suddenly become overwhelmed\u00a0with a million\u00a0unknowns, there was one thing we knew for sure \n God made a much better  god  then we did . \n He runs the show. \u00a0He calls the shots. \u00a0He is God. \u00a0I am not. \u00a0He is the Creator. \u00a0I am the created. \u00a0He knows Noah better then any doctor on the planet. \u00a0He knew about his extra 21st\u00a0chromosome\u00a0long before my wife\u2019s OB-GYN did. \u00a0 \u00a0He knows the future. \u00a0I do not.. \u00a0Noah belongs to God, not my wife and I. \u00a0Noah is simply on loan to us. \u00a0(This, by the way, is a very hard concept for me to wrap my mind around, but it\u2019s true.) \u00a0I also knew that God loved Noah even more then I do. \u00a0I also was fully aware that God alone held the entire world in the very palm of his hands, and that world included me, my wife, and our sweet, loving, unable to eat from a bottle, son. And we trusted God. \u00a0With everything we had. Everything being our son, Noah. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Fast forward five monts to today, and Noah here you see Noah eating out of a  spoon ! (And quite well, I might add.) Wow\u2026! God sure does an\u00a0incredible\u00a0of job of being God. It\u2019s didn\u2019t stop there, God\u00a0has continued to\u00a0demonstrate\u00a0mind-blowing examples of His grace toward our family!) I\u2019ll be honest. \u00a0This is quite the  journey  that God has us on, but honestly we wouldn\u2019t change a thing.  Down Syndrome  is sort of like the monster under my bed when I was kid. \u00a0It scared me. \u00a0It kept me up at night. \u00a0It caused me to cry. \u00a0It caused me to worry. \u00a0Then, one day, I\u00a0realized there was no reason for me to be\u00a0afraid. \u00a0That  monster , was no monster after all. Today, we can absolutely\u00a0say that our fears have been replaced with a supernatural joy that can only come from a loving, caring, graceful God. \u00a0Sure, there are some days when fear tries to win, but guess what\u2026 \n In this house, fear loses! \n This little guy is\u00a0seriously\u00a0amazing. \u00a0Being his dad is without a doubt the coolest\u00a0 role  I\u2019ve ever been in. \u00a0I can\u2019t stop looking at him, holding him, praying with him, playing with him, loving on him, and\u00a0staring\u00a0into those big, blue, eyes. \u00a0I\u2019m captiviated by him. Gosh, I love this kid. \u00a0Thank you God for finding us\u00a0faithful\u00a0that You would give us a child as\u00a0incredible\u00a0as Noah. Here\u2019s a few pictures of Noah\u2019s fun day with his grandma!

{"date": ",March,13,2012", "body": "If you ask  any parent \u00a0one thing that\u2019s in  limited supply  in their home\u00a0 time \u00a0(or money!) is usually at the top of their list. Parents in general stay busy. Parents raising  children born with Down syndrome \u00a0(or any  special need ) often have an  even busier schedule . Being the father of a 14 month old with  Down syndrome  myself, I know that just having a  day off  from the\u00a0various\u00a0physical, occupational, and speech\u00a0therapy\u00a0appointments can seem like a pot of gold at the end of a\u00a0seemingly\u00a0never-ending\u00a0developmental rainbow some weeks. Perhaps that\u2019s why I can relate so well to  Michael Kelley \u2018s new book,\u00a0 Wednesdays were Pretty Normal: A Boy, Cancer, And God . What\u2019s \u201cNormal\u201d Anyway? The book\u00a0tells the story of the author\u2019s own parenting journey after their two old son was\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with cancer. The Kelley\u2019s  normal \u00a0daily routine was quickly replaced by days full of Doctor\u2019s appointments,\u00a0specialists, and an extensive chemotherapy routine. Every day except Wednesdays.  For the Kelley\u2019s: \u201cWednesdays Were Pretty Normal.\u201d I won\u2019t spoil the ending for you, but  this is a book you will want to read .\u00a0If you\u2019ve ever had your world turned upside down in the blink of an eye, this book will help you see how to walk through it with  faith and hope . If you\u2019re a Christian and have ever wrestled with how to balance the promises of God with the\u00a0uncertainties\u00a0of life,  Wednesdays Were Pretty Normal  will help you see how it\u2019s\u00a0possible. And the author doesn\u2019t do this\u00a0just by quoting a bunch of old \u201c Christian\u201d  clich\u00e9s we\u2019ve all heard\u00a0a million\u00a0times, choosing instead to invite you into his families personal journey with the same fears and struggles. It other words,  real talk ! Now that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Just Check Out These Chapters! Just a quick look at the chapters gives you an idea of the kind of story Michael is sharing.

{"date": ",May,21,2012", "body": "[This post is a part of the \u201c New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome \u201d blog series. Be sure to check out the  other posts \u00a0in that series.) You may already have a pediatrician and hopefully they are the perfect fit for your family. However people sometimes ask \u201cdo I \u00a0have to go to a special pediatrician for my  baby with Down syndrome \u201d and while the answer is \u2018\u201dno\u201d there are some some qualities that are very important when choosing the best pediatrician for your child (special-needs or no special needs.) I\u2019ve also included some questions for you to ask your pediatrician under each quality to help you in your journey of choosing the best doctor for your child. 1. They MUST Listen To You. You know your child best and if you think something is wrong there is a good chance there is. If you have a doctor that blows you off, this is a red flag. You want a\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0that  listens  to your concern and is willing to either spend the time\u00a0necessary\u00a0to help you understand why they believe testing isn\u2019t\u00a0necessary, or is willing to do the proper testing to rules your concern out. This means that  you have to listen as well  and if you get reassurance and education you have to  let go of your concern  for the time being. The biggest concerns are the ones that keep you up at night worrying. I will often ask parents if we don\u2019t do XYZ test will you be able to sleep at night. If they say no, there is a high likelihood that I will do more testing. I call it  treating parents  \ud83d\ude42 \u00a0If it helps you sleep and feel better about your child, then let\u2019s do it. Can I guarantee that your pediatrician will do that\u2026no, but I urge you to let your pediatricians know what you are  really worried  about. Let me use a common example (and one that we personally deal with) A lot of parents of children with Down syndrome have a fear of cancer. Our children will likely deal with congestion and fevers and typical stuff, but when it starts to happen frequently the cancer idea can often sprout in your head. Make sure to ask your pediatrician as this question can  easily be answered  and you can easily be reassured. Therefore you can sleep at night \ud83d\ude42 If you are concerned about your child having cancer, here is one of the best thing you can ask your child\u2019s\u00a0pediatrician: If I \u00a0am concerned about something how do we best address those concerns, and if lab work or imaging is the only way to completely rule something out will you be willing to do that? 2. Comfortable Conversations You have to feel comfortable talking with them and asking your questions because you will certainly have a few. Maybe even hundreds. If you are intimidated or fearful of asking questions you will most likely leave every visit a little dissatisfied and wishing you would have  just asked that question you had in the back of your mind . One of the main purposes of a pediatrician is to answer parents\u2019 questions, and if you don\u2019t feel comfortable asking your\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0questions, you\u2019re missing out. Even I have ran into a few doctors where I don\u2019t feel comfortable asking all of my questions. I will also be the first one to volunteer that just as in the general population there are some not so nice doctors or ones with a little  different  personality. You\u2019ll have a gut feeling about this after your first visit. Trust your instincts and move on if you need to. 3. Time For Your Child They must have  time to spend with you  during your visits. Five minutes will not be enough. In today\u2019s busy private practice world time is becoming limited if a physician wants to keep their practice afloat. If they are busy and cannot take extra time for you, things may be missed or you will feel unsatisfied. They are the center of your care and will be coordinating various specialists. It will take time to look at the whole picture with your pediatrician. Make sure they are willing to take extra time with you if necessary. I know the  well child visits  for Noah take about 30-45 minutes, and our pediatrician is patient with us and makes sure all of our care is in place and questions are answered. To make the most of the time given you, make sure to come with your questions written down so you don\u2019t forget. Here are a few important questions to ask your\u00a0pediatrician: \n How many kids do you see in day? \n If I have a lot of questions or there are several issues that we need to talk about how do I schedule those appointments? \n Can I ask for a longer visit if\u00a0necessary? (In my resident clinic we had certain patients that we had documented in their chart that they needed longer appointment times.) \n 4. Knowledge They need to have some knowledge of Down syndrome as well as be willing to learn and research to expand that knowledge. They should adhere to the American Academy of Pediatrics Health Guidelines for Children with Down Syndrome. Below you will find a copy of these guidelines, and I suggest printing them and bringing them with you on your first visit. They should also be willing to learn new things and research the questions that you ask. There is exciting research being done by major\u00a0universities\u00a0for cognitive issues with Down syndrome and it is helpful if your doctor is helping your sort through that. \u00a0You may have to take the first step by asking the question, but that should be enough to spark their interest. If you have plans to use alternative medicine it would be a good idea to see how they feel about that and if they will answer questions for you. There are several supplements and such that you may decide to use. You will want a doctor that supports you, but you also wants one that  tells you the truth . You want one willing to help you sort through information and use what is proven to be beneficial. I encourage you to  listen to your doctor  if they don\u2019t think an alternative medicine would be beneficial and possibly even harmful. There are good alternative therapies, but there are also a lot of  scams  out there that are meant to take advantage of parents who have children with special needs.  Trust your doctor over the internet. Here are some questions to ask your\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0to help you get an idea of their\u00a0knowledge\u00a0about Down\u00a0syndrome. \n What guidelines do you use to manage a child with Down syndrome? \n Do you have other patients with Down syndrome? \n How do you learn new information? \n Can I bring you articles or information that I find? \n How do you feel about alternative medicine or using supplementation \n 5. Easy to Contact Communication is becoming harder in today\u2019s private practice world. During the day you are usually able to talk to a person who will get your question to the doctor. At night there are various systems. One is a nurse line where they use a protocol to answer questions to determine what you need to do. Sometimes the doctor is paged and they return your phone call. In our clinic we have a doctor who  actually answers the phone himself!  It shocks me each time he picks up the phone. Each way is a good way, but it\u2019s good to know before hand about how long you will wait to hear back from\u00a0your\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0when you need to contact them. You will probably have times when you need orders for things such as  labs  or therapies and it has to be easy to get this accomplished. You don\u2019t want there to be a delay if it\u2019s too hard to get a hold of your doctor to write orders. Your child may end up on medications. Getting refills can sometimes be a hassle. Sometimes it\u2019s just a phone call, other times the doctor may need to see the patient in person. Here are a few questions to ask your\u00a0pediatrician regarding your ability to contact them when needed. \n If I have a question during the day how does that work? \n What is your call system like at night? \n If I need orders for things such as therapies how do I go about getting those? \n If we need refills on medications how do I get this? \n 6. Encouragement Your\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0must be  encouraging . Your life is going to have quite a few appointments and you will need someone to tell you\u2019re doing a great job. It\u2019s a lot of work sometimes taking care of a child with special needs, and getting encouragement from your doctor can turn a dark day into a bright one. I will never forget when I was having a bad day about Noah\u2019s development and I went to see our pediatrician for something else and she could not stop encouraging us for how well we were doing and how awesome Noah was doing. It picked me right up. You also need someone with a  positive outlook  for your child. If your pediatrician initially painted a bleak future for your child I would tell you to  run like the wind  to another pediatrician. You will have a pretty good idea after they\u00a0deliver\u00a0your child\u2019s Down syndrome diagnosis on wether or not you want to stick with them. Here is a great question to ask your\u00a0pediatrician: \n What do you think the future holds for a child with Down syndrome? \n 7. Pediatricians who are also parents I never would have said this prior to Noah being born and it\u2019s not a requirement, but I became a 1000 x better pediatrician when I had Noah. Pediatricians with children have a much better understanding of what you are going through, and often give more realistic advice. For example, I may never recommend  time outs  after I try that method out myself. Those without children tend to hold to the books and research and haven\u2019t actually tried any of it out themselves. I wish I could back and change some of the things I have said to parents now.:) Here is a simple question to ask your\u00a0pediatrician: \n Do you have any children of your own? \n 8. Pediatrician Over Family Medicine I have nothing against my family medicine friends. I was taken care of by a family medicine doctor growing up and I think I turned out pretty good. \ud83d\ude42 That being said, a pediatrician has been trained by taking care of children for  three years  during his/her medical\u00a0residency. In that time we are exposed to all of the specialities of pediatrics including development. I have taken care of children with Down syndrome throughout my training and I am fairly confident in saying that other pediatricians will say the same thing. Compare this to family medicine, they spend a  few months  of training in pediatrics that usually centers around general pediatrics and newborn care. Now, there can be excellent family doctors out there that know the ins and outs of Down syndrome and will take fantastic care of your child. I just ask you to really question them in the knowledge department. Here\u2019s a simple question to ask your\u00a0pediatrician: \n Do you feel that your training has prepared you to care for a child with Down syndrome \n 9. Who Will Actually See My Child Private practices are involving advanced\u00a0practitioners\u00a0more and more. These include physician assistants and nurse\u00a0practitioners. These qualified individuals are a valuable part of a functioning clinic that allows for all of the above qualities to be found in your\u00a0pediatrician. How they are used varies in each clinic. There is usually a scope of field that the\u00a0practitioner\u00a0is able to work within. Take for example a 2 month well child check for a  typical child . They however may not be allowed to see a 2 month well child check for a child with Down syndrome since there is usually a bit more involved. Usually if there are questions about your child the advanced practitioner has easy access to the doctor to get answers. If these providers are in your clinic and you end up seeing them, that\u2019s perfectly fine, but if you feel that you need to see the doctor that day be sure to speak up. Here are a few questions to ask your doctor: \n Do you use advanced practitioners in your clinic such as physician assistants or nurse practitioners? \n What are they allowed to take care of on their own? \n Can I request to see the doctor rather than the PA or NP for some visits? \n What if I have a question they cannot answer during a visit? \n 10. Shared Faith Rick and I trust in God to be the best medical provider for our son. He answers our prayers and has done an excellent job taking care of him. I\u2019m a firm believer that God has provided us with the knowledge for treatments such as medications to take care of our children, and we find great comfort in the interaction of science and faith. I hope this is never you, but there may be a time in your child\u2019s life when the medical world has provided everything it has to offer your and your child and to  them  hope is gone. I personally want a doctor who relies on God  past that point  and knows that  miracles are possible  and will cling to hope with us. It takes a pretty brave doctor to pray with their patients. A lot of them will be praying at home, but to pray in a room with the family takes courage as we have trained that it is not acceptable to  push our faith  on those who are in desperate situations. I have been brave enough to pray with a few on my own, and will always pray for those who ask. If you fess up that you want your faith to be a part of your care I am willing to bet that if your doctor is a believer they will be ecstatic to include this in your care..they were just waiting for you to ask. Never forget that even when it looks like the odds are against you (and your child) that God likes bad odds. \ud83d\ude42 Here are a few\u00a0questions\u00a0to ask your doctor: \n Are you a Christian? \n Would you be willing to pray with us? \n We hope this list helps you in choosing the best\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0for your child born with Down syndrome. What qualities do you look for in a medical provider for your family? What are some of the things that you really like (or dislike) about your child\u2019s\u00a0pediatrician?

{"date": ",June,8,2011", "body": "On Tuesday and Wednesday of each week we take Noah to  physical therapy . \u00a0This is in additional to his bi-weekly  occupational therapy . \u00a0(Which was also in addition to his weekly  feeding therapy . However as of just a few weeks ago, Noah  eats like a champ  and no longer needs to go!) To be honest, when we found about all of the appointments that my wife and I would need to take Noah to, I thought I was going to be forever frustrated. Actually, I was a little frustrated. \u00a0Not at Noah, nor at all of the many appointments that were now a part of our life. \u00a0It was all the extra stuff that went into those appointments. Fighting the traffic to and from the appointments. (By the way, don\u2019t always trust the time your iPhone says it takes to get somewhere. \u00a0Trust me.) Waiting in doctors office\u2019s. \u00a0Lots of them. (By the way, why is it so hard to find a Doctor in Dallas who still subscribes to Highlights magazine!) Dealing with paperwork. \u00a0Lots of it. (If you know me in real life, you know administration  isn\u2019t  my strong point. \u00a0Thank God for my amazing wife!) Waiting at (insert your pharmacy of choice name here.) (If there was a pharmacy delivered. \u00a0That pharmacy would win. \u00a0Fact.) \u00a0 This list could go on, but the truth of the matter is I\u2019m ok with it. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0Really. \u00a0I\u2019m ok with it. In fact, I actually  thank God  for it. \u00a0Seriously. I know it sounds crazy, but it\u2019s true. \u00a0I\u2019m thankful that we live in a time and place where we have access to all of the resources. \u00a0I\u2019m thankful that are therapists that we can take our son to. \u00a0I\u2019m thankful for X-Ray machines, and labs that give doctors the ability to see inside my  son\u2019s throat  so that he can do awesome things\u2026like  eat . I could go on, and on with this list as well. \u00a0In fact, this list would be  way longer  then the one above. My wife and I often talk about the million and one emotions we experienced during the first few weeks of Noah\u2019s life. \u00a0In fact, I still tear up sometimes just thinking about it. \u00a0We had no idea what our life was going to be like on June 8th 2011, (today) but here we are six moths later and guess what \u2013  it\u2019s way better then we could have ever dreamed it would be! I often have people ask me, \u201cWhat\u2019s life like being the parent of a child with Down Syndrome?\u201d Here\u2019s my answer: 1. \u00a0Being a father is awesome\u2026! 2. \u00a0Our life is way more \u201cnormal\u201d then \u201cun-normal.\u201d Seriously, this journey we are on is incredible. \u00a0Watching God work in this little six-month olds life is amazing! \u00a0I seriously can\u2019t believe I get a front row ticket to watch him grow up. \u00a0In fact, when I think about this site and the daily one minute videos I\u2019ll be posting, I get excited. \u00a0I know one day I\u2019ll get to go back (and will you) and watch Noah grow up minute, by minute; literally. \u00a0 Wow\u2026! So I guess you could say this is my attempt at a geeky-sappy-dad-digital-scrapbook. \u00a0(That the whole world is invited to view!) The \u201cinspiration\u201d behind this site came from our friends  Joel and Emily Skaggs . \u00a0When Noah was born we  Facebook Stalked  them as we eagerly checked their page each day in hopes of them posting a new video of their three adorable three year old son, Seth; who also was born with Down Syndrome. \u00a0We wanted to a glimpse into the future. \u00a0We wanted to know our life would be \u201cnormal.\u201d \u00a0No one we knew had a child with Down Syndrome, and those videos, posted by people we had never met, were our window into the unknown. \u00a0Through that window we say hope, encouragement, and lots of fun!

{"date": ",June,11,2011", "body": "We had a great time tonight at the Dallas\u00a0Arboretum\u00a0celebrating the\u00a0completion\u00a0of my wife\u2019s residency.

Unless you are a Doctor, married to a doctor, or have someone in your family who is a\u00a0doctor, you can\u2019t comprehend how difficult it is to become a one. \u00a0Don\u2019t let Scrubs, or Grey\u2019s Anatomy fool you, it\u2019s hard. \u00a0Very hard. Over the last three years while my wife went through\u00a0residency, I\u2019ve seen her do things I\u00a0didn\u2019t even\u00a0know were humanly\u00a0possible. \u00a0She worked days. \u00a0She worked nights. \u00a0She worked over nights. She worked multiple days. \u00a0She worked for weeks in a row. \u00a0She\u00a0sacrificed\u2026.. \u00a0I could fill this page up with the number of\u00a0incredible\u00a0things I saw her do. \u00a0 \u00a0 There countless other things that amaze me when it comes to my wife. \u00a0For instance; she is a wonderful mom to Noah. \u00a0She cares, for her patients. \u00a0She stays close to God. \u00a0She prays for her patients. \u00a0She never complains. \u00a0I mean seriously. \u00a0She is always so\u00a0positive\u00a0\u2013 I love it! \u00a0She makes wonderful meals. \u00a0She is my best friend in the whole, wide, world. \u00a0She always thinks the best of me. \u00a0She never gives up on me. \u00a0She is seriously the best. \u00a0I have no words to explain how much I love my wife. She is also the best doctor I\u2019ve ever seen. \u00a0If you ever find yourself having to bring your child to  Children\u2019s Medical Center  in Dallas, you\u2019re in very, very good hands. I\u2019m so thankful for my family, I couldn\u2019t dream up a better one if I tried. -Rick \u00a0 (Please don\u2019t forget to visit our  subscribe  page so you can stay\u00a0connected\u00a0with our\u00a0journey! \u00a0Thanks!)

If you\u2019ve noticed the date that briefly\u00a0appears at the start of each of our one minute videos you may have noticed that we\u2019re running just a  tad bit  behind. We enjoy telling our son\u2019s  story \u00a0and giving\u00a0the world a window into the life of what life is like for one family raising a child born with  Down\u00a0syndrome .\u00a0Since we\u00a0sharing this beautiful story of life in\u00a0 chronological order \u00a0if, in the business of life, we don\u2019t create a new post on a every day it creates a domino effect. Most of the time no one notices (or cares) that we\u2019re running behind, however I didn\u2019t want anyone to get confused when they saw a post about Halloween in the middle of April! \ud83d\ude42\u00a0We have a plan to get caught up to real time over the next few\u00a0months. In the mean time I hope you enjoy the story we are sharing of our son\u2019s life. It\u2019s been a blast getting to know so many of our readers, and learning about your families as share your stories with us. Thanks for being so\u00a0encouraging\u00a0and\u00a0supportive of our efforts. We really\u00a0appreciate\u00a0each and every one of you! Now, on to today\u2019s post (which is jammed packed with tons of really cute pictures!) Noah\u2019s First Halloween\u2026.and His Parent\u2019s First Halloween Fail(s) First let me just say that before our son was born I\u2019ve never googled \u201cinfant Halloween\u00a0costume ideas,\u201d searched\u00a0 Pinterest  for the best\u00a0 baby Halloween costumes , or been exposed to how, umm\u2026.shall I say,  determined , mothers can be when it comes to finding their child the cutest and most creative Halloween outfit the world has ever seen. Which leads to the first of\u00a0two parent fails I\u2019m going to be sharing in this post. Parent Fail # 1: Daddy Fashion Fail I know what you\u2019re thinking\u2026.. What\u2019s so \u201cfail\u201d about a cute little 10 month old boy dressed up in a puppy dog, lion, and\u00a0banana\u00a0costume? That\u2019s  exactly  what I thought when I bought Noah all of these\u00a0 pajamas \u00a0costumes\u2026\u2026.10 months before Halloween! Yelp, it\u2019s true. I was at the mall one day when I saw these three awesome\u00a0outfits just hanging there in the clearance section (as in the  after Halloween  clearance\u00a0section.) Being a new father, and excited\u00a0about the thought of coming home from the mall and surprising his wife and son with some cute new baby clothes, bought all three outfits! (After all isn\u2019t part of the fun of having a child getting to dress them up in all sorts of cute outfits?) Well it turns out dressing up your son as a puppy dog in the middle of December isn\u2019t\u00a0considered\u00a0cute\u2026..more like strange. Oh well, at least I tried\u2026. \ud83d\ude42 But on the bright side, when his first Halloween finally arrived, he already had three super cute\u00a0costumes\u00a0waiting for him. Parent Fail # 2: Mommy-Trick-Or-Treater-Trust Fail Before I tell you about mommy\u2019s fail, I want to tell you about mommy\u2019s win. This\u00a0amazingly\u00a0awesome finding Nemo Jack-O-Lantern she carved! This was her first ever pumpkin carving. I think she did a pretty awesome job! Ok, moving on the epic mommy fail\u2026.. Since this was Noah\u2019s  first Halloween  (or fall festival, or harvest celebration, or great pumpkin\u00a0extravaganza, or as I like to call it; national trust a stranger day) and our first Halloween in our  new house , we wanted to give out candy and meet some of our new neighbors in the process. The only problem was we were also taking Noah out and about with  his friend \u00a0Austin to go Trick-Or-Treating. So\u00a0my wife had this  great  idea to leave  all of our candy  on the front\u00a0porch\u00a0in a large bowl, and just  trust  the treat or treaters\u2026! (Can you see where this story is going?) Well\u2026no sooner then us crossing the street (and the first few sets of cutely dressed kids and their\u00a0 passionately  candy seeking parents finding our bowl-o-candy) our once overflowing candy bowl was completely\u00a0empty.\u00a0With the exception of a few left over Nerds that someone\u00a0managed\u00a0to escape. Moral of the story? Never trust trick-or-treaters. The Cutest Little Lion (And Superman) You\u2019ve Ever Seen We took Noah and his friend Austin Trick or Treating around our\u00a0neighborhood\u00a0tonight and I think they (or shall I say I) made out like a\u00a0bandit. I know what you may be thinking\u2026. Awww..just look at those two little  angels . But, as I\u2019ve said before,  children with Down syndrome aren\u2019t angels . Sure, it\u2019s super cute seeing Austin (aka superman) sharing his candy with Noah, but\u2026. \u2026.Noah\u2019s not\u00a0interested\u00a0in Austin\u2019s M&M\u2019s. He\u2019s got his eyes on a much larger prize. Like\u2026. Austin\u2019s entire bucket of candy! \u2026and if he can\u2019t get his hands on Austin\u2019s entire bucket of candy, it\u2019s all good\u2026. \u2026.because\u00a0his feet will do! And if he can\u2019t get his  hands \u00a0mouth on the feet\u2026. \u2026.it\u2019s all good again,\u00a0because\u00a0Starbursts taste  way better  than feet! And after all of that, he finally lands on some random generic candy. *sigh* If only he would have taken the M&M\u2019s.\u00a0I\u2019ve have a lot to teach my son about Halloween candy\u2026.. We had a great time hanging out with Austin and his mommy, and we\u2019re also super glad to have such fun friends living so close to us! The two greatest titles I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve said this a million times being a dad (and husband) are the two greatest titles I\u2019ve ever had. I can\u2019t believe I get to wake up every morning and share life with these two. I really mean that. The joy that I get to experience daily in this house is beyond words. Don\u2019t settle for\u00a0counterfeit\u00a0joy. Are there\u00a0 bad \u00a0days, sure? Life has plenty of ups and downs. Highs and lows. Good days, bad days. But if you know\u00a0the\u00a0 true \u00a0source\u00a0of\u00a0joy, you know\u00a0joy isn\u2019t\u00a0dependent\u00a0upon any card life deals you. It doesn\u2019t ebb and flow based on your circumstances. No, true joy is must more  constant  than that. Much more  stable  than that. Much more  joyful  than that. True joy, joy that never fades away, comes from the creator of joy, the Triune God. And while life\u2019s\u00a0various\u00a0trinkets can sometimes seem to give us\u00a0 joy,  it\u2019s not real joy. It\u2019s counterfeit\u00a0joy. It quickly fades. And when it does we find ourself on a pursuit\u00a0for the next trinket. I\u2019m\u00a0thankful\u00a0that God has made a way through Jesus to show us that life is more than a collection of trinkets. That He has provided a way for us to experience true joy. Every single day of our life. Life is good\u2026. \u2026.and some days after playing with your mommy, daddy and friends, scoring a huge bag of candy, dressing up in a cute lion\u00a0costume, and enduring lots and lots of (really cute) pictures, All you really want to do is take a nap.

{"date": ",March,12,2012", "body": "I\u2019m\u00a0embarrassed\u00a0to admit that our ten month old son spends  way  more time at the gym than I do. He works out with his physical\u00a0therapist\u00a0twice a week, and his\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapist\u00a0twice a week as well. This little boy works hard! Like, super-crazy-awesome hard. I\u2019m so  proud  of this little boy. Occupational\u00a0And Physical\u00a0Therapists\u00a0Who Are It For More Than Just \u00a0A Paycheck = Epic Win We are blessed to have a team of\u00a0 incredible pediatric\u00a0therapists  working with Noah. They don\u2019t see our son as just  another   patient . They actually treat him as if he was their own child and are\u00a0 committed \u00a0to helping him reach his  goals .\u00a0it\u2019s great.\u00a0I\u2019ll never be able to thank them enough for the impact they have made (and are making) in my son\u2019s life. We have posted a lot of videos of Noah\u2019s journey with his various\u00a0therapists, and so I thought today would be a good time to give you all a little update on what he is\u00a0currently\u00a0working on. Physical Therapy Update Noah\u2019s  physical\u00a0therapist \u00a0has been spending a lot of time\u00a0lately\u00a0using  treadmill\u00a0therapy \u00a0to help him learn to walk. (If you\u2019re\u00a0interested\u00a0we posted the  treadmill training\u00a0protocol\u00a0for children with Down syndrome  which you can\u00a0download\u00a0for free.) He\u2019s come a long way since his  first time  on the treadmill. If your\u00a0child\u2019s\u00a0therapist\u00a0isn\u2019t using the treadmill with your child with Down syndrome, I\u00a0highly\u00a0suggested printing off the treadmill\u00a0information\u00a0I linked to above, giving to them, and asking them to\u00a0incorporate\u00a0in\u00a0your\u00a0child\u2019s\u00a0developmental\u00a0therapy. Occupational\u00a0Therapist\u00a0Update In today\u2019s video Noah\u2019s\u00a0 occupational\u00a0therapist  is using stairs and  developmental motivators  to\u00a0encourage\u00a0him to  sit up  on his own. He does a great job at  staying in the sitting position if we put him there , but his  core muscles  aren\u2019t strong enough yet for him to sit up on his own. Even though it looks like Noah is simply playing with toys in today\u2019s video, all that playing is actually helping him  develop  the\u00a0strength\u00a0needed to sit up, crawl, play with toys, and eventually walk! So those toys are actually  developmental tools . Pretty  sneaky \u00a0strategic, huh? My Pride\u00a0Outweighs\u00a0My Words I say this a lot, but I\u2019m  super proud  of our little boy. The pride I have for our son  far exceeds  any words I have to\u00a0express\u00a0it. From the second Noah was  born , he\u2019s been working hard to do things that  typical children  learn to do quickly and easily (and without spending hours at various\u00a0therapy\u00a0appointments\u00a0each week.) I\u2019ve get to see first hand all the hard work this kid puts in to reach his goals, and I also get to see the deep sense of accomplishment on his face every time he reaches one. He does it all with a smile on his face. Never complaining, and never asking for anything in return.\u00a0It\u2019s inspiring.\u00a0And it\u2019s amazing. There are no words to\u00a0describe\u00a0it. Hmmm\u2026.\u00a0maybe\u00a0your and I could learn something from this 10 month old boy. \ud83d\ude42 What has your child with Down syndrome been working on\u00a0recently\u00a0in physical /\u00a0occupational\u00a0/ speech / feeding\u00a0therapy?

{"date": ",June,9,2011", "body": "Two times a day we do a series of exercises given to us by Noah\u2019s  speech therapist \u00a0as part of the\u00a0 Beckman Oral Motor program . \u00a0The Beckman exercises\u00a0are designed to help children with low\u00a0muscle\u00a0tone \u00a0(a common  physical characteristic  of children\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with Down Syndrome) develop\u00a0strength in their mouth which helps with oral motor skills, and eventually speech. Z-Vibe Is A Great Speech Therapy Tool For Children Born With Down Syndrome In the video it looks like Noah doesn\u2019t enjoy some of the\u00a0exercises, but he actually doesn\u2019t mind them. \u00a0In fact, on most days he giggles and  laughs  all the way through them. \u00a0We\u2019ve seen tremendous progress in Noah\u2019s  ability to eat  since we started these exercises almost five months ago. \u00a0We went from seeing our son  hardly being able to drink from a bottle , to\u00a0 devouring\u00a0spoon fed cereal  like a champ! \u00a0It\u2019s really quite remarkable\u2026! In the second half of the video we are using a tool called a  z-vibe . \u00a0It\u2019s basically a small, vibrating toothbrush with a soft rubber tip on the end. \u00a0In the video it may look as if we are just randomly sticking the z-vibe in his mouth, but there\u2019s actually a series of very specific exercises that are required as part of the Beckman oral motor exercises program. \u00a0These exercises provide  oral stimulation , and help reduce tongue\u00a0protrusion (which is also a common\u00a0characteristic\u00a0in babies diagnosed with  Down syndrome .) Why do babies born with Down syndrome stick their tongue out:\u00a0 \u00a0If you don\u2019t know anyone personally with Down Syndrome, you may not know why many babies with Down Syndrome sometimes stick their tongues out. \u00a0The reason for their tongue sticking out (known as tongue protrusion) is partly due to the low muscle tone in their face, and mouth. \u00a0Almost everyday someone says, \u201cWow\u2026look at him stick his little tongue, that\u2019s so cute!\u201d \u00a0While it may look cute to everyone else, to us it\u2019s actually a reminder that Noah was  born with Down Syndrome  , and that  we have a lot of  work  to do!  Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve made a comment like that to us, it doesn\u2019t offend us in the least. \u00a0Up until \u00a0 six months ago  I didn\u2019t know any of this myself, so we\u2019ll all learn together!

{"date": ",June,6,2011", "body": "Every other Monday we take Noah in for occupational\u00a0therapy at  Our Children\u2019s House at Baylor . \u00a0Occupational therapy is important for children  born with down syndrome  as they often have challenges\u00a0developing\u00a0fine motor skills. \u00a0This is due to several\u00a0characteristics commonly shared by children with down syndrome including; low muscle tone,\u00a0increased\u00a0flexibility\u00a0in\u00a0their\u00a0arm and hand joints, broad hands, and short fingers. Fine motor skills  deals with areas such as self care (getting dressed, eating, tying ones shoes, etc.), skills related to playing (for instance, picking up and releasing toys), and work\u00a0related\u00a0activities (using\u00a0scissors, a glue stick, and hand writing.) When we brought Noah in (when he was only 3 1/2 weeks old!) we were very\u00a0concerned\u00a0with how \u201cfloppy\u201d he was. \u00a0We would pick him up, and he would seriously just fall back as if we were holding a little rag-doll. \u00a0His little hands, and neck would just flop all around due to the lack of low muscle tone. Ashley was one of the first\u00a0therapists\u00a0that worked with Noah at Our Children\u2019s House Baylor, and was a pleasure to work with. \u00a0(Noah also\u00a0receives  speech\u00a0therapy  and  physical\u00a0therapy  from OCHB.) She gave us simple things we could do at home that would help Noah with his fine motor skills (like having Noah practice holding, grasping, and releasing  tiny\u00a0maracas  she suggested we buy from Party City.) \u00a0\u00a0Almost\u00a0immediately\u00a0we saw\u00a0improvement, and each day brought even more\u00a0encouragement\u00a0as we saw Noah hold those\u00a0little\u00a0\u201cbaby weights\u201d a few songs longer each day (now we can\u00a0hardly\u00a0prey them out of his small hands!) Ashley\u00a0also uses a technique on Noah that\u00a0involves\u00a0using kinesio to gently pull on the skin, which in return helps the muscles\u00a0underneath\u00a0the tape to\u00a0strengthen. \u00a0This is the same technique that is often used on\u00a0athletes. \u00a0Noah doesn\u2019t seem to mind it at all, and it seems to be working well. On a sad note, today was Ashley\u2019s last day as Noah\u2019s\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapist. \u00a0She\u2019s moving to Philadelphia to\u00a0take a new job at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u00a0We wish her the best of luck, and look forward to\u00a0continuing\u00a0Noah\u2019s\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapy\u00a0with his new\u00a0therapist\u00a0in two weeks!

{"date": ",February,5,2012", "body": "As I was putting together today\u2019s video and thinking about what I was going to write about it, I decided I would just let the video speak for itself. \u00a0We\u2019ve written about the benefits of  treadmill therapy  for children born with Down syndrome, some of the best characteristics to look for when  choosing a physical therapist  for your child, and even what one of the major  goals of physical therapy  is for a child born with Down syndrome; so I figured today I\u2019d take a second just to brag on my son. I hope you don\u2019t mind. \ud83d\ude42 If you\u2019ve been reading this blog for very long you know how  proud  I am of \u00a0Noah. \u00a0This little boy works hard. \u00a0He goes to two physical therapy appointments a week, and two occupational therapy appointments a week\u2026.and always has a smile on his face (and sometimes a little throw up on his clothes afterwards!) While  typical  children are off doing whatever it is  typical children  do (Noah\u2019s our first, and only child at this point), Noah\u2019s hard at work developing the strength needed for  sitting up , crawling, pulling himself up, and eventually walking. \u00a0And again, he does this with no complaining. \u00a0He just wears a cute little grin on his face that\u2019s become his badge of  dedication  to never giving up. For the 2 millionth time\u2026I love being this little boy\u2019s daddy. It\u2019s Your Turn To Brag As we\u2019ve gotten to know so many families raising children with special needs, we\u2019ve been blown away by all the amazing things their children are doing. \u00a0Not only in their physiotherapy\u00a0appointments (as my friends in Australia call it) but in a variety of \u00a0things. \u00a0To the parents of children born with any sort of disability reading this; I am amazed at how much you love and sacrifice for your children. \u00a0You guys spend countless hours helping them reach their milestones, and I wish I could give every one of you a big hug. Thanks for inspiring Abbie and I. \u00a0We appreciate all of the great ideas we learn from all of you who take the time to share them with us. Please take a few minutes to brag on your child in the comments below (and perhaps congratulate another parent.) \u00a0Anything goes. \u00a0Did they just reach a new milestone? \u00a0Did they rock it at this week at physical therapy? \u00a0Was today the day your little one rolled over for the first time? \u00a0No accomplishment is a small accomplishment, and we encourage you to celebrate every  win ! So please take a second and brag on your kids in the comments below\u2026we want to hear about!

Actually, it was probably a bigger day for me, then for Noah. Mommy had to work an overnight shift at the hospital (she\u2019s a  pediatrician ), and I\u2019m as a\u00a0 student minister  , Sundays are crazy, busy for me. \u00a0So we decided  Noah  would spend the morning hanging out in the church nursery. This was sort of a big deal for  us  me since we hadn\u2019t left Noah with anyone besides his mommy and daddy (other then  immediate family , and a trusted sitter.) Our church nursery staff is great so I had no reservations what so every of leaving him there. When I checked in on Noah in between services (our church has two services) our entire nursery staff couldn\u2019t stop talking about how much fun they had with him! They also told me about how they had put on a worship CD and \u201c praised God for the entire cd !\u201d This was really cool to hear! In fact, I couldn\u2019t get the thought out of my head of my little five and a half month old son smiling and \u201csinging\u201d praises to God. How incredible! \u00a0He had a ball in the nursery! Later in the night my  brother  and I took Noah to see my wife at work so Noah could get a midnight snack \u2013 which he also enjoyed! We love this kid so much!

Everyday I love this kid more then the day before. It seriously feels like my heart is going to burst with love!

{"date": ",February,1,2012", "body": "I\u2019m excited to announce that today the Smith family said good bye to upstairs neighbors that apparently enjoy jumping rope with techno music blasting in the background at 2 in the morning; to having to play real life  Tetris  on a daily basis with our furniture\u00a0in order to fit it all in, and sadly\u2026.to\u00a0maintenance men at your beck and call. That\u2019s right, we\u2019ve finally said good bye to apartment life, and picked up the keys to our first home. What a great feeling! After buying baby Noah his first  rody horse , it was clear that our two bedroom apartment (one bedroom / one office) wasn\u2019t going cut it. \u00a0There was hardly any room for Noah to have tummy time, much less learn to crawl! \u00a0I had always heard house shopping was a stressful task, and that it difficult to find a home, but I have to say it couldn\u2019t have been more easy; we seriously found the perfect house for Noah to grow up in! Also it\u2019s not the house hunting that stresses me out\u2026it\u2019s moving in general. \u00a0In fact, that\u2019s one of the main reasons we\u2019ve put off buying a house for so long. \u00a0We both hate moving! \u00a0Seriously, the thought of having to pack up our entire apartment makes me a little sick to my stomach. After our closing we swung by our new home to scope it out \u00a0without having our (very nice) realtor with us. \u00a0It really was awesome putting that key in the door, and walking into our very first home as a family. \u00a0I just kept thinking about all the wonderful things that would happen in our house. \u00a0Noah would learn to crawl here\u2026.learn to walk here\u2026say his first words here. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0What a blessing. Afterwards we headed over to  The Home Depo t to pick out some paint for a few of the rooms. \u00a0Now let me just fill you in on a few things you may not know about me yet. \u00a0I\u2019m not your average manly-man. \u00a0I don\u2019t watch sports. \u00a0I don\u2019t like to work on cars. \u00a0And I much prefer Best Buy to Home Depot. \u00a0I\u2019ll even go on record and say, I even prefer Babies R Us to The Home Depot. \u00a0Any. Day. Of. The. Week! \u00a0Shhhhhh\u2026just don\u2019t tell my wife. Little did I know how much time I would soon be spending at The Home Depot. \u00a0One great thing about apartment living\u2026.24 x 7 maintenance men. \u00a0I would soon come to learn just how much I missed them. While we were cruising the aisles looking for paint I decided to test out all of that hard work Noah\u2019s  physical therapists  have been doing to help Noah strengthen his  core , and see if he could sit up in a shopping cart. \u00a0And I\u2019m glad I did because he rocked that shopping cart! \u00a0He was a little\u00a0wobbly, but he did great. \u00a0I was so  proud  of him. Check him out! For those of you not in the know, one of the main  physical characteristics\u00a0of Down syndrome  is hypotonia, or low muscle tone. \u00a0(Which also means that children born with Down syndrome give incredible hugs! Noah seriously melts into you like butter\u2026.I love it!) \u00a0So kids like Noah typically have to work really hard to develop the muscles needed to  sit up  (and stay up) on their own. \u00a0And it\u2019s only taken Noah 9 months to be able to ride in a shopping cart without falling over! This kid has abs of steel! Well now we start the nightmare process that is known as moving. \u00a0It\u2019s all good though. \u00a0I\u2019m at the best place I\u2019ve ever been in my life. \u00a0I have the most incredible family I guy could ever ask for\u2026and now we get to continue our life in our first home. \u00a0Life is good. \u00a0I can\u2019t wait to continue to share our  story  with you. \u00a0Thanks for following along on our journey. Do you have any funny \u2018first time home buyer\u201d stories? \u00a0\u00a0(The movie \u201c The Money Pit \u201d comes to mind.)\u00a0Please share your story in the comments below.

{"date": ",March,1,2012", "body": "Every year, the last Friday of September is like a national holiday  in our house  for me. I look forward to it every single year. The entire month I dream about  deep fried bubble gum , riding the largest ferris wheel in North America, and vendors that try to use pressure me into buying millions of  Shammys ,  Vitamixs , and  magical bracelets  that promise to cure my ADD (along with cancer, athlete\u2019s foot, acne, weak balance, and 100 other random things!) Just what is this wonderful day that I speak of? I\u2019m speaking of none other than the  largest State fair  in the United States;  The State Fair Of Texas . That\u2019s right.  The State Fair Of Texas ! I\u2019m not sure when (or why) I became such a fan of the fair (I have to bribe my friends and family to go with me every year) but I am. In fact I even bought a  season pass  a few years ago! (Did you even know the State Fair had a season pass? Me either, until a few years ago.) \ud83d\ude42 My Life Was About To Be Forever Changed This year\u2019s fair was especially awesome since I got to bring Noah with me. In fact this time last year my wife was just a few months away from giving  birth  to Noah, and I remember thinking, \u201cWow, how crazy is it that the next time I\u2019m here it will be with baby Noah.\u201d (Side note: I also had no idea how much our life was about to be forever changed when our little boy would surprise us by being born with a 3rd copy his  21st chromosome  in just a few short weeks. That\u2019s one of the best parts about life, it\u2019s an adventure. You never know what God has in store. I love it!) Deep Fried \u201cAwsomeness\u201d If you\u2019ve never been to the State Fair of Texas it\u2019s hard to explain it. It\u2019s not your  typical fair . For one, they get really into fried food. Like  really  into it. Like  you will die if you eat it  into it. Each year they try to one-up the year before. This year\u2019s big winner was deep fried bubble gum. The year before that; fried Fritos pie. Some of the other  honorable  mentions include; \n Deep Fried Butter \n Deep Fried Banana Split \n Deep Fried Peanut Butter, Jelly, and Banana Sandwich \n Deep Fried Coke \n Deep Fried Latte \n Deep Fried Cookie Dough \n State Fair Tip #232: Only Buy The Blender. In addition to the fried food, there are vendors. Lots and lots of vendors. I\u2019m not going to tell you about the time I  was conned  bought a machine that allowed me to make my own soft drinks at home, or how the Shammy guy only uses diet coke in his demonstration (I\u2019m not kidding, watch him next time\u2026there\u2019s a reason, but I\u201dm not going to spoil it for you.) I think as a former salesman myself I enjoy watching their hustle. It\u2019s sort of fun. Another side note: The coolest thing I\u2019ve ever bought at the fair was a  Vitamix . We\u2019ve actually owned one for several years, and it\u2019s awesome! You can make soup, ice-cream, or even Sonic Ice in it! (The fact that it makes Sonic Ice alone justifies the purchase.) In fact Vitamix is probably the only vendor at the State Fair whose product actually does what it claims to do. It\u2019s seriously awesome! Even The State Fair Of Texas Has Its Bad Days I am however sad to report one Fair Fail this year. Yelp, that\u2019s right. Somedays even the biggest State Fair in the United States has it\u2019s off days,and today was one of them. We wanted to take Noah on the big Ferris Wheel (please don\u2019t write in telling me how un-awesome we are as parents for attempting to take our 10 month old on a Ferris wheel\u2026.that\u2019s just how we roll.) We spent the price of a small car to buy tickets for everyone to ride. We waited in line almost an hour. We were excited. We were pumped. We were ready to ride the Ferris Wheel\u2026.and guess what happened just as we were about to get on? The Ferris Wheel worker screamed out, \u201c SORRY EVERYONE. THE FAIRS CLOSED. \u201c What!! I thought the billion other people in line with us were going to cause a riot. Why didn\u2019t they tell us that ahead of time? Why didn\u2019t they shut down the line an hour before the Fair Closed? Why did they wait until  after we bought tickets  (that you can\u2019t get a refund for, nor could you use anywhere else since the fair was now closed) to tell us that the people waiting in line wouldn\u2019t be able to ride the Ferris Wheel? WHY DID THIS LADY JUST CRUSH MY DREAMS LIKE THAT!??!!  I\u2019ll never know. All I do know is that I left the state fair a little sad that day. I realized that even the State Fair of Texas, in all of its deep fried glory can have an off day. I guess we\u2019ll try again next year. (But seriously, wasn\u2019t that messed up!?) \ud83d\ude42 Bonus Video: One Upset Baby After making today\u2019s video, my wife reminded me of some extra footage I totally forget about! I\u2019m so glad she did, because it\u2019s hilarious! This video starts where the one above ends\u2026with a crowd full of people who just paid for tickets to ride the ferris wheel and waited in a long hot line only to be told that the ferris wheel was closed, and that they had to go home. As you\u2019ll see in this bonus video Noah don\u2019t play when it comes to people messing with his ferris wheel! As I said (and you are about to see) people are  serious  about the ferris wheel at the State Fair of Texas! \ud83d\ude42 Have you ever been to the Sate Fair of Texas? Are you a fan? Yes? No? Why..?

{"date": ",July,10,2011", "body": "I wanted to take my  problogger  friend on a mini-tour of the hospital where my  wife  works (she\u2019s an emergency room\u00a0pediatrician)\u00a0before he headed back home to Atlanta (on a 5 am flight!) the following morning. By the time we made it to the hospital, Noah had fallen to sleep. \u00a0Rather then wake him, John (the  problogger ) pulled his iPhone out and started filming. \u00a0You\u2019ll notice that\u00a0despite\u00a0the screaming baby in the background, and the sound of a toy train, Noah stayed sound asleep. Seriously, this kid sleeps like a baby! By the way, do you remember that famous\u00a0commercial\u00a0from the 80\u2019s where the nice lady helplessly said, \u201cI\u2019ve fallen\u2026..and I can\u2019t get up?\u201d \u00a0Well, when Noah goes to sleep, he sleeps\u2026.and he doesn\u2019t wake up! The rumor is that babies who develop in the womb before  birth  in a house with dogs they get used to noise, and once out of the womb are champion sleepers. \u00a0We have two (sometimes very annoying) barking dogs. \u00a0So maybe there\u2019s some truth to that rumor\u00a0after all. A Stroll Down Memory Lane The Longest Car Ride Ever A few days after bringing Noah home from the hospital we got a phone call from our\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0(yes,\u00a0pediatricians\u00a0have\u00a0pediatricians) asking us to\u00a0immediately\u00a0bring Noah in to discuss something that had come back positive on\u00a0his  newborn screen . \u00a0We bundled up our little one-week old and headed out the door. Even though the\u00a0pediatrician\u2019s\u00a0office was just a few\u00a0miles\u00a0from our house, the car ride seemed to take forever. \u00a0In the car I asked my wife what she thought this could be, and if it could be \u00a0serious. She said it was likely something concerning Noah\u2019s thyroid, which wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal. If only it would have been his thyroid\u2026. Newborn Screen Results Once we made our way back to the examination room our\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0came right in. \u00a0She told us that Noah\u2019s newborn screen had come back positive for a very rare metabolic disorder called\u00a0 Glutaric acidemia , type 1 (GA-1). \u00a0In fact , it was so rare we were told that if Noah were to have both GA-1 and  Down Syndrome , he could be the only kid ever known to have both. Oh, and GA-1 is a  lot  more concerning then a thyroid problem. A lot more. \u00a0(So much so that my wife made me promise to her that I wouldn\u2019t go home and google it. \u00a0She was in luck,\u00a0because\u00a0I had no idea what our\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0had said, let alone how to\u00a0spell\u00a0it!) And\u2026.There\u2019s no cure for GA-1. And\u2026.it was going to take three months to know for sure if our little boy had it. And\u2026.Our one-week old baby would have to be put through a series of  labs , including a DNA sequencing. \u00a0Only then would we know for sure if we (as my wife put it) hit the \u201c genetic\u00a0jackpot .\u201d Great. The next three months were the hardest three months of my entire life. \u00a0Without a doubt. I\u2019m not going to go into all the details of that three-month time span in this\u00a0post. \u00a0If you are\u00a0interested\u00a0in knowing the entire story you can read \u201cNoah\u2019s Story\u201d which I\u2019ll have posted by the end of the week. It turned out that Noah did not have GA-1 (praise God!) and that the\u00a0original\u00a0lab results were a false\u00a0positive. You Never Know What The Future Holds When Abbie walked out of work on her last day before\u00a0beginning\u00a0her maternity leave she jokingly posted a picture of the hospital where she\u00a0works\u00a0on her Facebook with the caption, \u201cGoodbye hospital, I won\u2019t be seeing you for another 12 weeks.\u201d Little did she know that she\u2019d be back at that same hospital much sooner than 12 weeks\u2026.. Only she wouldn\u2019t be\u00a0coming in to see\u00a0patients. The\u00a0hospital\u00a0where Abbie works is home to one of the only geneticist offices in the metroplex, and we had to bring our little Noah in to get his DNA sequenced. Never in a million years would we had ever thought we\u2019d be brining our little baby in to see a geneticist. \u00a0Or to have his DNA sequenced. \u00a0(I still don\u2019t even know what that means.) Taking this video reminded me of how scared we were during those three months. \u00a0Here we were trying to wrap our minds around  Down Syndrome , and then we were forced to deal with the\u00a0possibility\u00a0of our son having\u00a0Glutaric acidemia on top of that! \u00a0It was scary. We learned a very valuable lesson during those three months\u2026.we\u00a0learned\u00a0that  God is bigger then your biggest fear.  \u00a0Seriously. All of the hugs, cards, candies, and kisses were nice\u2026.but they couldn\u2019t comfort our soul. \u00a0Chocolates\u00a0may taste great, but they can\u2019t help you sleep. The Lord gave us a peace that was beyond anyone\u2019s understanding. \u00a0Our worry was replaced with joy. \u00a0Our fear was replaced with trust. And God got us through it. \u00a0He really did. \u00a0It was amazing! I\u2019m not sure what you are going through today. If it\u2019s fear, worry,\u00a0anxiety, or all the rest\u2026but God is able. \u00a0He really, really is. \u00a0You, and I won\u2019t ever know what tomorrow holds \u00a0(I know that more than ever now) but I do know what God holds\u2026\u2026the whole world\u2026.in His very hands.

Which basically means one of two things: \n I\u2019m friends with a lot of geniuses, or \n ________ I\u2019ll let you fill in the blank. \ud83d\ude42 \n Either way my friend John is one of the  geekiest \u00a0/ crazy-smartest\u00a0people I know. Want proof? He recently wrote about a project he\u2019s working on that involves  smuggling Bibles  into\u00a0foreign\u00a0countries\u00a0on small\u00a0microchips. See, I told you so. \ud83d\ude42 (Oh, and I did mention he also makes really  awesome birthday cakes !) John\u2019s also one of the first people I called when I found out Noah was  born with Down\u00a0syndrome . I\u00a0consider him a great friend and enjoy getting to hang out with him and his equally as awesome family. The Blessing Of Childhood Innocence John\u2019s son Charlie is a few years older than Noah, doesn\u2019t haven\u2019t  Down syndrome , and\u00a0completely\u00a0 adores our son . It\u2019s so much fun watching them play\u00a0together. As I was watching these two kid-o\u2019s play today it made me think about how blessed Noah is to have a friend like Charlie in his life.\u00a0I know that Charlie is only a toddler and doesn\u2019t have any idea that our son has Down syndrome, or any idea that Noah is any  different  than any other of his play friends. But today there was no comparing, no misunderstanding, no confusion, no\u00a0awaked\u00a0moments\u2026.just two little boys playing and having fun. To my friend\u2019s 3 year old son, Noah was just Noah. The Fading Of Childhood Innocence But this will change one day. One day Charlie will begin to wonder why Noah is  different . Charlie will begin to ask questions. Childhood\u00a0innocence\u00a0will fade. This doesn\u2019t\u00a0always have to be a bad thing. In fact it can actually be a good thing. Heres why: Thankfully I know John and his wife well enough to know they will handle Charley\u2019s questions well. They will  teach  their son about Down syndrome. They\u2019ll  teach  their son to  love  and  respect , and  include  people that are different than he is. And Charlie (hopefully) in turn will help other people (who may not have parents like he does) to do the same as he grows up and goes into the world. Yelp, children like Charlie can grow up and change the world. The Charlie\u2019s of the world grow up helping others to exchange\u00a0cycles of\u00a0ignorance\u00a0with\u00a0cycles\u00a0of\u00a0acceptance. I like that. Childhood\u00a0Innocence\u00a0Fades, But Friendship Doesn\u2019t Have To I really hope Charlie and Noah stay friends as they get older. I hope that there are lots more days where Charlie and Noah just play. Just have fun. Days like today where Noah isn\u2019t treated as  the   poor little kid with Down syndrome , but as just a\u00a0regular\u00a0little boy who likes playing with wooden cookies just as much as the next kid. I hope one day Charlie calls Noah up and asks him to go to the movies, or to the high school football game, or to come over and just hang out. I hope\u00a0Charlie\u00a0continues\u00a0to look more at what he and Noah have in common than what he and Noah have  in different . I hope Charlie always sees Noah not as being \u2018 disabled \u2018 but as being able. \u00a0 Very, very able. I hope Noah has lots more friends like Charlie in his life. Lots more friends who see him as a peer. Friends who love him, accept him, and show him that he is valued. That he is able. That Down syndrome isn\u2019t  that  big of a deal. I hope every person born with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0has a friend like\u00a0Charlie. Does your child have a\u00a0Charlie\u00a0in\u00a0their\u00a0life? \u00a0Take a second to leave a comment below and tell me about one of your child\u2019s \u2018Charlie\u2019s.\u201d ", "outgoing_links": ["http://johndyer.name/", "http://donteatthefruit.com/2012/02/powerful-secure-bible-software-for-closed-countries-and-you/"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/child-down-syndrome-friend/", "title": "I Hope Every Child With Down Syndrome Has A Friend Like Charlie"},
{"date": ",April,3,2012", "body": "In 2007 the  American Congress of\u00a0Obstetricians\u00a0and Gynecologists  (ACOG) changed it\u2019s guidelines to recommend  fetal chromosomal screening  be offered to  all\u00a0pregnant\u00a0women  regardless of age\u00a0because\u00a0of new\u00a0 noninvasive ,  low-risk  screening tests. (By the way, here\u2019s  25,000 reasons why you shouldn\u2019t worry about the results of a Down syndrome screening test .) When we\u00a0received the news that our son, Noah, was\u00a0 born with Down syndrome \u00a0(we didn\u2019t have a\u00a0prenatal\u00a0diagnosis)\u00a0one of the first things my wife and I tried to do was figure out a way to take the pressure (and\u00a0awkwardness) off our friends and family by sending out a\u00a0\u201cspoiler-alert\u201d\u00a0blog post. I think it helped break the ice, and helped our friends know it was \u2018ok\u2019 to talk to us about the news of our son\u2019s\u00a0 extra 21st\u00a0chromosome . Do you know what you would say to a\u00a0friend\u00a0who has just\u00a0received\u00a0a Down syndrome diagnosis? One of the effects of the recent changes in the ACOG\u2019s\u00a0guidelines\u00a0is that more and more women will\u00a0receive\u00a0a  Down syndrome diagnosis . In fact, you may have had a\u00a0 prenatal\u00a0 Down syndrome diagnosis yourself, or known someone who has. Our  Facebook page  is filled with thousands of parents who have\u00a0received\u00a0a Down syndrome diagnosis\u00a0themselves. And I wanted them to help me come up with a list of things one might say to someone who just received a Down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis,\u00a0so I asked them the following\u00a0question: What would you say to someone who just\u00a0received\u00a0a Down syndrome diagnosis? What I got in return was over 300 suggestions of things to say to someone who just found out their little baby will be born (or was born) with Down syndrome. I\u2019m posting all of the comments just as they were\u00a0submitted, and you\u2019ll see was quite a\u00a0variety\u00a0of\u00a0responses. I hope you find the list\u00a0encouraging, helpful, and hopeful! By the way, be sure to leave your email in the box below and stay up to date with our newest posts.

Not the trip you might have wanted\u2026.but it will be the best trip you will EVER go on!!! \n Denise: Every time that you look into his/her eyes and you see his/her HUGE smile everything in the world goes away and your heart melts into a sea of love and when you hug your child you will be overwhelmed with love, joy, peace, comfort and pride that you have that angel!

Yes it is different, yes it is challenging, yes it is rewarding.. yes my little dude is the sun that shines in our house. But all of that comes in time.. it comes with educating myself.. with leaving my expectations behind without leading by my own selfish perceptions..giving up a bit of control and sacrificing a whole lot at times. But that is what being a parent is after all. I would seek to arm that person with information and positive examples of what Down syndrome is. \n Jenelle: he (she)\u2019s perfect! \n Stacy: God shares his blessings with us in many different ways! \n Wesley: what a wonderful experience you about to begin. \n Diane: Congratulations!

This child will be a blessing like all your current and/or future children ! Labels are for soup cans \ud83d\ude09 \n Stacy: Congratulations! You are about to experience more Love than you ever thought possible! \n Justin: go ahead and mourn that idea you had of your baby, its necessary. Don\u2019t feel guilty. Then look at your baby as a baby and not a down syndrome baby. The sooner you can look at them as who they are and not a catagory the more you will get to know them. I can\u2019t tell you how many days pass and Ella\u2019s diagnoses never crosses my mind.. Even with therapist and doc appts I still don\u2019t think of her DS. Usually someone has to say it then I\u2019m like of yea she does have DS. Just remember your baby is a person first. And Pray a lot! \n Deborah: Welcome to Holland.

It will be absolutely amazing!!! \n Tregg: Its good to see, judging by the responses here, that I was not the only one caring around a lot of guilt for my sense of loss immediately after my daughter\u2019s diagnosis. That was over 2 years ago and I still feel ashamed of how I felt that day. \n Lora: I know you don\u2019t believe this, but trust me, one day you WILL find yourself saying \u201cit\u2019s only Down syndrome\u201d. \n Patricia: It\u2019s okay.

The \u201corgs\u201d are more helpful/educational and come see us online at www.noahsdad.com. Meet my son Kellan\u2026 \n Ellyn: My OBGYN said the best thing to us and he was SO right! He said we would find this to be a blessing for our family. Our son has blessed our lives in so many ways and we wouldn\u2019t change him! \n Mark: Welcome to happiness. \n Kara: Shall Congratulations on winning the lottery!! :)) \n Denise: I wish I had had someone who had some good advice for us when I got the prenatal diagnosis that our baby boy Avery has Down syndrome. It was the scariest time of my life\u2026worrying about the unknown! We got the diagnosis just over halfway throug my pregnancy & I was absolutely terrified! Avery is now 15 1/2 months old, absolutely beautiful in every way, super smart & the joy of our lives\u2026& I couldn\u2019t imagine another second of my life without him! I still get so upset when people find out he has Down syndrome & say \u201coh sorry\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s too\u201d bad! Yes\u2026I\u2019m sorry the aren\u2019t lucky enough to have been blessed with a child like him!

He/she will be a baby and need live and everything a typical baby would. Expect cycles of being happy and mourning the loss of your dreams for a typical child. It may come in waves. Know that it WILL get better and you\u2019ll find sometimes you may wish all your kids had down syndrome because they can be so sweet/easy to be around. Try not to idealize or feel guilty bc of those who do. Surround yourself with friends who\u2019ve been there to encourage you. \n Cindy: Congratulations! \n Laura: Don\u2019t worry \u2013 everything will be A-OK! \n Jeanine: CONGRATULATIONS!!!:)) \n Delayna: \u00a0Congratulations!

You are one of the lucky ones! \n Amy: Congrats! take a deep breath and everything will be awesome it will give you a whole new prospective on life \n Kari: I haven\u2019t met my baby yet, but the best piece of advice I have came from my genetic counselor. This is especially important for a first-time parent like myself. Your baby is more like other babies than not. Don\u2019t overwhelm yourself with all the information out there about Down Syndrome right from the start. Read your baby books first! Celebrate your pregnancy. And by realizing that this is not the worst thing that could happen and that you will love your baby no matter what, stay positive \u2013 and others will follow your lead. \n Bonnie: Oh how exciting\u2026..you are in for the most blessed life ever!!! Yes, there will be good and bad days ahead but it is true with any child\u2026.you will learn so much from this child and your lives will be so much richer!! Place this precious one that God has given you charge of in HIS hands\u2026.Jeremiah 29:11 For I know the plans I have for you,\u201d declares the LORD, \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. \n Jennifer: Let\u2019s get learning so we are ready for your amazing baby! \n Cortney: What an honor, you get to be the parents of one of the most pure human beings you will ever know! \n Jenna: Congratulations u were chosen for a special reason and get ready cause it\u2019s a wild ride:) \n Courtney: Welcome to the way life should be! This child is going to overload your heart with love & pride! \n Christine: The same thing that was said to me when our son was born (unexpectedly with DS): \u201cDo you realize how blessed you are?? God has chosen YOU to take care of one of His most special angels here on Earth. The joy that lies ahead for you is unimaginable.\u201d Didn\u2019t believe it at that moment but I stand here \u2013 6 years later \u2013 and say \u201cAmen! Thank you, Lord for the blessing of my son!\u201d He is like having a glimpse of Heaven here on earth. \n Christopher: You will never how lucky you are! Only special people are chosen to have special children!!! \n Jennifer: Congrats! You just hit the lottery of love! \n Heather: Welcome to the family! Although you may be feeling scared, angry, hurt, sad, and confused, YOU WILL BE OK. Not only will you be ok, you will soon find out that this is exciting, joyful, and one of the most amazing experiences you will ever have. So don\u2019t waste to much time being upset, I did and I regret it \ud83d\ude42 \n Lorrie: You are so blessed! \n Amy: I think the worst thing that I was told and have read many times is \u201cit was just a fluke.\u201d cause who wants to hear that their baby is a fluke?? It made me feel so guilty!! I don\u2019t believe in accidents and I know that no one, no matter their diagnosis is a fluke! Every person is beautifully and wonderfully made. I wouldn\u2019t change anything about my little guy or my other kids for that matter. And yes, it really is just down syndrome. Every single one of us has our challenges and special needs, no one is exempt. Our children our awesome and made perfectly! \n Shelly: \u200e\u201dCALL ME!\u201d \n Amy: Ditto on Jeremiah 29:11! \n Carol: Have you seen Noah? He\u2019s so friggen\u2019 cute! \n Chasity: I know you are scared and a little sad but believe me when I say EVERYTHING will be OK!!! You will love your baby so much! When that baby smiles up at you, you will know \u201cI LOVE MY BABY\u201d. \n Melissa: Psalm 138:14. \u201d I will praise You for I am fearfully and wonderfully made!!!!\u201d \u00a0God doesn\u2019t make mistakes. This is a blessing not a punishment. Wait until you see how much richer your life is about to become! \n Renee: Love that baby as you would any other, don\u2019t focus on the diagnosis, meet other parents with children with down syndrome and get 1st hand knowledge and please know that people with down syndrome are more like people with out down syndrome than they are different. I would also say congrats & I\u2019m here if you need guidance and support. \n Julie: This scenario happened to me last yr\u2026.I said \u201cCongratulations! Even though it may not feel this way now, your life is about to change for the better.\u201d She said I was the only one who wished her a congratulations and she was so deeply touched by my gesture. A special moment I will never forget \ud83d\ude42 \n Ange: Remember first and foremost that you are having a beautiful unique baby, feelings of grief,despair,anger,loss are natural\u2026and medical staff often paint a negative picture but be brave and make an informed decision regarding your pregnancy, talk to another parent and/or find a local support group. And from a mum who has walked the path of having a prenatal diagnosis\u2026my son changed my life in the most profound way before he was even born and now at almost 2 years old he amazes us every day, if only every family had a child with Down syndrome\u2026we are fortunate. \n Melissa: Psalm 139:14 not 138. Ahhh typing from an iPhone! \n Luz: God knows what He is doing, trust Him with all your heart. \u00a0When I knew Ariel had ds before he was born I felt lonely and sad but I loved the Lord and decided to accept His will. God has never failed us, He promised to provide for Ariel\u2019s needs and it has been that way since. God uses Ariel to bless me and all who surround him. Just trust Him, your son/daughter will fill your life with love and miracles. \n Ana: First, congratulations! You\u2019re goingt to have a baby and you\u2019 ve to love him/her the same you would do without the extra chromosome. And second, expect the unexpected\u2026 Nobody knows what are going to do your child! \n Audrey: Hang on and welcome to the ride of your life. Fun, scary, frustrating, but so worth it. I have been on this ride for almost twenty years and not regretted a single moment. \n Bernadette: Congratulations you are going to have a gorgeous Baby! Yes! Really! a Baby, an eating, crying, smiling, sleeping, growing Baby! The rest of the stuff could come with any baby but you know, so take the opportunity to get to know your baby before he comes. A prenatal ultrasound of his heart and bowels and Dopla will tell you loads. Then plan his perfect birth just as you would your other babies, and enjoy every wonderful blessed amazing moment. When he comes you will want to bond and keep him maybe even more precious b\u2019cos he is and you may need extra time as a family. Take it is your right and the most precious time for you all. Don\u2019t let the hospital steal it. I thank God I knew early, it nearly killed my husband. If we hadn\u2019t had that bonding time he would not have accepted our son. I am blessed with 4 children x \n Stephanie: Don\u2019t freak out!!!! You\u2019ve been given a gift that will bring you joy like you have never known before! Above all protect him/her until they are born, then hold your child like the treasure they are. And never let them go! \n Joan: God sents us these angels for a reason.When you see the happiness that shines from their eyes you know why.We thank God for giving us our angel. \n Kevin: Congrats! You are about to become parents of amazing child. If you have other children, I recommend this buying this book \u201cWe\u2019ll Paint the Octopus Red\u201d by Stephanie Stuve-Bodeen. \n Lori: Congratulations. You have been chosen to be the parent of a very special an unique child. You will learn many things about life from this little miracle. \n Laura: God is in control! \n Lori: I would first tell them Congratulations! And how wonderful it is to have a Down Syndrome child! Then I would advise them on the books I read, and tell them to reach out to their local Down syndrome organization to talk with other parents. \n Liz: CONGRATS!!! These pip-squeaks ROCK!! It\u2019s like winning the lotto for special kiddos : \n Diana: chosen \n Regina: Congratulations! Don\u2019t be sad. Enjoy your baby! \n Antonia: Enjoy your little blessing :o) (why say anything different than if their child didn\u2019t have down syndrome) \n Jennifer: I would congratulate them and encourage them to let themselves feel whatever it is they are feeling\u2026.they\u2019re entitled to take some time to wrap their heads around all of it\u2026learn what it means. But then I would advise them to not let their fears of the unknown take away from their joy in the present. I\u2019d tell them my biggest regret was wasting a single minute being sad in the beginning instead of just soaking up and enjoying every minute with my baby. \n Anisha: WELCOME TO HOLLAND\u2026\u2026. I would give them the poem.. tell them the emotions they feel are ok.. it does not mean that they are bad people and they don\u2019t love their baby\u2026. I would also tell them to take the time they needed to grieve as we all did some may not admit to it but you know you all did have a moment even if it was a single moment that you felt like your heart sank to your stomach\u2026. then I would say the best is yet to come\u2026. and do not tell your child they have DS and they just might surprise you how they are just like a \u201ctypical\u201d child they just have to work a lil harder and you have to push them a lil harder but it is well worth it when they first say momma\u2026 when they take their first step\u2026. and welcome to the group.. there is so much love and support in the world of Down syndrome you will never be alone you will never have no one to talk to and you will never have questions or concerns go un answered as long as you ask\u2026..and welcome to the rest of your life being filled so much love and joy \ud83d\ude42 \n Linda: hope \n Kim: you said would I would it is great advise I do tell parents they will have a normal a different normal than you thought but a normal just the same but to me the grieving part is very important so they know it\u2019s ok to feel that way than you will feel more joy than you think possible!! Lexi is the joy of our family I can not imagine life without her in it!!! \n De-Anne: Dont be afraid, your baby is a product of you still, with a bit more sugar thrown in \ud83d\ude00 \n Anisha: Just don\u2019t forget that you have to give the new parents some time and space give them the resources they need and let them know you are there\u2026.. but don\u2019t be to pushy in the beginning it really is a lot to take in.. give them a few days before you reach out to them again and just let them know that you have material that will help answer questions and pre peace them for the journey they are about to embark on. \n Lisa: \u200e\u201dI know this AWESOME website you can check out\u2026\u201d \ud83d\ude42 \n Mattie: You are more blessed than you know!! What an honor it is that God chose you to take care of this amazing life. He/She will not only change your life for the better, but everyone else who will come in contact with him/her. God never makes mistakes. \u201cI praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full.\u201d ~ Psalm 139:14 \n Katie: Congratulations! \n Stephanie: congratulations\u2013you are about to know love and blessings beyond measure! \n Cathy: It\u2019s All Good! \n Cheri: One day you are going to realize that you are one of the lucky ones. My daughter is nine now and I am so thankful that God chose us to raise her! She affects EVERYONE she meets! We are so lucky to have her in our family!! Don\u2019t worry! \n Jeannie: WOW!!! Are you ready for all the Love!!!! \n Kimberly: I wouldn\u2019t need to say anything, I would just bring my Noah and they would see how WONDERFUL their life was about to become!! \ud83d\ude42 \n Ellie: Congratulations! You are lucky to have this baby. Someone actually said this to me, instead of saying how lucky this baby will be to have you. She was absolutely right, I was! \n Leslie: Tests don\u2019t determine level of functioning. Learn everything about hypothyroidism, subclinical hypothyroidism, and T3 hormone you can. Don\u2019t accept the words \u201cThat is just Down\u2019s.\u201d You are probably grieving a stereotype and you will find that your baby is far from what you grieved. Placing stereotypical expectations sells God and your child short. You will be amazed at what they both can accomplish. \n Wendy: Before a genetic counselor gives you their grim prognosis, arrange to meet a child with Trisomy 21 and you will see how blessed you are to be one of the chosen ones. \n Libby: congratulations! I\u2019m so excited for you!!! It really is an amazing journey and i love being on it!!! xx \n Mishayla: Congratulations!!! That was something that was not said to Tony and I!! \n Mike: Congratulations, you have won the jackpot. \n Meredith: I would tell them that their baby is a wonderful little blessing and that they are on the most wonderful and amazing journey. Just make sure to keep God in the driver\u2019s seat! \n Donna: You will have highs & lows; will grieve & rejoice; will laugh & cry! I am only the great-grandmother of a child with down syndrome but I cannot imagine our life without her! It won\u2019t always be easy; but will be a blessing that you could not have dreamt of before your baby arrived!! \n Wanda: believe that God has a purpose for your child.Love your child no matter \u2026Isn\u2019t Noah adorable \n Samantha: Congratulations you have a beautiful baby, you are about to meet the one person in your life that will change your heart to a thousand times bigger, show you Gods presence in every tiny wonder and bless you with so much joy & love you feel as though You\u2019l burst. Please try not to feel too sorry for those that don\u2019t \u2018see\u2019 you can introduce them to your little blessing & I guarantee he/she will change their lives forever too! because your babies love & joy of life, well it\u2019s contagious & once you get your eye\u2019s opened like that, you get to keep it with you all of your life. I would then explain the medical side & express that if it takes that extra special gene I think it should be renamed \u2018Up Syndrome\u2019 \ud83d\ude42 \n Sarah: Congrats, every you feel is normal, just because your baby isn\u2019t the \u2018average\u2019 baby you were expecting but the baby will eventually do everything the same as any other \u2018average\u2019 baby can it will just take that little bit longer to get there. I would offer as much support as I could, I would answer any questions they had honestly, and show them that having down syndrome in your life is not a death sentance. Just because you had one road mapped out for your child dosnt mean that you can\u2019t add a few speed traps, speed bumps and road works along the way, but the end destination will eventually be the same \n Katie: WELCOME TO HOLLAND!!! \n Gabrielle: CONGRATULATIONS on your little angel!! \u2665 \n Darla: AWSOME!! God has just blessed another family with another ANGEL, wow you are so fortunate to have been chosen to experience so many joyful moments too such a wonderful perfection of Love , laughter, and yes lots of new beginnings, so happy for you.. Congratualations!!! \n Becky: \u200e\u201dHave fun with your little one!\u201d This was one of the most refreshing things we heard after our Gabby was born. \ud83d\ude42 \n Allison: Try not to worry, you are embarking on the most incredible journey, enjoy every minute! \n Kylieand: We had a prenatal diagnosis and we were very happy and looking forward to meeting our precious little man. All we wanted was for people to share our joy and excitement (which most did) \ud83d\ude42 \n Stacey: So many doors have been opened because of other children/adults with Down\u2019s that I can\u2019t wait to see how many doors your angel opens! Congratulations on your bundle of love and joy a true gift from above! \n Kelly: WooHoo!\u00a0(And I\u2019m serious\u2026I love them so much!!! \n Kristina: You can do this!! Accept that the journey with this baby will be different and wonderful!! \n Kelley: \u00a0I would say congratulations and welcome to the elite club. You may feel alone, but you are not. Do not feel guilty for being upset, worried, etc. because we\u2019ve all been there (whether pretnatal diagnosis or at birth). Enjoy every moment of your pregnancy because you will miss it \ud83d\ude42 You will get more support than you expect and will be surprised by many wonderful people along your journey.

It is okay to feel the way you are feeling, and trust me when I say everything will be okay! \ud83d\ude42 \n Angela: Congratulations! \n Tammy: I would advise you to first grieve the child you had imagined and then thank God for the blessing of this special child who will bring you more joy than you ever thought possible. \n Raising Riley: Children with down syndrome can do anything a typical child can do, it just may take longer and it may happen differently, don\u2019t research until you\u2019ve had a chance to adjust, visit Noah\u2019s Dad blog and wonderful FB page and\u2026ENJOY YOUR BABY! \n Kristin: There is nothing to \u201cmourn\u201d. These babies are just like every other baby..they just have a little something extra! \n Jaci: Its the best \u201cworst\u201d thing ever!! Its ok to be sad and feel a loss\u2026we all did\u2026..but you\u2019ll get past that when u see how fearfully and wonderfully made ur lil miracle is! \n Amber: don\u2019t be scared. this baby will be the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to you, i promise, because he/she is an angel in disguise. you\u2019ve been given the gift of being able to see the world in a brand new and beautiful way. \n Cathy: Congratulations!!

She said, \u201cRejoice with her, for a baby has been born! Cry with her, because life will be different than she expected and there is (and needs to be) mourning of the expectations.\u201d I thought those were very wise words. \n Marta: see your child, always. not the down syndrome. \n Kirsten: Everything\u2019s going to be alright! Just prepare for a baby! \n Grace: You are about to bring an amazing child into the world. Can I babysit? \n Bruce: Blessing \n Wendy: The sun will rise again and this time it will be so much brighter! You are blessed! \n Charlene: Don\u2019t panic, it will be okay!

It\u2019s hard work, but it is so worth the effort! \n Elizabeth Eddings: I\u2019m a grandmother of a 3 month old DS baby boy. I was divastated, with emotions that is hard to decribe. We all morn in diferent ways. Something would be wrong if we did not. Father and Mother will have their own emotions, feeling like this is a bad dream. Not having control and knowing what to expect. Living Moment by moment will be away of life for awhile.Cry, Cry, Be Upset, You may queston God. But God is always with you. You will make it\u2026Read a little enough to know about SD. My Daughter in law and I felt it was dicouraging and depressing learning the challenges this child may or may not have. You will really not know until baby is born.

Photo of your sweetie. : ) \n Margaret McCormick Owen: I would say that the baby will change your life just like any other child. There will be hard times and joyous times again just like any other child. Raising our son has been hard work and our concern and care for him will go on for the rest of his life. I have two other sons that I can say the same about. Jesse has brought a dimension to our lives that we never had before and I cannot remember life without him. \n Libby Holmes: Awesome \n Lisa Landry Crochet; Right now life seems unfair\u2026.you will realize real soon you are the fortunate one who gets to look at life through an amazing window.I feel so honored to have this window to look through. \n Joy Schwarting: Not gonna lie times will be tough, but the good def. outweigh the bad!

To question \u2018why me?\u2019. But please remember, it is always darkest before dawn. It does get better. I promise you. The sun will shine again for you. The world will continue to spin.

{"date": ",April,5,2012", "body": "We are blown away by all that Noah is\u00a0 accomplishing . Since we take and post so many\u00a0 videos \u00a0of our son who was born with Down syndrome, you can really see that every week something new and exciting is happening. It\u2019s so fun to watch him grow and develop. 2 Reasons Playing Peek-A-Boo Helps Babies Born With Down Syndrome Peekaboo is one of the first games a child learns to  play . Not only is it fun, but it also shows a significant  milestone  for their cognitive development. It is highly entertaining for both parents and children. In fact, I would even say it is more fun for the parents in this house, as we can\u2019t stop playing. Peekaboo Strengths Their Core Muscles We have been working on Noah  sitting up  by himself. It has been pretty entertaining during the days around this video as we would just find Noah  sitting up by himself . We have no idea how he got there, but he GOT THERE \ud83d\ude42 It is pretty funny to walk up on the pack \u2018n play or his crib and just see him sitting there very proud of himself. \u00a0We make sure to cheer him on in his accomplishments even if we can\u2019t see them first hand yet. \u00a0 If you have been following us for awhile, you know we work on Noah\u2019s  core  in various ways, either using the  exercise ball ,  a swing , and just plain old  sit ups . Our therapist believe that the majority of developmental milestones come from a strong core including both gross and  fine motor skills , even eating. We found a great way to encourage our son to do sit ups, in a very\u00a0unexpected\u00a0way;  playing peek-a-boo!  As you can see in today\u2019s video Noah will sit up from almost laying down to grab our hands and expose our face. Everyone finds it hilarious\u2026..except maybe his abs. \ud83d\ude42 Object Permanence Peek-a-boo actually is a significant  cognitive milestone  in that your child has figured out  object permanence. Hmmm\u2026what does that mean?Well, it means that even though an object is  hidden  they know it is actually still  there . Prior to this milestone if an object (including you) was out of sight they no longer thought it existed. Now your child is going to realize you are still present when you leave the room, or when you hide your face from their view. Pretty cool, huh? Piaget\u2019s Theory Of Cognitive Development Object permanence is one of the most important parts of our first stage of development that Piaget calls the sensorimotor stage which lasts until about 2 years old. \u00a0This theory by swiss\u00a0developmental\u00a0psychologist\u00a0 Jean Piaget \u00a0has various stages. Piaget\u00a0thinks that at about 9 months a child realizes that things they can\u2019t see still exist. He stated that a child goes about 6 stages during the sensorimotor development stage and in a brief summary these are: \n Do not realize objects exist \n Noticing an object and following it \n Finding an object when it is partially hidden \n Finding an object it when it is completely hidden \n Finding an object when it is hid multiple times \n Finding an object hidden within another object, and using problem solving to figure out where an item might be. \n This theory is being challenged as other studies show that they believe that even  younger babies  have an understanding of object permanence but were unable to do the activities to expose their knowledge, such as pulling off a blanket. Some believe they have this ability even at birth! Regardless of which theory you think is correct the bottom line is that playing peek a boo with your son or\u00a0daughter\u00a0is tons of fun! In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure we could play this simple game with our son all day long. What games are your children playing right now? At what age did your baby start playing peek-a-boo, and where you as entertained with your baby playing peek-a-boo as we were?

{"date": ",July,10,2011", "body": "As much fun as I have have creating these daily one minute videos of our son, I have to admit it\u2019s not always easy. My goal is to record, and post, a video every single day. But sometimes the day just simply runs out before I get a chance to even record the video (much less edit, upload, and post.) That\u2019s what happened today. I had actually planned on recording our little guy playing on his new Rody exercise horse. But once my wife got home from work, and we had some dinner, Noah was down for the count. (And my wife followed closely behind.) They say you\u2019re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby (or sleeping wife) so I didn\u2019t. However I still wanted to be sure I captured some footage from today, so I scratched the horse idea, and worked with what I had (which actually turned out to be as equally adorable.) I pulled out the Nikon and recorded something that I doubt anyone would ever be interested in watching unless it involved a cute, little baby. Our little guy sleeping. That\u2019s it. Just a sleeping baby. (But a really  cute  sleeping baby.) Fatherhood Has Taught Me How To Be A Ninja I think I could just and watch this little boy sleep forever. One of the best parts of my day happens right before I head to seep (which is often very late.) I quietly tip-toe into Noah\u2019s room, kneel down beside his crib and pray over him. Kiss him. And just stay there for a little while watching him sleep. I sometimes place my hand over his skittle sized heart and just feel it beat. Or I\u2019ll lean in very close so that I can hear his tiny little lungs breathing in and out. Or I simply just hold his hand. \u2014\u00a0Most of the time I do all of the above. I just kneel there in that nursrey that my wife and I painted\u00a0together\u00a0months before Noah was born, amazed. Simply Amazed. Amazed at God\u2019s unique ability to create. Amazed that God would allow me to be the father to this preious little boy. Amazed that I am married to the most amazing wife, mom, doctor, daughter, friend, ever. Amazed that God has allowed my life to turn out better then I could have ever dreamed of. Amazed by His grace. It\u2019s overwhelming. It\u2019s almost been seven months since Noah was born and this whole thing still seems sureal to me. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m a dad. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m a dad to a little boy who has  Down Syndrome . I can\u2019t believe how unbelivably incredible it is to be a dad to a little boy who has Down Syndrome. (I assume it\u2019d be as eqauly incredible to be a dad to a little boy (or girl) without Down Syndrome. But I wouldn\u2019t know. Noah is our first child, so my only presepcitve on fatherhood is through the lenses of being Noah\u2019s Dad\u2026.And it\u2019s an awesome view!) When Noah was first born I was worried that our life would never be normal again. I was wrong. We have a new normal\u2026.And I\u2019m ok with that. Very  ok with that. What about you? Do you have any special\u00a0moments\u00a0you like to share with your little (or not so little) ones? \u00a0What\u2019s one of your favorite times of the day with your children?

{"date": ",July,11,2011", "body": "A few weeks ago Noah\u2019s physical\u00a0therapist\u00a0started using a small  inflatable elephant \u00a0to help him\u00a0develop\u00a0the core\u00a0strength required to  sit up  on his own. Even though it looked like a toy, it turns out it wasn\u2019t. It was actually an\u00a0expensive\u00a0therapy\u00a0tool that can only purchased from a medical supply company. YIKES! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I wanted to get buy one in order to help our little boy develop the\u00a0 core\u00a0strength \u00a0needed so that he could\u00a0 sit up on his own , but before\u00a0we shelled out the\u00a0cash\u00a0I wanted to see if there was\u00a0perhaps a\u00a0cheaper\u00a0alternative. The Rody Horse Is A Great Physical\u00a0Therapy\u00a0Tool After doing some\u00a0research\u00a0I found out that a lot of parents used (and were very happy) the  Inflatable Rody Horse .\u00a0So I figured why not. We\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Rody horse from Amazon, and once it arrived\u00a0(in just two days. Thanks Amazon\u00a0Prime!) \u00a0and set up took all of about five minutes. Since it was an \u201cinflatable\u201d horse I was a bit concerned\u00a0that I might have to blow it up. (Anyone who has ever blown up balloons for a little kid\u2019s birthday party knows how un-fun that can be.) Inflating the Rody horse required an air pump (we used a\u00a0bicycle\u00a0pump.) \u00a0Since the Rody horse is manufactured in Italy, inflating it also required the use of an included special adaptor. I\u2019m glad they included the adaptor\u00a0because\u00a0it wouldn\u2019t have been fun trying to track one \u00a0down in America. Once aired up, it was all ready to go. I put Noah on it, and it about three minutes they had become good friends. In fact it only took about four minutes for Noah to feel comfortable enough with Mr. Rody to eat his ears! \ud83d\ude42 Thankfully the plastic seems to be a very child-proof, and looks like it won\u2019t tear easily. \u00a0The box actually says the Rody horse will support up to 400 pounds\u2026now that would really be something to see! The neck of the horse prevents Noah from\u00a0sliding\u00a0forward (which helps his development) and the ears of the horse allow him to grab hold so that we can find (and keep) his balance. I think the  inflatable Rody horse  would be a great purchase for any parent who is\u00a0interested\u00a0in helping their child develop core\u00a0strength and\u00a0ultimately reaching their baby  milestones ! \u00a0We\u2019ve only had it a few days, but so far it gets two thumbs up. Additionally, they make a  base  for the\u00a0Rody horse that turns it into a rocking horse. \u00a0We don\u2019t have it, but it seems like a nice add on. If you have any questions about it, feel free to  contact  us, and we\u2019ll be glad to help in any way we can. Noah Yams It Up! Noah\u2019s been on a roll\u00a0lately\u00a0with food. \u00a0First cereal, then green beans, then a banana, then some squash, and today\u2026..a yam! He\u2019s also\u00a0snaked on a few other things\u2026like a bottle\u2026.a squash\u2026a yam\u2026.and you know, his blanket\u2026a toy\u2026his feet! This kid will eat anything. ) No matter what he is eating (or doing) I know one thing\u2026.he sure looks cute doing it!

In fact in addition to pumpkins stacked to the sky everywhere you looked, they had four classic storybook houses built entirely from pumpkins like the one below. I don\u2019t even want to think about how long it took to construct all of the different pumpkin castles on display throughout the arboretum. \u00a0Yikes! We tried to snap some some fun pictures of Noah sitting on top of a huge pile of pumpkins, but his  core  isn\u2019t strong enough yet for him to  sit up  on his own. \u00a0It\u2019s all good though, Noah has a  great physical therapist , and I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long before he\u2019s sitting, crawling, and playing on top of everything. \ud83d\ude42 Our friends have a adorable son, Ebenezer, who really enjoyed the climbing on top of the huge piles of pumpkins \u00a0So we let him climb on top, and I snapped some pictures\u2026by the way, doesn\u2019t Ebenezer have some beautiful eyes! \u00a0(Our friends also have a little girl on the way as well that we can\u2019t wait to meet!( As we were walking around we found this fun frog that sprayed water out of its mouth\u2026so being the wacky dad that I am I decided to let baby Noah play on it\u2026..turns out he liked it\u2026a lot! \u00a0It was so much fun watching the joy on Noah\u2019s face as he splashed around in the water.

{"date": ",August,3,2011", "body": "I hated road trips when I was a kid. My brother and I would frequently draw a line across the middle of the car so that we wouldn\u2019t annoy each other\u2026that didn\u2019t really work. I remember specifically a time when he just reached over and put gum in my hair. Really? I don\u2019t know how my parents survived our long trips to  grandma  and grandpa\u2019s house. There was frequent screaming and crying in the back that must have driven them crazy. However, if we had  iPads , it probably would have been smooth sailing. Noah\u2019s Road Trip Noah was a great traveler. He slept the majority of the time as he loves to sleep in the car. We barely make it five minutes from our house before he is  asleep . \nWe were wondering how we would keep him entertained when he was awake. Rick or I would sit in the back and play with Noah. He loved  playing  on the iPad himself. Rick found a great app called  Baby\u2019s Musical Hands  in which touching the screen does color and different musical sounds. Noah thought it was pretty  fun . He will probably get so bored with the iPad that it won\u2019t work on road trips when we really want it to. He lasted 10 hours the first day and 8 hours the second day. He only got a little fussy towards the end. We stopped every few hours and let Noah get out and stretch. Rick felt he deserved a  toy  after making it only 4 hours\u2026 Noah was much better to travel with than my own husband. He was so bored! He did not like my method of eating\u00a0and using the restroom only when we stopped to get gas. And I only stop when we are on empty (imagine me road tripping in a hybrid) Trashmasters One of the reasons we were visiting my parents, besides just hanging out and letting them enjoy time with Noah, was for me to give a little speech at a golf tournament. I received a scholarship from a local group called  the Trashmasters . The Trashmasters is a tournament that involves earning points by hitting trees, ending up in sand traps, skipping the ball across the water and various other feats while still maintaining par (with your handicap). People come from all over the world to play in this tournament. I was receiving the distinguished alumni award this year. I am beyond grateful for the help this scholarship provided to me while obtaining my degree at  Baylor . I however hate public speaking and I am slightly embarrassed to have this on the internet. Family The best thing about this trip is that my entire family is hanging out together. I have not seen my brother since before Noah was born. His wife also had a baby one month prior to Noah. This was the first time for us all to meet. I could not wait for Noah to meet his Uncle. What tricks do you use to keep your kids entertained on road trips?

Last weekend was one for the Smith family record books. \u00a0We took Noah to Houston for his first ever vacation\u2026! We went to Houston to visit some of our best friends, and meet a family that would become our new best friends. When Noah was  born  we were put in touch with  The Skagg Family . \u00a0The Skaggs are from Houston and attend the same church ( Houston\u2019s First Baptist Church )\u00a0Abbie and I were members of when we lived there. \u00a0 They have a three year old son, Seth, who like our son, was born with Down Syndrome. When Noah was born we were scared, nervous, excited, and confused all rolled into one. \u00a0One of the main things we desperately wanted was a look into the future. \u00a0We wanted to know what our family would be like. \u00a0Would we ever be \u201cnormal\u201d again? \u00a0Would things ever be \u201cok\u201d again? \u00a0What was \u201cok\u201d anyway? \u00a0We had no idea. You wouldn\u2019t believe the number of weird, sappy books people gave us. \u00a0I know they were  just trying to help,  but sad and sappy books was\u00a0 not  what we wanted. \u00a0What we  wanted  was to \u201cknow\u201d what our family was going to look like form this point forward. \u2014\u2014>  Enter, The Skaggs . As soon as we connected with them we became their Facebook stalkers. \u00a0They posted videos of their family on Facebook, and we  consumed  every one of them. \u00a0I remember in vivid detail watching one of their videos where Seth was playing The Michael Jackson Experience game on the Wii. \u00a0I sat in our house after everyone had gone to bed, and I watched that video over, and over again. \u00a0He was dancing. \u00a0Having fun. \u00a0Being  normal ! \u00a0(Yes, normal! \u00a0Not just because he was dancing, but because he was playing The Michael Jackson Experience on the Wii! \u00a0I\u2019m not even really sure why that was such a big deal to me, but there was just something about him dancing to Michael Jackson that seemed  normal  to me. In fact, I\u2019ll say that God used Michael Jackson in that moment to bless me\u2026.!) \u00a0I remember my heart exploding with joy, and saying to Abbie (my wife), \u201cWow\u2026look at Seth playing the Wii! \u00a0I can\u2019t wait until Noah can play the Wii!\u201d \u00a0I\u2019m also pretty sure I wept with joy that night. \u00a0It was that moment, after watching that video, I realized that things were going to be much more normal then un-norma. \u00a0That night that little three year old I had never met, blessed me more then he\u2019ll ever know. As the weeks passed we seriously checked their Facebook almost every day (yah, I know, we\u2019re strange.) \u00a0I would say to Abbie, \u201cHey did you see Seth\u2019s new video?\u201d \u00a0And my wife would come home from work and say the same to me. \u00a0We watched Seth play in the sandbox, build some sort of awesome fort in his backyard, play with his little sister, and do lots of other\u00a0 typical  three-year-old stuff. \u00a0We loved it\u2026! \u00a0In fact we fell in love with their family. \u00a0(It wasn\u2019t a 100% online (weird) \u00a0romance though\u2026we actually talked back and forth with them \u2013 so we aren\u2019t  that  weird!) \u00a0\u00a0In fact, they are the inspiration for this website. \u00a0I\u2019m not sure I can ever express to the Skaggs what those videos did for my wife and I. \u00a0Their videos meant so much to us, and I wanted to return the favor. \u00a0My hope is that other families \u201cout there\u201d will stumble upon this site, and find the same hope and encouragement through Noah\u2019s videos as we did from Seths\u2019. This reason this vacation was a big one was not because it was Noah\u2019s first vacation, but because we  finally  got to hang out with the Skaggs!!! \u00a0They let us spend the entire day at their house. \u00a0The nicknamed their house the \u201c Fun House ,\u201d and a Fun House it was! \u00a0They seriously have the kind of family Abbie and I long to have. \u00a0The joy of Christ shined all throughout that entire house\u2026It was awesome! \u00a0They shared their entire family with us. \u00a0We laughed. \u00a0 We  I cried. \u00a0(I\u2019m such a baby.) \u00a0We talked. \u00a0We ate. \u00a0We hugged. \u00a0We played. \u00a0We spent the day without  physical therapy  appointments, and worries about what the results of the next test would be. \u00a0We simply spent the day being  normal . \u00a0And we left from that fun house with hearts deeply full of joy. I hope you enjoy some pictures of our weekend, and the special day we had at the Skaggs house. \u00a0I also want to invite you to check out their blog, and read about Seth\u2019s  miracle ear ! \u00a0It\u2019s truly one of the most amazing stories I\u2019ve ever heard! \u00a0You have to check it out\u2026!

{"date": ",December,19,2011", "body": "Finding the perfect Christmas gift (or birthday present) for any child can be a daunting, confusing, and sometimes dangerous endeavor (have you ever been to  Toys\u201dR\u201dUs  this time of the year!?) \u00a0But what about buying a Christmas present for a  baby born with Down syndrome ? Are there  special toys \u00a0for these  special kids \u00a0you may be wondering? (spoiler alert: there aren\u2019t.) \u00a0You\u00a0may be worrying about offending a parent of a child with  special needs  by giving their child a toy that is  to   advanced  for their developmental skil l  level. Or maybe you\u2019re the  new parent  of a child born with  Down syndrome  trying to find the best toy for your \u00a0kid-o! No matter who you are, or whose child your purchasing a gift for, this holiday season I\u2019m here to help! \u00a0First I hope you are already giving your child the\u00a0 3 free gifts that any child would like better than an iPad . \u00a0Second, I want to give you some general advice for purchasing toys; not only for children born with special needs, but for all children. If you\u2019re in a hurry feel free to scroll down and check out our  top ten Christmas gift ideas for babies born with Down syndrome  at the bottom of the page. 2 Tips On How To Purchase The Best Christmas Present For A Baby Born With Down Syndrome \u00a01. \u00a0Follow the age recommendation on the box\u2026just like you would for any child . I\u2019ll be honest, before Noah was born I had no idea how to buy a Christmas gift for a  special needs  child. \u00a0(Pretty silly, I know.) \u00a0I would have been super worried that I was going to buy something too advanced for their child. \u00a0I\u2019d be embarrassed and they would be offended. \u00a0I would have thought the age suggestions that are clearly printed on the front of any toy box only applied to\u00a0 typical  children. \u00a0Boy, I had a lot to learn. Children born with Down syndrome like Christmas presents, birthday gifts, toys, and lots of fun just like any other child. \u00a0A baby not liking fun baby toys would be weird. \ud83d\ude42 \u00a0Being born with Down syndrome means you have 3 copies of your 21st chromosome. \u00a0It doesn\u2019t mean your weird. \u00a0Here\u2019s a quick pro toy buyer tip:\u00a0When in doubt just stick to the manufacturer\u2019s age recommendation\u2019s printed on the front of every box and you\u2019ll be just fine. 2. \u00a0The more it flashes, lights up, beeps, chirps, sings, dances, etc\u2026.the better! All children (not just children born with Down syndrome) benefit greatly by being exposed to a variety of  sensory stimulation . In other words, the louder and brighter\u2026the better! \u00a0You\u2019ve probably noticed that most baby toys have two things in common. \u00a0 Loud  and  Bright ! \u00a0I used to think this was just the toy companies way of  Punk\u2019ing  parents\u2026but I was wrong. \u00a0Those lights and silly (and sometimes annoying) songs are actually extremely helpful for  all  children. So when you\u2019re cruising\u00a0the aisles of your favorite toy store this holiday season, let your eyes and ears be your guide. \u00a0(By the way when I\u2019m looking for a fun, new toy for Noah the  first  things I look for is: something bright, and something loud .) Quick Tip: If you\u2019re in a hurry I\u2019ve found that almost any toy in the  v-tech  section passes the bright / loud test. So when in doubt, grab a V-tech toy!) We\u2019ve been on this journey for a year \u00a0now and during that time we\u2019ve brought MANY toys for our child who was born with Down syndrome. \u00a0Some good. Some bad. \u00a0And some we have kept going back to time and time again. \u00a0If you are looking for a Christmas gift, birthday present, or a \u201cI\u2019m your grandma and just want to spoil you rotten gift\u201d for a baby born with Down syndrome (or any child 0-12 months old) it\u2019s my pleasure to present to you the following list of \u00a0toys that made it to the top of our \u201cawesome toy stack\u201d this year. \u00a0I hope you find it helpful. Top Ten Christmas Gift Ideas For A Baby Born With Down Syndrome 1. Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! 1-2-3 Crawl Along Snail The  Fisher Price Crawl Along Snail \u00a0was one of the first gifts Noah\u2019s grandmother bought for him, and he still enjoys playing with it. \u00a0This would make a perfect Christmas present for any child under one year old. \u00a0A few of Noah\u2019s favorite things about it are its fun light up face, the catchy songs it plays, and the mirror. \u00a0Mirrors are great  developmental tools , and babies benefit (and have a lot of fun) spending hours looking (and kissing!) their self in the mirror. 2. \u00a0Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Fun with Friends Musical Table The  Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Fun with Friends Musical Table \u00a0is a toy that grows with your child. \u00a0All of the major toy companies make musical tables like this one, and we did a lot of research before buying this one as a gift for our son. \u00a0The reviews on this one were better than all of the others we say, and I feel like the variety of activities you get with this one are more fun than all the others. \u00a0Here\u2019s a video of Noah having some  fun  with it! \u00a0What I like the most about this are the detachable legs. \u00a0We were able to take them off and sit the table on the floor for Noah during tummy time, than again as he was learning to  sit up  by himself, and now that he is learning to stand we have attached the legs so he can pull himself up. \u00a0Win! Win! Win! \u00a0 If you are looking for a great musical (developmental) table to buy as a gift you can\u2019t go wrong with this one! 3. \u00a0Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! Stride-to-Ride Dino I could write an entire blog post \u00a0(in fact  I did ) about how much Noah (and I) like the  Stride-to-Ride Dino . We have tried so many of these walkers and haven\u2019t been completely happy with any of them. Most of them are real flimsy, or made out of cheap, lightweight plastic that causes it to tip over when a child tries to pull himself up. (Especially those toy shopping carts \u2013 Yuck!) But the Stride-To-Ride Dino is not like any of those. It\u2019s very well put together. It\u2019s hard to describe it to you other than to say it just feels better than all the rest. It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s sturdy. It has a seat (for when your child is older and wants to ride it) but when your little one is learning to walk the seat spreads apart and allows the child to sort of get inside of it to walk (if that makes sense.) You don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to tip over on him. The music is fun. The dino lights up. And Noah seems to really like it. If you are looking for a fun walker for a child born with Down syndrome (or any other kid) this is the best one I\u2019ve used (and I\u2019ve used a lot of them!) 4. Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Apptivity Case I was hesitant to include the  Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Apptivity iPhone Case \u00a0on this list of great Christmas gift ideas because you have to have an iPhone (or iPod touch) to use it, but it\u2019s so much fun that I couldn\u2019t leave it off! \u00a0This  iPhone / iPod touch case for kids  is especially great because it comes with  3   free iPhone developmental apps  that are a ton of fun! \u00a0Another great thing about this iPhone case is that you don\u2019t have to worry about your precious Apple product getting damaged because it\u2019s completely protected in its own little baby friendly vault! \u00a0Totally safe from slobber, buggers, snot, runny noses, or anything else your cute little baby may throw at it. It\u2019s great! \u00a0(It also has a mirror which I really like!) \u00a0It\u2019s fun for  road trips , and even with no phone in it Noah still likes to chew on it, and look at his adorable face in the mirror! 5. \u00a0Tickle Monster Laughter Kit Children\u2019s Book Kids (and their parents) are always on the look out for fun new books, and The\u00a0 Tickle Monster \u00a0would be a great one to add to their collection! \u00a0I encourage you to take a second to read about the top  3 reasons why The Tickle Monster is one of our favorite children\u2019s books . \u00a0If you don\u2019t have time to read that post I\u2019ll just say that this book is interactive. \u00a0You don\u2019t\u2019 just read it  to  your kids, you read it  with  your kids. \u00a0The Tickle Monster allows a parent to create some awesome memories with their children, and so while the book in and of itself is great, it\u2019s so much more than just a book. It\u2019s an experience. \u00a0And experiences help you win with your kids! 6. Vtech Roly Poly Learning Tree Toy The  Vtech Roly Poly Learning Tree Toy \u00a0is an older toy, but thankfully if you look around hard enough (or check out the link above) you can find one. \u00a0With so many great toys that you can simply walk into any store and purchase you may wonder why I would include one that isn\u2019t as easy to find? Because it\u2019s that good! \u00a0I don\u2019t\u2019 know what it is about this toy that\u2019s so great, but Noah can\u2019t get enough of it. \u00a0It\u2019s almost always in his crib. \u00a0He enjoys the songs, the way the apple moves around the tree, the multiple bright lights; he can\u2019t get enough of it! \u00a0I\u2019d highly suggest checking out the link I posted above to buy it from Amazon, or check out your local thrift store. \u00a0It may not be as easy to find as simply walking into your local Babies R Us, but I promise you it\u2019s worth taking the time to find it! \u00a0Any baby would be happy to find this present under their Christmas tree! 7. \u00a0Fisher-Price Precious Planet Kick and Play Piano The  Fisher-Price Precious Planet Kick and Play Piano \u00a0was one of the first toys we bought Noah when we was only a few month old. \u00a0We wanted to get him something fun and safe to play with that we could hang in his crib. \u00a0He really likes it, and at one year old still has a  wonderful time  in his crib with it. \u00a0The songs are great, and it also doubles as a \u201cbaby wake up monitor\u201d! \u00a0 (We often hear the fun songs playing from this keyboard in the morning as Noah kicks and plays with it.) \u00a0It\u2019s been a great toy, and one of the ones we\u2019ve actually had to change the batteries in most often due to how much he enjoys playing with it (As an extra bonus the batteries last I long time in this toy before they need to be changed!) 8. \u00a0Globe Multicolored LED Flashing Wand The  Multicolored Globe LED Flashing Wand \u00a0is one of those lucky finds! \u00a0Noah\u2019s occupational therapist uses it often as a  developmental play toy , and I stumbled upon this one during one of my \u201ctrying to find the perfect developmental toy for my son born with Down syndrome\u201d trips to Babies R Us. \u00a0And I\u2019m glad I did! \u00a0 We forget to include this on our  Four Cheap But Effective Child Developmental Tools  post, but we should \u00a0have! I only paid 5 bucks for this, and it is without a doubt one of Noah\u2019s favorite gifts ever! \u00a0You press the button and the lights inside the globe spin around in brilliant, bright colors! \u00a0It\u2019s a sensory party! \ud83d\ude42 You can buy them on the link I posted above for a great price, or from Babies R Us in their five dollar bins at the front of the store. \u00a0Oh, and don\u2019t let the cheap price fool you, this toy has held up great! \u00a0It has survived our two dogs, and a very playful and curious one year old for almost a year. \u00a0I can\u2019t say enough good things about this toy (and its great price!) 9. \u00a0Fisher-Price Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage Noah\u2019s  physical therapist  has been using the\u00a0 Fisher-Price Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage \u00a0with Noah for a while now, and my wife was lucky enough to find one used (and at a great price!) at our local  Once Upon A Child  (A baby 2nd hand store.) \u00a0In fact, this may be Noah\u2019s  favorite toy  right now. He just started to learn to pull himself up now, and every time he sits in front of this toy that\u2019s exactly what he wants to do. \u00a0(I can\u2019t wait to share one of the videos I took of him first pulling himself up to a standing position on this toy. \u00a0His entire face light up with excitement and pride! \u00a0It was awesome. \u00a0I\u2019m so proud to be this little boy\u2019s father!) \u00a0I\u2019ll be posting one of those videos in a few weeks, but until then I\u2019ll tell you that he especially likes the huge mirror and all of the bright fun lights! If I were buying a toy for a child with Down syndrome (or any kid for that matter) who was 10 months old \u2013 18 months old this would be the one\u2026without a doubt! 10. \u00a0Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby\u2019s First Blocks Last, but certainly not least, are the  Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Baby\u2019s First Blocks . \u00a0We have used these blocks more than any other toy during Noah\u2019s occupational therapy visits as they also double as\u00a0 fantastic developmental toys ! \u00a0They started out by having Noah just hold the blocks (to work on his grasp), then they had him work on grabbing the blocks out of the box. \u00a0After that he was able to hold a block in each hand and bang them together (another  developmental milestone ), and now at 12 months old he sits they often have him  sit on an exercise ball \u00a0while he turns his body, grabs a block out of the box, transfers it to his other hand, turns and grabs another, and finally bangs them together. \u00a0I could on and on about other creative and fun ways we\u2019ve used these blocks, but without a doubt these blocks should be one of the first gifts any baby receives. Warning: If you have dogs (we have to) they will enjoy playing (and eating) these blocks just as much as your little one. \u00a0So keep them away! \ud83d\ude42 Final Thoughts And A Helpful Special Needs Christmas Gift Buying Guide Tool I hope this list helps any of you out there who are looking for Christmas gift ideas for babies with Down syndrome (or for any baby 0-12 months! ) \u00a0There are a ton of great toys and gift ideas out there and this list is by no means comprehensive. \u00a0Although all of the gift ideas on this page are ones that our son has personally used (and enjoyed) this past year. Oh, and one more thing: Our son is only 12 months old, so the Christmas gift ideas on this page are for children 0-12 months old (although some of them can be used for children up to 36 months old). \u00a0If you are looking for other gift ideas Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has a fantastic  Differently-Abled Toy Guide  on their website. \u00a0If you haven\u2019t checked it out, it\u2019s great! \u00a0You can search for toys by certain developmental areas, age ranges, and a variety of other ways.

{"date": ",April,2,2012", "body": "Since Noah\u2019s our first (and as of today, only) child I have no idea how or when a  typical child \u00a0is supposed to reach\u00a0their\u00a0 developmental\u00a0milestones . My wife is a\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0and knows that stuff like the back of her hand, but not me. In fact, I\u2019m not really\u00a0interested\u00a0in  textbook baby milestone charts.  In fact, I\u00a0sort of enjoy Noah developing at Noah\u2019s pace. Not what some baby milestone chart says  should be  his pace. \ud83d\ude42 We Celebrate, Not Compare (most of the time.) We try to make a habit in our home out of  celebrating, not comparing  our son\u2019s accomplishments. Sure, there are moments (especially when we\u2019re around  typically  developing children who are about the same age as Noah) when we\u2019re reminded that Noah was  born with Down\u00a0syndrome , and will likely hit his developmental milestones a little later than his  typically  developing peers. But honestly those moments are few and far between. There\u2019s a lot of screaming and yelling in our house. Here\u2019s why. Our\u00a0neighbors\u00a0must think we\u2019re crazy because of all the loud screaming that comes from our house. I\u2019m sure anyone walking by our house can hear it. It\u2019s loud. Why so much noise you ask? Well, because\u00a0 we\u00a0celebrate\u00a0like crazy around here! \u00a0It doesn\u2019t matter how big or  small  (no\u00a0accomplishment\u00a0is a  small \u00a0accomplishment\u00a0in my book) we  celebrate  every win  in our house. And I mean celebrate! We\u00a0scream, cheer, and\u00a0applaud\u00a0Noah\u2019s accomplishments like the kid just hit the game winning grand\u00a0slam\u00a0in\u00a0the world\u00a0series. We have a lot of fun in our house. That\u2019s just how we roll. For the most part life is a bunch of seemingly  small wins , with a few large wins\u00a0sprinkled\u00a0in along the way. Both are nice, and we should cheer our children on both for both as well, but it\u2019s those large wins that can make you really want to go  bananas!  Children with  Down syndrome  have to work  so hard  to achieve their developmental goals and when they hit one boy, it should be a  party ! And in our house it is. \ud83d\ude42 Sitting up for the first time is an epic win! Strangely enough these large wins usually happen when you least expect it. Like today for instance, after months of Noah\u2019s  physical\u00a0therapist \u00a0working on his  core\u00a0strength ,\u00a0countless\u00a0 sitting marathons , and even beating his own (assisted)  sitting record ; our ten month old son decided to simply sit up all by\u00a0himself! It was awesome. Sadly I wasn\u2019t home to witness this milestone (in person) but thankfully my wife\u2019s  iPhone 4S  saves the day again! (Isn\u2019t it awesome that we live in a time where we can capture memories so quickly and easily?!) You can hear the excitement in my wife\u2019s voice as she glances over to see our little boy sitting up all by himself in his pack and play. Don\u2019t you love the uber-proud look on Noah\u2019s face as he sits there with a much deserved\u00a0sense\u00a0of\u00a0accomplishment? I sure do! (I guess all of that time on the  exercise ball  really paid off for him.) Being a parent (and a husband) is another epic win! As I\u2019ve said a million times, I love being this little boy\u2019s dad. I wish I could live life in slow motion, just so I could linger over every little second with my family a little longer. Time really does fly and I\u2019m loving every minute of being a father and a husband. I couldn\u2019t dream up a better family to live life with if I tried. Hmmm\u2026.it\u2019s almost as if God Himself put our family\u00a0together.\u00a0\ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m\u00a0truly\u00a0 blessed  beyond words. What recent\u00a0developmental\u00a0milestones have you\u00a0celebrated\u00a0in your house? We want to hear about them!

{"date": ",July,7,2011", "body": "Feeding Time Wasn\u2019t Always Fun Per the\u00a0recommendation\u00a0of Noah\u2019s speech and  feeding\u00a0therapist \u00a0we have been sitting Noah in his car seat for  meal time . Why? \u00a0Apparently a car seat can provide an ideal sitting position for\u00a0children\u00a0with  low muscle tone  or for those that are not yet able to  sit up  on their own quite yet. During the first few months of Noah\u2019s life my feeding time with Noah was quite\u00a0frustrating for both Noah and I. \u00a0As a result of his low muscle tone I had to support his neck, head, back, and bottom while I held his bottle in his mouth while\u00a0wiping\u00a0the milk that\u00a0 spilling  from his mouth (also a\u00a0result\u00a0of the low tone in his mouth and jaw muscles.) Since you and I\u00a0only\u00a0have two hands, you can quickly see how this could be\u00a0frustrating (or\u00a0perhaps\u00a0you know from personal experience) for everyone\u00a0involved! \u00a0In fact, when Noah was just a few weeks old he had to have a  barium swallow study  preformed to determine if he was\u00a0aspirating. Our solution? \u00a0 We begin to work closely with a speech and feeding\u00a0therapist who\u00a0developed\u00a0a\u00a0therapy\u00a0plan that would\u00a0dramatically\u00a0improve his (and mine) feeding time. Her first suggestion was to strap him into the car seat while\u00a0bottle\u00a0feeding. \u00a0The car seat gave him the support he needed, and allowed me to focus\u00a0simply on feeding him (and staring at\u00a0those\u00a0big beautiful eyes!) \u00a0Even though I missed holding him, our feeding time\u00a0together\u00a0was much more\u00a0enjoyable. Time For An Upgrade, After Five Months After about five months of  feeding ,  physical , and  occupational  therapy Noah begin to get much stronger and was even able to eat without having to be\u00a0strapped\u00a0in his car seat. In fact his speech\u00a0therapist\u00a0even said he was doing so well we no longer needed her services! I was overjoyed! About a month ago we started feeding Noah  non-liquid food , and used the car seat for feeding since it supported his body so well. We asked our  physical\u00a0therapist \u00a0what she thought about using a infant high chair so we could have him at the table during dinner with us. \u00a0She said since he was still\u00a0learning how to  sit up , a highchair would cause him to work to hard, and to wait until he could  sit up  on his own. So we continued to work with Noah, carefully considering his needs so that we could make progress. Last week at his  physical\u00a0therapy \u00a0appointment we were happy to learn that Noah was doing so well he was able for a feeding\u00a0chair\u00a0upgrade! \u00a0That\u2019s right, it was time for an upgrade (and who doesn\u2019t like upgrades?)! The\u00a0therapist\u00a0thought the\u00a0 Safety 1st Recline and Grow Stage 5 Booster Seat  was a good choice, which we\u00a0purchased, and tried for the first time today. \u00a0Noah seemed to do really well in it. \u00a0It\u2019s really important for a feeding chair to \u00a0have multiple adjustments, and we are really happy with how adjustable this chair is. The tray is very simple to take on and off, and the\u00a0seat-back\u00a0reclines forward and backwards so that we can find the perfect sitting positon for our son. \u00a0It also has a nice seat belt to help keep him strapped in. \u00a0My only compliant so far is that the seat belt only goes around his lap. \u00a0I\u2019d like it to go over his shoulder also to help keep him from sliding down in the chair. Since he is still\u00a0developing\u00a0his  core strength  he was a\u00a0tendency\u00a0to slide down while eating. \u00a0This isn\u2019t a huge problem, and really the only thing I wish the chair had. We are still fine tuning the seat for the the\u00a0optimum\u00a0eating postion, but for now Noah sure feels like a big boy in his new chair! \u00a0In fact he was so relaxed in his new chair, he was able to have a nice dinner conversation with his mom during dinner! So what about you? \u00a0What has your experience been? What have you used? What types of chairs? Any specific products? I\u2019d enjoy hearing about your experience! -Rick ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Recline-Stage-Booster/dp/B0032FOOWA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=baby-products&qid=1310139354&sr=8-1"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/feeding-chair-upgrade/", "title": "It\u2019s Time For A Feeding Chair Upgrade"},

Trying saying that five times real fast!) It\u2019s\u00a0designed\u00a0to help your child learn to  drink from a straw  (which is important to help them transition\u00a0from a bottle.) \u00a0It\u2019s super simple to use. \u00a0You just fill the small cup up with water, and squeeze it gently to bring the water up through the straw. \u00a0The idea is that once the water reaches the babies mouth, he\u2019ll learn that he has to suck on the straw to get more. He seemed to enjoy it, but at six and a half months old he likes anything he can get into his mouth. It\u2019ll be fun to see how his straw sucking ability develops!

{"date": ",December,26,2011", "body": "Today I took Noah on a quick campus tour of  Dallas Theological Seminary  where I\u2019m currently in my fifth year (yes, 5th year!) of graduate school, and (hopefully) will receive my ThM ( Masters of Theology ) next May. My time here has been life changing.  I\u2019ve met some of my closest friends here.  I\u2019m learned more about the Bible , God, and His plan for humanity than I ever thought possible here.  But more importantly,   I\u2019ve come to love God more here. It was fun giving Noah a little mini tour of DTS, and introducing him to 3 of my favorite people on this campus.  I love the way the people at this school love on our son.  When they see Noah with me on campus it\u2019s as if  Bono  himself walked in the front doors. They go nuts. Hugging him.  Taking pictures of him.  Loving on on him.  It\u2019s a great feeling, and I\u2019m honored to be a part of this community. What A Seminary Student Is Not I\u2019ve found that most people don\u2019t have an accurate view of what a graduate level seminary (and a seminary student) is.  Heck, before I become a seminary student myself the word  seminary  sounded super-ultra-mega  religious \u2026and\u2026.maybe just a little bit  spooky !  Some people imagine seminary to be something kind of  like a five year long church camp where all day long people sit around a large camp fire roasting marshmallows, and singing \u201cFriends Are Friends Forever\u201d while some guy who looks like  Justin Bieber  plays the acoustic guitar. Others think seminary is where people who can\u2019t get into any other sort of masters level program go. I\u2019ve met countless seminary students that are working on completing a ThM degree and who have  already earned  their MD or MBA.  The  unanimously  agree that earning their ThM at Dallas Seminary was more difficult than any of their previous academic endeavors!  (This helps me feel a little bit better about the countless hours I\u2019ve logged with my Greek and Hebrew tutors!) Oh, and here\u2019s a random fun-fact for you\u2026my ThM degree will end up costing  more  than my wife\u2019s medical degree, and chances are I\u2019ll be earning  way less  than her when I graudate\u2026but that\u2019s another post for another day. \ud83d\ude42 Others imagine seminary students wear some strange  religious  clothes. (We aren\u2019t priests, rabbis, or monks. \ud83d\ude42 Or that we don\u2019t like to watch movies (unless of course they\u2019re about  Jesus ) or that we\u2019re out of touch with the culture and reality (even though you can  watch lectures  on your  iPad !), or that we don\u2019t play video games, or that we are super judgmental, or we are  anti-alcholol , or that (fill in the blank with your favorite \u2018christian\u2019 stereotype.) But perhaps the  most  inaccurate assumption of all is that seminary students are  super spiritual .  That they know everything there is to know about The Bible, God, angles, church history, where that verse is that your-grandma-used-to always-say-when-you-were-growing-up, and that they all have a footprints poster hanging up in their house. That there is something different about a seminary student praying than when any other Christian prays.  They we think we are \u201cperfect.\u201d  Or that people can\u2019t be themself around us. ( I would both be millionaire if I had a quarter for every time someone said a  bad word  around me immediately followed up with;  \u201cOh man\u2026I\u2019m so sorry I said that.  My bad. I didn\u2019t mean to curse around  you !\u201d Ha,ha..What!?!?!? What (This) Seminary Student Is I can\u2019t speak on behalf of all seminary students, but I can tell you what this seminary student is all about.  First I\u2019m none of the things I listed above.  You\u2019d only have to hang out with me for about three minutes to know that.  I\u2019m just a regular guy trying to figure out how I can best make an impact in the world.  I\u2019m the opposite of perfect.  I don\u2019t know it all. (as my transcripts prove\u2026.).  I constantly do  really  stupid things.  I often feel like I\u2019m surrounded by geniuses at Dallas Theological Seminary, and sometimes wonder how in the world they ever let me into this place. I could go on and on, but I won\u2019t bore you.  I think you get the idea.  If it wasn\u2019t for God\u2019s grace in my life I\u2019d be nothing. Zero.  Zip.  Nadda.  He is the only  thing  I can boast in.  He is the only  thing  I can brag about.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a  good  person (In fact, I  know  I\u2019m not.)  I don\u2019t look at anyone and think they\u2019re a bad person if they curse, drink, or even listen to really bad (and cheesy) \u2018c hristian\u2019  music.  I promise. I\u2019m just a dad trying to love God, his family, and the world the best He can.  I had somewhat of an idea what that was going to look like up until  December 15, 2010 ; the day the entire direction and course of my life was changed\u2026.forever\u2026..and for the better. \ud83d\ude42 So for those of you following our story please know you have complete freedom to be you.  100% you.  The imperfections.  The mistakes.  The different views. They\u2019re all allowed around  this  seminary student.  Heck, you can even curse around me if you want! \u201cSometimes you find your passion, sometimes your passion finds you.\u201d \n -Gabe Lyons Mine found me\u2026.. What about you?

World News Tonight  With Diane Sawyer featured a touching story tonight about the Cox family\u2019s journey of adopting a child (Kareen)  born with Down syndrome  from the Ukraine. (Kecia and Kris have also documented their story on their blog:\u00a0 Kareen\u2019s Journey Home .) Words can\u2019t describe the range of emotions I have after watching this video (and reading their  adoption story .) I\u2019m overwhelmed with tears of joy for Kareen and the Cox\u2019s, but at the same time heartbroken for all of the other children forced to live as outcasts, desperately in need of someone to love them. \u00a0I\u2019m well aware of the horrible conditions that children born with Down syndrome are forced to endure in the Ukraine and other Eastern European countries which is why I\u2019m so thankful for organizations like  Reece\u2019s Rainbow \u00a0who help children like Kareen find a home with loving parents who will care for them. \u00a0As I said above, Reece\u2019s Rainbow is a modern-day hero! Reece's Rainbow is a true hero! I\u2019d encourage you to watch the video above, read their  story , and  pray  about how  you  can get involved with  Reece\u2019s Rainbow . On their website you can browse countless stories of families in the progress of adopting a child born with Down syndrome, many of which are in need of financial support to help give these beautiful children their dream of being part of a  forever family. (By the way, the Cox\u2019s raised  30 thousand dollars  in order to bring Kareen home!) Perhaps you could skip a latte (or two) next month and  donate  that money to help rescue a child in desperate need of a family who will love him or her. \u00a0Who knows\u2026maybe  you\u2019ll  even be called to adopt a child through Reece\u2019s Rainbow! How awesome would that be! (And if that happens\u2026please let me know!) Please take a second to visit  the Cox\u2019s blog  and leave them an encouraging comment. They are an amazing family, and I really do consider Kecia and Kris heroes of mine. The Cox\u2019s story is a perfect reminder of why I started this site, to give the world an inside look at what life is like rising a child born with Down syndrome. My hope is that we can show the world by our daily videos that people born with Down syndrome are just as equally valued by God as any other person. My heart hurts when I think about those children who desperately want someone to love them. They don\u2019t want an iPad, a new car, or a bunch of stuff\u2026..they just want to be a part of a family who will love them.

Be sure to check out the  other posts !] Labs For Children Born With Down Syndrome There will be a lot going on behind the scenes for your newborn that you may\u00a0 not realize.\u00a0 When\u00a0your baby is away from you, they may see doctors, be tested for\u00a0one of the\u00a0 medical concerns\u00a0for children born with Down syndrome , have imaging done, have their\u00a0hearing checked, or be held by everyone in the nursery because they are so cute.\u00a0 If your child is in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), they will most likely have several more tests done then what is mentioned below.\u00a0 Be sure to ask your doctor what tests were done each day and why.\u00a0 You have every right to know what is going on with your baby. There is a good chance that the nursery staff will not tell you that certain tests are done because they are so routine they assume everyone knows about them. \u00a0Your only clue may be that your baby comes back with a band-aid. \u00a0The blood tests listed below are the minimum tests expected for your newborn with  Down syndrome . [Image via  iStockPhoto .] Chromosomes Every child with\u00a0even the suspicion of Down syndrome\u00a0should have their chromosomes determined.\u00a0 This is the\u00a0definitive diagnosis for Down\u00a0syndrome and will also be able to differentiate which type of Down syndrome your child has. This is a blood test that cannot be obtained by a heel stick (which is the easiest way to obtain blood from a baby), but requires that\u00a0 blood be obtained\u00a0from a vein, like starting an IV.\u00a0 You may notice that your baby comes back from the nursery with a bruise or a band aid\u00a0in the bend of their elbow.\u00a0 It will likely take 1 week to get the final chromosome result. There is a quicker way to determine if there are three copies of the 21st chromosome which is done\u00a0by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\u00a0 This is a very specific test and will only look for specific genetic differences.\u00a0\u00a0 Examples\u00a0are FISH for Trisomy 21, 18, or 13.\u00a0 There are several other FISH tests, but your child would only have the one for trisomy 21 at first. \u00a0 Since the  characteristics of Down syndrome  can be seen in other syndromes your doctor may want to run more tests if a FISH is negative. \u00a0The FISH test can determine a mosaic pattern, translocation, and nondisjunction. \u00a0FISH studies are usually done with the full chromosome study but will come back much sooner with results. The results will likely look like algebra to you but they are actually quite easy to understand once they are explained. \u00a0Even if you do not understand what the results are, there should be an explanation at the bottom of the result page you receive. \u00a0 Below are possible results for children with Down syndrome. \u00a0The first number is the number of chromosomes present, 46 or 47.\u00a0 The second section determines if the child is a boy or girl by listing what type of sex chromosomes are present.\u00a0 Either two X (girl) or one X and one Y (boy) will be present. \u00a0Last it tells you what difference is seen;\u00a0is there an extra 21st chromosome, or translocation.\u00a0 A typical child has chromosomes that read 46, XX (girl)\u00a0or 46 XY (boy). Nondisjunction:  An extra 21st chromosome is present \n 47 XX, +21 (girl) \n 47 XY, +21 (boy) \n Translocation: \u00a0 The most common translocation is between the 14th chromosome and the 21st. \u00a0This shows that those two chromosomes have exchanged information.\u00a0 You can put in other numbers for the number 14 below. \n 46 XX, t(14q,21q) \n 46 XY, t(14q,21q) \n Mosaic: \u00a0 Both typical cells and cells with three copies of the 21st chromosome were found. \n 46 XX/47 XX, +21 \n 46 XY/47 XY, +21 \n Newborn Screen All children are required to get a newborn screen sometimes called the PKU test by people who do not\u00a0realize that the tests have expanded to\u00a0include\u00a0other conditions. \u00a0This test is so common that nurseries\u00a0frequently do not tell parents they have even done this test. \u00a0The blood is obtained by a heel stick. Your child will likely have a band-aid on their foot as proof that it \u00a0has been done. Each state must include certain conditions but many have an expanded newborn screen. \u00a0The purpose of the newborn screen is to screen for conditions that when caught early will either save the child\u2019s life or prevent mental retardation. However, there are also conditions included that will benefit the child if known early such a sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis The benefit of knowing about these conditions is so great that the cutoff value for a positive is set low enough to catch all true positives or babies that really have the disorder. \u00a0 This allows for several false positives. Noah was actually a false positive for  glutaric acidemia type 1 . \u00a0I am thankful that this test is in place because when this condition is caught early it can save a child\u2019s life and protect their brain. Why The Newborn Screen Is Important For Down Syndrome This test is very helpful for children with  born with\u00a0Down syndrome  because it screens for hypothyroidism or not enough of the thyroid hormone.\u00a0 This condition is more common in children with Down syndrome, and\u00a0the child will be screened\u00a0for this throughout their life.\u00a0\u00a0This test will be repeated if it is abnormal the first time, but will also be repeated after 7 days\u00a0of life even if it is normal.\u00a0\u00a0You will hear from your  pediatrician  if the results are positive, and if they are not able to get to you in time you will get a notice in the mail that a result came back positive.\u00a0 If you hear nothing, do not worry as that means your results are negative. \u00a0You will need their thyroid tested again at 6 months. Complete Blood Count with Differential (CBC with Diff) A complete blood count with differential may or may not be done while in the hospital. \u00a0The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children have this done within the first month. \u00a0A  CBC  looks at white cells which fight infection, red cells which carry oxygen and platelets that help us clot. I am about to use some very scary terms but I want to reassure you that the majority of children with Down syndrome do very well with these diagnoses. There are 5 abnormalities that can be seen in children with Down syndrome. \u00a0The three most common are not harmful and typically resolve by 3 weeks of age. \u00a0These include neutrophilia, too many neutrophils a type of white cell; thrombocytopenia, not enough platelets; and polycythemia, too many red cells. \u00a0There are two other conditions that are more concerning for children with Down syndrome and they are hard to differentiate. \u00a0Transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and congenital leukemia will initially look the same. \u00a0Blasts, immature blood cells, are seen in the blood stream which is not where they should be found. \u00a0 \u00a0TMD usually resolves spontaneously by 3 months of age and is typically\u00a0only seen in newborns who have Down syndrome. Congenital leukemia is also associated with blasts in the peripheral blood but they also invade the skin and other organs. \u00a0This diagnosis sadly has a much worse prognosis.\u00a0 A child with Down syndrome will likely be watched through this course as it is much more likely to resolve by 3 months of age and be TMD. Final Thought On Labs Our own personal experience with lab tests has been an adventure, specifically the chromosome tests. \u00a0It is very hard to wait for these tests.\u00a0 You will stare at your baby and not see what the doctors are talking about, as will most of your family. \u00a0Even as a doctor I would question the diagnosis as I looked at Noah\u2019s little upturned eyes. \u00a0There is a good chance that your child will be doing so well that you just think it is impossible that they have Down syndrome and the risks that go along with that. At first you will just want them to have\u00a0typical chromosomes.\u00a0 Then you will say if they do have Down syndrome they must be a mosaic because my child is amazing.\u00a0 Despite the results your child will continue to be amazing as all you have done is\u00a0proven what has been there since they were conceived.

{"date": ",August,1,2011", "body": "I was never really into the television show \u201cThe Little House On The Prairie\u201d but from what I remember their life was pretty slow. I never remember Charles taking little Grace to countless  physical therapy ,  occupational therapy , and  speech therapy  appointments, riding  elephants  (or  rody  horses), or taking little Mary to have a  CBC test  ran. Our life is nothing like the Ingalls. \u00a0Nothing at all. They lived a slow-paced life. \u00a0We don\u2019t. \u00a0They made it a priority to keep the main things in life, the main things. \u00a0We so often do not. In fact it\u2019s pretty easy to get caught up in the busyness of life, and miss life all together. I find that the older I get the more intentional I have to be about  slowing down to notice and enjoy  all of the small things in life. Our life isn\u2019t a TiVo. \u00a0We only get one shot. As a  new parent  I want to take in every smile, every cry, every  laugh , every bit of  fun  I can from our little guy. One of my biggest fears is lying on my death-bed and wishing I had a TiVo remote to my life. Wishing that I could somehow rewind to parts of my life I missed. \u00a0Sections of my life where I was present, but wasn\u2019t. \u00a0If you know what I mean. Parts of my life I would have caught had I just put down my computer, or iPhone, or iPad, or\u2026\u2026whatever else was beeping, or buzzing for my attention, and focused on what was happening \u201con-screen\u201d at the moment. I wonder how many hours I spent re-watching a one hour television program because I had to rewind it over, and over because I was \u201cmulti-tasking\u201d instead of giving all of my attention to what was going on at the time\u2026? Ok, moving on. Keeping the main thing, the main thing isn\u2019t easy. My life long goal is to \u201ckeep the main thing, the main thing.\u201d To not lose sight of the trees spite the forest. \u00a0To be the kind of person who \u201cis where he is,\u201d so to speak. I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s  hard work  for me. I live and work in a world where there is constantly something beeping, chirping, ringing, buzzing, or vibrating for my attention. I have to fight (hard) to stay focused on the vital parts of life, and allow all the rest to fade into the background. I think they call that priorities. My top-six-don\u2019t-ever-forget-these-life-priority-list! Quick, give me your top six life priorities. \u00a0You know, the top six items of your life listed in the order of importance. Is that tough for you? I\u2019m convinced most people never really think about this sort of stuff, and would struggle to give you a list of their \u201clife priorities.\u201d Maybe you just struggled to list off your top six. But it\u2019s important to have a list like this if you want your life to work. \u00a0Not just getting by\u2026.I mean really working. I\u2019ll share with you my top six life priority list. \u00a0Now I don\u2019t always do a great job of keeping this list straight, but this is the list by which I try to order my life. When things in my life seem to not make sense, or I find myself frustrated, angry, distracted, confused, etc, it\u2019s usually because something in this list (or the whole list) is out-of-order. So without further ado, here you go: My \u201clife-priority\u201d List \n Developing, growing, and nurturing my relationship with God. (It should be noted that if there was a spot higher than number 1, this priority would go there. It is essential to every other part of my life that I keep God at the top spot on this list. If I don\u2019t \u00a0it won\u2019t be long before I am ineffective in every other area of my life. \n Developing, growing, and nurturing my relationship with my  wife . \n Developing, growing, and nurturing my relationship with my  son . \n Developing, growing, and nurturing my relationship with my family. \n Developing, growing, and nurturing my relationships with others. (Friends, etc.) \n Work, school, play\u2026apple products, etc\u2026(pretty much everything else in life.) \n If I keep this list in order my life seems to just work. \u00a0However if just one of these items is in the wrong place on this list it causes a domino\u00a0that effects my entire life. \u00a0I\u2019m convinced that the world has been \u201crigged\u201d to only work well when our \u201clife priorities\u201d are kept in this order. Vacations are like water to your family. They are vital. One way our family tries to live life by this priority list is by making sure we take at least one vacation a year (more if possible.) I know some of you think this is impossible for your family to do, but it\u2019s not. You don\u2019t have to go to the Bahamas every year (But if you can, that\u2019s awesome!) to have a vacation. Heck, even just a \u201cstaycation\u201d can do wonders for your family. Just pack up the family and find a cheap hotel somewhere close to where you live. Be creative. Make it fun. But above all else\u2026 don\u2019t just do nothing! It\u2019s ok (and important) to leave the kids at home sometimes! It is important to not only have a yearly family vacation, but a yearly married-couple-only vacation as well! I \u00a0have met many married couples that haven\u2019t been on a vacation as a family, or as a couple, for 5,6,7\u2026even 10 years or more\u2026!!! I don\u2019t get that. You have to learn to take time out of your life and  slow down . (If not life has a funny way of  making  you slow down.) \u00a0I think every year a married couple should spend  at least  one weekend a year by themselves\u2026.with no kids! Trust me, I know this is a hard thing to do, (especially when you have a kid-o as cute as our  baby Noah !) but it\u2019s a necessity. \u00a0Did you know studies have shown that children who have parents that regularly spend time alone (date nights, vacations, etc) have more confidence, and feel more supported as a result of mom and dad still taking time to be with one another. So parents, start planning that next trip! Today marks the start of our family vacation! Since Noah was  born  our life has been going at Mach 5. \u00a0We have been going, going, going. Thankfully today marks the first day of our (much-needed) two-week vacation. We are spending the first leg of our trip at my wife\u2019s parents in Colorado. Since its such a beautiful drive we decided to take Noah on his first cross-country road trip to see his  grandparents ! (I\u2019m not sure how many states you have to drive through in order for a trip to be considered cross-country. In my rule book it\u2019s two or more\u2026so we\u2019ll just go with it!) It is about an 18 hour drive from our door to theirs\u2026unless you are me. When it comes to road trips you have two groups of people. You have the types that like to go non-stop, and maybe, if you are lucky, they will let you stop for a bath room break. Then you have my type. I like to stop\u2026often. I get bored in the car. \ud83d\ude42 I can turn an 18 hour trip into a two-day trip easily! A day full of firsts! We stopped about half way to give baby Noah a little rest (and me!) I was glad we did because Noah got to see his fist dinosaur! In fact the entire day was filled with firsts: First out-of-state road trip First ice cream cone (rocky road, yum!) First carrot First time to ride a dinosaur! Really\u2026! See picture above for proof! First time in a hotel crib (sorry buddy) First time in a hotel hot tub (sorry again, buddy) What a day! Our little Noah was ready to crash by the time we got to our hotel in New Mexico. I\u2019m thankful that no matter how busy life gets we make time to get away and relax. To shut down (kind of) and just enjoy the important things in life. What sort of things does your family do to make sure you are keeping the main thing the main thing?

Noah\u2019s only 20 months old, but he\u2019s been a fan of the iPad ever since his tiny fingers first touched that glorious glass screen. He enjoys the\u00a0 interactive books , playing\u00a0 fun games , watching movies, and checking out his\u00a0 Baby Signing Times \u00a0videos on it! As much fun as I enjoy playing around on the iPad with him, it\u2019d be nice to let him enjoy the iPad on his own every once in a while. But before that could happen I needed to find the best iPad cover for a curious little toddler . \u00a0However I quickly discovered that finding the\u00a0 best ipad case for a kid \u00a0can be\u00a0difficult. \u00a0We currently have one of Apple\u2019s\u00a0Smart Cases, which allows us to prop the iPad up landscape style so Noah can watch Baby Signing Times while he eats breakfast (and we can get ready for the day.) The problem with the Smart Case (and most other iPad cases)\u2026. However, the Smart Case doesn\u2019t work well for a toddler since it doesn\u2019t offer much protection from dropping, licking, trying to eat, throwing out of a crib, knocking off a table; you know the typical baby-iPad scenarios. (However, it is great for adults who just want to protect their iPad\u2019s screen from getting scratched in their briefcase, diaper bag, etc.) \n \nAfter doing a little research on the best iPad cases for a young child, these 8 iPad cases really rose to the top. I thought I\u2019d put a list together to save you the trouble of having to do the research on your own. By the way, all of these cases are available on Amazon, which means they can be shipped! So feel free to forward this post to any grandparents who may be looking to buy an iPad case as a gift for their little grandson / granddaughter!.\u00a0 Oh, and if you are thinking of buying your child an iPad, make sure they have these\u00a0 6 other gifts \u00a0that are\u00a0 way cheaper \u00a0first. \n 8 Great iPad Cases for Kids 8 Great iPad Cases For Babies, Toddlers, and Children \u2013 2016 I hope you find this list helpful in your search for the top kid\u2019s iPad cases.

And if it is indeed awesome, I\u2019ll be sure to add it to this list!\u00a0 \u00a0 1. Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Apptivity Case: iPad Edition There are a few things I really like about the\u00a0 Fisher Price Apptivity iPad case . 1. Our son already own (and we really like) the\u00a0 Fisher Price Apptivity iPhone case . 2. I\u00a0 really \u00a0like how this case covers the iPad\u2019s home button. One of the things I dislike about the iPad is the fact that you can\u2019t disable the home button. (Although a fix for this is coming in\u00a0 iOS 6 !) Ever time I try to let Noah use the iPad on his own, his curious little hands head straight to that home button, which of course closes the app. However, this case is\u00a0 big . Like really, really big. Like clunky big. You get what am saying? It\u2019s still a nice case, that will almost certainly baby-proof your iPad, but we passed on it just because of its size. 2. Speck Products iPad 2 iGuy Case This\u00a0 Speck iGuy iPad Case \u00a0is a popular ipad case for kids, toddlers, and babies because the rubber arms can help your child hold on to the iPad while they are using it. I also like how the rubber feet allow the iPad to stand up on a counter, table, which allows your child to watch a movie / or video on the iPad without holding it. 3.

{"date": ",July,4,2012", "body": "Being a working mom does have some downfalls, ok several. One of them being that there is a chance that I will miss  milestones  in person. Thanks to technology\u00a0however, I get to experience them via video, as do all of my co-workers. While at work, Rick sent me a video of Noah  pulling to stand for the first time . Who knew he had this in him? The last milestone Noah hit was the\u00a0 inch worm crawl , so we weren\u2019t even on the look out for Noah to pull himself up on his own right now. Even if we aren\u2019t expecting them, it doesn\u2019t keep us from getting  super excited  and  celebrating  Noah\u2019s accomplishments. How To Help Your Child Learn To Stand Up / Pull Their Self Up. There are several tools that need to come together for a child to stand. Noah is pulling up from a  kneeling position , which we have been working on at physical therapy.Kneeling helps strengthen the legs to be ready for standing. There are several different activities to work on in kneeling, one that has helped with this milestone today is doing  half kneeling , where one foot is placed flat on the floor with the other knee on the ground. Noah is pushing up from this position in the video. Standing also involves something we are very familiar with which is the  core . I am starting to notice a theme with all of our developmental milestones, that one must have a  strong core  to achieve them. \u00a0Noah continues to work on his core muscles with each therapy session. Since we first brought Noah  home from the hospital  he\u2019s had a very strong desire to have his back extended. Tummy time was awesome for him, and he was great at it. \u00a0It\u2019s one reason  sitting  was a difficult task for us to accomplish, as he didn\u2019t like to flex. I am excited that he now gets to extend his back again during these activities. He will be one happy camper. When mastering pulling to stand the child will initially rely on  upper body strength  to get them up, and as they get stronger will transition to using the  lower body , as well as being able to gain endurance so that they can stand longer. Two Exercises to Work On Pulling To Stand I will again reference Patricia Winder\u2019s fabulous book  Gross Motor Skills in Children With Down Syndrome \u00a0for these exercises. (If you don\u2019t already own this book, it\u2019s a must have for any parent raising a child with Down syndrome.) \n Have your child sitting on a bench, or box so that their legs are at a 90 degree angle. You put something in front of them that they can grab onto to pull themselves up, she recommends a crib, pack and play, large storage container with something to weight it down, or whatever your child is interested in. Put a toy on the pull up object to motivate your child to pull up. She mentions moving the bench or box against the legs once they stand up to offer support initially. \u00a0You then work on sitting back down with bent legs \n Once they have mastered the 90 degree angle then you can move to working on standing from a kneeling position. \u00a0You can see our post on  supported kneeling  to help with that position. \u00a0Practice getting into half-kneeling with one foot on the ground. \u00a0Put something to pull up on in front of them that they are actually able to reach and they will pull to stand from the leg that has the foot flat on the ground. \u00a0 This is what Noah is doing in today\u2019s video \n Motivation for Standing Noah is playing with his current favorite toy in today\u2019s video. The  Fisher-Price Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage \u00a0has been an excellent motivator for him to work on kneeling and now pulling to stand. (This toy is also on our  top 10 toy list , and without a doubt has been one of the toys Noah\u2019s played with the most.) Noah\u2019s fairly certain the guy he sees in the mirror is awesome and becomes quite chatty with him. You should hear their conversations. \ud83d\ude42 This toy is hard to find in stores, but you can purchase it on Amazon by clicking the link above, and I\u2019ve also seen it several times at second-hand stores like  Once Upon A Child  which is where we scored this one. It has a firm base, lots of lights and music and Noah\u2019s best friend in the mirror. It has been a great tool for us to use. Has your child shocked you by achieving a milestone you were not expecting? \u00a0Any other working parents out there that experience milestones via video?

{"date": ",September,27,2012", "body": "When Noah was\u00a0 born \u00a0I had this fear that weekends like this would never happen. That he wouldn\u2019t be able to play and have fun like a\u00a0 typical \u00a0child. Before Noah was born I knew\u00a0 very little \u00a0nothing about\u00a0 Down\u00a0syndrome \u00a0and the little I did know I learned from\u00a0 watching\u00a0television\u00a0shows . Worrying Is Such A Waste Of Time Noah\u2019s Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0diagnosis\u00a0was a\u00a0 total surprise \u00a0to us.\u00a0We never saw it\u00a0coming.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t\u00a0expected. Having a son with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0wasn\u2019t even on our radar. When we found out Noah had Down syndrome it felt like someone had punched me directly in the heart.\u00a0I didn\u2019t really know what to do. What to say. What to think. I\u00a0was scared. Anxious. Worried. Fearful. \n \nWould Noah like to play with other kids? How would he interact with me? With others? Would he just sort of sit around and droll on himself? (Again, I knew nothing about Down syndrome.)\u00a0I remember wondering if we would ever the kind\u00a0 typical \u00a0weekends that\u00a0 typical \u00a0families have. If only I knew then what I know now\u2026.\u00a0 \u00a0It turns out life is much more\u00a0 typical \u00a0than I could have ever imagined. All of those fears and tears quickly turned to\u00a0 laughter and joy . (Not to mention a few weeks after Noah was born I had\u00a0 something else to worry about \u00a0which took my mind off of his Down syndrome diagnosis.) I wish I could have all of that time back that I spent worry about the \u201cwhat if\u2019s.\u201d I guess that\u2019s why they say hindsight is 20/20. Noah\u2019s having some fun with his buddy Seth! Best buds! It turns out Noah is even more epic-ly awesome than the imaginary kid I made up in my head before Noah was born. Like I said\u00a0 last night ,\u00a0this little boy\u00a0brings more joy and happiness to our family than I ever dreamed he would. In fact, I don\u2019t even notice that he has Down syndrome\u2026unless I\u2019m looking at my\u00a0 calendar . It turns out all of those\u00a0 parenting fears \u00a0I had when Noah was born never came true. If only I were a little taller\u2026. Sure, I worry about his future sometimes. Sure, I worry about how people will treat him as he gets older. But that\u2019s not\u00a0 necessary \u00a0because he has Down syndrome. It\u2019s just because he\u2019s my child, and I\u2019m his dad. And it\u2019s a pretty normal feeling for parents to worry about their child\u2019s future. But fear doesn\u2019t win in this house. In this house joy trumps fear! Seth\u2019s adorable sister! (And smiling mommy!)\u00a0 Time goes by quick. So we try our best to soak up all the joy we can from each day (and each weekend.) And as one of the wisest people in the world once said: \u201cTherefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.\u201d So this weekend we spent some time with our good friends\u00a0 Joel and Emily \u00a0and enjoyed life. \u00a0We did\u00a0 typical \u00a0stuff. The kind of stuff I wondered if we\u2019d ever be able to do. We went to the Zoo. We ate out. We\u00a0 swung . We\u00a0 slid . We went to the\u00a0 American Girl \u00a0Store. <\u2014\u2014 This is by the way was NOT \u00a0something I ever worried about doing.\u00a0 We enjoyed life. Yes, he\u2019s a little flirt! \u201cHey Seth, whatcha watching?\u201d \u00a0 Noah loves the zoo!\u00a0 A little trip to the American Girl Store Our friends wanted to take their daughter to the American Girl store here in Dallas while they were in town. I had never been inside one of the stores, and words can\u2019t describe how\u00a0 business savvy the owners are \u00a0unique this place is. Trust me when I say this is the first time in my life I\u2019ve ever seen people line up with their child to have their dolls\u2019 hear done at the doll hair salon. The look on the dads\u2019 faces while they waited in line was priceless\u2026..actually come to think of it, it looked a lot like 45 dollars. Ha,ha. Yes, these are doll hair stylists. The truth be told if I had a little girl I\u2019d be going to the American Girl store as well. I\u2019m all about parents creating unique and fun moments with their children. This was a once in a life time event for my friend\u2019s daughter and a very special daddy-dauther \u00a0day. They didn\u2019t just buy their daughter a doll\u2026they created some fun memories. And that\u2019s a win. (Oh and by the way, creating memories doesn\u2019t getting ripped off\u2026..they\u00a0 opted out \u00a0of getting their daughters new dolls\u2019 hair done!) One happy little girl!\u00a0 What a great weekend! I\u2019m so thankful to share life with so many wonderful friends who love life as much as I do. By the way, for those of you who have had a hard time making new friends, here\u2019s a few ways tomeet some new friends. I hope you find them useful.

{"date": ",June,20,2012", "body": "Noah\u2019s 11 months old in today\u2019s video and we decided to try and let Noah self feed today. As you can see he really enjoyed it (as we did his mommy and daddy.) I thought I\u2019d share a little bit about our experience with allowing Noah to self feed for the first time for any of you getting ready to try this with your child. It\u2019s messy I am not going to lie, my biggest fear with starting self-feeding with Noah was the MESS. I have seen this kid  eat off a spoon  and it isn\u2019t pretty, so I could only imagine what he will do when he is in control. So the first step in deciding to let your child self-feed is getting a  really good mop  and lots of paper towels. It also helps to let them eat in only their diaper\u2026your washer and dryer will thank you later. I have all but abandoned bibs as they only keep one section of him clean and Noah is able to target every area outside of that with excellent precision. When to start I quickly realized that I had no idea what I was doing or where to start. It is best to try self-feeding when a child is able to support themselves while  sitting . Since this is sometimes delayed in children with  Down syndrome  I don\u2019t think they need to be sitting on their own so much as being able to sit well when supported in a  feeding chair  or high chair. They also should be able to reach out and grab things and have fairly good aim at their mouth. When they start doing this with  toys , they should be more than willing to do this with food. They should also be making some chewing movements with their mouth, they don\u2019t need teeth, but they do need to know what to do with a more solid food.  Teeth  will determine the consistency of the foods you will try. If your little one does not have teeth yet you\u2019ll want to stick to easily mashed items. It\u2019ll also be easier if they are  interested  in what is on your plate while you are eating. Noah started grabbing our drinks and food which made me realize that maybe I needed to give him his own plate. When we were introducing solid foods with Noah our  pediatrician  recommended to start with  puffs , a classic. They dissolve almost instantly in the mouth and are easy to handle. I think our OT was a bit shocked when we told her with excitement that Noah was advancing his diet. I couldn\u2019t quite figure out why until we tried the puffs. These things are not quite as easy to pick up as they look. As hard as Noah tried, he could not get them to his mouth himself. We gave up on self-feeding for a little while after that as I assumed that he was not ready. Type of grasp determines food choices I finally had an epiphany one day when I was at  my best friend\u2019s  house. \u00a0She knows all the cool stuff people are trying and had a book lying around called  The Baby-Led Weaning Cookbook: 130 Recipes That Will Help Your Baby Learn to Eat Solid Foods \u2013 and That the Whole Family Will Enjoy, by Gill Rapley and Tracey Murkett. (Long title, huh?) \u00a0I was skimming through it and with their help it finally clicked what I was missing.  I needed to match Noah\u2019s grasp development with his foods. Puffs are for those who have a great  raking ability  and more importantly a  pincher grasp  which typically develops around 9 months when children usually start eating more solid foods. The average age of a child with Down syndrome having a pincher grasp is 20 months. The reason I wrote the post on  grasps  is because I had just figured this stuff out and knew I would be referencing it now as I talk about feeding. Noah is still at a  radial palmar grasp  which makes puffs pretty hard to pick up. \u00a0I had set him up for failure because I didn\u2019t figure out his grasp prior to giving him foods. Foods to start with The book mentioned above has a great table matching grasp type with food choices. They recommend starting with large stick-shaped pieces of food. I started with  bananas . They recommended making it look like an ice cream cone with the peel still on with the banana exposed at the top. Noah grabbed onto that, brought it right to his mouth and started gnawing on it. See\u2026if I just put the right thing in his hand. Some other options are veggie straws which are basically tube-shaped puffs, larger pasta with a shape that is easy to grasp like rotini, or cutting long narrow pieces of bread. Using long pieces allows the child to hold an object with an edible section exposed that can easily be put in the mouth. Compare this to the puff which gets hidden in the hand and has to actually be released into the mouth. The teething crackers, such as the ones we are using in the video, are also great as they dissolve easily and stick out of the hand since they are fairly large. Next you can advance to foods that your child can pick up in clumps. Think rice, mashed potatoes, apple sauce, mac and cheese (do see why you need a good mop) and one of Noah\u2019s favorites eggs. These are offered when your child is doing a raking grasp. Puffs can be offered at this time as well. \u00a0When we started with these Noah was still eating the parts that were on top of his hand and not so much releasing it into his mouth. \u00a0I however believe that this helped him realize that if he opened his hand there was more goodness inside You can get smaller and smaller as the grasp develops to where some day instead of your child picking up a clump of rice, he is picking up the individual grains. Likely will not get all of their nutrition at the beginning I did not rely on Noah to get all of his intake from self-feeding alone. \u00a0I would give him some things to play with as give him meals by spoon feeding in combination with milk. \u00a0As he starts getting better I will stop giving him things off a spoon as much. You need to have a balance, and it may take a while before your child is able to eat enough on their own. \u00a0This is ok. \u00a0The whole point at the beginning to to be exploring not necessarily providing nutrition. The Gag Reflex Your child will gag. They are supposed to gag. You want them to gag. It will scare you. You may have your hand on the phone for 911 before you realize that your child is ok.  Gagging is not the same thing as choking . Choking cuts off the air supply where as gagging gets a chunk of food out of the back of the throat so that it can get worked on some more. With choking you will not hear many sounds from your child and they will likely be changing colors, now is the time you want to shout \u201cAnnie, Annie are you ok?\u201d, get your child out of their chair, put them over your knee and give them 5 back slaps to help get that item out as well as call 911. However if they are trying to gag an item of food up, give them a few seconds and it will get there. Starting with mushy or slippery things helps the child swallow without problems. I have seen Noah swallow whole noodles before without difficulty. Chicken on the other hand causes us a lot of problems with gagging as he tends to not chew it enough. (NOTE: If you ever have any concern that your child is\u00a0choking, or not able to breathe, you need to call 911\u00a0immediately.\u00a0Additionally\u00a0if you have questions or concerns about this please be sure to talk with your\u00a0pediatrician, as this post is not and should not be taken as medical advice.) Patience I thought that letting Noah self feed would speed up the feeding process\u2026I was very wrong. It has slowed it down, but that\u2019s ok. Noah eats his meals with us as usual, and I try to give him whatever we are eating plus or minus a few things. He likes to shovel the food in so we have to place it in front of him slowly. It is great to share eating times together and has finally brought my husband and I to the dinning room table rather than eating in front of the tv. Offer variety I know that several children with Down syndrome have problems with textures in their mouth. Your OT or ST should be helping with these issues. I encourage you to offer as many different textures as you can. Also try all sorts of different fruits and vegetables so that your child gets used to eating them. It can take something like  7 exposures to a food  before a child will accept it as something they will eat. I find parents often just give the child what they know they will eat rather than branching out and trying new things.  It\u2019s very easy to get into a routine. Obesity is a big risk for our kids, and getting them to eat fruits and vegetables now will only help them in the long run. \u00a0I noticed our friends over at  The Fun House  always offered their children fruits and vegetables at each meal, and their children devoured them. \u00a0They definitely inspired me to be well aware of what I am putting in my child\u2019s mouth. \u00a0Do we venture out to pei wei and pizza\u2026sure. \u00a0But they are being eaten with a fruit or veggie on the side. \ud83d\ude42 What foods did you try with your child first? \u00a0What were you afraid of most? \u00a0What challenges have you faced with feeding?

So bear with us as we catch up, we\u2019re working on it, I promise. \u00a0We want you to enjoy  every minute  so keep coming back to watch this little boy\u2019s story unfold\u2026minute by minute\u2026.day by day. Moving Forward We have started working on Noah moving outside of rolling around on the floor like the biggest roly-poly you have ever seen. This kid can get around, trust me, but we want to see if he can keep his eyes on the prize and  move forward  at the same time. We are talking about  crawling , or  scooting , or whatever he wants to do to  move forward . We\u2019re being a little mean in this video by taunting him with his favorite toys just inches from his little  grasp . \u00a0(We featured this toy in todays video on our top  gifts for children with Down syndrome . \u00a0For less then ten bucks this is one of the  cheapest developmental toys  you\u2019ll ever find, and think it should be in everyone\u2019s toy box.) Actually we aren\u2019t being mean..we are trying to motive him to move\u2026.even just a \u00a0little  bit. \u00a0He\u2019s trying so hard, and I  love  it. \u00a0The little man is so  determined. \u00a0\u00a0You can see him even trying to even use the floor/or activity mat to pull himself forward, if only he didn\u2019t weigh so much he may have launched himself through the air. \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 It\u2019s so much fun watching him try sooooo hard to move forward. You can tell he isn\u2019t interested in staying in one place. He\u2019s \u00a0ready to move forward\u2026no matter what challenges life may bring his way. \u00a0We love that about him, and we also love that we can be right by his side to celebrate every  win . \u00a0We can\u2019t wait to see the look on his face when we finally takes that first crawl. \u00a0It may be hard work, but it\u2019s worth it. Exercises To Help Prepare For Crawling We have been working in  therapy  for several weeks on being in  quardraped  which is the fancy term for  on your hands and knees . We put our leg out and support Noah so that his hands are one side, knees on the other. \u00a0We put toys in front of him to entertain him, and he\u2019ll reach out trying to grab them. The therapists have also worked with him on rocking back and forth in this position so he can gain balance and stability to one day move forward. \u00a0I am sure this will be similar to our  sitting marathons  where his hard work will pay off and Noah WILL move forward and obtain that prize. \u00a0In the mean time we probably need to start safety-proofing our house. Thank you for all of your recent support and encouragement. We are excited you are part of our journey, and we love hearing about yours. \u00a0So please keep sharing with us. \u00a0We really enjoy hearing from you.

{"date": ",August,1,2011", "body": "Rick and I are preoccupied with\u00a0 toys . \u00a0We cannot get enough of playing with Noah and we want him to enjoy every minute. I don\u2019t think that either one of us realized how we would use  toys  to help our child develop and reach his  milestones .\u00a0I think every  developmental  toy from Toys \u2018R Us has visited our home; however most have not made the cut and had to be returned. I\u00a0think I have a pretty good feel now for what Noah likes and what will be helpful. Take for example a  xylophone  that has spinning wheels to play the keys; I knew Noah would like it AND be able to use it.  Knowing what your kid is capable of doing and what interests them is key. Noah really enjoys bright lights like the one his  occupational therapist  sometime uses. Finding a toy with multiple lights has been a challenge for us. If anyone knows of a keyboard in which ALL the keys light up please let us know. Toys and Therapy Sessions This toy obsession has led to a little bit of a problem at our  therapy  sessions. We are known for going straight to Toys \u2018R Us after a session and buying whatever toy he just used. The majority of our toys are purchased this way, and it gets pretty expensive. We even bought Noah a  rody horse  after he rode an  elephant  at physical therapy! I have started looking at  Once Upon a Child  for toys which is a great way to find cheaper (but effective) slightly used\u00a0developmental toys! \u00a0The xylophone mentioned above was one of those finds. If Noah Says It Is A Toy, Then It Is. This week I was wondering what new thing we would be presented with. To my delight Noah was completely entertained with a piece of paper. (Which I totally have already at home!!) And if he rips it, I have plenty of back ups. We have not yet experienced Noah being more entertained with the boxes than the toys, but I am sure that time is just around the corner. And thanks to  Anna  we now know that boxes can definately help out with development. What is your child\u2019s current favorite toy? What is a surprising item that entertained your child?

I wanted to share a little bit about our first experience flying with our 11 month old son (who just happens to have been born with Down syndrome) for those of you curious or about to take your first airplane trip with a baby. Over The River And Through The Air, To Great GrandMother\u2019s House We Fly\u2026. Noah\u2019s going on his first plane ride today. We\u2019re going to Missouri to meet his Great Grandma. I was pretty nervous to travel with Noah, mainly because I was concerned that he was going to be the screaming child that everyone gets annoyed at on the plane. I had a realization though\u2026this is not a movie, people aren\u2019t guaranteed a nice comfy ride to their destination. The true purpose of the plane is to get you from A to B quicker than a car. Every person has the right to do that,  even crying babies . \ud83d\ude42 (Sorry everyone.) Packing (and a travel bargain for parents) You have to bring a lot of stuff when you are traveling with a child. Gone are the days of carrying on all our baggage. This is only a weekend trip but I had to bust out my big suitcase. We packed diapers, food, bottles, and toys. Hopefully the trip back will be a bit lighter thanks to Noah using up some things. One nice thing is that they  check your car seat for free  so we were only paying for the one bag. They will also  check your strollers at the gate for free . It\u2019s great (and\u00a0really\u00a0helpful for traveling parents) that the airlines provide these services for free! Boarding Getting a child on the plane is also a fun adventure. We have our stroller plus the diaper bag and my purse. I think the smartest thing I did was bring a  carrier  as well so that way my hands were free when walking onto the plane. We switched Noah from the stroller to the carrier and checked the stroller at that gate. So being in the carrier made it much easier to get on (and off) the plane. Now, I know that the safest way for my child to travel is in a car seat. However, I do not know too many people who shell out the 200+ dollars to get that extra seat for their child including ourselves. Who can resist free travel for their child? What was really funny is that the flight attendants told me that I couldn\u2019t leave him in the carrier either. I hadn\u2019t planned on that, however I would think it a bit safer for him to be connected to me than to nothing. The Flight \u00a0 Noah did great on the flight. Take off and landing can be the most irritating parts for children as their ears are popping and it can be painful, especially if your child is prone to having fluid in their ears like children with Down syndrome. Some ways to get through this are to have them drink a bottle or suck on a pacifier during these times which helps the ears pop. It is the same theory as adults chewing on gum. Noah made it through take off with no problems. In fact he was quickly asleep and slept through the entire flight. We were flying later at night so it was close to Noah\u2019s bedtime, but flying during sleep times for your children can make your flight a little better. This was a big sigh of relief. Now on to meet Noah\u2019s great grandma. Have your traveled with your child? How did it go? Any tips for travel?

Noah\u00a0 signed his first word \u00a0at 15 months\u2026.and we have Baby Signing Time to thank! Read on and let me tell you why! Communication Is More Than Speech I\u2019ll admit it, I\u00a0 was \u00a0one of those\u00a0 pediatricians \u00a0who asked parents \u201chow many words does your child say?\u201d Thanks to Noah he had broadened my view of communication. Simply changing the phrase to \u201c how does your child communicate with you? \u201d encompasses so much more than speech and is the true meaning of language development. \n \nNoah has learned several ways to communicate with us already. For example, simply crying when he needs something. He\u00a0 babbles \u00a0up a storm, but has not used any consistent phrase for an object including his mom and dad. We started working on sign language several months ago and today his hard work paid off as he\u00a0 signed on his own \u00a0for the first time. I think you can tell by the video that we were very excited and I may have even gotten teary.\u00a0 \u00a0In case you were wondering his first sign was \u201cmore.\u201d Our good friends gave us the\u00a0 Baby Signing Time Volume 1 \u00a0dvd\u00a0as a\u00a0gift when Noah was born. They probably had\u00a0 no idea \u00a0how important and life changing this video would be for us. It was just something they had used and enjoyed with their\u00a0 typically \u00a0developing child. Little did I know how many people in the\u00a0Down syndrome community\u00a0used the Signing Time videos and I can totally see why! I have fessed up earlier in our blog that I was not sold on\u00a0 signing , especially for kids that are typically developing. Watching Noah with this video has changed my mind about signing specifically for children with developmental delays. What is Baby Signing Time? Rachel Coleman \u00a0is the creator of the\u00a0 Signing Time videos . We have stuck with the baby series, however she has two more advanced series that we will likely progress to. Rachel is an amazing mother who has a child who just happens to be deaf. She longed for her child to be able to communicate and for others to be able to communicate with her. She also has a gift for singing and performing (as does Noah\u00a0 \u00a0) so she created these videos and now can be seen on Nick Jr as well as at various live\u00a0performances\u00a0across the country. In fact, I got to meet her last weekend at the\u00a0 New York Buddy Walk \u2026.and I *may* have even cried just a *little*. I couldn\u2019t help it. I\u2019m just so thankful all she does to help our children communicate. Yes, that\u2019s me getting a hug from Rachel.\u00a0 Her daughter is actually one of the stars of the videos which is pretty cool.\u00a0Rachel was blessed with another child who has spina bifida and cerebral palsy. Rachel\u00a0 refused to listen to the doctors \u00a0who said that her daughter would never communicate. Good thing she didn\u2019t listen as her child has gone on to sign as well as verbally communicate beautifully. Rachel is a true inspiration to me as she has taken the challenges in her life and not only helped her children but has helped so many other families who face similar challenges. Does Signing Time Really Work? His first sign! There is research being done to answer the questions I have had about infants and signing. My biggest concern has been that if a child has a sign, why would they learn the word and thus they would actually have speech delay. Rachel has a\u00a0 summary of research \u00a0that was put together by Claire Valloton, PhD, and was an excellent resource that I felt was not printed to sell DVDs but just state the facts. \u00a0Here are some interesting research results included in their summary 5 Awesome Reasons To Teach Your Baby Sign Language \n Typically developing children who were taught sign language had better language skills including larger vocabularies, and used longer sentences by age 2 than children who were not taught sign. This was replicated in other studies. \n Signing activates the same areas of the brain as learning to speak and signing vocabulary can help predict verbal vocabulary. \n Typically developing children who were taught sign starting at 11 months scored an average of 12 points higher on verbal IQ tests in the 2nd grade. \n Ever heard the idea that there are fewer tantrums in children who sign? They show that children will use signs rather than crying or whining when they need something from their parents. (this was not an experimental study) \n Not one of the studies ever showed that signing delayed language development which proved my assumptions wrong. \n What Age Should Your Child Start Watching The Signing\u00a0Time Videos? The research also answered some great questions like: \u201cWhen should I start teaching my child sign\u00a0language?\u201d The earlier you start the sooner your child will do their first sign, however if you start when they are older they will learn signs more rapidly. Typically developing children usually develop signs around 8-11 months and some are older. They stated that they go through a progression of using them as a routine of learning (mimicking you), then they use them to initiate communication or express a need, and finally as a response to others\u2019s words or signs. I was a little disappointed in the results of the research that they summarized for children with Down syndrome . Their research showed that children with Down syndrome can detect the meaning in a gesture as well as typically developing children, however they have a hard time replicating the gesture. I can vouch for that one. They also stated that the those with more\u00a0 severe intellectual difficulties \u00a0may\u00a0 not benefit \u00a0from signing. They felt that those with moderate intellectual difficulties may benefit the same as typical children but there is\u00a0 no research \u00a0backing that up. There was one study that showed that there was no difference in new oral vocabulary in speech only training vs speech + sign training in children with Down syndrome. However using sign language helps an adult with Down syndrome be understood better. \u00a0I think it also helps little ones be better understood, as I figured out pretty quickly that Noah wanted more brownie today. (And he certainly likes that he can tell us when he wants more of something now!) Sometimes It\u2019s Ok To Break the Rules. One concern I had never thought of but should have is that since Noah\u2019s watching these DVD\u2019s either\u00a0on our tv or our iPad we are using TV to teach Noah to sign. The American\u00a0Academy\u00a0of\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0recommends\u00a0 not exposing your child to TV until they are two or older \u00a0to help with the obesity epidemic. I follow a lot of AAP recommendations that my husband teases me about, but\u00a0 this is not one of them . (If you\u2019re getting your fingers ready to write a comment about how we\u2019re bad parents for letting Noah watch\u00a0television\u00a0be sure to read this post on\u00a0balance\u00a0first.) \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 \u00a0 There was also the fun study that came out that showed that the\u00a0 Baby Einstein videos \u00a0actually\u00a0 caused language delay . This is thought to be mainly because the parent was not interacting or reading with the child but relying on the videos. With the idea that\u00a0 parent interaction and reading \u00a0 helps with language development,\u00a0 the best ways to use these videos is sit down and watch them with your child, doing the signs yourself and\u00a0 cheering on your child . What Makes The Baby Signing Time DVD\u2019s So Awesome? You\u2019ll come to love that orange sweater! (And the person behind it.)\u00a0 Each section is a song that helps you learn various signs. The first Baby Signing Time video has one on eating and drinking, pets, family, more, the popular diaper dance, and hurt. The Singing Time songs are really catchy, and I\u2019m not going to deny singing the them around the house. The word is written on the screen, followed by the actions or objects multiple times, it is said multiple times in the song, and they show kids (some even have Down syndrome) using the signs. The videos are able to incorporate so many methods of learning. We have talked previously about how\u00a0 music \u00a0helps with learning so I think she has tapped into a method that really works for Noah. \u00a0One of our friends Gretchen believes that it has helped her child actually learn to sight read and she has a pretty impressive\u00a0 video and blog post \u00a0on the subject. Making Sign Language a \u201cLifestyle\u201d I don\u2019t know why but these videos suck Noah in, it is actually the only TV he really pays attention to, laughs at, and mimics. We usually watch them in the morning while I am making him breakfast. It is important for me to watch them as well as I didn\u2019t know one word of ASL and have learned all my signs from Rachel. I then try to incorporate the signs into our day. I would first help Noah do the signs himself trying to form his hands and do the actions. He would then do the same thing to me making my hands do certain actions which was pretty cute. He would also just stare at me when I was doing the signs and I know he was just trying to figure it out, he gives this look right before he signs in today\u2019s video. And then finally, he figured it out and signed \u201cmore.\u201d Big Thanks To Rachel! Speech delay is\u00a0 common\u00a0characteristic \u00a0in children with Down syndrome. Signing has given my child his voice to communicate with me while his mouth is still figuring it out. I am beyond appreciative to Rachel and what she has done to help people learn a new language and to help our children! Thank you so much Rachel, we\u00a0appreciate\u00a0all that you do. Have you used the Signing Time video to help your child learn to communicate? What was your experience like? Leave a comment below and tell us al about it.

{"date": ",January,8,2012", "body": "If you\u2019ve been following our  story  you may recall that Noah\u2019s pediatric therapy sessions were  upgraded  this past summer to three times a week. \u00a0Since that time they\u2019ve even been  re-upgraded  to four times a week! \u00a0(This little boy works hard!) Thankfully one one of the day we\u2019ve been able to schedule Noah\u2019s occupational and physical therapy visits on the same day which is nice since it means that we only have to drive to his therapy appointments three times a week instead of four. \u00a0Truth be told since Noah has such  great therapists  who are committed to helping him  succeed , we\u00a0don\u2019t mind taking him at all\u2026even if we did have to drive there four times a week. \u00a0We\u2019re just thankful for all the incredible therapies that are available today for kids like Noah. The Physical Therapy Trifecta It\u2019s so much fun watching this kid grow and develop. \u00a0I hope you don\u2019t mind me repeating myself over, and over on various posts on this site\u2026but as you can probably tell\u2026..I\u2019m\u00a0 crazy proud  of this little boy! \u00a0This kid works out more in one thirty minute therapy session than I do all week. \u00a0I know that\u2019s not saying much, but just check out a few of the exercises he rocked by hitting\u00a0the \u201c3-awesome-physical-thearpy-exercises-in-one-visit\u201d trifecta! \u00a0Wouldn\u2019t you be proud? \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 3 Awesome And Effective Physical Therapy Exercises Exercise Ball We\u2019ve already talked about the effectiveness of an  exercise ball for children with Down syndrome \u00a0so it should go with out saying that we\u00a0think it\u2019s awesome! \u00a0It\u00a0can greatly help with your child\u2019s balance, reaction,  core strength , propping, and lots more! Not to mention it can be combined with one of our favorite toys for a cheap and  easy physical therapy exercise  you can do at your own house. Treadmill Training Noah recently started doing  treadmill training , and we think it\u2019s great! \u00a0 Dr. Dale Ulrich  and his team at the University of Michigan are doing some\u00a0 amazing research  on the effectiveness of \u00a0using treadmill therapy for children with Down syndrome and autism. \u00a0According to his website their research is helping to, \u201c\u2026.maximize physical activity, motor skill development, community participation, and quality of life in children with Down syndrome and autism.\u201d Wow\u2026Now that\u2019s the sort of stuff that gets me excited about the future of children born with Down syndrome! I\u2019m thankful for organizations like the  School of Kinesiology at the University of Michigan , the  Stanford Down Syndrome Research Center , the  Pierce-Shimomura Lab  at the University of Texas, the  Down Syndrome Research and Treatment Foundation , and countless others. \u00a0Their cutting edge research is helping to improve the quality of life for  all children , \u00a0not just children born with Down syndrome and autism. In fact it\u2019s research like theirs that makes this the \u201cB est time in the history of the world to be born with Down syndrome!\u201d (As someone lovingly told me shortly after Noah was born.) Swing There\u2019s not much I need to say about the swing. \u00a0It\u2019s a swing. \u00a0It\u2019s awesome. \u00a0It\u2019s helpful. \u00a0Noah can\u2019t get enough of it. \u00a0The swing rocks\u2026\u2026 The swing is typical . \u00a0Can you tell we really like the swing? \ud83d\ude42 It\u2019s fun watching Noah reach out and grab the big ropes that hold the swing up. \u00a0His tiny little hands barely wrap around them\u2026. \u2026but that doesn\u2019t stop him! \u00a0This kid is  determined . \u00a0And I love it! Now you see why we are so ridiculously proud of our  little  boy? \u00a0Man, oh man how we love this kid. What sort of things are your children doing in their therapy sessions these days? \u00a0Do you (or have you) used any of these exercise tools with your little one before? \u00a0How did he or she (and you!) like them? \u00a0I want to hear your story.

{"date": ",October,31,2012", "body": "Noah has been working on his  pincer grasp \u00a0(which is a huge  milestone  for any child) for awhile and he has not quite mastered it yet. Noah is motor driven, just not fine motor driven. We\u2019ve talked about the  development of a child\u2019s grasp  previously and how  understanding your child\u2019s grasp  determines what they are able to interact with from food to toys. Once I understood Noah\u2019s grasp, I realized that I was asking a lot for him to  pick up puffs  at 9 months of age and so I  switched to a banana  which he was able to bring to his mouth with ease. Our occupational therapist has given us several activities to work on to help him develop his pincer grasp which is last stage of grasp development. Feel free to try some of these with your child. 1. Socks On Your Hands I am not going to lie, there are a few activities that we don\u2019t do at home, and one reason Noah may be lacking in his pincer grasp is it is not a top priority at home. (Like we always say, we aren\u2019t perfect parents by any means.) \ud83d\ude42 Our occupational therapist told us we could but socks on his hands with a hole cut out for his pointer finger and thumb so that he can only use his pincer grasp to pick things up.\u00a0We were not big fans of this, but it does work. 2. Using An Ice Tray For Dinner Putting pick up foods in an ice tray forces Noah to use just his pointer and thumb to pick up food. It is the only two fingers that fit down into those tight spaces. I will admit this works great and Noah used those fingers without problems with this method. We should do this more now that I am thinking of it. 3. Pulling Nobs Out Of Dough This is an activity that must be closely watched as you are going to use items that are marked for age 3+ due to  choking hazards . Our therapist likes to use  Pop Beads . \u00a0She buries them in therapy dough,  Theraputty \u00a0(that is what they call it, it reminds me of silly putty) and Noah has to pull them out. It is much easier to get them out when you use your pincer grasp than the other variations. We do this almost every therapy session. By the way, another fun and easy to do at home activity is to make \u201c Cloud Dough .\u201d Has your child mastered the pincer grasp yet? What activities did you do?

Let me explain. My Wife\u2019s A Superhero \u201cSuperhero: a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also : an exceptionally skillful or successful person\u201d We\u2019re out of town today and I only have about 5 minutes to write this blog post before heading out for the day.

{"date": ",August,29,2012", "body": "I\u2019m not sure exactly when it happened, but sometime after our first child was\u00a0 born \u00a0I became a\u00a0 toy\u00a0connoisseur . I\u2019ve learned to judge a toy by more than it\u2019s fun-looking cover. I\u2019ve learned to notice how loud the toy\u2019s volume is, how\u00a0bright\u00a0it lights up, and even how a\u00a0certain\u00a0toy helps my child with Down syndrome develop and learn. Prior to having a little boy born with\u00a0developmental\u00a0delays (our son was  born with\u00a0Down syndrome ) I thought toys were just, well, toys. Boy was I ever wrong! Toys have a purpose\u2026. As it\u00a0turns\u00a0out all those bright, loud, colorful (and sometimes\u00a0annoying) baby toys actually serve a\u00a0 developmental purpose!  That\u2019s right toys help teach our kids! I remember when Noah first started going to\u00a0 occupational\u00a0therapy \u00a0(at\u00a0only a few weeks old!) I wondered what the purpose of all those visits were since it looked like all he was doing was playing with toys. (Something we could easily have done at home\u2026.for free.)\u00a0 I quickly learned he wasn\u2019t just playing with toys,\u00a0 he was learning \u2026.developing\u2026.getting smarter and stronger!\u00a0His tiny little brain was growing and developing. And that\u2019s a\u00a0 parenting\u00a0win !\u00a0 \u00a0 In fact, my wife even\u00a0 wrote an article \u00a0about how toys and\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapy go hand in hand. I\u2019ve watched Noah play with\u00a0 lots\u00a0 of developmental toys, and there are a handful that have really stood out. And not simply\u00a0because\u00a0he\u00a0enjoys\u00a0playing with them, but\u00a0because\u00a0of how how well\u00a0 they help him learn . In fact, almost all of the toys I\u00a0mention\u00a0on this list have been used by his physical or\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapist\u00a0as they help him work on his\u00a0 developmental milestones . 7 Developmental Toys For Children With Down Syndrome Friends\u00a0and family sometimes wonder what the best toys are for a child with Down syndrome when\u00a0birthday\u2019s\u00a0and Christmas\u2019s roll around. Some wonder if you need to buy special toys for a child with\u00a0 special needs . The truth of the matter is kids are kids. When trying to pick out what to buy a baby with Down syndrome as present, a person should do the same thing they would do for any other child; check out the age\u00a0requirements\u00a0for the toy printed on the front of the toy\u2019s\u00a0packaging. The\u00a0developmental\u00a0goals for children at this age are pretty much the same regardless of if the child was born with Down syndrome or not. With that being said, there are certain\u00a0developmental\u00a0goals that parents raising children with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0really try to\u00a0focus\u00a0on to help them grow and\u00a0develop; one\u00a0of those being\u00a0 developing\u00a0their core , and many\u00a0of these toys will help a child do just that. In fact, if you look through Noah\u2019s\u00a0 therapy\u00a0videos , you\u2019ll see him using many of these toys during his\u00a0therapy\u00a0appointments. All of these toys are one we personally own, and that Noah plays with on a daily basis. (And on a random side note, they all turned out to be Fisher Price Learning Toys!) If you are trying to find a good developmental toy for your toddler, or baby, this list is a good start. One other thing I like about these toys is they will grow with your child. You\u2019ll find that you can use them in different ways, to work (and play) on\u00a0different\u00a0goals for your child. Many of these toys we had before Noah could even\u00a0 sit up \u00a0on his own, and at 20 months old he still gets daily use out of them! Talk about a\u00a0 toy win! \u00a0 1. Fisher-Price Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage\u00a0 The\u00a0 Fisher-Price Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage \u00a0is without a doubt our favorite toy on this list! Noah has played with toys more than any other toy he owns. If you look at the link I posted you\u2019ll notice this toy has a\u00a0 ton \u00a0of great reviews on Amazon, so I\u2019m not alone in saying how great this toy is. (In fact, when I mentioned it on our\u00a0 Facebook page \u00a0once, I had a ton of comments from other parents saying how much their child liked it as well. I think the reason it\u2019s such a hit is\u00a0because\u00a0of how many different things this toy does. It has a mirror, and what child doesn\u2019t like looking at\u00a0them self\u00a0in a mirror? It lights up. It plays music. It has a big orange button they can press on the front of it. And, here\u2019s a super random thing about this toy\u2026.every once in a while the toy will play some fun kid music followed by the phrase, \u201cYou\u2019re a star!\u201d Do you know what Noah\u2019s first word was?\u00a0 STAR ! Now I have no idea if that\u2019s because he heard that word so much while playing with this toy, but that\u2019s my best guess. Funny, huh? Anyway, I can\u2019t\u00a0recommend\u00a0this sing-along stage enough! 2. Fisher Price Roll-a-Rounds Swirlin Surprise\u00a0Gumball\u00a0Machine The\u00a0 Fisher Price Roll-a-Rounds Swirlin Surprise Gumball machine \u00a0is another one of Noah\u2019s favorite\u2019s. The\u00a0gum ball\u00a0machine comes with these fun\u00a0sensory\u00a0balls that your child can drop in the top. They then press the handle which\u00a0causes\u00a0the balls to drop down the little spiral and out the front of the toy. The best part is when the balls drop down, the toy lights up and plays fun music that Noah really enjoys. In the last few months Noah has gotten\u00a0really\u00a0good at pressing the handle and watching the balls come flying out.

{"date": ",July,16,2012", "body": "First birthday parties are a big deal\u2026for parents. I am fairly certain that no one remembers their first birthday, however parents cherish it forever and may go a little overboard. I was a little late to the starting gate on Noah\u2019s theme. I had no idea what to do and finally got inspiration from  Facebook . Our friends posted pictures of their rubber ducky themed party, and I thought that was such a great idea as Noah really loves  baths . My next thoughts went like this: \u2026.hmmm, I wish I had thought of that\u2026.think they will notice if I steal their idea\u2026probably they will likely be there\u2026.Noah\u2019s favorite bath toy is a floating penguin\u2026it is winter\u2026let\u2019s have a penguin party!!!! Thus the theme for our party. Preparation for the party\u2026. I will be the first to admit that I am no Martha Stewart (or  Kelle Hampton ; who by the way throws some pretty amazing parties!)\u00a0Preparing for a party with a theme was fairly intimidating. Thanks to  Pinterest  I got some great ideas\u2026none of which I was able to replicate.\u00a0I went back to my days in kindergarten for decoration inspiration and cut out about 20 snowflakes from folded paper. \u00a0I couldn\u2019t remember for the life of me how to fold one, but thankfully Martha Stewart actually has a  tutorial  on how to make snowflakes which really helped me out. I made cupcakes that looked either like Elvis or a penguin, you decide. \u00a0 We played the arctic part of  Planet Earth  in the background hoping the kids wouldn\u2019t notice the killer whales eating the seals. \ud83d\ude42 And thanks to my mom giving Noah an awesome  penguin beach ball  when we visited my  grandma \u00a0for Noah\u2019s pre-pre-birthday party (yes, this is actually his  3rd  first birthday party!) I had about 32 inflated penguin guests that magically disappeared from my house when the party was over. I have never fed a lot of small children. I am having enough issues trying to figure out how to  feed just one , but I figured pizza would make the majority pretty happy. We had blue jello to mimic ice. And some other little things to nibble on. The food was probably not the highlight. I also set up some activities as I knew older children would be here as well. \u00a0There was penguin bowling and make your own penguin ornament. \u00a0Kids were much more interested in our own toys than the activities we set up. Party Time There is one thing that has happened with Noah having  Down syndrome , we have more friends than I can fit in my house. Thanks to our awesome  local Down syndrome support group , the mommy and me group, plus some other awesome friends we were packed. And no matter how hard you try to tell people you don\u2019t need a gift\u2026they will bring you one. I do the same thing despite what any invitation may say. We were so blessed by our friends. \u00a0 Noah got to experience his third and final  smash cake . I must say his last one was not his best show. I think he was kind of like \u201cagain mom????\u201d I was also made fun of for putting him in his apron like bib\u2026hey people I have learned my lesson \ud83d\ude42 The most humorous part of the party was during the picture taking. Our party was supposed to end at 2 and I kid you not when the clock struck 2 our son just laid his head on the floor and went to sleep. It was the perfect ending to a weeklong celebration. Noah is 1! On a more personal note I can\u2019t believe I have a one year old. It is crazy to think where we were a year ago. I understand why people write letters to their children on their first birthday. I look back at how I handled his diagnosis at birth and wonder what in the world I was so upset about and I feel the urge to shower my child with love and acceptance. I look at Noah smile at us and light up our lives and I just can\u2019t imagine one moment without him. As Rick has mentioned I wish we could go back to when Noah was born and tell ourselves a few things (or maybe\u00a0 12 things )\u00a0but there are emotions you have to work through at the beginning, and everyone does that at their own pace. I won\u2019t sit here and say there are not tears,  fears  and struggles but that is true of ANY child. As we  celebrated every one of Noah\u2019s chromosomes today , I know I wouldn\u2019t change one ounce (or one chromosome) about him. Happy Birthday Noah! Your mom and dad love you very much!

{"date": ",June,23,2012", "body": "I was extremely humbled when\u00a0recently\u00a0contacted by  AbilityPath.org  advising me that I had been selected as one of their \u201c Rad Dad\u2019s. \u201d \u00a0During our interview I had a great time talking about the joys of being a dad, including some of the\u00a0unique\u00a0characteristics\u00a0of being a\u00a0father of a son born with  Down syndrome . I want to add that I\u2019m just one of the  many  dads out there who are  totally in love  with their family.\u00a0To all of you other dads (and mommies) who are out there rocking it, thank you so much for all of your hard work! It\u2019s been an honor meeting so many incredible parents through this site, and our  Facebook page . If you haven\u2019t checked out AbilityPath.org you should. They are\u00a0committed\u00a0to helping parents and their families, and that\u2019s something I\u2019m all about! I\u2019ll let you check out their site on your own, but here\u2019s a little sneak peak from their  about page . AbilityPath.org\u2019s mission is to build a community that brings together professionals and parents of children with special needs from around the globe to learn, share and strengthen the process of supporting the ongoing healthy development of children and youth with special needs and disabilities. I enjoy supporting and promoting\u00a0organizations\u00a0like these, and I encourage you to check them out on  Twitter  and  Facebook  as well. One thing I really love about families is that every parent has the potential to become a  game changing parent . Sadly, many don\u2019t believe they are, or have the potential to be. But they do! Other parents think the school, the church, or the grandparents should function as their child\u2019s game changing  parent . The truth is all of those are poor substitutes for a parent. If you\u2019re a parent you have the ability to be the  best parent in the world for your child! I\u2019m no parenting expert, but I wanted to share a few things I\u2019ve learned to help you become a game changing parent. 1. There Are No Time Machines. Being a \u201cRad Dad\u201d is a passion of mine\u2026and not just the \u2018Rad Dad\u201d of the month on AbilityPath.org. I\u2019m talking about the minute to minute, day to day, ins and outs of parenthood. I love it.\u00a0In fact I\u2019ve given my entire life to supporting,\u00a0encouraging, and loving on families. Now this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a perfect parent by any means, but but it does mean that next to my relationship with God, my relationship with my family takes priority. It means that I try to be very intentional about my son knowing every day how much I love him, how  proud  I am of him, and how much God loves him and has a great purpose for his life. It breaks my heart when I hear the\u00a0countless\u00a0sorties of dads who aren\u2019t being dads. Dads who walked out on their\u00a0families. Dads who  couldn\u2019t handle \u00a0raising a child with special needs (Give me a break.) Dads who haven\u2019t spoken to their children (or the wives) in years. Dads who enjoy  hanging with the guys , more than growing, developing, loving on and raising their children. And the list goes on and on. I don\u2019t think these fathers\u00a0realize\u00a0the impact their  current actions  have on their\u00a0 future\u00a0children . I don\u2019t think these fathers understand that the greatest influence (either\u00a0positive\u00a0or negative) in a child\u2019s life is their parents. I don\u2019t think these fathers know they have the potential of being a Rad Dad themselves. Like I said, being a \u201cRad Dad,\u201d a dad that is pouring into his wife and children, isn\u2019t a one time thing. It\u2019s not a monthly \u201cwinner.\u201d It\u2019s a lifestyle. It\u2019s something you work on every day of your life. Somedays you you fail. Somedays you win. But you keep working on it. Everyday. But the point is you are committed to being a  game changing dad! I\u2019ve met lots of dads who wish they had a time machine so could travel back in time and be the kind of dad they wish they would have been. Consider this your time machine. No matter what sort of relationship you\u2019ve had with your children, today can be the day you turn it all around. God has the ability to build things back up much faster than it took us to tear them down. Trust me. (By the way, even  if you didn\u2019t grow up with a good dad , you can still be one yourself!) Dad\u2019s it\u2019s time to step up. It\u2019s worth it.\u00a0There is no greater influence in the life of a child than their parents. (For better or for worse.) 2. Don\u2019t Get Fooled By Facebook. We live in a world where (real) transparency is almost non existent. We have  Facebook , where at any time we can jump on our newsfeed to see countless pictures of all the fun (and expensive) vacations our friends are on. See more pictures of all the great meals they always seem to be eating. And read an endless supply of status updates about all the fun stuff their doing\u2026and you aren\u2019t. Oh and let\u2019s not forget all the nice cars and toys they always seem to be buying (and posting pictures of.) It  almost  looks like everyone has a more fun, active, and happy life than you. In fact, if you\u2019re part of our Facebook page you\u2019ll see I post tons of pictures of Noah. Pretty much every picture I post gets a ton of \u201clikes\u201d and comments. In fact people often leave comments like, \u201cWow, you take great photos!\u201d \u201cYou post the best photos!,\u201d etc, etc\u2026 I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret. Often times I take 20, 30, 50, pictures to get that one good one that you saw on Facebook. I just don\u2019t post\u00a0the bad ones. So for every one good picture you see, there\u2019s 50 more you\u2019ll never see, because they weren\u2019t any good. So the truth is I don\u2019t think great pictures, I take bad ones. Lots of them. You just don\u2019t see them. You see where I\u2019m going with this? 3. Nobody (and no family) is perfect. Never forget this. If you read this blog, or follow me on Facebook, you may think our family is perfect. That we have it \u201call down\u201d (pun intended.) That all we do is take fun pictures and videos of our son, take him to  ride dinosaurs  and see  dolphins , and write blog posts all day. \ud83d\ude42 You know why? Because that\u2019s mostly what I share. I\u2019m not going to post a video of the argument my wife and I got into on the way home from church one day. I\u2019m not going to post a picture of the time Noah threw up all over me (several times.) In fact, this weekend I\u2019m doing some yard work, but you\u2019ll never see any pictures and videos of it. It\u2019s just boring, typical, run of the mill stuff. Nothing exciting about it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I try to be transparent about our life. In fact I\u2019ve shared lots of posts on this blog about  fear , worry, and the whole nine yards. But my wife and I will be the first to admit we are  far from perfect parents . We mess up. A lot. We don\u2019t do everything the physical therapist tells us to do with Noah. (Shhhhhh, don\u2019t tell her though.) We let Noah watch tv. We\u2019ve given Noah fast food. (It was however  In-N-Out burger  which is so good I\u2019m not 100% sure you can really call it fast food.) \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 We get into arguments from time to time. We are just your typical family trying hard to love \u00a0God, our family, and others the best way we can.\u00a0Some days we do an ok job at this, other days\u2026not so much. But the last thing we ever want anyone to think is that we have it all together, or somehow know more than anyone else out there. We don\u2019t. Not by a long shot. We value all of your comments on the blog and on Facebook, and read every single one of them. You guys teach us so much, and it\u2019s so wonderful to be on this parenting journey with so many game changing parents! I want to remind you that there are  no perfect families .\u00a0My friend  Reggie Joine r says this: \u201cBoth the church and the home are comprised of broken, imperfect people through whom God has chosen to tell His story.\u201d God isn\u2019t interested in  perfect . He knows there is only One Perfect Person whose ever lived\u2026 and it isn\u2019t you!\u00a0 What He is interested in is telling great stories through not-so-great people. (But don\u2019t take my word for it, just pick up a Bible.) I just want to encourage you today, that no matter how things have been in the life of your family, let today be a new start. Let today be the day you start giving your children the  gifts they really want . There are no perfect families. They don\u2019t exist. Every family is in in process. Let\u2019s throw away the stock images of families that seem to have it all together. Let\u2019s stop pretending we\u2019re something we\u2019re not. Let today be a game changing day in the life of your family. Let today be the today every thing changes. I believe you. Parents, do you have any tip to help us become game changing parents?

{"date": ",October,26,2012", "body": "Noah has been  pushing his walker  for awhile now. His favorite would be the  Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! Stride-to-Ride Dino \u00a0that he is using in today\u2019s video. (Which also made our list of  top toys .) We\u2019ve\u00a0been trying to get him to walk on different surfaces since he is becoming a pro on the carpet in  our house . Today we took him out in the backyard to get to experience walking on grass for the first time. The options for different textures that your child can walk on are endless from sand, tile, gym mats, to puddles just to name a few. All of these different surfaces are helpful not only with walking but also with  sensory development . Balance and Muscle Control \n Just look at that balance! Walking on sand, grass, and other softer surfaces activates different muscles than walking on a hard surfaces. The child is having to counteract the movement of the surface with their body, especially their  core  (better known as balance). Balance is something that a lot of children with  Down syndrome  can struggle with due to hypotonia and changing up their walking surface challenges this weakness. We all know that we get a much better workout if we go running in the sand than around the track for the same reasons. It is also the theory behind those popular shoes that are supposed to tone the lower body (are those working for anyone?). It will help the child become even more controlled on a firm surface helping them master walking. Resistance Changing up the surface with a push toy in particular will change the resistance the child is working against. Grass and sand offer a lot of resistance so the child really has to push, where as tile may cause a face plant the first few times you try it out as the toy can get away from them. Even carpet was initially hard for Noah as the toys could get away from him too quickly, so putting him in the grass offered him a way to push the toy on his own as well as build muscles. \u00a0The resistance also activates the core, and if you have learned just one thing from our therapy visits it is that the core is the center of the majority of motor milestones. Sensory Integration Keeping those feet bare will help with sensory integration for the child as well. We have talked about how  swings  are also important for this as well. \u00a0Experiencing textures helps their brain process all the different sensations from the poking of grass, to the coolness of tile. I encourage you to get the added benefit of plopping your child down on surfaces so their hands can get the benefit too. Noah is not a big fan of touching grass, but the more exposure he gets the better he does. Sand is an awesome texture for sensory integration as they can really dig their toes and fingers into it. We\u2019ve heard shaving cream is pretty awesome too, but we aren\u2019t quite ready for that mess at our house. By the way, be sure to check out this list of our favorite  fisher price developmental toys ! Does your child like walking on a particular texture? Any unique ideas for textures to try?

{"date": ",July,8,2012", "body": "Today is Noah\u2019s first birthday! Wow\u2026! It\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s  been a year  since our son was born. It\u2019s true what they say, time really does fly\u2026and even more so when your a parent it seems. Since  Noah\u2019s  first birthday falls on a weekday, we decided to wait and have his\u00a0 official \u00a0birthday party on Saturday to make it easier on Noah\u2019s friends and family to come. (No one likes rushing to a child\u2019s birthday party as soon as they get off work.) But as you can tell from the pictures, and today\u2019s video, he certainly enjoyed his pre-birthday party! Not to mention he\u2019s already had a  pre-pre-birthday party ! Does this kid know how to party or what? Our next post will be all about Noah\u2019s first birthday party (and the awesome\u00a0penguin\u00a0themed party my wife planned) so today I thought I\u2019d share a few thoughts about raising a child with Down syndrome a year into our journey. The day that changed our life. As I mentioned above, it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been a year since our  wonderful pediatrician  came into that cold hospital room where we were waiting with excitement to see our little boy and told the news that would forever change our life: \u201cYour son has features that are consistent with Trisomy\u00a021.\u201d In other words;  Your son has Down syndrome. If you\u2019ve read  Noah\u2019s birth story , you know that our son\u2019s  Down syndrome  diagnosis was a total surprise to us. We had no idea our son had Down syndrome until a few hours after he was born. We thought everything was perfectly normal and they were just giving him the world\u2019s longest bath as we waited for the nurse to bring him to us. It turns out they were actually just trying to reach our pediatrician (it was after-hours) and wait for her to arrive at the hospital so she could be the one to  break the news  to us; which I\u00a0describe\u00a0in more detail  here . I\u2019ll never in my life forget those few minutes when our pediatrician told us Noah had Down syndrome. It was like everything went in slow motion. I couldn\u2019t speak (and if you know me, you know that\u2019s a rare occurrence!) I didn\u2019t know\u00a0what to think. What to do. What that meant for our son. For our family. For our life. I was\u00a0scared. In fact it was one of the scariest moments of my entire life. (Little did I know things were about to get a  lot more scarier .) A crash course in parenting\u2026and Down\u00a0syndrome. There are so many thoughts going through my mind as I write this post one year later. So many things I want to say, but again find myself at a loss for words. I\u2019m overcome with emotion as I reflect on the last year and how our life has changed (in a good way) because of our son Noah. We had a few scares over the last year, learned more about Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0in the last year than most people learn in their life time, and most of all; we\u2019ve had a blast being first time parents! I mean seriously, I knew I was gong to enjoy being a father, but this is\u00a0ridiculous. I\u00a0absolutely\u00a0love it! And as for all of those\u00a0 parenting\u00a0fears  I had when Noah was born;\u00a0they\u2019re long gone. Noah having Down syndrome has just sort of faded into the background of our family. It\u2019s our  normal .\u00a0Noah having Down syndrome is the same as me having green eyes, or two hands. It\u2019s just him. No biggy. In fact the only time I really think about it is when we have to go in for a  CBC , those still scare me\u2026but that\u2019s another post for another day. \ud83d\ude42 There is no parenting time machine I\u2019ve mentioned before there is no such thing as a  parenting time machine  so I can\u2019t go back in time and\u00a0tell myself things I wish I knew at the time. It\u2019s impossible. However, maybe I can be that time machine for someone else. Today on our son\u2019s first birthday I\u2019d like to share a few things I wish I could go back in time and tell myself when we first learned of our son\u2019s Down syndrome diagnosis. If you\u2019re a new parent of a child born with Down syndrome consider this your  parenting time machine \u00a0and that these words are coming from your future self. \ud83d\ude42 (I\u2019m so strange\u2026.) If you are a new parent I\u2019d also encourage you to check out this post with over 300 suggestions of  what to say to someone who has just\u00a0received\u00a0a Down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis ; it\u2019s jammed packed with\u00a0encouragement\u00a0from other parents raising a child with Down syndrome. A quick disclaimer: When Noah was born  everything I knew about Down syndrome I learned from watching TV , seriously. So remember that these\u00a0statements\u00a0are\u00a0from the perspective of a total rookie to the Down syndrome world. Like I mentioned before I know much more now than a year ago. \ud83d\ude42 Also I was going to go into detail on each of these\u00a0statements, but the post is already pretty long as is. If you have any questions on what I meant by any of them please be sure to leave a comment and I\u2019ll\u00a0elaborate. 12 Things I wish I knew the day our son\u00a0received\u00a0a Down syndrome diagnosis 1. Noah being born with Down syndrome doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s sick or unhealthy. 2. Noah\u2019s not going to be a  vegetable . In fact, far from it. 3. Noah\u2019s going to laugh and play just like every other kid. 4. Noah shares more things in common with a child without Down syndrome than differences. 5. In a few weeks your son having Down syndrome won\u2019t be a big deal. 6. You\u2019re going to have the ability to make a huge impact in the world. 7. You\u2019re going to have so much fun with your son. In fact, you\u2019re going to have even more fun than you ever imagined! 8.  You aren\u2019t alone. 9. You\u00a0didn\u2019t just exchange a happy story for a sad one. 10. Other people\u2019s stories aren\u2019t your stories. 11. Stay off internet. 12. You and your family are going to be just fine. Whew\u2026.that\u2019s a mouth full, huh? (See, I told you I\u2019m not normally short on words!) \ud83d\ude42 There are so many more things I could say about each of those\u00a0statements, but I think you get the idea. If I could just say one thing\u2026 In fact, if I could go back in time and just tell myself one thing when I first learned Noah had Down syndrome (which would pretty much just be a summary of all of the above) it would be: Rick, things are going to be just fine, trust me. This next year is going to be the best year of your life. I know it doesn\u2019t feel that way now, but trust me on this one! And today, one year later, on my son\u2019s first birthday, I can confirm 100% that the above\u00a0statement\u00a0is\u00a0true. This year\u00a0truly\u00a0has been the best year of my life. There are no words to describe how much I love my son and how much joy he brings to our life. I love every second of being this little boy\u2019s dad! What\u2019s one thing you wish you could travel back in time in tell yourself when you first had your child? (Regardless of if they were born with Down syndrome or not.) Please take a second to leave a comment and let us know. Don\u2019t forget your comment could be just the thing that someone else needs to hear!

{"date": ",January,2,2012", "body": "If you were browsing through this week\u2019s  Target  ad you may have passed right over the adorable little boy in the bright orange shirt smiling at you on page 9! \u00a0And if so, I\u2019m glad! The reason I\u2019m glad? \u00a0Well, that stylish young man in the orange shirt is  Ryan Langston . Ryan just so happened to have been born with  Down syndrome ,\u00a0and I\u2019m glad that Target included a model with down syndrome in their  typical  ad! \ud83d\ude42 This wasn\u2019t a \u201c Special Clothing For Special People \u201d catalog. \u00a0There wasn\u2019t a call out somewhere on the page proudly proclaiming that \u201c Target\u2019s proud to feature a model with Down syndrome in this week\u2019s ad! \u201d \u00a0And they didn\u2019t even ask him to model a shirt with the phrase, \u201c We Aren\u2019t All Angels \u201d printed on the front. In other words, they didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it. \u00a0I like that. 5 Things Target Said By Not Saying Anything Even though Target didn\u2019t make a big deal out of the fact they used a boy with Down syndrome as a model in their ad, they said plenty. \u00a0They said the same things that  Nordstrom  said when they used Ryan as a model in their  catalog  this past summer. \u00a0I could list a hundred things Target said by running this ad, let me give you 5 that\u00a0immediately\u00a0come to mind: \n They said that  people born with Down syndrome  deserve to be treated the  same  as every other person on this planet. \n They said that it\u2019s time for organizations to be  intentional  about seeking creative ways to help promote  inclusion , not exclusion. \u00a0(It\u2019s no accident that Target used a model with Down syndrome in this ad; it was an intentional decision. \u00a0If we want the world to be a place where e everyone is treated equal \u00a0we can\u2019t just sit around and watch the days tick away. \u00a0We have to be intentional. \u00a0We have to do something.) \n They said that companies don\u2019t have to call attention to the fact that they choose to be  inclusive \u00a0in order for people to notice their support for people with disabilities. In fact, by  not  making a big deal out of it they are doing a  better  job of showing their support for the special needs community. \n They said it\u2019s important for the world to see people born with disabilities with a fresh set of eyes. \u00a0That it\u2019s time for us to lay down all the inaccurate stereotypes from the past and move forward embracing the future with  true and accurate  ones \n They said you don\u2019t have to spend a lot for your kids to look good! \u00a0(I mean come on, that shirt\u2019s only five bucks!) \n The Future Is Bright (Our son\u2019s pretty cute, huh?) \ud83d\ude42 One of the reasons I started this site was to give the world an\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to\u00a0see first hand what it\u2019s like raising a child born with Down syndrome. I had this crazy idea that if I could give the world a window into the life of a family raising a child with\u00a0 special needs\u00a0 it would help them see that people like my son are much more  typical  than they may think. I believe the story we are telling by posting a daily one minute video of our son\u2019s story is doing just that. I also have this crazy dream that together we can use social media to help spread the message that children born with disabilities deserve  love,\u00a0 not  pity . \u00a0But I can\u2019t do it alone. I need your help. Would you please help spread that message by clicking the \u2018like\u201d button that appears right below this post,  tweeting  this post out to your twitter followers, and posting it on your  Facebook  wall? Please be sure to leave your email in the box below and stay up to date on all of our newest posts. Enter your email address:       The story we are telling is one that we believe needs to be shared. \u00a0Will you help us share it? I\u2019ve never been more excited about the future of individuals born with disabilities. \u00a0The possibilities are endless, and the future looks bright! To Target: As a father of a son born with a disability I want to sincerely thank you. \u00a0I hope that more companies choose to follow the great example that you guys have set. \u00a0By choosing to embrace the exciting future and limitless opportunities for people like my son, organizations like yours are leading the way in showing the world that our world isn\u2019t forced to live in the past. \n Thank you Target. \u00a0By not saying anything, you said a lot. What do you think about\u00a0companies who understand the importance of including people born with special needs? \u00a0When\u00a0companies do this\u00a0correctly, like Target and Nordstrom have,\u00a0does it influence your decision to shop\u00a0with\u00a0them more?

It was a quick trip, but we were glad we were able to go for a few reasons: Noah\u2019s picture was selected to be in the National Down\u00a0Syndrome\u00a0Society\u2019s Times Square kick off video (which we talk about in this\u00a0interview.) In\u00a0addition\u00a0we wanted to be a part of the NDSS 2012\u00a0 Buddy Walk \u00a0in Central Park. We had a super fun time\u00a0hanging\u00a0out with old friends, and meeting lots of new ones who we\u2019ve meet through this blog and our\u00a0 Facebook page . I can\u2019t wait to share some more images and videos of our time in\u00a0 New York \u00a0later this week (We just got home a little while ago and I\u2019m way too\u00a0tired\u00a0to get them up tonight.)\u00a0 However I did want to quickly share this photo of Noah crossing the finish line in Central Park.

{"date": ",August,31,2012", "body": "Today is day 4 of Noah\u2019s\u00a0 first trip to New York , and let me tell you, for a 1 year old, this kid\u00a0 knows how to have fun \u00a0in the Big Apple! \u00a0Yesterday we had a great time hanging out with Ryan Langston, the young\u00a0model with Down syndrome, and his family. And today we had the\u00a0privilege\u00a0of meeting a\u00a0pioneer\u00a0in the Down syndrome community, Chris Burke. Before Becky, there was Corky! When you think of actors (or\u00a0actresses) with Down syndrome you may think of\u00a0 Lauren Potter \u00a0who plays Becky Jackson on\u00a0 Glee . But way before Becky ever put on her cheerleading outfit, Chris Burke was playing the role of Corky on the\u00a0television\u00a0show\u00a0 Life Goes On . Life Goes On aired between 1989-1993, and revolved around a family of four, the Thacher\u2019s. Chris Burke played the role of Corky Thacher and basically gave the world a window into what life is like raising a child with Down syndrome. (Much like what we\u2019re trying to do with our website!) \n \nHere\u2019s a little known fact about how Life Goes On got its start. Chris Burke\u2019s first acting job was in the movie\u00a0 Desperate . ABC producers saw the movie and enjoyed Chris\u2019s acting so much they asked the\u00a0executive\u00a0producer (Michael Braverman) to create an entire\u00a0television\u00a0program around \u00a0Chris Burke, and Life Goes On was born. Doesn\u2019t Chris Burke look great?! Pretty awesome, and forward thinking, don\u2019t you think. (Especially\u00a0considering\u00a0this was the late 80\u2032s!) Way to go ABC! (Note to any\u00a0television\u00a0executives that may be reading this;\u00a0I\u2019d love to see more\u00a0television\u00a0programs include\u00a0people\u00a0with special needs. I think it really helps our\u00a0culture to put away inaccurate\u00a0stereotypes.) What\u2019s Chris (aka Corky) up to these days? You may be wondering what Chris Burke is up to these days. Well, Chris now lives in New York City and is the\u00a0 Goodwill Ambassador \u00a0for the\u00a0 National Down Syndrome\u00a0Society \u00a0(NDSS.) We had the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to visit The\u00a0National\u00a0Down\u00a0Syndrome\u00a0Society\u2019s office while we were in New York. What\u2019s funny is we were going to their offices to meet with some of their staff, and had\u00a0 no idea\u00a0 that Chris Burke even worked for the National Down Syndrome\u00a0Society, much less expected to meet\u00a0him. But then, in the middle of our meeting in the\u00a0conference\u00a0room, walks in Chris Burke to grab his lunch that was in the small\u00a0refrigerator\u00a0in the\u00a0conference\u00a0room.I couldn\u2019t believe it! Not only was it super cool,\u00a0but Chris and Noah became instant friends! Winning! Noah made a new friend! Chris and I became good\u00a0friends\u00a0as well\u2026.. Hanging out with our new friends from NDSS! Noah takes another bite out of the Big Apple After our time at NDSS we took in some more sights in the City. Being a huge\u00a0 Apple \u00a0Geek I wanted to check out Apple\u2019s newest (and biggest) retail store. If you hadn\u2019t heard, Apple built a store inside of\u00a0 Grand Central Station , and it is\u00a0absolutely\u00a0stunning! (Yes, I just called a computer store stunning.)\u00a0 The picture below is of a building called \u201c The Flatiron Building .\u201d It\u2019s one of favorite buildings in New York\u00a0simply\u00a0because of it\u2019s uniqueness. Pretty cool, huh? The flatiron building is, well, um, flat! And now for one of the coolest\u00a0things I\u2019ve done in my entire life! There are few things in my life that make my list of \u201cthe coolest things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\u00a0 Having our son ,\u00a0getting married to the most awesome lady in the world,\u00a0meeting\u00a0the Eyeglass rapper in Japan, finishing my\u00a0 Master\u2019s\u00a0degree , you know, things like that. Well, today I\u2019m excited to be able to add another awesome adventure to that list; visiting a New York City\u00a0Fire station! When we arrived in New York I got a message from someone who followed our journey on\u00a0 Noah\u2019s Dad Facebook \u00a0saying he was a frireman in New York and that we were welcome to come by his firehouse! It took me less than 2 seconds to think about it, before replying back with a \u201c Yes! What time can we come by. )\u00a0 We walked over to Fire Station 14 and met Michael, who turns out to be the fireman in charge of\u00a0actually \u00a0driving the firetruck! \u00a0How awesome is that!!! Michael also has a son with Down\u00a0syndrome, and it turns out he, and all the guys in his station, are\u00a0 huge softies ! Shhhhhh, don\u2019t tell them I told you that! But seriously, it was a lot of fun seeing all of the huge, manly, New York City Fireman totally melt when they got around a little baby. It really was touching. I was\u00a0especially\u00a0touched by how great a dad our new friend\u00a0Michael\u00a0was. He was totally in love with his family, and told us all about them, including showing us lots of fun iPhone pictures. I love seeing father\u2019s like Michael who are doing it right. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget the contrast of this huge, stud fireman, totally melting when he was talking about his family, I think I may have even saw a tear!\u00a0 I\u2019m glad Michael reached out to us and invited us to come by the\u00a0Fire station. Not\u00a0just\u00a0because\u00a0we got to go on an awesome tour of the\u00a0fire station, (and something else that was crazy awesome, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m allowed to\u00a0publicize\u00a0it, so it\u2019ll have to be my\u00a0secret\u2026but let me just say\u2026it was awesome!) but\u00a0because\u00a0we made a new friend. We\u2019re looking forward to\u00a0visiting\u00a0with Michael the next time we\u2019re in New York, and hope we got the chance to meet his family as well! And to Michael, thanks for opening up your home away from home to us, and for being such a great dad and husband. It\u2019s a\u00a0privilege\u00a0to call you a friend! Afterwards that wasn\u2019t much that could top that, so we hung out a bit before heading to the Hotel to crash. Tomorrow we were looking forward to heading home. Hi Friends!

{"date": ",June,30,2012", "body": "This is a very special weekend for Noah (and us!) Yesterday was Noah\u2019s  first time on an airplane , but what\u2019s even cooler than that is  where  he was taking the airplane to! This weekend we flew to Missouri to have an early Christmas with my wife\u2019s grandmother, and my in-lawns (who flew in from Colorado.) Noah\u2019s grandparents were in town for the  Buddy Walk  a few weeks ago, but the last time he got to hang out with his fun cousins was  last summer . With all of us living in different states we don\u2019t get to see each other as often as we\u2019d like, so it was great to be able to spend an entire weekend together. One of the most special things about this weekend was that Noah got to meet his great grandmother for the first time. It was fun watching her face light up when she held him for the first time. I really think this kid knows what a camera is\u2026.He always seems to give me that look like, \u201cYah, I know, I know\u2026\u201d when I pull my camera out. \ud83d\ude42 Two birthdays are better than one! Since we were all together we decided to celebrate Guy (Noah\u2019s cousin) and Noah\u2019s birthday. (It\u2019s hard to believe Noah\u2019s about to be 1 year old. Wow!) One great thing about celebrating two birthday\u2019s at the same time is that there are  two birthday cakes \u2026..and who doesn\u2019t like any party where there are two birthday cakes! You may wonder why Noah\u2019s birthday cake is so small compared to his cousins. Well, as you\u2019ll see in our next post we decided to give Noah his first smash cake. (Which was a mess, but totally worth it just for the amazing pictures I was able to snap!) Be sure to check back tomorrow to see our son looking like smurf (aka \u2013 covered in blue icing.) One of my mother in laws friend\u2019s hand made this awesome texture blanket / crawling mat. I wish you could see this entire thing, it\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s very bright and fun, and covered with various textures for Noah to grab. I seriously couldn\u2019t believe someone hand made this; she seriously needs to go in the crawling mat making business! On a side note, this is the 2nd hand made gift Noah has received. Our friend made Noah a  texture blanket  which he also enjoys a lot, and is also great for sensory development! Since Noah is still  learning how to crawl , we really appreciate these sorts of gifts. Family love\u2026 After the cake, and presents, we spent of the rest of the day hanging out with family. Noah\u2019s so huggable so everyone wanted a piece of those huggable hugs of his. \ud83d\ude42 Noah had a great time playing with his adorable little cousin! One sleepy little boy\u2026 After a long day full of fun and family, Noah was asleep long before we even got back to the hotel from dinner.  (Don\u2019t you love his cute little bear jacket?) \ud83d\ude42 A huge congrats to my mother! I had to make a tough decision this weekend. After planning the trip, buying airplane tickets, hotel rooms, etc we realized that we had a mix up on when we thought my mother\u2019s college graduation was. Ugggg\u2026..I hate when that happens. One of the main reasons we planned this trip was to introduce Noah to his  98 year old  great grandmother, and realistically this weekend may be the only opportunity for that to happen. So we had to make a tough call and miss my mom\u2019s graduation. Thankfully she\u2019s very gracious and understanding and encouraged us to take Noah to see his great grandmother. However, thanks to the magic of technology we were able to video chat with my brother live during her graduation so we could still be a part of it\u2026in a cyber kind of way. I\u2019m so proud of my mom for going back to school as an adult and getting her degree. It\u2019s a lot of work, and she nailed it! Also this was her associates degree, and she\u2019s now working on her bachelors\u2019, which means we\u2019ll have a chance to watch her graduate again in a few years! We love you mom and are so proud of you! We knew you could do it! How does your family use technology to stay in touch? Also have you ever \u201cdouble booked\u201d with your family?

First, let me talk about one of toys that does a lot more than just bring extra challenges to the exercise ball. One of the best investments we have made, and by  investment  I mean we spent about 10 dollars, was the  Fisher Price Brillant Basics First Blocks . Rick put this on the  top\u00a0Christmas gift list so maybe this made it under your tree. It\u2019s a basket of blocks with a shape sorter top. Why is this such a good investment? Well, it has helped us work on a variety of Noah\u2019s  fine motor skills . \u00a0Granted we aren\u2019t using this box in the videos or pictures, but we use it all the time at therapy and at home. There is obviously more than one way to work on a skill. Fine Motor Skills 7 Types Of Grasps The first action was simply grasping these blocks in his hand. Your child will advance through various grasps. \n Palmar Grasp:  the entire hand wraps around an object, with the palm of the hand picking up the object. \n Ulnar Palmar Grasp:  object held on the ulnar (pinky side) side of the palm using fingers on that side of the hand \n Radial Palmar Grasp:  object held in on the radial (thumb side) of the palm using fingers on that side of the hand \n Raking Grasp:  flexion of the radial fingers (closest to the thumb) to bring the objects into the palm (like a rake) \n Radial Digital Grasp or Tripod Grasp:  using the thumb and first two fingers (index and middle) \n Inferior Pincer Grasp:  using thumb to push object against index finger \n Pincer Grasp:  using tips of thumb and index finger \n The size and rim on these blocks will allow him to work on all of these grasps, Noah is currently at the ulnar/radial palmar grasp and will on occasion use the radial digital grasp. Knowing where your child is with grasping will help you figure out what to feed them, which  toys  are best, and other ways to interact with your child. Release While you advance through grasps you\u2019ll also work on releasing objects. We have worked on releasing in general, as well as into the box. I am not quite sure that Noah realizes he is putting the blocks in the box as we chase his hand around so he has perfect aim. Eventually we will use the sorter on top. Remove He knows what\u2019s in this box now and he gets very excited when we bring it out. He has even picked a favorite color as he will drop them all for a red one. \u00a0 He likes to remove the blocks from the box until there are none left. Then we put them back and repeat. \u00a0His favorite way to empty the box is to simply dump it over. \u00a0It is highly efficient. Bang We also work on banging the blocks together, which helps with coordination and stability. We have talked about stability in the core but we are now starting to work on those shoulders and hands. Noah will bang his own blocks, but we also hold blocks out for him to bang. He thinks it is pretty awesome to make  noise  that way. Transfer One other thing it helps us work on is transferring objects from hand to hand. He has not quite mastered this, but we will hold a block out, he will grab it, we will hold another block out on the same side and expect him to transfer the block to the other hand to grab the new block. \u00a0He usually drops the block to grab the new one, but occasionally it makes it to the other hand. Encourage all of these actions by cheering them on. \u00a0You will also need to do the activities first to show them what you expect. \u00a0This is probably the first time we saw Noah mimic us. \u00a0We would bang blocks, then he would, and we would erupt into loud cheering. \u00a0 It never fails that his version is way cuter than ours. Taking the Ball to the Next Level So how do we combine the blocks and ball for the extreme workout? Well, you do all of the above exercises except on the ball. \u00a0Noah works on his stability which not only includes core, but also shoulders and hands as mentioned. So we entice him with the blocks and he reaches out to each side working multiple muscles to obtain the blocks. While he is reaching out, he grabs blocks, puts blocks in the box, takes them out, bangs them and then he returns to the middle. We also work on transferring as mentioned above. Any skill you work on while he is sitting on the ground you can translate to the ball to take it to the next level. \u00a0 I feel like I am advertising a fitness method on tv \ud83d\ude42 It is obviously a two person job to do this as you cannot hold your child on the ball as well as hold blocks out for them. \u00a0I am usually helping out during our sessions. \u00a0But today you get a glimpse of one of our new therapists as she helps out. \u00a0Yes we had to say goodbye to another occupational therapist, but we are already excited about our new one based on our experience with her so far. P.S. These blocks are also our dogs favorite chew toy, so guard them from your pups. Have you taken any of your previous therapies to the next level? \u00a0What is your favorite toy to work on fine motor skills?

{"date": ",September,24,2012", "body": "At the time of this video Noah\u2019s almost 15 months old and the\u00a0 duck tail \u00a0quickly growing down the back of his neck is telling us he\u2019s\u00a0 way past due \u00a0for his first haircut! I seriously wish I would have snapped a picture of it (the duck tail) before it was cut off just so you can see how\u00a0 country \u00a0he looked! Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with the country look\u00a0 per say , I just don\u2019t think Noah\u2019s all that into it.\u00a0 \u00a0(He didn\u2019t care for the\u00a0 baby fohawk \u00a0look either!) See what I mean?\u00a0 Noah Get\u2019s His Hair Cut With The Big Boys There are lots of places that specialize\u00a0in giving children\u00a0haircuts, but instead of using\u00a0 Snip-Its \u00a0or one of the many other children\u00a0 salons \u00a0out there, I decided to bring Noah where I go for his first hair cut. I\u2019ve had the same hair\u00a0stylist for almost\u00a0 5 years now \u00a0and I consider him a friend.\u00a0So one day as I was getting my own hair cut I mentioned that it was time for Noah to get his first haircut and thought it would be fun to have Brett (my friend) cut it. And although he doesn\u2019t really cut baby\u2019s hair, he\u00a0agreed, so it was on. (By the way, I know it sounds sort of\u00a0 uppity-up \u00a0to say\u00a0 stylist\u2026. especially since I\u2019ve a guy, but that\u2019s what Brett is, a stylist! I guess I could say \u201c the guy who cuts my hair \u201d but that sort of seems to discredit his experience and training, and he\u2019s awesome \u00a0at what he does. So stylist it is.)\u00a0 We didn\u2019t know how well Noah would do with someone trying to come at him with scissors, but I have to say he actually did pretty well. As you can see in the video I had to hold him pretty tightly to keep him steady, but he didn\u2019t really cry or scream. (By the way, the video makes it look like I\u2019ve got him in a\u00a0choke\u00a0hold or something\u2026I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just a wacky camera angle.) So all in all I think he, and Brett, did a great job! What do you think? Sharp\u00a0looking\u00a0kid, huh?\u00a0 Looking all grown up after his first hair cut! Do As I Say, Not As I Do If you\u2019re looking for a great place to get your child\u2019s first hair cut, I\u00a0 wouldn\u2019t suggest \u00a0using a\u00a0 grown up \u00a0hair salon. (No\u00a0offense\u00a0Brett!) The only reason we got Noah\u2019s haircut where we did is\u00a0because I\u2019m friends with the\u00a0 guy who cuts my hair \u00a0(better?) and we thought it would be fun for him to cut Noah\u2019s hair for the first time. We would\u00a0 never \u00a0pay for Noah to get his hair cut at a grown up \u00a0salon, plus the places geared toward children have special training and they cut children\u2019s hair all day every day. They know how to deal with\u00a0crying, scared, screaming babies, and their\u00a0environment\u00a0is much more tailored to them. We didn\u2019t plan on using Brett for Noah\u2019s haircuts going forward, this just a one time thing for fun. From here on out we\u2019ll be taking Noah to a more kid friendly place that\u00a0specializes\u00a0in doing children\u2019s hair cuts. Plus, Noah\u2019s a baby. There are no ladies checking out his hair cut at this age (well,\u00a0maybe one.) So don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t think about simply trying to cut his\u00a0hair myself\u00a0at home (in fact, I\u2019ve given him a quick trim once before.) Who knows, maybe I need to grab one of\u00a0 these !\u00a0 All done, and ready to go play! How did your child do on his / her first haircut? DId you do it yourself, or take them somewhere?

{"date": ",July,2,2012", "body": "Our family crams a lot of celebration into the holiday season. From about a week before Thanksgiving to Christmas we have 5 birthdays, oh and 3 of those are just our little family. That\u2019s right, Rick, Noah and myself all have our birthdays at this time. The other two are my niece and nephew. So we are celebrating\u2026a lot, including this weekend. This weekend was around my nephew and Noah\u2019s birthday, so we were having a party which included a very special guest, their  great grandma . The party was the day that we were leaving so we had a breakfast surprise for Noah. He had his own giant blue cake to smash his fists into. Yelp, that\u2019s right, he\u2019s very own smash cake! The Smash Cake The smash cake is something I had never heard of until we started going to first birthday parties, which happens a lot once you have a kid. We went to one back in  August \u00a0where we experienced the smash cake for the first time, and I started pondering what Noah would do at his first birthday. The idea is that this is the first time a child is given a cake. They may be tentative with it at first but once they get a taste they dig in with their hands, feet, whole face, who knows. It is intended to be a big old mess with great pictures and lots of laughs. The best part about our first experience with smash cake was that the  little girl  was not really into the cake, so they put some broccoli in front of her as a motivator and she went to town. So we wondered what Noah would do when we placed him in front of mass of sweetness for the first time? The Smurf Experience Noah provided us with the ultimate smash cake performance. The best part may be the icing choice of blue which coincidently matched his pajamas. Noah started out just how I envisioned with one hand at first, realization that his hand was full of sweet goodness, followed by digging in with both hands covering his whole face with icing. He ended up looking just like a smurf. \u00a0It was a great end to a wonderful weekend with my grandmother meeting all of her great-grandchildren. Here\u2019s some pre-bath pictures of Noah enjoying his first smash cake. Now it\u2019s time to clean this little guy up and head to the airport. We\u2019re hoping Noah\u2019s second airplane flight goes as smooth as his  first ! \u00a0 6 Tips We Learned From Our First Smash Cake \n You may not want to use a blue or black frosting. They are really messy and hard to clean up, in fact they may leave a lasting stain on your face letting people know what you have been up to. \n You want to have a really big covering on your floor as cake is fairly light and can fly pretty far. Or be like us and do it in a hotel room \ud83d\ude42 \n You want a bath easily available, unlike our hotel room which only had a shower \n Having a second wardrobe change available is preferable for both baby and parents. Cake ends up on everyone involved, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t realize this \n Bibs only block a small area of space, why bother. \n Be prepared for it to not go quite like you envision but enjoy every moment of it! \n Did you give your child a smash cake at their first birthday party? What do you think about the smash cake tradition? Tell us about it in the comments.

We were in New York this\u00a0weekend\u00a0for the 2012\u00a0National\u00a0Down Syndrome Society New York City Buddy Walk , and\u00a0words can\u2019t express how\u00a0incredibly\u00a0 proud \u00a0I am of our son! Long story shortNoah\u2019s picture was selected, along with 200 others, to be\u00a0displayed\u00a0in Times Square on the big screen to kick off the New York City Buddy Walk and Down Syndrome\u00a0Awareness\u00a0month (which is in\u00a0October.) The kick off video is 20 minutes long and played twice on the large bright screens at One Times Square, which is the same building where the ball drops during the Times Square New Year Celebration. The idea behind the video is to help create Down Syndrome\u00a0awareness\u00a0for those passing by who may see it (and I\u2019m pretty sure for the people who have children / family members in the video to have an awesome time!) \u00a0 One of the coolest parts of our trip was getting to meet so many\u00a0 amazing families \u00a0who have followed our story on our blog / \u00a0 Facebook Page . You have no idea how much of an honor it is for us to get to know you and your families as you share stories, comments, pictures, and\u00a0 videos \u00a0with us. Several families came up to us and told us that our blog was one of the first things they found when they\u00a0received\u00a0a\u00a0 Down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis \u00a0and that they were greatly\u00a0encouraged\u00a0by our posts.\u00a0 I can\u2019t even begin to explain how much that\u00a0encourages\u00a0us! \u00a0It\u2019s nice to know we\u2019re having a\u00a0positive\u00a0impact on people, and\u00a0hopefully\u00a0helping to replace a little of their fear with hope. By the way the same goes for every email, facebook message, and tweet we get as well. We don\u2019t get the chance to reply back to each message that comes in, but we do read them all. So thank you to all of you who have taken the time to drop us a line to tell us how Noah\u2019s story has\u00a0encouraged\u00a0us. It really does mean a lot to us. We got to meet Chappy and his family!\u00a0 I think Noah has a new crush\u2026. We had some fun hanging out in Central Park\u00a0waiting\u00a0for the Buddy Walk to begin. I\u00a0seriously\u00a0don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been in New York on a day with more perfect weather\u2026it was seriously amazing! Wherever there is music you can count on one thing\u2026Noah turning it in to an all out dance party! Which he did right in the middle of Central Park! I loved it! \u00a0These dance moves reminded me of the same ones he did in\u00a0this video! (Again, epic cuteness!) He loves his mommy! As you can see Noah is almost staring to walk\u2026he\u2019s so, so, so, so close. We had a ton of fun watching him giggle and smile as he wobbled all around the park! Crossing the finish line! All done! **shakes hands back and forth** We got to spend some fun time dancing in\u00a0Central\u00a0Park with our friends, the Lyons, who live in New York . You may remember us\u00a0talking about them\u00a0from the last time we were here. There son, Cade, had Down syndrome and their entire family spills joy all over the place! By the way, you can read this awesome post Gabe wrote for the\u00a0 Huffington Post \u00a0on his son\u2019s birthday. (By the way, they changed the title of the post after it was written with\u00a0 people first\u00a0 language.) Our friends, The Lyons! We are huge fans of\u00a0 Baby Signing Times \u00a0and it was a lot of fun to meet\u00a0Rachel Coleman. In fact my wife got a\u00a0 little \u00a0teary eyed when meeting her simply for how\u00a0grateful\u00a0we are for all she does to help children learn to communicate. (As you can see, she\u2019s a good hugger\u2026and rocks that orange sweater!) Rachel from Baby Signing Times! (Recognize the sweater?)\u00a0 Baby, Baby, Baby signing times! (Sing along if you know the words\u2026)\u00a0 We had a great time in New York City. We\u00a0appreciate\u00a0all of the hard work the NDSS puts into the Buddy Walk, and for all they do to support people born with Down syndrome (like our son) and their families. They really put on a great event, and we look forward to\u00a0joining\u00a0them in NYC again sometime. If you haven\u2019t had a chance to attend a Buddy Walk I would\u00a0encourage\u00a0you to check out\u00a0 this site \u00a0where you can find a Buddy Walk near you, and go to one. Even if you don\u2019t know anyone with Down syndrome (although if you\u2019re reading you know can say you\u00a0 know \u00a0someone with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0though; Noah!) it\u2019s a great time and will help you see how awesome people living with Down syndrome are. And if you\u2019re in the Dallas area, you can even join us on Sunday November 4th at Victory Park for our\u00a0 local Buddy Walk ! We\u2019d love it! Have you ever been to a Buddy Walk?

{"date": ",July,3,2012", "body": "Noah physical\u00a0therapist\u00a0has been using treadmill\u00a0training\u00a0to help him learn to walk for 3 and a half months now. As you can see in today\u2019s video he\u2019s come a long way since he took his  first \u201csteps\u201d  on the treadmill in a few months ago. However, he still has a lot of work to do before he\u2019ll actually walk on his own;\u00a0specifically his  core muscles , and balance. But he\u2019ll get there. By the way you can also see in the video how his personality is developing. For instance there are times when he just sort of let\u2019s his feet go  limp  and\u00a0decides\u00a0that he doesn\u2019t want to walk. So much for all  kids with Down syndrome being angels . \ud83d\ude42 It\u2019s a ton of fun seeing him figure out what his feet are for and watching him put one foot in front of the other. It seems like it\u2019ll be forever before Noah takes his first steps (off the treadmill), and I can\u2019t wait! But I also know that our kids grow up fast, so as much as I want him to walk, I also want to enjoy every second of his development, because once a child starts to walk on their own there\u2019s no going back! (Can I get an \u201camen\u201d parents?) I also want to be sure to never let\u00a0parenting\u00a0be a  contest . As my wife and I often remind each other, we should\u00a0focus\u00a0on  celebrating, not\u00a0comparing.\u00a0 Why is your child on a treadmill anyway? For those of you wondering why our 11 month old is on a\u00a0treadmill let me explain. One of the\u00a0 characteristics\u00a0of Down syndrome  \u00a0is\u00a0hypotonia which is basically low muscle tone. This means that children with  Down syndrome \u00a0(like our son) generally develop a little slower than a  typical child,  and early intervention developmental\u00a0therapy\u00a0is often used to help them in their progress. So one of the tools in Noah\u2019s\u00a0developmental\u00a0toolbox is pediatric treadmill therapy since it has been\u00a0 proven to help  children born with Down syndrome learn to walk. So that\u2019s the long and short of it. \ud83d\ude42 Want to learn more about treadmill therapy?

{"date": ",August,25,2012", "body": "Why does my child always have their tongue out? \u201cMy baby sticks their tongue out all the time!\u201d As a pediatrician this is a common concern I hear from parents of newborns. Sticking your tongue out is better known as\u00a0 tongue protrusion . It is when the tongue sticks out beyond the lip border for all to see. Since tongue protrusion is one of the\u00a0 Characteristics of Down syndrome , new parents often ask, \u201cDoes my child have Down syndrome if they constantly stick out their\u00c2\u00a0tongue?\u201d Be sure to sign up for our email updates to first the first to know when we publish a new post! Enter your email address: \n \n 6 Causes of Tongue Protrusion Just because it seems as if your child sticks their tongue out \u201c all the time \u201d does not automatically mean your child has\u00a0 Down syndrome . In fact, there are multiple reasons that a child\u2019s tongue could be sticking out. Let\u2019s take a look at the top 6: \n 1. Normal Reflex I feel that I must emphasize that tongue protrusion is a\u00a0 completely normal \u00a0(or as we like to say typical ) finding in infants. It is part of the sucking reflex. It usually disappears with time, around 4-6 months when it is time to spoon feed. In other words, your child could simply be sticking their tongue out, just because they like to stick it out. (Don\u2019t you just love how kids like to keep things interesting?)\u00a0 The reason the tongue protrudes, other than as a natural reflex, is that the tongue is or appears large. Several things can give this appearance, a true large tongue, a small mouth, growths/masses around the tongue, muscle tone and mouth breathing. If your\u00a0 pediatrician \u00a0finds one of these things, they should then try to see if there are other characteristics that fit into a syndrome or diagnosis. A syndrome means that there is a cluster of characteristics that are found together. Tongue protrusion is a characteristic of Down syndrome, however\u00a0 a person cannot be diagnosed with Down syndrome if they only have tongue protrusion . As you will soon read there are several diagnoses that are associated with tongue protrusion. 2. Macroglossia (large tongue) Macroglossia is an increase in the amount of tissue in the tongue. This causes the tongue to protrude from the mouth as it simply does not fit in a typical mouth. There are various reasons for a tongue to be large both congenital (born with it) and acquired (develops later). Again this is most likely to be seen with other characteristics that fit a syndrome or diagnosis. Some of the more common reasons are\u00a0 Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome ,\u00a0 acromegaly \u00a0(increase in growth hormone), congenital hypothyroidism \u00a0(not enough thyroid hormone), and\u00a0 mucopolysaccharides . There can also be a build up of substances from the body in the tongue such as amyloid or glycogen which is seen in amyloidosis and\u00a0glycogen storage diseases The majority of text books and articles think that children with Down syndrome have a large tongue, however, from my experiencee as a medical doctor (and a parent of a\u00a0 child born with Down syndrome \u00a0I think several of the reasons listed below contribute and it can be considered a pseudomacroglossia \u00a0(appears large but is actually normal size) in most cases. 3. Small Mouth A small mouth will make a normal size tongue stick out\u00a0 giving the appearance of a large tongue . You can have an overall small mouth which I feel a lot of children with Down syndrome have. One reason a child with Down syndrome can have a small mouth is because they have differences in their palate (the top of the mouth) the most common being a narrow higher arched palate. A small mouth is also seen in\u00a0 DiGeorge syndrome . Another cause of a small mouth is micrognathia which means small lower jaw. When looking at a child you usually see a recession of the lower jaw so that it looks like the chin is sucked back.\u00a0 Pierre Robin \u00a0is a sequence that occurs with the diagnosis of micrognathia. 4. Hypotonia (poor muscle tone) We have discussed how\u00a0 hypotonia , low muscle tone, affects every muscle in the body including the tongue. It means that at rest there is little tone in the muscle so it hangs like a wet noodle. (I use that metaphor, because this is often how the tongue appears on a child with low muscle tone.) If the tongue has no tone it will rest in state that is completely relaxed and likely\u00a0 protrude from the mouth . Just think about what your tongue is doing right now. You are holding it back in your mouth, if you just relax the muscle it takes up a lot more room in your mouth. There are several other syndromes that have hypotonia besides Down syndrome including,\u00a0 Prader-Willi ,\u00a0 Rett syndrome , and several others, even\u00a0 benign congenital hypotonia \u00a0which will resolve on its own. 5. Masses Masses or growths in and around the tongue can either make it large or push the tongue out. There are cysts that can form in salivary glands or what is known as a\u00a0 thyroglossal duct cyst . Cysts are usually observed and resolve on their own. One of our friends right now is dealing with a possible lymphatic malformation that is causing their baby\u2019s tongue to appear large. 6. Mouth Breathing Simply being a mouth breather can cause the tongue to protrude. Infants are typically nose breathers so something usually causes them to breathe through their mouth whether it be nasal congestion from a cold or allergies, or large tonsils and adenoids. Babies with Down syndrome can often end up being mouth breathers for all of the above reasons. If the reason is large tonsils and adenoids, a surgery may be in order to have them removed if they are causing other problems such as sleep apnea or chronic ear or sinus infections. Bonus Reason Some infants develop a habit of sticking out their tongue that continues after the normal reflex has resolved. They have none of the above characteristics, but continue to have tongue protrusion once they start eating. This should probably be dealt with by a speech therapist to help them break the habit. So, does my child have Down syndrome if they have their tongue out all the time? As I\u2019ve discussed, there are multiple reasons for a child to exhibit tongue protrusion (having their tongue out.) Parents of newborns often jump to the conclusion that their child has Down syndrome if they see them sticking their tongue out \u201call the time.\u201d First, ask yourself if you\u2019re being hypersensitive. Is your child really sticking their tongue \u201call the time?\u201d Second,\u00a0 tongue protrusion alone will not warrant a Down syndrome diagnosis . Your pediatrician will be looking for a combination of characteristics, and ultimately a\u00a0 Chromosome analysis,\u00a0 before confirming a Down syndrome diagnosis. As always, if you have\u00a0 any concerns \u00a0about your child, you should\u00a0 always talk \u00a0with your child\u2019s pediatrician. While the internet can sometimes be helpful, it is\u00a0 by no means a substitute \u00a0for your child\u2019s pediatrician. Every child is unique, and what you read online about one person\u2019s child, will not always equally apply to yours. Often times parents could save a lot of\u00a0 unnecessary worry \u00a0by simply bringing their child in to see their pediatrician when they have a medical concern instead of surfing the web, but I know you aren\u2019t one of those types of parents.\u00a0 What can you do to help with tongue protrusion? We are still working on this one ourself. Some of the above can be corrected with surgery such as taking out the tonsils and adenoids, extracting the jaw for Pierre Robin and removing cysts. I will have to say that Noah\u2019s tongue protrusion drives his mama a bit crazy.:-) His is not correctable by surgery but requires the help of a speech therapist. We are just starting out with speech therapy and don\u2019t have many tips yet. We have been told\u00a0 not to tap or flick the tongue \u00a0to encourage it to go back in the mouth (I am sure there will be a few of you who have actually been told the opposite). We have been told to encourage him to\u00a0 drink from a straw \u00a0and make sounds that cause you to close your mouth such as \u201cba\u201d and \u201cma\u201d . I really like that last one\u00a0 \u00a0We have also used the\u00a0 Z-vibe \u00a0with Noah with is often used to help\u00c2\u00a0strengthen\u00c2\u00a0oral motor skills. What have your speech therapists told you about tongue protrusion?

The  Down Syndrome Guild of Dallas  will be hosting the 2012 Dallas  Buddy Walk  at Victory Park in a few weeks and  we\u2019re calling all of our blog readers  to be one of Noah\u2019s Game Changers! Keep reading\u2026.  What\u2019s the Buddy Walk? If you don\u2019t know much about the Buddy Walk it\u2019s an annual  Down syndrome\u00a0awareness \u00a0event started by the\u00a0 National Down Syndrome\u00a0Society \u00a0that\u00a0takes place in cities all across the United States.\u00a0In\u00a0addition\u00a0to creating\u00a0awareness, the Buddy Walk raises funds to help provide resources to people with  Down\u00a0syndrome  and their families. In fact, our local Down Syndrome support group provided us with some\u00a0 great resources  when Noah was born\u2026which was a life saver for us\u00a0considering\u00a0how our\u00a0hospital\u00a0provided us with almost none. #HospitalFail \n We were in New York a few weeks ago to take part in the  New York Buddy Walk \u00a0(and see Noah\u2019s picture in Times Square!) This will be the second year in a row for us to be a part of the Dallas Buddy Walk (be sure to check out my thoughts on our  first Buddy Walk .) We\u2019re excited to hang out with so many of the friends we\u2019ve made in  real life  as well as meet some of the new ones we\u2019ve meet through\u00a0this site and our  Facebook page .  Will You Be One Of Noah\u2019s Game Changers? Noah\u2019s team name this year is \u201cNoah\u2019s Game Changers\u201d and we\u2019d love for all of the  game changers  who read this blog and / or hang out with us on our Facebook page to be a part of the \u201cNoah\u2019s Game Changers Team.\u201d No matter where you live you can be one of Noah\u2019s Game changers\u2026here\u2019s how! 1. Walk With Us If you live in the DFW area we would love for you to come out to  Victory Park  and walk in the Buddy Walk with us! If you\u2019re the parent of a child with Down syndrome you probably already have your own Buddy Walk team\u00a0participating\u00a0in the walk. If that\u2019s the case please let us know so we can say hello! (One of of our readers suggested we all meet up and do a big group picture. I think that\u2019s a great idea! Let\u2019s make it happen.) But if you are a\u00a0developmental\u00a0therapist, friend, facebook buddy, blog buddy, teacher, or just someone who wants to come out and support Noah and the Down\u00a0Syndrome\u00a0Guild of Dallas we\u2019d love for you to be a part of our team! You can visit  this link  to sign up to be one of Noah\u2019s Game Changers and join our Buddy Walk Team! For those of you who can come out and walk with us, here\u2019s the details: 2012 Buddy Walk \n Sunday, November 4, 2012 \n 11:00 am \u2013 3:00 pm \n AT&T Plaza at Victory Park \n 2500 Victory Avenue \n Here\u2019s an event map for the Buddy Walk! 2. Make a Small (or large) Donation  The Buddy Walk is one of the major fund raisers for the National Down Syndrome Society and the Down Syndrome Guild of Dallas. As I mentioned both of these\u00a0organizations\u00a0do a  great job \u00a0supporting people with Down syndrome and their families, and any donation you make will go directly to helping them help others. Each Buddy Walk team sets a\u00a0financial\u00a0goal that they hope to reach as a team. To be honest I think our goal is pretty low considering how awesome (and\u00a0generous!) all of you guys are.   I never ask for money / donations on this site, but this is such a fantastic cause so I\u2019m asking you to skip a latte (or two) this month and make a little donation to our Buddy Walk team. It would really mean a lot to us. Plus your donation will go a long way in helping others. Which is awesome! If you don\u2019t live near us we would still love you to be a part of the Noah\u2019s Gamer Changer\u2019s Team by making a small donation. It\u2019s super simple to donate. All you have to do is  click here . Thanks so much! 3. Pray No matter where you live would you mind taking a minute to pray for all the Buddy Walks taking place all over the Word. Pray that God would use these Buddy Walks to help the world learn more about Down syndrome, and\u00a0ultimately\u00a0that more of these children would be brought to full term. Please be sure to leave a comment if you can commit to praying since being a \u201c prayer partner \u201c\u00a0certainly\u00a0qualifies you to be one of Noah\u2019s Game Changers!  4. Share And Stay Connected Words can\u2019t\u00a0describe\u00a0how\u00a0incredible\u00a0the\u00a0community\u00a0is that\u2019s formed around this site.

(And I think we do a pretty decent job of replying back, all things considered.)    Thanks for being such great friends. Yes, friends. Just so you know it really helps us spread the word that Down syndrome is ok when you share, LIKE, tweet,  repin , comment,  plus , email to a friend, share on your Facebook page, etc our blog posts and content. So thank you for that. Also if you have a blog  we\u2019d really\u00a0appreciate\u00a0it  if you\u2019d link to our site and/or any\u00a0articles\u00a0you may have found helpful. If you do, please be sure to let us know so we can check it out! Oh and by the way, Noah wanted me to let you know he thinks that anyone who links to us is \u201cvery cool!\u201d (And we agree.)

{"date": ",August,21,2012", "body": "The moment my entire life changed\u2026for the better! I\u2019ll never forget the moment I snapped this picture. It was shortly after learning that our son was born with Down syndrome, and as scared as I was after\u00a0receiving\u00a0our son\u2019s\u00a0diagnosis, it all went away the moment they wheeled\u00a0this little boy into our hospital room. Sure, the\u00a0 fear \u00a0came back later as I began to work through what a\u00a0 Down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis \u00a0meant for our son, and our\u00a0family. Sure, there are\u00a0 a few things I know now , that I wish I knew then. But in that moment all I could think about was how in love I was with this lovely little newborn of ours! (And those cheeks\u2026oh those cheeks!) A real life love story\u2026 If case you aren\u2019t\u00a0familiar\u00a0with\u00a0 our story , I had no idea Noah had Down syndrome the\u00a0 first time I saw him . It wasn\u2019t\u00a0until\u00a0a few hours later that I would learn our baby was born with an\u00a0extra\u00a0 21st\u00a0chromosome . I\u2019ve known my son when I thought he didn\u2019t have Down syndrome, and I\u2019ve known him when I\u00a0 knew \u00a0he did, and I can\u00a0honestly\u00a0say my love for him is 110% the same. It\u2019s not just something I say,\u00a0 but something I know to be true . Since even before taking this picture I\u2019ve been head over heels in love with this little boy. My love for him grows more and more each day. I\u2019ve said this a million times, but I seriously\u00a0 wouldn\u2019t change one single\u00a0chromosome \u00a0on him! I\u2019m in love with him, just as he is. And\u00a0If you\u2019re a parent I\u2019m sure you know\u00a0 just \u00a0what I\u2019m talking about.\u00a0 A reminder to all the parents out there\u2026. It\u2019s easy to allow\u00a0memories like the this one to be replaced by newer memories. Memories of diaper changes,\u00a0 physical\u00a0therapy\u00a0appointments ,\u00a0soccer\u00a0practice, getting to work on time, paying the bills, dealing with insurance companies, making sure your children eat 3 times a day, going to the grocery store, you name it. It\u2019s easy to become stressed out,\u00a0frustrated,\u00a0 worried , and anxious. But today I\u2019m giving you\u00a0permission\u00a0to put all of those new memories on hold and think back to\u00a0something\u00a0you\u2019ll never forget; the moment when you first held your\u00a0child\u00a0in your arms. The\u00a0moment\u00a0you first looked into their eyes. The moment you changed\u00a0their\u00a0diaper for the first time (remember\u00a0how cute it was then? Not so much now, huh?)\u00a0 Remember the tears in your eyes? Remember being speechless? Remember wondering how it was\u00a0possible\u00a0to love someone so much? Pretty awesome, huh? Today, take a second to pause, and think about the first time you saw your child. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have a new born, or a 40 year old, stop what you\u2019re doing and go back there in your mind. Don\u2019t let the busyness of life try to\u00a0crowd\u00a0out memories like these. In fact, I encourage you to take time to stop and\u00a0reflect on them\u00a0often. I think you\u2019ll find it certainly\u00a0help\u00a0put things in\u00a0perspective. Share one of the first pictures you have of your child! Ok, I want to try something new. I\u2019ve added a way for you to\u00a0 share a picture in your comments . (Just click on the attach image button that shows up where you write your comment to upload a picture.) For those of you that don\u2019t mind sharing pictures, take a second to leave a comment telling us\u00a0about\u00a0how you felt the first time you saw your newborn, and be sure to\u00a0include\u00a0the \u00a0earliest\u00a0picture \u00a0you can find of him/her. It\u2019ll be fun to see everyone\u2019s baby pictures! By the way, your child doesn\u2019t have to have Down syndrome for you to leave a picture, this blog post is for\u00a0 all parents .

{"date": ",October,24,2012", "body": "This post is going to be a little different than usual, but today\u2019s video marks such a significant event in my life that I thought I\u2019d share with you guys, and in doing so share a\u00a0little bit about my story before becoming  Noahs Dad . The story behind the  story  so to speak. So I hope you\u2019ll accept my apologize for Noah only being in about 3 seconds of today\u2019s video. However, I included lots of pictures from our\u00a0weekend\u00a0to make up for it. \u00a0And don\u2019t worry, tomorrow\u2019s video will be  jammed packed  with lots of Noah cuteness. Those moments you think will never\u00a0happen\u2026.sometimes do. Sometimes in our life there are moments that we think will  never  happen. They seem so far off.  So impossible.\u00a0 So unlikely to ever happen to you that when they do, it\u2019s almost unbelievable. Like you\u2019re watching a character play you in a\u00a0movie, doing what you wish  you  were doing. Then you realize  it\u2019s real . The event  really  happened. It really is you doing something you had only\u00a0dreamed of doing. That\u2019s what today was like for me. Today I Received My Master\u2019s Of Theology (ThM) To quote one of the first phrases in  To Kill A Mockingbird ,  \u2026It started long before that. \u201d I\u2019ll save you the long back story, but let me just say this; 15 years ago  no one  (especially myself!) would have ever thought that I\u2019d one day be\u00a0receiving\u00a0a Master\u2019s degree, much less a  Master\u2019s of\u00a0Theology Degree \u00a0from  Dallas Theological Seminary . But after a five  very long years  it happened. And I seriously can\u2019t believe it.\u00a0 Today as I walked across that stage\u00a0I was once again reminded that  God is faithful.  And He can do things in and through your life that you never thought\u00a0possible. It\u2019s amazing. And I\u2019m humbled. A Few Thoughts On Seminary,\u00a0Religious\u00a0Crazies, And Cool Pastors For those of you who only know\u00a0me as \u201c Noah\u2019s Dad \u201d l wanted to take this\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to share a little bit of my story with you. If you have any questions about any of the stuff I talk about in today\u2019s post, feel free to ask them in the comments. I don\u2019t mind at all.  Why I Hesitate to Tell People I Went To Seminary I wrote in a previous post a little bit about  what a\u00a0seminary\u00a0student is actually like . But to be honest, I hesitate to tell people I went to seminary because there are so many  misconceptions  about seminarians (or pastors, people \u201cin\u201d ministry, etc.) I\u2019m also well aware that lots of people have been hurt, judged, or treated wrongly by a  religious person ( read: religious crazy ) \u00a0and the last thing I want is for someone to think I\u2019m  anything  like one of  those people . So I usually try to get to know someone first before talking about what I \u201cdo.\u201d One of the best compliments anyone\u00a0can ever tell me is, \u201c Wow, you\u2019re not anything like the (fill in the blank with some religious term) I meet once .\u201d I love breaking stereotypes. If you\u2019ve been following our story the last 22 months then you probably already knew I went to seminary, but if not, now you do. Hopefully we can still be friends.  Why I Went To Seminary? (or) How A Cool Preacher Changed My Life. About 15 years ago I slipped into the back of a large young adult\u00a0Bible study. There was a guy preaching name  Todd Wagner.  I had heard a lot of preachers in my life, but none of them sounded anything like this guy. He was authentic. He was honest.  He was cool!  No offense, but most of the preachers I had seen on tv looked like the kind of guys who got picked on (a lot) growing up. (And they all had those awkward \u201cevangelist\u2019s haircuts.) Not this guy. He actually looked, and dressed, cool. I know it sounds pretty superficial, but\u00a0realizing\u00a0that pastors could be cool ( read: normal ) was a turning point for me. I went back week after week, and bought as many tapes (yes, tapes!) as I could afford. I consumed them. I played some of them so many times I have sections of them memorized to this day.\u00a0He was teaching  truth , and the more I heard, the more I  wanted  to hear. I had never heard anyone teach the Bible like Todd did. It blew my mind (and changed my life.) One day Todd invited me to hang out with him at his office in Dallas. I had this beat up car, with no A/C and drove that thing all the way to Dallas in the heat and traffic (it barely made it) just to hang out with him for a little bit. It really meant a lot to me that this awesome preacher took an interest in this 18 year old, punk kid\u2019s life. (Quick reminder:  You never know the impact you can have on someone else\u2019s life by investing in them. Don\u2019t ever count anyone out. Ever. ) I remember thinking to myself that someway, somehow I would learn to communicate the Bible like Todd. I found out he\u00a0went to  Dallas Theological Seminary  (DTS) and I wanted to go there also. I was an 18 year old kid, so I didn\u2019t know much, but I knew I had to do whatever it took to go there so that maybe I could learn to talk about the Bible that way he did. But man, it seemed so far off.  I didn\u2019t even have a high school diploma!  How the heck\u00a0was I ever going to get my Master\u2019s degree ? Todd, thanks for investing in my life all those years ago (and for\u00a0continuing\u00a0to do so today.) Thanks for showing me a \u201cdifferent\u201d kind of Christian. And thanks for your faithfulness as a  pastor , friend, and follower of Christ. I can never repay you for all the ways your friendship, love, and Biblical teaching have shaped and guided my life forever. Thank you. By the way to all my friends reading this blog post, if you enjoy hearing life\u00a0changing\u00a0messages I encourage\u00a0you to check out some of  Todd\u2019s\u00a0sermons \u00a0and our weekly video podcast,  Real Truth. Real Quick.  (That\u2019s right, I actually work with that same friend, Todd\u00a0these days,\u00a017 years later. God\u2019s pretty cool, huh?)\u00a0I think you\u2019ll see why I speak so highly of him. And if you aren\u2019t plugged into to a good church you can even watch  Watermark\u2019s services live and free online \u00a0anywhere in the world!\u00a0So be sure to check it out. What A Difference A Decade Can Make Let\u2019s just say a lot of things happened in my life over that that next decade that God would use to eventually get me to DTS. I met one of the most loving, gracious, and encouraging people I\u2019d ever meet, my wife. She believed in me. And my dream. She saw things in me that no one else did. And she loved me. A lot. I don\u2019t think anyone else (including myself) ever thought I\u2019d actually make it to DTS. But she did. I had to first go to undergrad. (And do well enough to somehow get accepted into graduate school.) I moved to Houston to attend the  University of Houston  (Go Coogs!) moved in with some guys that would become some of my closest friends, and got involved with a church that God would use to transform me.\u00a0I graduated with a bachelors degree in corporate communication. My wife graduated from medical school. We got married (a miracle.)  I got accepted into Dallas Theological\u00a0Seminary (another miracle.) My wife got accepted into the residency program she wanted to be in, also in Dallas. My wife finished her residency program. We had an amazing (and adorably cute)  son . Then\u2026.it\u00a0happened. I graduated from seminary! \u2026but it wasn\u2019t easy. Every Story Has It\u2019s Challenges\u2026. As I was writing this post and reflecting on the\u00a0last\u00a015 years of my life I was reminded of God\u2019s faithfulness and grace throughout it. I faced some pretty big challenges in my story, and God allowed me to overcome them. Many of the challenges I faced I brought upon myself, but some I had no  control  over; they were the sort of\u00a0challenges\u00a0we all face. But again, I look back over the last 15 years of life with a heart full of praise as I think about how God guided and shaped my life through all of these circumstances. I could write about a million challenges I faced during that time, but I\u2019ll share a few of the major ones: \n Lost my grandmother to cancer. \n Lost my grandfather. \n My dad (who I hadn\u2019t spoken with in almost a decade, but planned on doing at some point) died before I had chance to talk to him.  Here\u2019s a letter I \u201cwrote to him\u201d after his death. \n My wife\u2019s grandmother died. \n My wife\u2019s grandfather died. \n My brother in law got cancer (and beat it!)  \n Our son surprised us by being  born with Down syndrome . (Not a bad thing, just something we weren\u2019t expecting.) \n We were told in addition to Down syndrome our son could also have a very rare (and deadly)  genetic condition know as GA-1 , and that it would take 3 months for us to know for sure (right in the middle of my final exams.) \n We thought our son was having  seizures . \n We thought our son had  leukemia . \n I had to take (and pass) 5 semesters of Greek, and 4 semesters of Hebrew. (which is another miracle.)  \n And just today we\u00a0received\u00a0a call in the middle of the night from my wife\u2019s mother telling us that her grandmother had passed away. (While this didn\u2019t happen while I was going through seminary I found it\u00a0interesting\u00a0that it\u00a0happened\u00a0while I was working on this blog post. In fact, this is the point in the post where I quit\u00a0writing\u00a0last night, in order to finish up today\u2026.)\u00a0 \n Man. It\u2019s been one heck of a\u00a0journey. That\u2019s for sure. But the truth of the matter is struggles aren\u2019t\u00a0unique to me and my family. We aren\u2019t the only ones who have faced challenges recently, and honestly our  struggles  pale in\u00a0comparison\u00a0to some of the struggles that others are going through. The bottom line is  we all go through challenges. \u00a0It\u2019s part of life. The question isn\u2019t will you go through challenges / hardships / surprises in life. You will. The question is  how will you respond  to life\u2019s challenges when they come your way? As I\u2019ve said  once before ; \u2026in this life fear is going to\u00a0constantly\u00a0be knocking at your door. And every time it does it\u2019s up to you to decide you will win; fear, or truth. And in this house we\u2019ve made a\u00a0decision\u00a0that fear doesn\u2019t win in this house, God does. I\u00a0encourage\u00a0you to make the same decision. It isn\u2019t always easy. But I\u2019ll\u00a0promise\u00a0you that 100 out of 100 times  hope is always better than fear . Always. \u2026And Every Challenge Teaches Us Something. If you\u2019ve\u00a0stuck\u00a0with me this long,  thank you!  As I\u00a0mentioned about one thousand three hundred words ago,\u00a0today\u2019s post is a little different than others. I hope you didn\u2019t mind. I just wanted to take this\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to share a little bit more about my story with you. We\u2019ll be back\u00a0tomorrow\u00a0with more epic Noah cuteness. But before I end this (super long) post I wanted to share a few\u00a0 nuggets \u00a0of truth with you as a take away. Sort of a moral to my story in\u00a0progress.  15 Life Lessons That I\u2019ve Learned Along The Way \n Make time to invest in the lives of other people. \n Never doubt God. \n When it looks like the odds are against you, watch out,\u00a0because\u00a0God REALLY likes bad odds. \n God\u2019s plan for your life is\u00a0probably\u00a0much different, and\u00a0certainly\u00a0much better, than you ever could have\u00a0imagined. \n Telling someone you believe in them is a much bigger deal to them than it is to you. Take time to\u00a0encourage\u00a0someone today. It only takes you a few minutes, they may never forget it. \n You have no idea what God is\u00a0capable\u00a0of doing in and through your life. \n Friendships and\u00a0relationships\u00a0matter.You aren\u2019t meant to live in\u00a0isolation. Find people who are sold out for the things that really matter in life and hang out with them as much as you can. \n Who you date and marry matter. A lot. \n The underdog sometimes wins. \n Each of us are only one phone call / conversation / Doctor\u2019s visit away from news that could change the entire course and direction of our life. \n Not all preachers have to dress\u00a0dorky and have funny looking hair.  \n We will all face challenges in life. And when we do we have a choice to choose fear or truth. Choose truth. \n In the long run, God always wins. \n Greek and Hebrew are hard. Avoid it at all costs. Unless you\u2019re trying to earn a ThM. In that case, find a really good tutor. \n Dreams that you think are\u00a0impossible, may\u00a0actually\u00a0be more possible\u00a0than you think. (I also think I\u2019ve heard that  somewhere before \u2026.) \n I Hope We Can Still Be Friends.  Thanks for letting me have a chance to share a little of my story with you. It\u2019s so much fun sharing our son\u2019s story with you and getting the chance to learn more about yours as well! I hope you found some\u00a0encouragement\u00a0in today\u2019s post. And for those of you who aren\u2019t Christians,  anti-religion , etc. I hope we can still be friends. It\u2019s amazing how many people get upset when I even mention God on my  Facebook ,  Twitter ,  Google + , Etc. I get messages like \u201c I come here to read about your son, not a bunch of religious talk. \u201d Many of those same people have sent me kind messages in the past, commented on our blog, etc. It\u00a0surprises\u00a0(and hurts) me that people can\u00a0be so quick to write\u00a0someone\u00a0off simply\u00a0because\u00a0they are\u00a0Christian. I have lots of friends who aren\u2019t Christians and their\u00a0relationships\u00a0mean a lot to me. I hope those of you who aren\u2019t\u00a0Christians know me well enough to know I\u2019m a pretty  normal  guy. (Ok, maybe  normal\u2019s  not the right, but you get the idea.)\u00a0I hope that you don\u2019t tune me out or stop being my friend just because I talk about God. I promise, if you give me a chance you may find out that I\u2019m not like some of the other  Christians  you may have met. Oh, And if you\u2019re one of those preachers with weird hair\u2026I\u2019m sorry, but you and I can\u2019t be friends. At least not until you get a haircut.  And The Most\u00a0Important Life Lessons I\u2019ve Ever Learned\u2026 The biggest life lesson I\u2019ve ever learned is that I would be nothing without the saving and transforming power of Jesus Christ in my life. Every bit of kindness, goodness, joy, love, etc that you see in me is a direct result of my relationship with God through Jesus Christ. He has completely changed my life. I once was lost, isolated, living life with\u00a0no purpose or direction, and worse of all had no idea the joy that could only be found in a relationship with Jesus Christ. If you don\u2019t know Him, or have questions about Him, I\u2019d love to answer them. Feel free to leave a comment below. \u201cFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u2014 not by works [not by anything a person can do], so that no one can boast.\u201d \u2013 Ephesians 2:8-9 I leave you with one question. What\u2019s one dream you have that feels like it\u2019s\u00a0completely\u00a0impossible?\u00a0Completely\u00a0out of your reach? I want to know about about! So please take a second to leave a comment below and tell us. (And don\u2019t worry, no dream is too\u00a0small\u2026or too silly.

{"date": ",July,6,2011", "body": "Inflatable\u00a0elephants\u00a0are awesome Tuesdays and\u00a0Wednesdays\u00a0are Noah\u2019s weekly  physical\u00a0therapy  days (I feel like I deserve my own\u00a0parking\u00a0spot at  Our Children\u2019s House at Baylor  by now.) \u00a0It\u2019s always to  fun  seeing the many different  tools \u00a0the therapists use to give\u00a0variety\u00a0to baby Noah\u2019s  therapy sessions . \u00a0The last few weeks they have been using this really cool  inflatable\u00a0elephant . \u00a0Besides just looking fun it helps him develop much-needed  core strength , and balance. \u00a0Noah is only  six  and a half months old so he is still learning how all of his different muscles work\u00a0together. \u00a0One of the things he is trying to figure out in this stage of his life is sitting up (his current  sitting record  is 30 seconds by the way.) \u00a0It\u2019s so fun watching him work so hard to sit (and stay) up. \u00a0However, he has a tendency to push his bottom forward when he is sitting, which\u00a0causes\u00a0him to fall backwards. \u00a0The\u00a0elephant\u00a0is designed to keep a baby like Noah from\u00a0pushing\u00a0himself forward. \u00a0It accomplishes this in two\u00a0ways; 1) his sitting position, (which is very close to the neck of the elephant) and 2) the position of the\u00a0elephants\u00a0ears (which allow him to grab and hold on to in order to keep his balance.) The Rody Inflatable Hopping Horse After seeing how well Noah did on the  inflatable elephant  the last time he used it, I really wanted to get him one to use at home. \u00a0The one used by the physical\u00a0therapists is very expensive since it has to be purchased from a\u00a0medical supply company. \u00a0However, after talking with some other families who have children born with  down syndrome  I found out about the\u00a0 Rody Inflatable Hopping Horse . \u00a0The word \u201cinflatable\u201d threw me off since the one used at the physical\u00a0therapist\u00a0office seemed to be made of a really hard plastic, and not \u201cinflatable.\u201d \u00a0But, after looking closer at the one used by the\u00a0therapists, it actually is inflatable. \u00a0(It sort of reminds me of those big rubber balls you can sit on and ride. It\u2019s not like a\u00a0balloon\u00a0or anything.) \u00a0The price is  much  cheaper on  amazon , and looks to be the same quality as the more\u00a0expensive\u00a0version. \u00a0I ordered one today, and will post a review after we get a chance to use it. \u00a0This looks like a great, fun, and\u00a0fairly\u00a0inexpensive tool for anyone who wants to help their baby develop some core strength. \u00a0 Noah rocking it at physical therapy ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.baylorhealth.com/PhysiciansLocations/OCH/Pages/Default.aspx", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028FM1PM?ie=UTF8&tag=rickwsmcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B0028FM1PM", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028FM1PM?ie=UTF8&tag=rickwsmcom-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B0028FM1PM"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/elephant-take-two/", "title": "Noah Rides An Elephant At Physical Therapy \u2013 Take Two"},
{"date": ",December,8,2011", "body": "\n Dale Ulrich  is the man behind  treadmill  training, in fact he is the one that helped develop the infant treadmills that are used to help our little ones walk sooner. \u00a0\u00a0 He has been known to lend out his treadmills for use to families with children with  Down syndrome  (hint, hint). If you do any research on the topic, the majority, if not all, of the articles are written by him. High Intensity Helps In our previous post we covered how\u00a0 treadmill training \u00a0helps your child with Down syndrome walk sooner. \u00a0One of the more recent articles looked at the intensity of the workout. He assumed that if the child was on a higher intensity protocol that they would walk earlier. He was right. He looked at 8  milestones  and moves forward using pre-walking methods, raises self to standing position, walks sideways/cruises, walks with help, walks alone and walks alone with good coordination; all had meaningful differences (notice I am not using statistically significant as was used in his previous article). Previous studies have shown that with  physical therapy  alone only 40% of children with Down syndrome walked prior to 2 years, however 94% of his high intensity group walked before 2 years of age when treadmill training was added to their regimen. \u00a0 WOW! How To Increase Intensity His recommendation for increasing intensity on the treadmill was to increase the speed to increase steps per minute. They did other things in this study such as increasing time and putting weight on the child\u2019s legs. The increase in time was the most difficult for parents to adhere to because lets face it we are busy people. The weights took quite some time for the child to adjust to, so he felt that sticking to speed alone would be enough. He increased the speed once a child was able to take 10 steps per minutes, then 20, 30, etc. What To Do With Your Home Treadmill I am sure some of you have treadmills at home (we do not). We use a full size treadmill during our therapy sessions. Our  therapist  sits on a bench just above the treadmill and holds Noah so that his feet can touch the track. We set the rate at about 0.5 and away he goes for 8 minutes. We do use a harness the majority of the time as it is easier, but it is possible to hold your child over the treadmill. Imagine the arm muscles you would have doing that \ud83d\ude42 We do recommend your child wear shoes or socks as the belt on regular treadmills is pretty rough. The majority of pictures in Ulrich\u2019s articles have children in socks or barefoot, I don\u2019t know what their treadmills are made of. Take Home Message For Those Without A Treadmill I think you can also take something else away from this article even if you aren\u2019t doing treadmill training. Our children are able and willing to  work hard . We should expect and ask for higher intensity programs for our kids in their therapy sessions. It makes sense in the beginning to not have intense sessions; but if they do not increase your schedule from when the child was a few weeks old to when they are a few months old then you need to do something. Some early intervention programs will try to come as little as possible, so you need to speak up if you feel your little one can handle more. Not only that, but work hard in the sessions. \u00a0I have tagged along on some visits for early intervention and there is not a lot of  intervention  going on, just a lot of chatting. \u00a0We wrote a previous post on options for\u00a0 early intervention program s to make sure you getting the services you need. \u00a0 Noah is nonstop in his sessions. I get tired just watching. I also encourage you to be a hard-core player at home. \u00a0Don\u2019t focus on therapy moves or working on something, just  play . \u00a0You will be surprised at what your baby will learn. \u00a0We are going to play and interact with Noah as much as we can, because lets face it, it\u2019s just plain  fun .

We learned that our son was  born with Down syndrome  \u00a0four hours after he was born. \u00a0We never saw it coming. \u00a0We were completely blindsided. \u00a0A few days after Noah\u2019s birth my wife and I walked back into the through the same door we had walked out of just a few days previous as we headed to the hospital to welcome Noah into the world. \u00a0Never in a million years would we have thought we\u2019d be walking back into our home with our new son\u2026..who also happened to be born with  Down syndrome . \u00a0Talk about the surprise of your life. \ud83d\ude42 But it was ok. \u00a0We loved Noah with every once of our being. We were excited. \u00a0We were nervous. \u00a0We were scared. \u00a0We were confused. \u00a0We were hurting. \u00a0We were joyful. \u00a0It was as if we were injected with every single emotion a person could feel (and some I didn\u2019t even know existed.) \u00a0It was a very odd feeling. \u00a0But out of all the emotions we were experiencing, there were two that always rose to the top: \u00a0love and pride. We loved Noah. \u00a0And we were proud of him. This Time Last Year, Part 2: \u00a0The Scariest Day Of My Life About a week after coming home from the hospital with Noah, and as we started to catch our breath, we received a call from Noah\u2019s pediatrician. \u00a0She said we needed to come to her office right away to discuss something that had come back on Noah\u2019s  newborn screen . \u00a0As we rushed out the door my wife, a pediatrician, assured me it was no big deal, and it was probably just an issue with his thyroid. \u00a0When we arrive at the pediatrician\u2019s office we\u2019re told that Noah\u2019s newborn screen had come back positive for\u00a0 Glutaric acidemia , type 1 (GA-1) a rare genetic disorder that has nothing to do with Down syndrome and can be deadly! \u00a0(In fact we were told that if Noah had both Down syndrome, and GA-1 that he would likely be the first child ever to have both. \u00a0Just great.) We were told it would take about 90 days to know for sure, and during that time they would need to run a series of tests on our son\u2026.one of which being a DNA sequence. (You can read more about everything on my personal blog.) \u00a0My wife made me promise not to google GA-1, and I didn\u2019t. \u00a0I was to scared (and I had no idea how to spell it!) \u00a0But later that night she sat me and my in-laws down and gave us a packet of information\u2026..and it was scary. \u00a0Very scary. \u00a0(At the time I didn\u2019t have this blog, but wrote about it on my personal blog.) \u00a0 As you can imagine we were overwhelmed. \u00a0First Down syndrome,and now this. \u00a0Talk about kicking a guy while he\u2019d down (pun intended!) \ud83d\ude42 We wept that night. \u00a0That week. \u00a0That month. \u00a0We were scared for our son. \u00a0We just had our first Christmas with our first child, and we were about to have our first New Years Eve celebration with him\u2026this was supposed to be a time of great joy in our life, and it was\u2026but boy was there also a lot of pain as well. The doctor told us to \u201ctry not to worry about this\u201d and to \u201cjust try to relax until we get all the tests back\u2026\u201d Easier said than done. A Father\u2019s Prayer On December 27, 2010 (the night we found out about all of this) at 12:59 a.m. I sat alone in Noah\u2019s nursery weeping. \u00a0I was afraid. \u00a0I was scared. \u00a0I felt helpless (I was.) \u00a0I felt like no one \u00a0in the world could relate to what I was going through. \u00a0As I wept, I wrote the following words (which I\u2019ve never shared with anyone, until now) in my journal (yes, I keep a journal, so what\u2026) \ud83d\ude42 \u2026I\u2019m more scared than I\u2019ve ever been. \u00a0I am nervous, anxious, and many more things. \u00a0I want to know my son. \u00a0I want to teach him about God. \u00a0I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get to do that now. \u00a0I\u2019m scared of Noah dying. \u00a0GA-1 looks very scary. \u00a0What will we do if he has this? \u00a0Will there ever be happy days again? \u00a0Will worry overcome me? \u00a0Will life ever be normal again? \u00a0Will my wife be sad forever? \u00a0Will I? \u00a0I feel so alone. \u00a0So worried. \u00a0The only thing I know to do is pray. \u00a0I believe God is on His throne watching everything. \u00a0This is no shock to Him, or to Noah. \u00a0Today I am fasting. \u00a0I\u2019m not even sure why. \u00a0I just want God to know I\u2019m serious. \u00a0Reggie, his wife, and Brandon are fasting with me. \u00a0We are begging God for a false positive for the GA-1 test. \u00a0We will praise God either way, but a false positive sure would be nice. \u00a0I love Noah more than I every thought you could love someone. \u00a0I feel like my heart is going to explode it is so full. \u00a0I\u2019m also in deep pain because I can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d my son. \u00a0I can do nothing but pray, which is actually the best thing to do. \u00a0Father, give me peace. \u00a0Have mercy on Noah, and to us. \u00a0Please give us a long time to enjoy Noah. \u00a0He is my son. \u00a0As a Father your understand the pain of loosing a son. \u00a0But Father would you spare us that pain! \u00a0I know we don\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d that are son get better any more more than any other parents praying this same prayer tonight, but Lord I beg you. \u00a0I feel like if he has this, my heart will be sad forever. \u00a0I feel like I\u2019ll worry forever. \u00a0Although I know you can, and do, give peace to us when we go through something difficult, I don\u2019t want it to be this way. \u00a0Please God, answer our prayer. \u00a0Please give Noah a false positive for this test. \u00a0Either way Lord, please give us peace to walk through this. \u00a0We are your children, and we are afraid. \u00a0Please God show your glory through this (which you will do no matter what the outcome.) \u00a0Lord give me the strength to say \u2018thy will be done,\u2019 and the strength to commit my son to you. \u00a0He is yours, but Lord we love him. \u00a0Thank you for all of our blessings, and please give us peace and rest. Wow. \u00a0Just typing that out brought back a rush of emotions. \u00a0I remember weeping so hard as I penned those words that I had to stop writing a few times. \u00a0I remember never being more scared about anything in my life before. \u00a0I \u00a0remember never crying so hard about anything in my life before. \u00a0I also remember never praying so hard about anything in my life before. \u00a0I remember just being honest to God about how I felt, and pleading with Him of behalf of my little 2 week old son. \u00a0If Noah did have GA-1 I knew that God was the only One in the world capable of healing him, and the only thing I knew to do was pray\u2026..ask every other Christian I knew to pray with me as well. \u00a0And we prayed hard. \u00a0Every single day. A Prayer I Never Thought I Would Pray I believe in the power of prayer. \u00a0I believe prayer changes things. \u00a0I remember constantly begging God to answer one prayer for me. \u00a0It was a prayer I never dreamed in a million years I\u2019d be praying. \u00a0I prayed \u201cDear God please just let my son have Down syndrome\u2026please.\u201d I never thought in a million years I\u2019d be begging God to  just  let my son have Down syndrome. \u00a0But I was. I was scared. \u00a0GA-1 can be deadly. \u00a0Down syndrome isn\u2019t. \u00a0GA-1 is a big deal. \u00a0Down syndrome isn\u2019t. \u00a0 And every night I would asked God to, \u201cplease  just  let Noah have Down syndrome.\u201d \u00a0This time last year this is what I did: I prayed. \u00a0And waited. \u00a0And \u00a0I waited. \u00a0Prayed. \u00a0Wept. \u00a0Hugged my wife. \u00a0Played \u00a0with Noah. \u00a0Wept. Laughed. \u00a0Hugged Noah. \u00a0Prayed. \u00a0Worried. \u00a0Prayed. \u00a0Worried. \u00a0Prayed. \u00a0Held Noah. \u00a0And waited\u2026\u2026 And that is what was gong on in our life this time last year. \u00a0Heavy stuff huh? \u00a0In fact we were at the hospital on New Years Eve last year as we watched our 2 week old baby scream as lab technicians\u00a0stuck him with needles over and over again while they tried to find a tiny, new born vein on him that big enough to allow them to draw blood. \u00a0After the tests were finished we came home, and I recorded the video I posted above. \u00a0And we went to sleep scared. \u00a0Anxious. \u00a0Worried, and madly in love with a two week old boy. We would just hold him tight and  wish  that our little boy would just have Down syndrome. And that\u2019s what was going on in our life one year ago today. \u00a0Pretty crazy way to ring in the New Year, huh? Wanna know what happened? \u00a0Well\u2026after running all of the tests (including a DNA sequence) we received the results early. \u00a0And guess what\u2026. \u00a0 \u2026it turned out Noah didn\u2019t have GA-1, and the original test was a\u00a0 false positive ! \u00a0(At least that\u2019s what the Doctor\u2019s say\u2026..me on the other hand\u2026.? I think God answered my prayer request that my son would \u00a0 just \u00a0have \u00a0Down syndrome. \ud83d\ude42 \u00a0Guess I\u2019ll have to wait to find out if I was right. A Different New Years Eve Today I\u2019m almost in tears as I write again. \u00a0But this time the tears are tears of joy. \u00a0Pure joy. \u00a0Tonight I held my healthy,1 year old son as he fell asleep (actually he isn\u2019t 100% healthy tonight\u2026he has a little cold.) \u00a0As I held him I thanked God for the faithfulness, grace, and love He demonstrated toward our family his past year. \u00a0He gave us peace when no one else could. \u00a0This time last year when we were hurting people brought us gifts, movies, food, you name it\u2026.but none of it gave us true peace. \u00a0Only God could do that. \u00a0And He did. \u00a0He gave us peace in the middle of our darkest days. I could tell you so many stories about how God worked in our lives during that time, but I\u2019ll just say this. \u00a0We prayed every night for God to give us peace and joy in the middle of all that we were going through, even when it didn\u2019t seem possible to have peace\u2026..and guess what. He did! A few weeks after I wrote that entry in my journal my wife and I begin to ask each other, \u201cToday was a good day for me, what about you? \u00a0Did you cry today\u201d and eventually one of us answered back, \u201cActually no..I didn\u2019t! Wow!\u201d And we realized that God has transformed our hearts. \u00a0Our fear had 100% been replaced with joy. \u00a0 In fact by the time we received the news that Noah didn\u2019t have GA-1 we were 100% prepared (and ok) with whatever results we got. \u00a0It sounds crazy. \u00a0Impossible even. \u00a0But it\u2019s true. What Is Your \u2018it\u2019\u2026.? I can honestly say that I now know, first hand, that in our time of need God will supply us with  everything  we need to get through it. \u00a0You\u2019ll never think you\u2019ll be able to get through  it  before you are in  it . \u00a0In fact you may even say (as I did the night before Noah was born) that you don\u2019t think you can \u201chandle\u201d (fill in the blank with your  it .) \u00a0But guess what\u2026when that  it  comes, you realize that God is bigger than your  it . And He will amaze you. \u00a0And He will cause you to fall in love with Him even more. \u00a0And you\u2019ll come out of you  it  saying that  it  was the best thing that ever happened to you because now your faith is a million times stronger. \u00a0And the next time something difficult (another  it ) comes your way you\u2019ll be less worried because you\u2019ll be able to remember the time God brought you through your  it . The one tough thing about all of this is that you have to  go through  your  it . \u00a0There\u2019s no growth, like the growth you experience during hard times. \u00a0Until you go through something  really  \u00a0difficult; I mean something so\u00a0difficult you\u2019re praying prayers like: \u201cGod, I\u2019m scared my son is going to die,\u201d you\u2019ll never fully understand the extent of the growth I\u2019m talking about. \u00a0It\u2019s when you find yourself at a point of desperation and have no choice but to trust God, it\u2019s there, in that scary place, where the greatest growth and deepest understanding of God\u2019s provision and care for you occur. God Is Still In The Business Of Meeting Needs (And Your Its.) It\u2019s been a year since that all of that happened and here I am on the other side of it; alive and more grateful than ever. \u00a0This has been the very best year of my life. Without a doubt. \u00a0I want you to know that no matter what you are going through, in good times and bad, God cares about you. \u00a0He truly does. \u00a0It\u2019s more than just a clich\u00e9. \u00a0More than just a saying. \u00a0It\u2019s the truth. \u00a0God not only cares about what you are going through, He is productive. \u00a0He doesn\u2019t just sit there. \u00a0He can really give you a peace and joy in the middle of what you going though. \u00a0Trust me, I know. \u00a0This time last year all I wanted to do was weep. \u00a0He turned my weeping into joy. \u00a0And He can do the same for you. He wants to give you a joy and peace so deep that everyone else in your life looks at you and wonders, \u201cHow could they be smiling at a time like this?\u201d \u00a0 Of course, it doesn\u2019t always mean things will turn out the way you want them to. \u00a0Sometimes we don\u2019t understand the story God is in the middle of telling. \u00a0And that\u2019s ok because no matter how scary things get, you can always trust in the One that still holds the whole world in His hands. \u00a0And you can go to sleep at night trusting in the fact that your  it  is fully, 100% in His hands. \u00a0That you can cast your cares and burdens onto Him, and He will give you rest. \u00a0And man\u2026.that rest is sweet; trust me. Wow! \u00a0it\u2019s almost 5:30 in the morning now, which means it\u2019s 2012. \u00a0Since it\u2019s the start of a New Year how about I offer you this simple, yet life changing, New Year\u2019s Resolution for 2012:  Trust God . \u00a0That\u2019s it. \u00a0Instead of worrying night after night about all the \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d and  it\u2019s  in your life\u2026what would your life be like if you (and I) just start trusting God more. \u00a0Can you imagine how different your life would be if you and I truly lived our life trusting in the fact that God still holds the whole world in the palm of His hand? \u00a0Can you imagine how great 2012 could be if we lived each and every day as if that was true? \u00a0The good news is\u2026it is true! Let\u2019s start this year off right by committing to trust God in everything this year\u2026.even the really scary stuff. \u00a0Are you willing? It won\u2019t be easy. \u00a0But it\u2019ll be worth it. \u201cWhen his people pray for help, He listens and rescues them\u00a0from their troubles. \u00a0The LORD is there to rescue\u00a0all\u00a0who are discouraged\u00a0and have given up hope. \u00a0The LORD\u2019s people\u00a0may suffer a lot,\u00a0but he will always\u00a0bring them safely through.\u201d \n \u2013 Psalm 34: 17-19 How about taking a few minutes to pause, and ask God to help you commit all of your worries, fears, and anxieties to Him this year. Are you up to the challenge? Be sure to let me know in the comments! \u00a0Here\u2019s to a great 2012!

{"date": ",December,15,2011", "body": "I came across this amazing video tonight about a young man named Ryan Pittman who is  literally  changing the world! Ryan was born with  Down syndrome  and for years had a desire to travel to Peru with his church,  Fellowship Bible Church \u00a0in Nashville and share with them the amazing things God had done in his life. \u00a0When he graduated high school that dream became a reality. \u00a0I\u2019ll let you watch the video for yourself, but let me just say ahead of time; this video blessed me tremendously! As a parent of a\u00a0 child born with Down syndrome  myself, seeing Ryan\u2019s story brought me great hope about Noah\u2019s future. \u00a0I\u2019ll let you in on a little secret. \u00a0I have two  big  prayer requests for Noah. \u00a0Two prayer requests that I \u00a0pray for over and over and over for my son. \u00a0Here they are: \n That Noah would come to have a relationship with the Lord at an early age. \n That God would use Noah\u2019s life to impact and change the world for His (God\u2019s) sake. \n I sometimes  worry  about Noah\u2019s future (as all parents do for their children). \u00a0I sometimes, in the back of my mind, wonder to what extent Noah\u2019s\u00a0 disability \u00a0(I really dislike that word by the way. \u00a0If you know Noah, or anyone else born with Down syndrome, than you know that they are\u00a0 far  from  dis-abled ) is going to keep him from accomplishing the  goals  he will surely have for his life. But then it happens. \u00a0Out of the blue. \u00a0When I least expect it. \u00a0 Bam! Tonight God used this video, and Ryan Pittman\u2019s testimony, to keep my vision in focus. \u00a0Focused on truth. \u00a0Focused on the fact that He (God) still holds the whole world in His hands. \u00a0Focused on the fact that\u00a0 He is in control . \u00a0Focused on the fact that He does what  He  wants, with who  He  wants, when  He  wants. Today is Noah\u2019s 1 year birthday, and I can honestly say this has been the  best year  of my entire life. \u00a0This time last year I would have never imagined that God would be using my little boy to impact lives all over the world with the simple\u00a0 fact that Down syndrome  is ok! \u00a0I\u2019m so blessed to be this little boy\u2019s daddy. To Ryan Pittman and his family: Thank you! \u00a0I hope to meet you guys one day. \u00a0The fact that today is Noah\u2019s birthday makes this video, and Ryan\u2019s testimony, even more special to me. \u00a0I pray that God would allow my wife and I to be the sort of \u00a0loving parents to Noah that you guys are to Ryan. \u00a0And also that God would continue to use my son to impact the world (just like your son!) To everyone else: If you didn\u2019t watch the video, please take five minutes and watch it, then take a second to click the like button to the left. \u00a0Share it on  Facebook . \u00a0Tweet it on twitter. \u00a0Let\u2019s share this awesome story!

{"date": ",August,24,2012", "body": "It\u2019s funny how things work out sometimes. After our Target post went\u00a0 viral \u00a0I really wanted to find a way to get a hold of the family whose little boy appeared in Target ad \u00a0I had blogged about. When I published that post, I had no idea their son\u2019s picture was going to be plastered all over the media. I had no idea if they even\u00a0 knew \u00a0what was happening, but from all of the calls we were getting from various media outlets about the post, I knew it was only a matter of time\u00a0before\u00a0they found out. I really wanted to connect with them so I could tell them what had\u00a0happened before the media started blowing up their phones (or even worse, coming to their home!) Hanging out in Times Square! However, I didn\u2019t even know this little boy\u2019s name, much less how to get a hold of his parents. Even if I reach them, I wondered if they were going to be upset at me for\u00a0indirectly bringing their family into the spotlight. Regardless, I still wanted to find a way to reach them. As it turns out Ryan Langston (the little boy with Down syndrome in the Target ad) also appeared in an advertisement\u00a0for\u00a0 Nordstrom , which I\u00a0happened\u00a0to also blog about months\u00a0before\u00a0this Target ad came out. I had no idea this was the same child until someone pointed it out. Then I remembered that little boy\u2019s mother\u00a0commenting on the post, therefore I had her email address, thus a way to (hopefully) reach them! I sent her an email and we connected on the phone shortly after. We talked for a while about all of the media attention this ad was getting, we talked about each other\u2019s families, and what life was like raising twins; one of whom has Down syndrome. (I found out Ryan has a twin brother, Ian.) Ryan and his twin brother, Ian What\u2019s even more fun is we had a trip to New York planned before this Target post went viral, so we arranged to meet up with Ryan\u2019s family while we were in New York. In fact, we had been talking with some folks at NBC Nightly News about doing a special segment with Ryan\u2019s family, but we would have had to\u00a0arrive\u00a0in NYC a few days before we had planned, and we weren\u2019t able to make it work, schedule wise. But if you didn\u2019t see the segment NBC Nightly news did on Ryan and his family, you can check it out\u00a0 here . I thought they did an\u00a0excellent\u00a0job! However, we did make some good friends at NBC and they invited our two families to 30 Rock to hang out with them for a bit, and get a behind the scenes\u00a0tour of 30 rock, where NBC\u2019s\u00a0corporate\u00a0offices are located. Thanks to the NBC Nightly News folks for a great time! If you aren\u2019t\u00a0familiar\u00a0with 30 Rock, it\u2019s where a number of NBC\u2019s\u00a0television\u00a0show\u2019s are produced. I\u2019ve been on the tourist\u2019s tour of 30 Rock before, but Ann Thompson and the crew we were with from NBC was able to give us a more\u00a0advanced\u00a0tour. It was awesome. One thing I don\u2019t remember seeing on past tours were these pipes hidden away in one of the back hallways of 30 Rock. The pipes were actually painted by Jim Henson, creator of The Muppets. I thought the\u00a0 story \u00a0behind these pipes was especially\u00a0interesting. The Muppet Pipes! We wondered around for a bit, and ended up on the set of Late Night With Jimmy Fallon. Jimmy\u2019s wardrobe for the night. What was really funny was the actually got kicked out of Jimmy Fallon\u2019s set! \u00a0Ann Thompson (a reporter for NBC Nightly News)\u00a0 snuck \u00a0us on to the set, and the crew that was working didn\u2019t\u00a0recognize\u00a0her, and ended up kicking us all out. Ann didn\u2019t say give them any hassle, or even mention who she was. She just said, \u201cOk, sorry.\u201d as we walked out. We all got a chuckle out of it. Hilarious. Ryan and his brother on the set of Jimmy Fallon Afterwards we ended up heading to the set of one of my favorite shows,\u00a0 Saturday Night Live ! SNL Stage Here are some more pictures from our time at NBC. BIg thanks to everyone at NBC Nightly News for being so kind and welcoming, and for the great tour! We look forward to saying\u00a0hello\u00a0again next time we\u2019re in NYC! Ryan and Noah hanging out with Ann Thompson Lots going on in this room! After our tour we spent some time walking around the city, and hanging out at a few of my favorite places in NYC, before\u00a0grabbing some lunch. The Nintendo World Store \u00a0is always on my places to visit in New York! Ryan and his mommy Hanging out in Nintendo World, NYC. Then to Toys R Us\u2026.again! (As you can see, Noah was happy about that.)\u00a0 \u00a0By the way,\u00a0 be sure to watch today\u2019s video \u00a0to see Ryan\u2019s reaction to meeting the T-Rex inside of Toy\u2019s R Us. It\u2019s classic! (Scroll up to the top of this post to watch the video.) He loves his mommy! Ryan is a fan of Ironman! And finally lunch time\u2026.. Noah likes his new buddy, Ryan. Ryan\u2019s all smiles! Fingers for lunch? Sure, why not! After dinner we took a few pictures in Times Square before saying good bye to the Langston\u2019s. It was so much fun to hang out with them. In fact, one of the best parts of the Target post going viral was the friendship we made with their family. We\u2019re looking forward to staying friends with the Langstons, and seeing them again the next time we\u2019re in New York. Later that tonight we went out to grab dinner, and were treated to one of the first snow falls of the year! It didn\u2019t last long, but everyone was\u00a0grabbing\u00a0their cell phones and cameras to capture the moment. It really was\u00a0beautiful\u00a0(and cold!) Lots of snow! I love these two! Fun with a fish eye lens! This guy made this picture even better! I love this little bear! I think he likes New York! After a long day in the New York, Noah (and his parents) were ready to get some much needed sleep! One sleepy baby Noah\u2026 Did you watch any of the news reports about Ryan Langston (the model born with Down syndrome?) Did you see the Target ad yourself? And a bonus question, are you fan of New York (like I am?) When\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve been, or when do you plan to go? Leave a comment and talk to us, we enjoy hearing from you!

{"date": ",September,19,2012", "body": "This kid is seriously on a roll lately. He\u00a0 just \u00a0learned to climb up a\u00a0 few \u00a0steps a few days ago, and as you can see in today\u2019s video, he\u2019s already almost able to make it to the top of our\u00a0staircase at home!\u00a0I\u2019m so\u00a0 proud \u00a0of this little boy! He\u2019s hard at work learning to climb these stairs. Isn\u2019t it fun how our kids just decide to up and surprise us sometimes? As I mentioned, it was only a few days ago when we blogged about Noah climbing up a few steps \u00a0at occupational therapy (and shared some tips on how you can help your child do the same.) So tonight we were just playing around at home practicing what Noah had learned in\u00a0therapy the other day\u2026and hoping he would take a few\u00a0steps\u00a0on our staircase at home\u2026.when BAM! Out of nowhere he just decided to blow us away and make his way (almost) to the half-way point for our\u00a0staircase! It was awesome! You Never Know When Your Child\u2019s Going To Surprise You! Today could be the day your child blows you away\u2026.again! I\u2019ve said this before, and I\u2019ll say it again;\u00a0 you really never know \u00a0when your child is going to decide to just out of the blue surprise you by doing something awesome! \u00a0 In no way \u00a0I was expecting Noah to just take off up the\u00a0stairs\u00a0like he did tonight! He just\u00a0decided\u00a0he wanted to do it, and off he went with it!\u00a0 This is also the same thing that\u00a0happened\u00a0when he first started\u00a0 crawling . We assumed that Noah was going to go from inch worming / rolling around to walking, and just sort of skip crawling all together (which not uncommon in children, by the way.) So we\u00a0 weren\u2019t even expecting \u00a0him to start crawling. Then one day while we were playing around in his nursery\u2026. BAM , he just took off and started\u00a0 crawling . Once again,\u00a0 It was awesome! The same thing also happened when he learned to\u00a0 sit up \u00a0on his own. And once again\u2026. it was awesome! So I\u2019m starting to see a pattern develop as I watch Noah grow and develop. The pattern is this\u2026.this is no pattern! Whatever I\u00a0 expect \u00a0to happen, probably isn\u2019t\u00a0going\u00a0to happen. So I guess you could say it\u2019s better to\u00a0 expect the unexpected !\u00a0 \u00a0In fact, I think a\u00a0 former Denver\u00a0Broncos \u00a0player told something along those same lines one time! Don\u2019t Worry, Be Happy! \u201cBeing Awesome Is Way Better Than Worrying.\u201d\u00a0 So if you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019ve been a\u00a0 little \u00a0discouraged lately about your child\u2019s progress, I just want to encourage you by reminding you that you\u00a0 never know what\u2019s around the corner \u00a0for you child. Heck,\u00a0 today could be the day that your child decides to amaze you by reaching a\u00a0 milestone \u00a0that you thought was a long way away! And even if they don\u2019t, who cares? They sure don\u2019t.\u00a0 As my wife so eloquently put it, let\u2019s make habit out of\u00a0 celebrating, not comparing \u00a0our children.\u00a0 There\u2019s no one else in the world like your child. \u00a0They are their own person and will grow and develop in their own\u00a0unique\u00a0way as well. Enjoy Being A Parent Today. You\u2019ll have seasons where it seems like every day your child is reaching\u00a0 another developmental milestone \u2026.and you\u2019ll have seasons where you feel like they\u2019ll never reach another one. And they are just that, seasons. They come, and go. So don\u2019t get to attached to attached to any certain one.\u00a0Instead just remind yourself of how much\u00a0fun\u00a0it is to be a parent, and go have some fun today! Heck, maybe you just need to turn the music up and\u00a0dance\u00a0today. You have my\u00a0permission.\u00a0 What are you celebrating in your house lately? What goals are you working on? Leave a comment below and tell us about it. (I\u2019ll go first; We\u2019re celebrating Noah crawling up the stars on his own today! And we\u2019re working hard on getting him to take his first steps.) Now it\u2019s your turn. 1, 2, 3, go\u2026..

{"date": ",July,5,2011", "body": "Childhood Memories The Forth of July brings back  good  memories of my four  brothers  and I piling into our parents mini-van and heading over to the local firework show (early of course so we could get a  good  seat!) \u00a0After we were bathed in  Deep Woods Off , we dined on an endless supply of  kool-aid cool bursts  and ham sandwiches as we waited for the show to start! (By the way, there\u2019s no smell on earth like the musty combination of sweat and Deep Woods Off!) \u00a0 As we sat in that hot Texas heat watching those fireworks we had fun. \u00a0We made memories. \u00a0Memories I still think about today. Making New Ones\u2026 Today my wife and I made some of those same memories with our son, Noah. \u00a0Although we wanted to go to Ft. Worth for their annual\u00a0firework show on the\u00a0Trinity\u00a0River, we ended up heading down to Fair Park in Dallas. \u00a0Abbie and I went to the show at Fair Park a few years back, and remembered it being great! \u00a0But this year\u00a0their\u00a0show seemed really short. \u00a0I think the City of Dallas shortened it from\u00a0thirty\u00a0minutes to fifteen. \u00a0Budget cuts, maybe? Luckily, my wife\u00a0was carrying Noah in his  carrier ,\u00a0because\u00a0Dallas opposed a \u201c no stroller \u201d law for the firework show this year! \u00a0Seriously, a no stroller law\u2026?! \u00a0I think the entire of city of Dallas decided to come out to Fair Park last night, (25,000 people showed up!) and it was quite a hike from the parking lot (which was someone\u2019s front yard!) to the viewing area, so you can\u00a0imagine\u00a0how upset\u00a0a lot of parents were, and rightfully so. \u00a0If I had wheeled Noah in his stroller all that way (in 101 degree heat) and was told to go back to the car I wouldn\u2019t have been happy either. \u00a0Not a cool move Dallas. Every Firework Show Needs A Good Blanket Once we were in, we\u00a0lounged\u00a0around on a really cool fold out \u201c blanket \u201d my  wife  bought! \u00a0I\u2019m not sure if you have ever brought a blanket somewhere before (fireworks, picnic,  swimming , beach, etc..) to hang out on, but I\u2019ve\u00a0always found them\u00a0awkward to carry, they get sand, dirt, grass, etc. all over the place, and are overall just a hassle. I have never seen one of these types of \u201cblankets\u201d before and thought it was a very smart purchase. \u00a0I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get a ton of use out of it over the years! \u00a0 I highly\u00a0recommend\u00a0it! Almost Show Time We hung out for about an hour  playing  with Noah, and getting the camera ready for the show. \u00a0I\u2019ve never tried to take (good) pictures of fireworks before, and wanted to\u00a0attempt a few shots of the show (and lots of our son!) \u00a0However, once the show started we\u00a0realized\u00a0that our  prime  location wasn\u2019t so prime after all. \u00a0There was a huge oak tree between us and the fireworks! \u00a0By the time we moved all of our stuff, reset up the tripod, and started to take pictures\u2026.the show was over! \u00a0(Fifteen minutes goes by a lot faster than you\u2019d think.) \u00a0Regardless, we had a lot of fun. \u00a0And made some new memories. \u00a0So it\u2019s a win. Thoughts On Fatherhood I\u2019ve learned a lot about fatherhood over the last  six months . \u00a0 Before  Noah was born I wondered how I\u2019d be at fatherhood. \u00a0 After  Noah was born I wondered about how I\u2019d be at fatherhood.\u201d And I\u2019m  still  wondering how I\u2019m going to be at fatherhood. \u00a0But\u2026.I\u2019m quickly learning that fatherhood isn\u2019t something someone can \u201c be \u201d good at. \u00a0It\u2019s something that you  become  good at. \u00a0Moment\u00a0by moment. \u00a0Minute by minute. \u00a0Day by day. \u00a0It\u2019s a process. \u00a0And that\u2019s ok. \u00a0It\u2019s a process I enjoy. I just wish someone would have taught me how to take better family firework shots! (You notice there are no shots of us and the fireworks at the same time?) \u00a0Oh well. \u00a0There\u2019s always next year. \u00a0Like I said, it\u2019s a process. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.off.com/DeepWoods.aspx", "http://product.expotv.com/1/4/6/146028_150x150.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Beco-Baby-Carrier-Gemini-Metro/dp/B003YE24EE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=baby-products&qid=1309910992&sr=8-1", "http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Few-problems-at-Fair-Park-Festival-124991384.html", "http://www.amazon.com/Tuffo-Water-Resistant-Outdoor-Blanket-Carrying/dp/B001J9N1PW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1309910918&sr=8-2"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/first-firework-show/", "title": "Noah\u2019s First Forth Of July Firework Show"},

The best thing to do when you start to feel a little down is to stop and reflect on the first time you saw your baby. Remember how awesome it was before you got caught up on what your child could and couldn\u2019t do? Before you started comparing your child to everyone\u00a0else\u2019s? How the only thing that\u00a0mattered\u00a0with your baby and you? (And getting lots and lots of snuggles?)

Tonight was his first go round at eating spaghetti, and as you can see, he really enjoyed it. In\u00a0addition\u00a0to just tasting good, letting him eat the\u00a0spaghetti with his hands made for some more great sensory input. If you think about it would seem like spaghetti is sort of a hard thing for a growing baby to eat with their hands; it certainly  feels different  than other types of foods. It\u2019s slick, sort of  slimy , slippery, maybe a little hard to hold, etc. But he handled it like a champ. I was impressed. \ud83d\ude42 Are you letting your child eat things with his hands? If so how do they do with that? Are there any food that they outright don\u2019t want coming any where near their mouth? And if so, when did you first notice them not liking that food or have they always not liked it? Leave a comment below and tell us about it.

{"date": ",August,12,2012", "body": "It\u2019s only the second day of our trip to New York and I\u2019m pretty sure Noah\u2019s already a huge fun of the Big Apple\u2026just like his dad. This morning we took a cab over to the Eastside of the city and headed to\u00a0 Trinity Grace Church \u00a0to meet up with some new friends,\u00a0 Gabe \u00a0and\u00a0 Rebekah Lyons .\u00a0Their oldest son,\u00a0 Cade , is ten years old and was born with\u00a0 Down syndrome \u00a0like our son, Noah. The Lyons are some of the most loving and kind people anyone could ever know and we\u2019re thankful to call them\u00a0friends!\u00a0After church they took us to an awesome\u00a0restaurant\u00a0for brunch. I wish I could remember the name of it because\u00a0I\u00a0definitely\u00a0want to go back! (I\u2019ll be sure to update the post once I ask them what it was!) We spent the the morning talking about our families, asking Gabe and Rebekah questions we had about raising a child with Down syndrome whose a few years older than Noah, and talking through various ways to change the world\u2026.but that\u2019s another blog post for another day. As you can see Noah loved the Lyons as much as we did. (Plus, I think we may have scored some\u00a0 free baby sitting \u00a0the next time we\u2019re in NYC and want to go see a show!)\u00a0 After lunch we\u00a0explored\u00a0the city a little bit and made our way over to my all time favorite toy store ,\u00a0 FAO Schwarz . Every time I\u2019m in New York I make sure to visit FAO\u2026so I was\u00a0 super\u00a0excited \u00a0to bring my own son here for the first time! (And before he\u2019s old enough to want everything in store. As you\u2019re about to see, you can go broke quick in this place.) This man guards the front door. (In the freezing cold!) One of my favorite things about FAO is looking (and laughing) at all of the one of a kind (and over the top) toys they have\u00a0scattered\u00a0through out the store, like this 25,000 dollar barbie foosball table! See, I told you so. A person is only one doll house away from the poor house in here.\u00a0 Or\u00a0maybe\u00a0you\u2019re more\u00a0interested\u00a0in the 1,500 dollar, bedazzled Etch-A-Sketch\u2026 Or\u00a0perhaps\u00a0you\u2019re saving your money up for one of my personal favorite, the 250,000 dollars \u00a0Dance-On Piano. That\u2019s right friends, for a quarter of a million dollars you and your family can bring home your very own replica of the piano\u00a0used in the\u00a0movie\u00a0 Big \u00a0and\u00a0hop around playing Heart and Soul until your feet hurt!\u00a0 \nBy the way if you\u2019ve never seen the\u00a0movie\u00a0Big,\u00a0 you should , because\u00a0it\u2019s awesome!\u00a0 \u00a0Here\u2019s a clip of the BIG piano scene. I\u2019ve a huge fan of creative play, and thought it would be fun to buy Noah his first puppet while we were here. Not only would make for a fun and memorable\u00a0souvenir, it was much more in our price range. Noah and I had fun\u00a0 monkeying around \u00a0while picking out a puppet. And as you can see we ended up bringing home a monkey! I love watching his face light up with\u00a0 wonder \u00a0and\u00a0curiosity\u00a0as we played around with the puppets. His expressions melt his daddy\u2019s heart that\u2019s for sure. Not only does FAO have an\u00a0incredible\u00a0children\u2019s book section, they also have several\u00a0 free \u00a0story times throughout the day. If you\u2019re in NYC and looking for something cheap (free!) to do with your small children, I highly suggest checking it out. Although depending on\u00a0their\u00a0age, it could turn from free to\u00a0expensive\u00a0pretty quick as they are tempted with wall to wall toys while making their way to the story room! Thankfully Noah\u2019s only 12 months old, and the only thing he wanted was hugs.\u00a0 Noah gets intense when it comes to story time! It doesn\u2019t matter where Noah\u2019s at, he likes to make himself right at home! (By the way, does anyone else have a hard time keeping shoes and socks on their children? Noah\u2019s become a master at taking his shoes and socks off. Even\u00a0velcro\u00a0is no match for this kid.) As you can see Noah wasn\u2019t really\u00a0interested\u00a0in leaving. \u00a0Oh, and for those of you who think that all children with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0are angels,\u00a0 you\u2019re wrong .\u00a0 Next door to Fao Schwarz is another one of my favorite places in New York; the 24 hour flagship Apple store! That\u2019s right, it\u2019s open 24 hours a day. So if you ever find yourself in NYC and need to buy a new iPad at 2 am you know where to go! This was our first time in New York with an infant, and if you\u2019ve ever been to this city before you know how crazy it can be to catch a cab. The drivers are in a hurry, there are mobs of people all around, and we wondered how that all worked when you add a car seat and stroller to the mix. Although it\u2019s doable (in fact we did it this morning on the way to church) we found it was much easier to simply strap Noah to us and take the subway. It\u2019s all good\u00a0because\u00a0I\u00a0actually\u00a0like carrying him around anyways, and he enjoyed the ride. So it was a double\u00a0 win ! By the end of the day we had done so much walking around we were both ready to head to our hotel and catch some sleep\u2026.. \u2026but we wanted to try out a few fun places for dinner first. Our first stop was to grab some fries from\u00a0 Pommes Frites . I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201cFries for dinner!\u201d But let me just tell you, these aren\u2019t your average fries; these are \u201cauthentic\u00a0Belgian\u00a0fries\u201d and man are they ever awesome! But what\u2019s really amazing are all of the\u00a0delicious\u00a0dipping sauces they have for your fry dipping pleasure.\u00a0Yummm\u2026! Just\u00a0typing\u00a0this makes me wish I was snacking on some. We didn\u2019t\u00a0finish\u00a0all our\u00a0fries\u00a0because we wanted to save room for another snack place we heard about from our friend\u00a0 Eryn . It\u2019s called\u00a0 S\u2019Mac \u00a0and\u00a0they serve mac and cheese\u2026. lots, and lots \u00a0of mac and cheese!. And it is awesome! Words can\u2019t explain how happy I was to see this pan full of piping hot S\u2019Mac in front of me. We walked in the\u00a0 freezing cold \u00a0from the place I mentioned above to S\u2019Mac (about 6 long, cold, New York City blocks)\u2026with a baby strapped to me)\u2026then we had to wait for a table\u2026and I was\u00a0starving. Needless to say, this pan full of S\u2019Mac didn\u2019t last long.\u00a0 And here\u2019s a picture of a menu from\u00a0another\u00a0place I ate at during our trip. Only in NYC can you find a Bowel of Cereal on a menu\u2026under the Rigatoni! While I enjoy watching the ice skaters at\u00a0 Rockefeller Center , I\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u00a0want to be them. I remember when I snapped this picture I was so cold I didn\u2019t even want to take my glove off to use my iPhone camera. I\u2019m not a good ice skater, and falling on cold hard ice in freezing weather, isn\u2019t something I\u2019m all that interested\u00a0in. And one last shot of the day from Times Square, aka a visual\u00a0representation\u00a0of what goes on inside my\u00a0brain. We had a great second (and cold) day in New York, but after a long day we were ready to head back to our hotel and get recharged.\u00a0There\u2019s a lot on the agenda for tomorrow starting with meeting Ryan Langston\u2019s family (the young model with Down syndrome from the\u00a0 Target ad ) at NBC studios. I can\u2019t wait to tell you all more about it! What are some of your favorite places to visit in New York? If you\u2019ve never been would you like to go? Why or why not?

{"date": ",October,16,2012", "body": "Our son must have been bitten by a radio active spider or something\u00a0because\u00a0he has\u00a0suddenly\u00a0turned into a  baby spiderman . (For all the non  comic book nerds  out there that\u2019s an  Amazing Spider-Man  reference.)   \u00a0As I mentioned recently, you never know when your child is going to decide to surprise you by  doing the\u00a0unexpected . Sometimes, the unexpected is  something awesome  (and safe) like  sitting up  on their own for the first time, or  learning how to crawl ; other times it\u2019s something that\u2019s still pretty awesome,  just not very safe. Like today for instance, I was watching Noah play in his play gate (which by the way, is the  North States Superyard Color Play Yard . We like it a lot, and If you\u2019re looking for baby gate /\u00a0play yard, I  highly  suggest checking it out!) when he decided to just start  climbing up the gate \u2026.Spiderman Style! It was amazing (and again, very unsafe.) \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 Curiosity \u201cDad, let me out of here.\u201d (Please.) \n I love the fact that as Noah get\u2019s older, he gets more and more curious. He loves to explore and try to solve problems in creative ways. (Like moving his toys to the\u00a0windowsill\u00a0so he can use them as stepping stones in order to climb on to it.) I\u2019ve already mentioned how our son  reminded me of a Muppet Baby , and it\u2019s a ton of fun watching his little brain go a million miles a minute as he learns new things every day. Don\u2019t you just love this little face? I sure do! I hope Noah keeps his sense of curiosity and exploration his entire life, especially since adults often lose it; which is a shame. \u201cWe keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we\u2019re curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.\u201d -Walt Disney Learning To Say No As Noah gets older, and becoming more and more curious, my wife and I find\u00a0ourselves\u00a0saying \u201cNo\u201d more and often. We try to make sure our  Yes\u2019s   far outnumber \u00a0our  no\u2019s , and that we  celebrate  more than we\u00a0discipline, but still it\u2019s getting to the point where we\u2019re having to  lovingly help  our son learn that his choices have\u00a0consequences. That climbing over the gate may be sort of awesome (in a manly-guy sort of thing) and yes, it shows off how strong he is getting, but it\u2019s also\u00a0dangerous. On the other side of that gate is a floor. Ouch! As you can see in today\u2019s video, he thought No meant more (which by the way was the  first sign  he learned) and so he kept climbing up his play gate. So we have  a few things  to work on. But it\u2019s all good. You take parenting like you take everything else in life, one day at a time. And we\u2019re having lots and lots of great days in this house with this little guy around. \u201cHmmm, I totally think I can escape from this baby jail.\u201d \u201cI\u2019M GOING OVER!!!\u201d Awwwww\u2026.Isn\u2019t it fun to be a parent?

{"date": ",August,17,2012", "body": "Wayne Brady issues apology via Facebook Wayne Brady\u00a0Apologizes for his comments about Sarah Palin\u2019s Son, Trig. (And the entire Down syndrome community.) A few days ago I wrote an\u00a0 Open Letter to Wayne Brady \u00a0about his recent comments at Comedy Central\u2019s roast of Roseanne\u00a0Barr. If you\u2019d like to read what Wayne Brady said about Trig Palin that has so many parent\u2019s unhappy you can read the\u00a0 post , but in short he made a\u00a0 joke \u00a0that used Trig Palin (and his\u00a0 Down syndrome \u00a0diagnosis) as the punchline. The\u00a0 joke \u00a0was met with boo\u2019s from the crowd, as well as\u00a0numerous\u00a0posts on Wayne Brady\u2019s Facebook page by parents posting pictures of their\u00a0 children born with Down syndrome , expressing their\u00a0disappointment in Mr. Brady, and asking \u00a0Wayne Brady for an apology for his comments during Comedy Central\u2019s Roast of Roseanne Barr. After the roast, Wayne Brady thanked his fans via twitter for watching the roast and that he was glad it \u201copened some eyes.\u201d (Although I\u2019m not sure what that means.) A few days later he retweeted a message from a fan that said he was glad Wayne wasn\u2019t\u00a0apologizing\u00a0for the comments; which was taken by many to suggest that Wayne Brady\u00a0 wasn\u2019t \u00a0going to apologize for the comments directed at Sarah Palin\u2019s son, Trig. Today Wayne Brady issued an apology via his\u00a0 Facebook page . Here is the apology in its\u00a0entirety: This letter has taken me a few days to compose because of the conflicting emotions that I\u2019ve experienced since the day of the Roast and it\u2019s subsequent airing. The environment of the Roast is a comedic (hopefully), tasteless (mostly always), affair that encourages everyone to out-filth each other. Not normally what I\u2019m known for, right? But, when I was invited, I jumped at the chance to play outside of my perceived \u201cnorm\u201d and have fun. The Jeff joke was written for me and at the end of the day I take full responsibility for saying it. It wasn\u2019t meant as a slam to Trig and at the time I didn\u2019t see it that way. \n I could defend it as a performer, but I would rather apologize from the bottom of my heart as a father. I understand how a parent, who loves their child, who tries to nurture and shield them when they cannot defend themselves, would take offense.. I have many times experienced this feeling. I\u2019ve had awful things said about my daughter.. Violent and most times racial stabs. Being in the spotlight I have built a thick skin to these sorts of things. My daughter ( who\u2019s now old enough to understand ) is another story. That being said I write this letter with sensitivity and a strong stance of responsibility for my actions. \n I thank everyone who\u2019s expressed their opinion for reminding me that my voice is heard\u2026 It\u2019s easy to forget sometimes in front of cameras and lights. \n To the Palins, please know that no malice or harm was meant. To the other families who were touched negatively, I hope you\u2019ll be able to accept this apology as well. \n I\u2019ve always said that people in the public eye should be held responsible for what you say and I\u2019m no hypocrite. Thanks for reading and letting me express my side. \n Take care all, \n Wayne I will say I found it\u00a0interesting\u00a0that Mr. Brady didn\u2019t mention the word \u201cDown syndrome\u201d once in his apology letter. However, I am glad that Mr. Brady at least\u00a0acknowledged\u00a0that his remarks were\u00a0hurtful\u00a0and crossed a line. I do hope Wayne Brady takes me up on my offer to attend a National Down Syndrome Society\u00a0 Buddy Walk , or get\u00a0involved\u00a0in his local Down Syndrome\u00a0organization so that he may have the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to get to know someone with Down syndrome personally. Mr. Brady if you are reading this, I accept your apology, and really do hope to see you at a Buddy Walk sometime.\u00a0 What do you think about Wayne Brady\u2019s apology?

{"date": ",August,14,2012", "body": "Update: A few days after this letter was written Wayne Brady issued an\u00a0apology\u00a0for the Trig Palin \u201cjoke\u201d he made during Comedy Central\u2019s roast of Roseanne Barr.\u00a0Check it out\u00a0and let us know what you think. For those of you who aren\u2019t aware, Wayne Brady was a part of Comedy Central\u2019s roast of Roseanne Barr this past Sunday. At one point in his routine he directed the following statement to Jeff Ross, another comedian taking part in the roast. \u201cNow the thing is Jeff, these are all jokes, and I really like you. I really, really like you. But a lot of people hate you, especially Sarah Palin because you remind her of what Trig is going to look like when he\u2019s 40.\u201d Wayne Brady\u2019s comments infer that Sarah Palin\u2019s son, Trig,\u00a0would\u00a0grow up to be an ugly 40-year-old\u00a0because\u00a0he was born with Down syndrome. In other words, Mr. Brady used a 4-year-old-boy with Down syndrome (and an entire population of people living with Down\u00a0syndrome, a group which my son is a part of) as the punchline of a cruel and hurtful joke. What follows is an open letter to Mr. Wayne Brady regarding the comments he made during the Comedy Central program. \n \n*** Dear Mr. Brady, Your remarks about Trig Palin during Comedy Central\u2019s roast of Roseanne Barr were out of line, hurtful, and disrespectful not simply to the Palin family, but to thousands of individuals living with Down syndrome today, their families, friends, and all of us who place a high value on all human life. I\u2019m a father of a 19 month old boy (whom I love deeply) who was\u00a0 born with Down syndrome . Some people (wrongly) assume that he is \u2018suffering\u2019 with Down syndrome. But they are incorrect. It isn\u2019t Down syndrome that people like my son suffer from, Mr. Brady, rather his suffering comes from having to endure hurtful comments like the one you made toward Trig Palin (which also applies to my son as well since your underlying premise was that people with Down syndrome grow up to become ugly.) The truth of the matter is, I do worry about the hurtful comments people will say to my son as he gets older. Comments on the playground, around his school, when we are on vacation. It breaks my heart that someone could say things to purposely hurt my little boy. Perhaps what hurts the most is that while I\u2019m expecting these sorts of comments from children too immature to understand the gravity of their words, I don\u2019t expect them from adults. From other parents who know the love a parent has for their child. How do you think Trig\u2019s mom and dad felt when they heard you say what you said? How would you have felt if someone on national television used your son as a punch line of a cruel joke? Think about it. Would you be angry? Hurt?\u00a0Disappointed? Mr. Brady, you\u2019ve been on Sesame Street a number of times, a show my son and many other children with Down syndrome watch as well. Were you aware that Sesame Street\u00a0features children with Down syndrome on their show from time to time? I\u2019m curious if you have ever met any children with Down syndrome while on their set? I wonder if you\u2019d be able to look one of their\u00a0fathers\u00a0or mothers in the eyes if you were to meet one after this past weekend. Would you apologize to them? I have to be honest, if I see you on an episode of Sesame Street\u00a0after these comments, I would turn the channel. I would not want to watch you on that show pretending to be a person who loves and cares for all children. Someone who makes hurtful comments like you made is not a person that loves and cares for all people, but rather a person who treats people as a punchline. Here\u2019s a video clip of one of your many\u00a0appearances\u00a0on Sesame Street. This seems to be a different person than the one that made the comments above. Trig Palin, my son, and the thousands of other people living with Down syndrome aren\u2019t punchlines. They are human beings. They are daughters. Sons. Grandchildren. Most of all, they are people . Mr. Brady, your comment implied that people over 40 with Down syndrome are ugly. I\u2019m curious how many people you personally know with Down syndrome, of any age. We have a Facebook page where thousands of families have children with Down syndrome of a variety of ages. I\u2019d encourage you to check it out sometime. I think you\u2019d be surprised to learn what people with Down syndrome are like. I assure you, they aren\u2019t ugly. Mr. Brady, you are a public figure. You have a choice to use that platform for good or bad. To build people up, or tear them down.\u00a0Unfortunately, on Sunday you chose to tear them down. I\u2019m one of the many people who are passionate about helping the world understand more about Down syndrome. To not see Down syndrome as a curse word, or to think that people like Trig, or my son Noah, are suffering. Instead, I hope to help people exchange inaccurate and hurtful stereotypes for accurate, respectful, and dignifying views. I (along with\u00a0thousands\u00a0of other parents across the world) work hard at this every day, and although we may be making one step forward, comments like yours take us two steps back. Comments like yours continue to dehumanize, degrade, and insult people born with Down syndrome. And it has to stop. Mr. Brady, shortly after the Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne\u00a0Barr, where you made the hurtful comments meant to degrad people with Down\u00a0syndrome, you broadcasted this message on your twitter feed: Your comments certainly did open people\u2019s eyes to a few things, Mr. Brady. It\u00a0opened\u00a0their\u00a0eyes to how insensitive people can be towards people with Down syndrome. It\u00a0opened\u00a0their\u00a0eyes to how easily an actor can transform from one role (sesame street) to another (The Comedy Central Roast.) And to be honest, I\u2019m not sure which role more\u00a0accurately\u00a0reflects your true opinions. I\u2019m also not sure what you were\u00a0referring\u00a0to in your tweet about how the Roast opened people\u2019s eyes, but if anything it helped to open my eyes to the fact that there is still a lot of work left to do in order to see that people like Trig, and my son, are treated with\u00a0dignity\u00a0and respect. I hope this letter helps open your eyes to how\u00a0insensitive\u00a0and hurtful your\u00a0comments\u00a0were. First and foremost, I think you owe an apology to the Palin family. I also think you owe an apology to the entire community of people born with Down syndrome and their families. Third, I would encourage you to get involved with a local Down syndrome\u00a0organization\u00a0in your community. In fact, the Down syndrome\u00a0 Buddy Walk \u00a0is coming up in\u00a0October, and I would encourage you to attend one. There, you will meet people with Down syndrome of all ages.\u00a0Perhaps\u00a0that will help you understand that people with Down syndrome aren\u2019t ugly, rather they are people just like you. People who deserve the same amount of respect and courtesy as you do. Mr. Brady, as my son gets older, the biggest fear I have for him is having to suffer through the ignorant and hurtful comments of others who do not value all people. People who value the laughs of their schoolyard friends above the feelings of others. People who are careless with their words at the expense of another. I worry about him coming home from school one day and asking me to explain something he overheard on the playground (where he was the punchline.) As I said, I could expect this from\u00a0children, but not from the man who reads stories to Elmo on\u00a0 Sesame Street . Mr. Brady, I want you to know that I, of all people, understand that sometimes we say things we don\u2019t mean. Sometimes we get caught in a\u00a0moment. Sometimes we say things without fully understanding the\u00a0consequences. I\u2019ve said lots of things in my life I wish I could take back. But once we say something it can never be taken back. However, we can say we\u2019re sorry. We messed up. We made a mistake. We were wrong. And thankfully grace can find us in our mistake and help us to\u00a0begin to\u00a0right the wrong we made. So I hope you know I\u2019m not trying to throw stones at you, I\u2019m simply trying to help you understand how your\u00a0 joke \u00a0crossed the line, and extend the same grace to you that is often extended to me. The grace to do the right thing. I hope moving forward, you\u2019ll use your platform to help people, not hurt them. I hope you\u2019ll\u00a0apologize\u00a0to the Palin family, and the thousands of people born with Down\u00a0syndrome. And most of all I hope you will take time to get\u00a0involved\u00a0and get to know some people with Down syndrome. I think you will find that they, like all people, are\u00a0beautiful. By the way, here is a picture of my son Noah. I love him with all of my heart. He\u2019s a person, not a punchline. Sincerely, Noah\u2019s Dad To those of you reading this post, what are your\u00a0thoughts\u00a0regarding Wayne Brady\u2019s comments? Do you think\u00a0Sesame Street\u00a0should\u00a0continue\u00a0to allow Mr. Brady to appear on their program until he\u00a0apologizes\u00a0for the remarks he made?

You\u2019re lying in your crib sleeping after a long and fun day. I just wanted to take a minute to let you know that you are such an incredible father\u2019s day gift. I love just hanging out with you. I love watching the way your contagious smile causes everyone in your path to do the same. I love listening to your giggles. I love watching you dance in the back seat of the car as I turn the music up. I love watching you explore. I love the way you reach your arms out to me as I approach you. I love the way your face lights every time your eyes catch a glimpse of me. I love the way you throw your toys over your play gate so I\u2019ll pick them up and throw them back over. I love the way you hold my finger as I read to you. I love the way you grab your mom and I\u2019s hands when we pray together. I love the way you push your little toy car back and forth with me. I love to listen to all of those fun laughs you make when you crawl up the stairs\u2026with me very close behind you. I love watching your walk around on your dino walker; laughing the entire time. I love the way you put your arm around me when I\u2019m carrying you. That little one arm hug is so cute, I love it. I love your hugs, your kisses, your little nose, your little feet, your stunning blue eyes, and your little teeth. I love every single thing about you. I love you being your daddy so much. It\u2019s hard to believe how much you\u2019ve grown, and all of the wonderful things you\u2019ve done since last father\u2019s day. I am so proud of you.

He cares about you, and created you with a purpose. I can\u2019t wait to see God\u2019s purpose for your life unfold. I\u2019m thankful I have a front row seat.

{"date": ",July,1,2011", "body": "[This post is a part of the \u201c New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome \u201d blog series. Be sure to check out the  other posts !] Four Medical Concerns For Babies Diagnosed With Down syndrome Down syndrome  is associated with many medical concerns. I will address what to be aware of in the first few days of life here. I know that this is  scary  but I reassure you that\u00a0doctors are able to treat your child for each of these conditions with very good outcomes. Sometimes you will watch and wait, other times your baby\u00a0may need surgery. \u00a0Medicine has come a long way and there is so much that can be done for your new baby if he or she requires any intervention. Heart Up to 50% of children  born with\u00a0Down syndrome  have problems with the structure of the heart. This means that there will be a hole between the chambers or abnormal connections. The most common conditions found are an  atrial septal defect  or ASD\u00a0(hole between upper two chambers), a  ventricular septal defect \u00a0or VSD (hole between bottom two chambers), or an  atrioventricular canal defect  (all the chambers are connected). Some of the abnormalities may require immediate surgery, but the majority will require watching and waiting. \u00a0Below is what a heart looks like so you can see where the different chambers are located. \u00a0Holes between chambers do not mean that blood is leaking out of the heart, but that they are sharing blood. Another very common medical\u00a0condition\u00a0in Down syndrome is a  patent ductus arteriosus . \u00a0This is not an abnormal connection or a hole. \u00a0When we are growing inside the womb we do not use our lungs to oxygenate blood, this all comes from our mother. \u00a0The  ductus arteriosus  is a normal connection that is used to get oxygenated blood to our body and bypass the lungs. As soon as our lungs work, which is when we take our first breath, that connection is no longer needed and it is able to close due to some pretty cool things that happen in our body. \u00a0All babies have to close this connection and it can occur instantly or over several days. Patent means open and so a  patent ductus arteriosus  is one that remains open. This will be monitored and if it does not close there is a procedure called a  catheterization  that can close this connection. \u00a0If your child has other structural changes and needs open heart surgery it can be taken care of during that procedure as well. Questions to ask your doctor regarding your child\u2019s heart: \u2022 How do you feel my baby is doing? \u2022 Does my baby have a murmur? \u2022 What are my baby\u2019s oxygen saturations? (You want 100% or as close to that as you can get. It can take several hours for a newborn to have saturations at a normal level as they transition to breathing air outside of the womb.) \u2022 When will my child be seen by a cardiologist? (All children with Down Syndrome need to be evaluated at some point in the first month or so) \u2022 When will my child have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart, just like how they looked at your baby when you were pregnant)? Gastrointestinal Tract (Gut) There are two concerns with your child gastrointestinal tract that can present themselves at birth for children with Down syndrome. 1. Duodenal atresia :\u00a0 The duodenum is the first part of the intestines after the stomach.\u00a0 Atresia means abscence or narrowing of an opening.\u00a0 Therefore  duedenal atresia  means that the duodenum is narrowed or completely closed off.\u00a0 This would not allow food to go through the intestines as expected.\u00a0\u00a0Your child will have vomiting within the first few hours of life, which will likely contain bile (green stuff). 2. Hirschprung\u2019s disease:  This prevents the child from being able to poop normally or at all\u00a0due to an abscence of nerves in the\u00a0rectum or\u00a0colon. It sounds funny that a lack of nerves would prevent you from being able to poop, but without those nerves the rectum or colon\u00a0is not able to relax\u00a0to let poop out.\u00a0\u00a0The suspicion for this will increase if the child does not poop in the first 24-48 hours. Things to tell your doctor concerning your child\u2019s GI tract: \u2022 When your child pooped for the first time \u2022 How your child is eating Hearing It is more common for children with Down syndrome to have difficulty hearing. Every child gets a hearing screen prior to leaving the hospital. If your child fails, they will be tested again prior to going home. If they fail a second time you will then see an audiologist for further testing as an outpatient.  Do not worry  if your child fails the first two tests, as that does not mean for certain that your child cannot hear. Despite passing you will continue to get hearing tests for our child though out their childhood. Questions to ask your doctor\u00a0concerning\u00a0your child\u2019s hearing: \u2022 Did my child pass their hearing screen? \u2022 When should we test their hearing again? Eyes Children with Down syndrome can also have eye concerns. The first one your doctor assesses for is cataracts. This is\u00a0easily\u00a0done by looking at your baby\u2019s eyes with an  ophthalmoscope . The doctor will be looking for a red reflex meaning that they are able to see the back of the eye without problems.  Other things that can be seen are abnormal eye movements. \u00a0One that our own son had is called  nystagmus . This is a rhythmic beating of the eye while looking one direction. When our son looked left or right his eyes would move back and forth rhythmically. If this is present at birth, it is not as concerning as nystagmus that develops several months to years later. \u00a0 Children with Down syndrome have weaker muscles even in their eyes which will cause nystagmus. Their eye muscles cannot hold the eye in a certain position for a long period of time so it will beat back and forth. Despite knowing the reason why, they should still see an eye doctor (ophthalmologist, not optometrist). \u00a0All children with Down syndrome should see an ophthalmologist within the first year of life.  Questions to ask your doctor concerning your child\u2019s eyes: \u2022 Did you see the red reflex? \u2022 Do you see nystagmus or weird eye movements? \u2022 When should we see the eye doctor? While there are other medical concerns that are unique to each child, these four will be the main concern of your\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0during the first few weeks of your precious child\u2019s life. The above are diagnosed based on physical exam and tests done by individuals. There are other medical diagnoses that are found based on  blood tests  which we address in a later post. \u00a0 Congratulations\u00a0on the birth of your new baby.\u00a0I know this\u00a0information\u00a0can seem overwhelming at first, please don\u2019t let it be. As a new parent your first\u00a0priority\u00a0is to spend time enjoying being a parent.

In fact, I think I\u2019ve learned more in the past 19 months as\u00a0 Noah\u2019s Dad \u00a0than all of my\u00a0 formal \u00a0education combined. Like today for instance, I\u00a0was reminded that most great things in our life don\u2019t come\u00a0instantly. They don\u2019t just happen. Often they require\u00a0a series of small, and sometimes\u00a0unnoticeable, steps. Somedays it will feel like you aren\u2019t making any progress at all. Somedays you\u2019ll fall down. (And you won\u2019t want to get up.) Somedays you\u2019ll wonder if all of the steps are worth it.\u00a0Somedays\u00a0you won\u2019t want to take any steps at all. But then there are other days. Days when you amaze yourself at the number of steps you were able to take. Days when you remember that all of the small steps really\u00a0 are \u00a0worth it. That you can get back up. (Even if you don\u2019t feel like it.)\u00a0Days when you\u00a0realize\u00a0that those small\u00a0steps are often even more important than the goal itself. In fact there are days when you actually come to love, enjoy, and celebrate the small steps.

{"date": ",July,2,2011", "body": "Noah and his  mommy  decided to have a little  fun  at the mall today with a few  friends ! My wife has been working super hero type hours as she finishes up her\u00a0residency\u00a0at  Children\u2019s Medical Center  here in Dallas, so hanging out at the mall isn\u2019t something she gets to do very often. In fact, she went into work at six p.m. the same night this video was taken! See, I told you she\u2019s a super hero. It\u2019s hard to believe she has less than a month until\u00a0she\u2019s\u00a0officially\u00a0 finished  with\u00a0residency! We are so proud of her. I can\u2019t\u00a0imagine\u00a0there being a better  mommy , wife, or doctor. By the way, if anyone\u00a0reading\u00a0this is\u00a0considering\u00a0becoming a Doctor, it\u2019s a lot of  really hard work . \u00a0You\u2019ve been warned. It\u2019s Time For An Upgrade!

We started\u00a0this site about a month ago, and within the first two weeks it was clear that people were\u00a0interested\u00a0in watching the daily one minute videos\u00a0we post of our son. \u00a0A lot of people. The hosting company that hosts this site contacted me and suggested we move the site from a shared hosting\u00a0environment\u00a0to a\u00a0virtual\u00a0private server (VPS) at no extra charge. (Thanks!) \u00a0Without getting to\u00a0technical, a VPS is meant to handle much more traffic then a shared hosting plan. Well\u2026after two weeks of being on a VPS it was clear I needed an even more advanced hosting solution (which they tried to provide, but couldn\u2019t.) Thankfully, the president of  Milk Engine , (who just so happens to be one of my best  friends !)\u00a0graciously\u00a0offered to migrate and host  NoahsDad.com  on one of his\u00a0private\u00a0servers \u2014  for free!  (Which was why the site was down for a few hours early this morning as the migration was preformed. \u00a0The site is now ready for any amount of traffic thrown at it, and you should experience  very  quick loading times throughout the site!) Wow\u2026! \u00a0If you know anything about web hosting and the interwebs\u2026..then you know how much of a blessing this is! \u00a0Thanks, John! It\u2019s Amazing What Can Happen In Just 30 Days! A month ago when I posted the first  video \u00a0on this  Noah\u2019s Dad , I would have never have\u00a0imagined\u00a0the\u00a0response being what it has been. I knew that there were  parents  and soon-to-be parents out there searching the web for \u201cDown Syndrome videos\u201d and hoping to find videos online that would bring them hope and\u00a0encouragement. And maybe even a  laugh  or  two ! However, it isn\u2019t easy\u00a0finding\u00a0videos like that online (take my word for it!) The great news is, based on the notes we\u2019ve been\u00a0receiving, it\u2019s clear this site is doing just that. \u00a0So it\u2019s a win-win. By the way, our goal is not to get \u201cbig\u201d for \u201cbig-ness\u201d sake. Our goal, rather we have 1 visitor, or 1 million visitors, is the same: To\u00a0glorify\u00a0God by giving the world an inside look into a family raising a child born with  down syndrome . And in turn, praying that lives (rather in the womb or out) could be seen as God\u00a0intended\u00a0for them to be seen. A full, 100%, complete, person made in the very image of God, created for His glory. We hope this site\u00a0continues\u00a0to do that.

One of those days that makes a parent feel like a ton of bricks are on their back. Today we went into Noah\u2019s  pediatrician  for his 18 month check up and after talking to her about some of Noah\u2019s recent symptoms decided that we needed to take him to Children\u2019s Medical Center to have a  CBC \u00a0(complete blood count.) Children that are born with  Down syndrome  (like our son) are at a higher risk to develop\u00a0leukemia than  typical  kids. This usually just means having a complete blood count (CBC) preformed on a regular basis to make sure his white blood cells, and\u00a0platelet count is all good. Normally a pediatrician wouldn\u2019t run a CBC at the 18 month visit, but Noah had some symptoms which caused some concern. He\u2019s had a few fevers\u00a0lately\u00a0that seem to have\u00a0occurred\u00a0for no reason. He\u2019s had a few bloody noses that have also seemed to occur for no reason. And the most concerning symptom,  petechia . After waiting for what seemed like forever, it turns out Noah is fine, and cancer free. I could go on and on about how scared we were today, how my wife and I both cried, and how  fearful  we were, but to be honest I\u2019m physically and mentally\u00a0exhausted\u00a0after today. However, I will say that this day is a runner up to the\u00a0 scariest\u00a0week of my life . I wanted to share just a few things I learned today, in no\u00a0particular\u00a0order. I\u00a0apologize\u00a0in advance if this list seems like sort of a ramble. Today was just so\u00a0emotional\u00a0and raw that I just wanted to have a record of what I learned. I certainly don\u2019t want to forget anything. I\u2019m also not going to to go into detail about any of these, so if you\u2019d like me to explain any of them, leave a comment and I\u2019ll be happy to (although I think most will be self\u00a0explanatory.) \n Being a parent is scary.\u00a0 \n Cancer is scary. \n Holding your child down as they are screaming and wondering why some lady is sticking\u00a0needles\u00a0in their arm is heart breaking to me. \n God holds the whole world in His hands. \n There are things in life that as a parent you have no\u00a0control\u00a0over. \n Sometimes as a parent you simply can\u2019t kiss it and make it all better. \n You\u00a0truly, really, without a\u00a0doubt never know how long you (or your child) as on this Earth. \n Enjoy every second you can with your family. \n Hug a lot. \n Play a lot. \n Laugh a lot. \n It\u2019s ok to cry. Yes, even for guys. \n Even\u00a0pediatricians\u00a0worry about their children. \n Thinking\u00a0your child could die as a result of a \u201cdisease\u201d is sheer terror. \n Thinking something is seriously wrong with your child puts everything else going on in your life on pause. It\u2019s as if nothing else in the world is happening. \n Our mind is capable of coming up with all sorts of scenarios\u00a0that probably won\u2019t ever happen. \n Learning to control our mind (and our\u00a0imagination) is hard. \n You either believe that God is FULLY in control of everything on\u00a0this\u00a0planet, or you don\u2019t. What you can\u2019t do is believe He is only partly in control. It\u2019s all or nothing. Not both.\u00a0 \n You have to believe that God loves your children even more than you do. \n You have to FULLY trust God. Both in your life, and in the life of your children. \n Number 20 is hard to do sometimes. \n The tears a parent cry for their children are some of the most hurtful tears a person can cry. \n Seeing your child play and be happy and not\u00a0realizing\u00a0that something could be\u00a0horribly\u00a0wrong with them is heartbreaking. \n I love being a dad, and a husband. A lot. (I already knew this, but was reminded again today.) \n Prayer is powerful. \n God cares. \n God doesn\u2019t\u00a0abandon\u00a0us. \n God gives peace and joy even when there doesn\u2019t seem to be any in sight. \n I hate, yes hate, cancer. \n Waiting on test results is one of the worst feelings in the world. \n Getting a call from a doctor that things aren\u2019t what you thought (in a good way) makes you very happy. \n Sometimes you  cry \u00a0weep when your happy. (Those tears are wonderful.)\u00a0 \n Being a parent is\u00a0scary.\u00a0 \n God is bigger than our fear. \n Ok, sorry for the ramble, but I wanted to get that stuff off my heart. I am so thankful that things turned out ok today. I want to add that there was a good\u00a0possibility\u00a0today that things didn\u2019t turn out so good. That our son actually ended up having\u00a0leukemia. My wife and I had more than a few conversations today as we waited on the blood tests about this, just to prepare our hearts and minds. And we both said (multiple times) if that was the case, we\u2019d trust God just as we have every since Noah was  born . God hadn\u2019t let us down yet, and He isn\u2019t going to let us down. He is God, we aren\u2019t. Humans don\u2019t make very good Gods. God would have been just as faithful, and just as good no matter what the results of those blood tests were. And so we prayed (a lot) and we said \u201cGod we really want this test to come back negative, but more than that, we want you to prepare our heart for whatever\u00a0happens.\u201d \u00a0And I know it\u2019s easy to say this now, but if Noah\u2019s test\u00a0results\u00a0would have come back\u00a0positive\u00a0for leukemia we would have a) wept like no other, b) grabbed our little boy and hugged him, c) Asked God to heal our little boy of cancer, d) praised God for being\u00a0sovereign\u00a0and in control, and e) asked God to help us bring glory to Him in this. Somehow, someway. (All of this would have been done through a lot of tears.) If you are out there, and your child is battling something serious we want you to know that God is in control. He cares. He loves you and your family. And He really can bring you joy and peace. No matter what the \u201ctest results\u201d come back to be. Now it\u2019s time for me to head to bed with a\u00a0grateful\u00a0and joyful heart. We made it through another day. It may not be this way forever, but for today,  I\u2019m thankful my son was born with just Down syndrome . Thank you to everyone you prayed for our son and our family today. We\u00a0appreciate\u00a0it more than you\u2019ll ever know.

It was just a little more then a month ago when my friend  John , and I were  jokingly  discussing a site where I posted a\u00a0daily one minute video of our (as in my wife and I\u2019s!) son, (who just so happens\u00a0to have been born with  Down Syndrome .) \u00a0Well, that conversation\u00a0turned into reality. Wow Noah\u2019s Dad, You Sure Post A Lot Of Videos. \u00a0Why? When Noah was  born  my  wife  and I knew very little about what life was like raising a child with  Down Syndrome . \u00a0We were scared. \u00a0 Surprised . Confused. \u00a0Anxious. Happy. Sad. Nervous. \u00a0Excited. \u00a0And about a million other\u00a0indescribable emotions. We wanted to know what our son was going to be like\u2026what our  life  was going to be like. \u00a0I guess we sort of wanted a window into the future. We quickly  met  (Facebook stalked!)\u00a0some new\u00a0 friend\u2019s  whose son had also born with  Down\u00a0Syndrome . \u00a0(To be honest, it took us about a month after Noah was born before we really\u00a0felt \u00a0like talking to other parents who had children born with  Down Syndrome .) However\u2026our new  friends  had no idea how much we were being\u00a0encouraged\u00a0by them (and their Facebook wall.) \u00a0We found several videos that they had posted of their son Seth. We watched them. \u00a0And watched them. \u00a0And watched them\u2026.and watched them\u2026..They didn\u2019t post a video everyday. \u00a0In fact not even every week\u2026but when they did\u2026we consumed it. \u00a0It was our little window into the future. \u00a0Those videos gave us hope. \u00a0They helped ease our fears. \u00a0They helped us understand that  Down Syndrome  was ok. \u00a0They helped us realize that there was nothing to be afraid of. But \u00a0I wanted to find more videos. \u00a0I wanted to see other families. \u00a0Other children. \u00a0So I searched YouTube for \u00a0\u201cDown Syndrome Videos\u201d (don\u2019t do that by the way) and came up all kinds of results, mostly people making fun of Down Syndrome. \u00a0I was hurt. \u00a0But I also know we live in a world that is broken, and so people do things like that. \u00a0No surprise. \u00a0But it wasn\u2019t helpful. Our Life Has Never Been Better. \u00a0Seriously! It\u2019s now  six months  later, and life is ok\u2026in fact it\u2019s  great ! I can honestly say our life has  never been better .

My prayer is that God would use this site, these videos, and our family to\u00a0encourage\u00a0other people who may be where we were six months ago when Noah was  born .. \u00a0It\u2019s only been a month, and the response to this site has been overwhelming to me. \u00a0I\u2019ve gotten so many messages from new, expecting, and\u00a0seasoned\u00a0moms who have found joy, hope, and comfort through the story we are telling through this site\u2026.and that brings more\u00a0encouragement\u00a0to us then you know.

{"date": ",June,20,2012", "body": "Noah\u2019s 11 months old in today\u2019s video and we decided to try and let Noah self feed today. As you can see he really enjoyed it (as we did his mommy and daddy.) I thought I\u2019d share a little bit about our experience with allowing Noah to self feed for the first time for any of you getting ready to try this with your child. It\u2019s messy I am not going to lie, my biggest fear with starting self-feeding with Noah was the MESS. I have seen this kid  eat off a spoon  and it isn\u2019t pretty, so I could only imagine what he will do when he is in control. So the first step in deciding to let your child self-feed is getting a  really good mop  and lots of paper towels. It also helps to let them eat in only their diaper\u2026your washer and dryer will thank you later. I have all but abandoned bibs as they only keep one section of him clean and Noah is able to target every area outside of that with excellent precision. When to start I quickly realized that I had no idea what I was doing or where to start. It is best to try self-feeding when a child is able to support themselves while  sitting . Since this is sometimes delayed in children with  Down syndrome  I don\u2019t think they need to be sitting on their own so much as being able to sit well when supported in a  feeding chair  or high chair. They also should be able to reach out and grab things and have fairly good aim at their mouth. When they start doing this with  toys , they should be more than willing to do this with food. They should also be making some chewing movements with their mouth, they don\u2019t need teeth, but they do need to know what to do with a more solid food.  Teeth  will determine the consistency of the foods you will try. If your little one does not have teeth yet you\u2019ll want to stick to easily mashed items. It\u2019ll also be easier if they are  interested  in what is on your plate while you are eating. Noah started grabbing our drinks and food which made me realize that maybe I needed to give him his own plate. When we were introducing solid foods with Noah our  pediatrician  recommended to start with  puffs , a classic. They dissolve almost instantly in the mouth and are easy to handle. I think our OT was a bit shocked when we told her with excitement that Noah was advancing his diet. I couldn\u2019t quite figure out why until we tried the puffs. These things are not quite as easy to pick up as they look. As hard as Noah tried, he could not get them to his mouth himself. We gave up on self-feeding for a little while after that as I assumed that he was not ready. Type of grasp determines food choices I finally had an epiphany one day when I was at  my best friend\u2019s  house. \u00a0She knows all the cool stuff people are trying and had a book lying around called  The Baby-Led Weaning Cookbook: 130 Recipes That Will Help Your Baby Learn to Eat Solid Foods \u2013 and That the Whole Family Will Enjoy, by Gill Rapley and Tracey Murkett. (Long title, huh?) \u00a0I was skimming through it and with their help it finally clicked what I was missing.  I needed to match Noah\u2019s grasp development with his foods. Puffs are for those who have a great  raking ability  and more importantly a  pincher grasp  which typically develops around 9 months when children usually start eating more solid foods. The average age of a child with Down syndrome having a pincher grasp is 20 months. The reason I wrote the post on  grasps  is because I had just figured this stuff out and knew I would be referencing it now as I talk about feeding. Noah is still at a  radial palmar grasp  which makes puffs pretty hard to pick up. \u00a0I had set him up for failure because I didn\u2019t figure out his grasp prior to giving him foods. Foods to start with The book mentioned above has a great table matching grasp type with food choices. They recommend starting with large stick-shaped pieces of food. I started with  bananas . They recommended making it look like an ice cream cone with the peel still on with the banana exposed at the top. Noah grabbed onto that, brought it right to his mouth and started gnawing on it. See\u2026if I just put the right thing in his hand. Some other options are veggie straws which are basically tube-shaped puffs, larger pasta with a shape that is easy to grasp like rotini, or cutting long narrow pieces of bread. Using long pieces allows the child to hold an object with an edible section exposed that can easily be put in the mouth. Compare this to the puff which gets hidden in the hand and has to actually be released into the mouth. The teething crackers, such as the ones we are using in the video, are also great as they dissolve easily and stick out of the hand since they are fairly large. Next you can advance to foods that your child can pick up in clumps. Think rice, mashed potatoes, apple sauce, mac and cheese (do see why you need a good mop) and one of Noah\u2019s favorites eggs. These are offered when your child is doing a raking grasp. Puffs can be offered at this time as well. \u00a0When we started with these Noah was still eating the parts that were on top of his hand and not so much releasing it into his mouth. \u00a0I however believe that this helped him realize that if he opened his hand there was more goodness inside You can get smaller and smaller as the grasp develops to where some day instead of your child picking up a clump of rice, he is picking up the individual grains. Likely will not get all of their nutrition at the beginning I did not rely on Noah to get all of his intake from self-feeding alone. \u00a0I would give him some things to play with as give him meals by spoon feeding in combination with milk. \u00a0As he starts getting better I will stop giving him things off a spoon as much. You need to have a balance, and it may take a while before your child is able to eat enough on their own. \u00a0This is ok. \u00a0The whole point at the beginning to to be exploring not necessarily providing nutrition. The Gag Reflex Your child will gag. They are supposed to gag. You want them to gag. It will scare you. You may have your hand on the phone for 911 before you realize that your child is ok.  Gagging is not the same thing as choking . Choking cuts off the air supply where as gagging gets a chunk of food out of the back of the throat so that it can get worked on some more. With choking you will not hear many sounds from your child and they will likely be changing colors, now is the time you want to shout \u201cAnnie, Annie are you ok?\u201d, get your child out of their chair, put them over your knee and give them 5 back slaps to help get that item out as well as call 911. However if they are trying to gag an item of food up, give them a few seconds and it will get there. Starting with mushy or slippery things helps the child swallow without problems. I have seen Noah swallow whole noodles before without difficulty. Chicken on the other hand causes us a lot of problems with gagging as he tends to not chew it enough. (NOTE: If you ever have any concern that your child is\u00a0choking, or not able to breathe, you need to call 911\u00a0immediately.\u00a0Additionally\u00a0if you have questions or concerns about this please be sure to talk with your\u00a0pediatrician, as this post is not and should not be taken as medical advice.) Patience I thought that letting Noah self feed would speed up the feeding process\u2026I was very wrong. It has slowed it down, but that\u2019s ok. Noah eats his meals with us as usual, and I try to give him whatever we are eating plus or minus a few things. He likes to shovel the food in so we have to place it in front of him slowly. It is great to share eating times together and has finally brought my husband and I to the dinning room table rather than eating in front of the tv. Offer variety I know that several children with Down syndrome have problems with textures in their mouth. Your OT or ST should be helping with these issues. I encourage you to offer as many different textures as you can. Also try all sorts of different fruits and vegetables so that your child gets used to eating them. It can take something like  7 exposures to a food  before a child will accept it as something they will eat. I find parents often just give the child what they know they will eat rather than branching out and trying new things. \\ It\u2019s very easy to get into a routine. Obesity is a big risk for our kids, and getting them to eat fruits and vegetables now will only help them in the long run. \u00a0I noticed our friends over at  The Fun House  always offered their children fruits and vegetables at each meal, and their children devoured them. \u00a0They definitely inspired me to be well aware of what I am putting in my child\u2019s mouth. \u00a0Do we venture out to pei wei and pizza\u2026sure. \u00a0But they are being eaten with a fruit or veggie on the side. \ud83d\ude42 What foods did you try with your child first? \u00a0What were you afraid of most? \u00a0What challenges have you faced with feeding?

{"date": ",June,14,2012", "body": "While it\u2019s true that every Thanksgiving brings with it much to be thankful for, this year\u2019s Thanksgiving (our son\u2019s first) was perhaps our families most thankful Thanksgiving yet. (Whew\u2026.try trying that 7 times real fast!) This year our family has something to be thankful for that less than a year ago we would have never imagined it even being a part of our life, much less saying we were  thankful  for it.  But we are. This thanksgiving we\u2019re thankful to have a son with Down syndrome. Our son almost came with an extra, extra bonus\u2026. A few days after our son surprised us by being  born with Down syndrome  we were called to our  pediatrician\u2019s  office to  discuss  something that came back on his  newborn screen . This  something  ended up being the possibility that our son could have  Glutaric Acidemia, type 1  (GA-1), in addition to Down syndrome. Now if you\u2019ve never heard of  GA-1 , you\u2019re not alone. Neither had I until this doctor visit, but I\u2019ll give you the long and short of it:  It could kill you . We were told that it was likely a false positive, not to worry (yah, right.), and to go home and enjoy Christmas with our new baby (after taking him to the lab to have some blood drawn.) I\u2019ll never forget walking in the front door of our apartment after that doctor visit. I was still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that our son was unexpectedly born with  Down syndrome  just a few days earlier. I was still trying to sort through what that meant for him and for our family. I was still hurt, confused, heavy hearted, and  worried  about our little baby boy. I mean come on, he was only a few days old, and it takes time for a new parent to sort through all of the emotions of a  Down syndrome diagnosis . Now not only does my son have  Down syndrome , but he may also have a  very rare metabolic disorder  that could  kill him . Wow! Talk about kicking a guy when he\u2019s down. I\u201dm getting teary eyed just reflecting on that day as I draft this post. You can read more about what I call  the scariest week of my life  if you\u2019d like, but after about a month and a half of testing, which included taking our few weeks old son to a  geneticist  to have his DNS sequenced, he ended up  not having  Glutaric Acidemia. Thank God! The 6 weeks that changed my life\u2026forever. \u00a0 Waiting on the test results to come back (about 6 weeks) really changed my life in more ways than anyone will ever know. When Noah was born I had to think about how our life was going to change as a result of his being born with Down syndrome When I found out Noah may have GA-1 I had to think about how our life was going to change if Noah had Down syndrome and Glutaric Acidemia, including the possibility of loosing our son. That was a whole different animal. Down syndrome I was ok with, GA-1 (and the reality that our son could die) I was not. I had to have a lot of heart to heart conversations with God during those 6 weeks. I remember pleading with God that our son would  just  have Down syndrome. When all the dusted settled (and before we received the results) I came to grips with the fact that our children are not are own. They are God\u2019s. They belong to them. We are their parents, their stewards. One day they will leave us. They get married, they move out, they get a roommate and at some point our children die. Sometimes they die after us, and sometimes, sadly, they die before us. I say that not to be morbid, but just to remind you (and me) that our children aren\u2019t forever. We never know what any day may hold. Our children (and us) are only one Doctor\u2019s appointment away from having their lives changed forever. Yes, that\u2019s scary, but you have a choice\u2026 You can either allow fear to paralyze you and keep you from enjoying the joy of today, or you can move forward choosing to trust that God truly does  have the whole world in His hands , including you and your family. It doesn\u2019t mean that what your facing isn\u2019t scary. But it does means coming to a very real place in your life where you  truly  trust that God is bigger than your fear, and  He is able  to see you through it. Your fear doesn\u2019t control you. When fear comes knocking at your family\u2019s door you tell it to go somewhere else, because fear doesn\u2019t win in your house, God does. All of that to say that on the other side of that 6 week waiting period, I came out a different person. God used those 6 weeks to help me deal with my fear and anxiety issues. (Yes, my name\u2019s Rick Smith and I\u2019m worrier!) \ud83d\ude42 He wanted to show me that He is able to give us joy even in one of the scariest moments of our life. Up until that point in my life I had only heard stories about God giving people this kind of joy, but now I know first hand those stories are true. God really can meet our needs when nothing else on this planet can. How amazing is that! So on this thanksgiving (our son\u2019s first) I am extremely thankful that I\u2019m not faced with the reality of raising a child born with Down syndrome and GA-1. Don\u2019t get me wrong, our God is a big God. If Noah would have had GA-1, He would have certainly enabled us to get through it. However I\u2019m speaking honest and from my heart when I say I am thankful that we don\u2019t have to go down that road. To the parents of a child facing a posable Glutaric Acidemia diagnosis\u2026 If you ended up on this page somehow because your child is facing the possibility of a GA-1 diagnosis I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve only added to your fear. But I want you to know that I\u2019m speaking to you from the heart, and yes as a parent that is scary, very scary. Your child really can die as a result of it. That\u2019s perhaps one of the scariest things I can think of. Now let me try to give you some encouragement. \u00a0 First, there are  a lot of false positives  on the newborn screen. and it\u2019s very likely that will be the case with your child. If that\u2019s not the case, GA-1 is like most everything medically related in that there is a  wide range  of how it affects a person. Your medical team will help you develop a plan for your child that helps keep them from having a metabolic crisis. Furthermore, as stressful as newborn screens (and false positives) can be, it\u2019s all worth it if it helps just one child catch a genetic condition as early as possible. As with almost everything medically related, the earlier a person is diagnosed with a condition, the better. I tell you all of this in an attempt to encourage you. I\u2019m sure you are very scared, but know that we live in a time like no other time in history, and our medical community has become very good at helping children with all sorts of conditions (including GA-1) live long and healthy lives. Noah\u2019s first Thanksgiving As I\u2019ve mentioned we have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. I can honestly say that I\u2019m thankful to be the parent of a child with Down syndrome. This child has changed our family\u2019s life in more ways than I could even begin count. I\u2019m thankful that my son is healthy. That he is growing, learning, and developing. I\u2019m thankful for how joyous and fun this little boy is. It\u2019s awesome being his daddy. \u00a0 Will there be bumps in the road? Sure. Will there be lots of scary times in our future? Sure, what child doesn\u2019t scare his parents from time to time? But for today, for this first Thanksgiving with our new little baby boy, things are ok. The rush of emotions we dealt with the few months of Noah\u2019s birth has subsided. I don\u2019t freak out as much every time we have to take Noah to see his pediatrician (although waiting for the results every time Noah gets a  CBC  still causes my heart to beat faster than normal.) I don\u2019t get (as) worried every time Noah gets a little cough. \u00a0 Other than Noah having a little virus (as you can see in some of the pictures) today is a great day of enjoying life, eating lots of yummy food (thanks Abbie!) and enjoying time with family\u2026and being very, very thankful that my son  just  has Down syndrome! I know it\u2019s not Thanksgiving right now, but it\u2019s always good to reflect on things you\u2019re thankful for. So please take a second to leave a comment below and let me know one or two things that your especially thankful for  right now .

{"date": ",June,15,2012", "body": "We have been practicing Noah\u2019s walking for awhile now despite him not even being 1 year old yet. We are far from him being able to walk on his own (although he\u2019s\u00a0 inch-worming \u00a0quite\u00a0nicely!), however he\u2019s figuring out the concept quite well. We started on the  treadmill  back in August, and we do it twice a week at his  physical therapy  sessions. We spend a grueling  8 minutes  on the treadmill. \u00a0Noah is like his mom on a treadmill and he gets a bit bored. \u00a0So today we tried something new. Trying the gait trainer for the first time \u00a0 Noah is easily distracted and it is quite a battle some days to get him to  focus  on the job at hand, specifically on the treadmill. Our therapist decided to try something different today and put Noah in a  gait trainer . A gait trainer is a fancy contraption that is basically a walker with support to allow a child (or anyone having difficulty) learn to walk. I don\u2019t know if I can describe a piece of metal as agile, but this thing moves any direction with just a little bit of effort, it is like the  Porsche of walkers . I was quite impressed with how well he did, and I think he was quite surprised to see his world from this point of view. \u00a0 This was the first time for us to see Noah walk off the treadmill. Noah doesn\u2019t put his feet down to stand when we hold him up; however, with this device it gives him support underneath so that he can do that. A toy walker would not work for him right now as he does not have the strength to push up on his legs, but we are getting closer with each day. Continued treadmill training \u00a0 The point of treadmill training is to help develop and maintain the stepping reflex, or basically get the legs used to making these movements until eventually they are strong enough to do them on their own.  As we have mentioned , the man behind the idea, Dr. Ulrich, sees children with  Down syndrome  walk sooner and with that explore their world and continue their development. \u00a0He provided us with the\u00a0 protocol \u00a0for free, which was pretty awesome on his part. (He also gave us\u00a0permission to  post it  so that all of you can download, and print out as well!) We don\u2019t follow it exactly, but if you have access to a treadmill 5 days a week I would definitely give it a whirl. \u00a0If using a regular treadmill, you just need a good bench and some strong biceps and you are good to go. We have a lot of catching up to do\u2026. For those of you who follow us on  facebook , you may realize that Noah looks a bit older there than is this video. We are\u00a0dedicated\u00a0to sharing the story of his life via one minute videos in\u00a0chronological\u00a0order. We are trying to catch up with all of our videos as we keep getting distracted by life. This video is from back in December. I wish I could show you the video from this week of Noah running laps in therapy with this thing, but thus you will have to wait and keep coming back for more. \ud83d\ude42 Has your child used a gait trainer? \u00a0If so, did you get one for your house and how long did your child use it?

{"date": ",September,16,2012", "body": "Noah\u2019s mouth is a\u00a0dangerous\u00a0place to be these days! He\u2019s\u00a0seriously\u00a0like a little\u00a0alligator. He\u2019s only 14 months old and already has a mouth full of teeth\u2026and today it was time to get those little \u00a0chompers checked out! Technically \u00a0he should have his first trip to the dentist a few months ago (when his fist tooth came in) but between moving into our\u00a0 new house , and some\u00a0 traveling , we\u2019re just now getting to it.\u00a0To be honest it was actually a good thing that we didn\u2019t take him to the dentist before now, because it turns out our new next door neighbor is a\u00a0 pediatric dentist \u00a0(and her husband\u00a0happens\u00a0goes to the same\u00a0 graduate school \u00a0as I do,\u00a0random, huh?) We honestly had no idea when we\u00a0 were \u00a0supposed to take Noah to the dentist to the first time, so one day we asked her about it, and she offered to come over and give Noah his\u00a0 first official dental exam \u2026in the middle of our living room! (For free!) Pretty cool, huh? Noah\u2019s First Dental Exam \u201cUmmm, what are those gloves for..?\u201d Our awesome neighbor came over with all of her tools (and gloves) today, checked out Noah\u2019s mouth, and even applied a fluoride varnish right here in our living room! It was quick and easy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6well, sort of easy. As you can see in the video he did ok with the exam part of the visit, including the brushing, but he wasn\u2019t a huge fan of having that fluoride varnish put on. Noah doesn\u2019t really like anything (or anyone) coming near his mouth unless it\u2019s food\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.or \u00a0drink\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6or toys. So I was surprised how great he did, he didn\u2019t even bite down on her fingers!\u00a0 6 Dental Tips For New Parents Since Noah is our\u00a0 first child , we\u00a0really\u00a0didn\u2019t know a lot about the dental side of things. I thought my wife would know considering she\u2019s a\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0(but it turns out they don\u2019t cover\u00a0dentistry\u00a0in medical school.) Thankfully our\u00a0neighbor\u00a0is not only a kid dentist, but she also\u00a0teaches\u00a0at the dental school so we we were able to pick her brain on a few things while she was here. A lot of this may may be common\u00a0knowledge\u00a0to most of you, but it was new to me. So I thought I\u2019d share some of the things we talked to her about just in case any of you may be wondering some of the same things. 1. Do I need to take my child with Down syndrome to a special\u00a0dentist? Nope. You don\u2019t have to find a dentist that\u00a0 specializes \u00a0with children with Down\u00a0syndrome or anything like that. However, I do suggest taking your child to a\u00a0 pediatric\u00a0dentist , as opposed to a\u00a0 general\u00a0dentist .\u00a0According\u00a0to the\u00a0 American\u00a0Academy\u00a0of\u00a0Pediatric\u00a0Dentistry : \u201cPediatric dentists are the pediatricians of dentistry. A pediatric dentist has two to three years specialty training following dental school and limits his/her practice to treating children only. Pediatric dentists are primary and specialty oral care providers for infants and children through adolescence, including those with special health needs.\u201d By the way, if you\u2019re looking for a pediatric dentist in your area the AAPD has a\u00a0 great tool \u00a0on their website to help you do just that. 2. When I should I take my child to the dentist to the first time? \u201cOh\u2026that\u2019s what the gloves are far. Piece of cake.\u201d You want to make an\u00a0appointment\u00a0to see a\u00a0pediatric\u00a0dentist for their first check up as soon as their\u00a0 fist tooth \u00a0comes in, or no later than their\u00a0 first birthday . Remember, often times life prevents us following guidelines like these perfectly. So if you\u2019re like us, and didn\u2019t get your child into the dentist by their first birthday, or when their first tooth came in,\u00a0 don\u2019t feel guilty . Heck, We didn\u2019t even know we were\u00a0 supposed \u00a0to do that. Needless to say we didn\u2019t follow these guidelines\u2026and Noah\u2019s teeth are doing just fine.)\u00a0 3. When type of tooth brush should I use to brush my child\u2019s teeth? According the the AAPD you want to use: \u201cAny soft-bristled toothbrush with a small head, preferably one designed specifically for infants, should be used at least once a day at bedtime.\u201d 4. When can I start using tooth paste on my child? My wife\u00a0said it was common for\u00a0pediatricians\u00a0to tell parents\u00a0 not to use \u00a0fluoride\u00a0based\u00a0toothpaste\u00a0on children before they could rinse and spit on their own. However, we were surprised\u00a0to learn from our\u00a0pediatric\u00a0dentist that this isn\u2019t the case. (See, Doctors don\u2019t know\u00a0 everything .)\u00a0 \u00a0In fact the AAPD says t he sooner a parent starts using\u00a0fluoride\u00a0toothpaste on their child, the better ! Here\u2019s what else the AAPD had to say: \u201cStarting at birth, clean your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gums with a soft infant toothbrush or cloth and water. As soon as the teeth begin to appear, start brushing twice daily using fluoridated toothpaste and a soft, age-appropriate sized toothbrush. Use a \u201csmear\u201d of toothpaste to brush the teeth of a child less than 2 years of age. For the 2-5 year old, dispense a \u201cpea-size\u201d amount of toothpaste and perform or assist your child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toothbrushing. Remember that young children do not have the ability to brush their teeth effectively.Children should spit out and not swallow excess toothpaste after brushing.\u201d 5. Is grinding your teeth normal? Noah is a teeth grinder. In fact, sometimes it\u2019s so loud it sends shivers up my spin. We asked our dentist about this and were told that it\u2019s actually\u00a0 normal \u00a0for children to grind their teeth at this age. According to\u00a0 Rhea Haugseth ,\u00a0President\u00a0Elect of the AAPD: \u201cChildren exhibit teeth grinding very commonly. We see it in children younger than 7-8 years old often. A lot of children will stop grinding once their six-year permanent molars erupt. Their permanent teeth bite begins to establish itself once those molars erupt. \n Prior to this, children\u2019s bites are very flexible and subject to changes as they grow. Occasionally, children will exhibit an abnormal bite causing them to grind because of the placement of their teeth.\u201d Of course every child is\u00a0unique, and you\u2019ll want to talk to your child\u2019s\u00a0pediatric\u00a0dentist\u00a0about any unique concerns you may have about your child\u2019s grinding. However chances are if your toddler is grinding his teeth, you have nothing to worry about. 6. Is it ok for my child to drink juice? One of the questions Noah\u2019s dentist asked us was what sort of things did we allow Noah to drink.\u00a0If you\u2019ve taken your child to dentist than you\u00a0probably\u00a0know how she answered this\u00a0question; In two letters: No .\u00a0 Juice contains a lot of sugar and can be very bad for children\u2019s teeth.\u00a0Even though my wife and I are very aware of the\u00a0 ill-effects of to much fruit juice \u00a0we still let Noah sip on an\u00a0occasional\u00a0juice\u00a0box, but not often. I\u2019m sure there are some\u00a0 perfect \u00a0parents our there who never give\u00a0their\u00a0children an ounce of sugar, but\u00a0we aren\u2019t one of them. However it doesn\u2019t drink it all the time. Noah drinks a ton of soy milk (due to a milk\u00a0protean\u00a0allergy) and so that and water are his two main drinks, but we like to switch it up every once in a while and fill his\u00a0 straw cup \u00a0up with some tasty juice.\u00a0 On a quick side note, if you\u2019re one of those parents whose kids I\u2019ve seen walking around the grocery\u00a0store\u00a0with a bottle full of soda, that\u2019s not cool. For one, I think we can all agree soda is not healthy for anyone, kids or adults (although I sure do enjoy an ice cold\u00a0 Dr. Pepper .) Second, a toddler certainly shouldn\u2019t be drinking soda. And third, if your child can walk, chances are he shouldn\u2019t be drinking out of a bottle any more. Just saying.\u00a0 We want to hear from you! I hope you found this information useful. I\u2019m always learning, so feel free to share any of your dental wisdom in the comments below. How does your child behave at the dentist? Do they enjoy going, or is it a\u00a0nightmare\u00a0to get them in the chair like it is for me? Yelp, I\u2019m deathly\u00a0afraid\u00a0of going to the\u00a0dentist, and I\u201dm not afraid to say it! I still go (just had a\u00a0 great \u00a0check up / cleaning) but man oh man, I don\u2019t like it!\u00a0 \u00a0Leave a comment and tell me about your child\u2019s dental experience.

{"date": ",December,17,2012", "body": "Dear Noah, I can\u2019t believe you turned two years old on\u00a0Saturday.  Time really does fly.  We had a great time celebrating your life with some of your little buddies on Saturday. Your mom did such a great job planning your party. You and I are super crazy lucky to have such an awesome lady in our life. We both hope you had a ton of fun on Saturday and felt honored and loved. This has been a big year for you. First let me just say that you don\u2019t have to ever  do  anything to earn my love nor is there some random\u00a0millstone that I\u2019m waiting for you to accomplish that would somehow make me  more proud  of you. I\u2019m already at\u00a0 maximum\u00a0love and pride\u00a0capacity . In fact, I\u2019m\u00a0overflowing\u00a0with both. So  every year  is a  big year  for you as far as I\u2019m concerned. \n \n But this year  you  did accomplish some pretty  major millstones . You  drank from a straw for the first time . You  crawled for the first time . You  signed for the first time . You walked for the first time. You went to the  New York Buddy Walk  for the first time.  Wow\u2026.! What a big year! You\u2019ve blown me away with all that you have accomplished in the last 12\u00a0months\u00a0and to just say I\u2019m proud of you would be a massive\u00a0understatement. I hope more than just hearing me say those words you are able to see that I\u2019m proud of you as I love on you as your daddy every. single. day. Every day when I wake up and see you lying there in your crib (unless you\u2019ve already woke up and you\u2019re lying there having a  mini-party ) I am blown away that I get the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to be your dad. It\u2019s seriously amazing. I feel like I won the little boy lottery or something (ok, that sounds sort of weird, so scratch that illustration.) As you\u2019ve gotten older your smile and joy has gotten  20 million times  more amazing. Your smile is so huge it seriously lights up a room (and my heart.) I can\u2019t get enough of your smile and laughter. The way you play and have fun and explore and dance is so much fun for your daddy to watch. I love it. Noah I couldn\u2019t have even dreamed of a more perfect little boy in my head. You are  way better  than the pretend kid I made up in my head before you born. It\u2019s funny how in life we sometimes we  think  we know what we want, but in actuality we have no idea. God knows what we want so much more than we do. And He shows me that more and more every day. There is no doubt His ways are always better than our ways. Always. I still remember the second your mom and I found out you were  born with Down syndrome . We were so scared. We had no idea what that meant for us, and especially for you. Turns out none of those  parenting fears  came true. As I\u2019ve said before Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0is sort of like the monster under the bed. It\u2019s pretty scary until you realize there\u2019s  nothing to be afraid of after all . Noah I\u2019m  so in love with you . Every time I look at you I\u2019m reminded of The Glory of God and how He has crafted you into His image. You are so unique and so full of the joy of God that it spills all over\u00a0everyone\u00a0any time they are around you. (including your mom and I.) And I love it. Again, words can\u2019t say how proud I am of you. You are changing the world and changing me. And I love it. Every day is better than the day before. I want you to know that these last 2 years have been the best 2 years of our life.  You make our family better. In every way.  You make our life better. In every way.  You make our days better. In every way. And we love you. We feel like the\u00a0luckiest\u00a0parents in the world to have you as our son. I want you to know that your dad and mom are here for you. We are so much in love and  you  have made our\u00a0marriage\u00a0better than it\u2019s every been. You NEVER have to worry about your mom and dad not being together. We are\u00a0committed\u00a0to God, to each other, and to you. I want you to know that next to Jesus we are your biggest advocates. We will speak when you can\u2019t. We will fight when you can\u2019t. We will push forward when you can\u2019t. Always. So know that.    I\u2019m looking forward to another great year being your dad. I hope this year I can show you even more than last year a small glimpse of the love that God has for you as I love and shepherd you. I want to remind you once again that no matter what the world tells you,  you are made unique, and created and crafted in the image of God .  God\u00a0designed\u00a0you with a purpose and your life matters a great deal. You aren\u2019t a burden, you aren\u2019t suffering, you aren\u2019t \u201cdisabled.\u201d You are 100% a co-equal with every other person on this planet. And God has some great plans for you. I\u2019m love having a front row seat to your life as I watch God\u00a0change\u00a0the world through it. I love you. I love you. I love you. Let\u2019s keep doing this thing! Your Daddy.

{"date": ",September,15,2012", "body": "I mean seriously what\u2019s more cute than a dancing baby!? I absolutely love how expressive our little boy is. It\u2019s hilarious (and incredibly adorable) to watch him bob his head and throw his little hands in the air whenever he hears a song he can dance to. It doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re riding in the car, hanging out at the movies, or watching a little  Glee ; when he hears a song he likes, it\u2019s dance time! He\u2019s been doing that move you see him do in the video for a while now where he raises his hands up. But he just recently started doing the other move you see him do where we rotates around on his bottom. I have no idea where he learned that move, but it is hilarious! Although I didn\u2019t show it in the video, he just kept dong that over and over. I seriously thought he was going to dizzy! Awww\u2026it\u2019s fun to be a parent!

{"date": ",August,7,2012", "body": "It\u2019s amazing how fast news travels in this day of everyone-and-their-grandmother-is-on-Facebook, but man oh man is it ever true.\u00a0Literally overnight news\u00a0organizations\u00a0around the world were contacting us about the  Target post that went viral . (There were even stories written in\u00a0foreign\u00a0languages\u00a0published about it, it was seriously unbelievable!) To be honest we were\u00a0uncomfortable\u00a0with all of the media attention the blog post was getting. This was the first time we had ever been a part of anything like this and to be honest it was a little of scary and overwhelming. The number of phone calls and emails we\u00a0received\u00a0from various\u00a0television\u00a0producers (many of them  very  well known) wanting to\u00a0inquiring\u00a0about us\u00a0appearing\u00a0on their program was mind blowing. It was\u00a0literally\u00a0one after the other. It started to get overwhelming very quickly, and we were thankful when things started to calm down. Trying to make the most of our 15 minutes\u2026 As I  mentioned ,\u00a0I never imaged the post was going to go  viral  when I published it and of course we weren\u2019t prepared for the overwhelming number of people trying to contact us. I mean would anyone really ever be ready for something like that? We were very selective in the number of\u00a0interviews\u00a0we did. Noah was only 12 months old at this point and we wanted to be sure it wasn\u2019t to much for him. In\u00a0addition, as most\u00a0typical american\u00a0families\u00a0we have a pretty busy schedule, and had commitments we needed to attend to in the midst of all this. However, it was important for us to be good stewards of the platform we had been given to help bring\u00a0awareness\u00a0to  Down syndrome  in general, but more\u00a0specifically\u00a0we wanted the world to be aware of the high number of children that are aborted\u00a0 prenatally \u00a0for no other reason than that there\u00a0is a chance they could be born with Down syndrome. We knew that stories didn\u2019t last long in the press, and we wanted to be sure used our 15 minutes to help bring awareness to a\u00a0cause\u00a0we are very\u00a0passionate\u00a0about\u2026. LIFE! A crash course in media relations We had never interacted with the media before, and we learned a lot throughout the entire process; specifically\u00a0how, umm\u2026.  creative \u00a0the\u00a0editing\u00a0process can be. In\u00a0addition, I\u2019m a talker, and interviews aren\u2019t made for talkers. They\u2019re made for short sound bites (something that is hard for talkers like me!) As we watched some of our\u00a0 interviews \u00a0we cringed at how some of our comments\u00a0came across when\u00a0separated\u00a0from their\u00a0original\u00a0context. For example I was\u00a0talking to one of the reporters about how when Noah was born I had a hard hard time finding a lot of\u00a0positive\u00a0 videos about Down syndrome  online. While I found a lot of really  great blogs  written by families raising a  child  with Down\u00a0syndrome, I\u201dm a visual person and wanted to see videos. I didn\u2019t know much about Down syndrome and wanted to find some every day videos of a family raising a child with Down syndrome so I could try to get an idea of what our life was going to be like moving forward. Also most of the blogs and video I did find were written by mommy bloggers, and as a dad, I really wanted to find something from a dad\u2019s point of view. (No offense to all the mommy bloggers out there\u2026y\u2019all are\u00a0awesome!) Since I had such a hard time finding the videos I was looking for, and limited blogs written by fathers who were\u00a0raising\u00a0children with Down syndrome, I decided I would start a site that would hopefully be the kind of site I was looking for\u2026 for someone else. This is what I was  trying  to explain to the reporter\u2026. Media Fail. As clear as I thought I was being, here is how all of the above came out during the interview: \u201c When Noah was born I had a hard time finding positive information about Down syndrome online. \u201d Fail!  This makes it seems like I think our site is  only place  online where someone can find\u00a0positive\u00a0information\u00a0about down syndrome. Ha,ha. This couldn\u2019t be\u00a0further\u00a0from the truth! We were (and still are)  new parents . We\u2019re just sharing our story as we go along. We are  far  from Down syndrome (or parenting) pros!\u00a0In fact there are thousands of  amazing websites  written by  parents  raising  children with Down syndrome , not to\u00a0mention\u00a0all of\u00a0fantastic\u00a0Down syndrome\u00a0organization websites out there like\u00a0 NDSS  and  DSE . From this point forward we tried to make sure it was clear that it was  videos about Down syndrome,  not\u00a0information, that \u00a0 we had a hard time finding, and how thankful we were to join so many other  amazing families  that are helping the world learn more about Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0as they blog and tell their story! If you want to meet more of these awesome families check out  Noah\u2019s Dad  Twitter, and  Facebook  page! We may not have said everything perfectly, or as clear as we would have liked to, but such is the nature of the press. However we\u00a0certainly\u00a0hope that we helped to communicate the joy that our son has\u00a0brought\u00a0to our life\u2026.3 copies of his 21st\u00a0chromosome\u00a0and all! \ud83d\ude42 The first baby I\u2019ve ever seen with Down syndrome on TV\u2026.Baby Noah! I have to say that for a 12 month old Noah did great during the various interviews we were a part of over the last few days (all the pictures on this post are taken during a two day\u00a0period!) I was so proud of him, and even more proud to be a daddy to this little boy in front of the world! Words can\u2019t express enough how much I love this little boy! I\u2019ve mentioned previously that that\u00a0before Noah was  born  pretty much  everything I knew about Down syndrome I learned\u00a0from\u00a0watching T.V , but I would have never guessed that back when I was watching  Life Goes On \u00a0that a son of my own (that just so happened to have been born with Down syndrome) would be on tv one day himself! It may not seem like he said much, but in the back of mind mind I like to believe that even though he didn\u2019t say any words, he said a lot. I like to believe that even if it was only for 15 minutes he helped get topic of Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0in front of the world. That someone, somewhere who had just\u00a0received\u00a0a  Down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis  (and\u00a0possibly\u00a0even considering abortion) decided to\u00a0 choose\u00a0life  after seeing the\u00a0massive\u00a0amount of joy that Noah has brought to our life. I may never know if this really\u00a0happened, but I know do is there is\u00a0tremendous\u00a0 power  when you and I share our story. If you are a parent of a child with  special needs  you are the  biggest\u00a0advocate \u00a0in the world to your family, friends, and local community. As you share with people the unique\u00a0aspects of your family, you help them\u00a0exchange\u00a0inaccurate\u00a0stereotypes for true ones, and that\u2019s a  win ! Check out the interviews\u2026..! Here\u2019s our interview with WFAA if you\u2019d like to check it out. And here\u2019s the one with Fox 4. Do you think interviews like these make an impact on our culture? Do you enjoy seeing the media cover stories about\u00a0people\u00a0with Down syndrome? What recent stories have you seen covered in the media about\u00a0people\u00a0with Down syndrome?

{"date": ",January,20,2013", "body": "Most kids known to have Down syndrome in their mother\u2019s womb don\u2019t make it out alive. I\u2019m thankful ours did. The third Sunday of January is\u00a0 National Sanctity of Human Life Day \u00a0and since that\u00a0happens\u00a0to be today I thought I\u2019d share a few things that\u00a0constantly\u00a0weigh heavy on my heart. A Reminder Of Brokenness This website and our\u00a0 other\u00a0social\u00a0media channels \u00a0have a wide reach and we\u00a0regularly\u00a0receive\u00a0messages from people all over the world. Most of these messages are overwhelmingly\u00a0positive and give us great\u00a0encouragement. But every once in a while we\u00a0receive\u00a0a message that reminds us that our world is deeply broken and in desperate need of repair it. Here\u2019s an example of one of those messages that we\u00a0received just yesterday: I wouldn\u2019t want the burden of having a child with Down Syndrome. I would have terminated the pregnancy. Sadly, this isn\u2019t just the opinion of the person who sent me this message. In fact,\u00a0 92% of children with Down syndrome are aborted \u00a0( yes, 92%! )\u00a0This means every time you see one Noah (my son) there\u2019s 9 Noah\u2019s you don\u2019t see as a result of people\u00a0 not wanting the burden . In other words, if you\u2019re a baby with Down syndrome, your mothers womb is a very\u00a0dangerous\u00a0place for you. And it breaks my heart. My Son Wants To Ride A\u00a0Dinosaur\u2026Not Become One. My friend Gabe Lyons notes, \u201c people with Down syndrome have been targeted for extinction. \u201d Our\u00a0culture\u00a0has become\u00a0obsessed\u00a0with making it easier and easier to detect if a child has\u00a0 Down syndrome \u00a0in the womb so parents can\u00a0 murder their child \u00a0 make an informed decision.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t begin to count the number of stories I\u2019ve heard from parents of children with Down syndrome about how their OB/GYN\u201ds repeatedly tried to get them to make an even more\u00a0 informed\u00a0decision\u00a0 after telling them they planned on bringing their child to full term. In fact, one dad told me he was so upset by the repeated pressure of their OB/GYN to abort their child he told him if he suggested they abort their child one more time he was going to hit him! This is why I highly recommend every OB/GYN / Pediatrician in the world read our letter on  how to correctly deliver a Down Syndrome diagnosis . Even after a child\u2019s birth this\u00a0discrimination\u00a0and\u00a0blatant disregard for human life continues. In Noah\u2019s\u00a0 birth story \u00a0we shared how our OB\u2019s first words to us were, I\u2019m so sorry. followed by, I\u2019m going to prescribe you some antidepressants. to which we politely declined.\u00a0 Our culture reminds me almost every day that it\u2019s on a mission to exterminate everyone who they deem\u00a0 a burden, or less than\u00a0 worthy of life. So What Do We Do? I don\u2019t have all of the answers. In fact, I have no answers. But I have a few ideas\u2026.. 1. Pray Every since man first decided to trust their way over God\u2019s our world has been going down hill. The Bible is clear that our world isn\u2019t getting better, in fact quite the opposite. There are some\u00a0problems\u00a0that are so big that our best efforts to change them will never be enough. The good news that we have access to The One who created the world and all that\u2019s in it.  When we reach the end of our gifts, talents, abilities, and creativity that\u2019s where the true power begins. In other words\u2026 Prayer changes things. \u00a0We should pray\u00a0 often \u00a0for God to protect these little children in the womb, and that He would change the hearts of our culture to view\u00a0 all people \u00a0as worthy of life, and\u00a0recognize\u00a0that all people are created in the image of God (in the womb or out\u2026.Down syndrome or no Down syndrome.) 2. Be Kind Mean people rarely change the world (for the better.) Enough said. 3. Tell Your Story If a tree falls in the woods\u2026.. Stories have power \u2026.but only if they\u2019re shared.\u00a0 The internet is a powerful place , and these days we all have access to a\u00a0 global audience . If you have a child with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0(or other\u00a0 special need )\u00a0 find a way to tell your story . You are your child\u2019s biggest advocate. You have to find a way to help the world understand that your child has more in common with a\u00a0 typical child\u00a0 than people think. Start a blog. A Facebook page, twitter account, heck, even an\u00a0 Pinterest \u00a0page. Call up your local college and offer to come speak to a class about your family\u2019s story. The\u00a0possibilities\u00a0are endless and every family had a\u00a0different\u00a0way of telling their story. Different is ok.  Being silent\u00a0isn\u2019t.  So share your story\u2026as often as you can.  Here\u2019s 14 ideas to get your started. Oh, and just in case you think God doesn\u2019t use stories to change lives, here\u2019s a quote from another message I recently\u00a0received: \u201cI just got the phone call last night that my blood work was abnormal and my child may possibly have Down\u2019s Syndrome. After the initial shock and confusion I buried myself in research looking for more info and a better perspective on what this could possibly mean. While my first thought was to abort if DS was confirmed all that has changed thanks to your story and others like yours.\u201d That little kid\u2019s life is forever changed. All\u00a0because\u00a0of a story. Look for ways to share yours today. 5. Constantly Reflect On Your Own \u201cBurden-ness.\u201d Never forget that you were once someone\u2019s \u2018burden\u2019 (who knows, maybe you still are!)\u00a0 \u00a0Let\u2019s be honest for a second, all of our lives\u00a0are\u00a0train wrecks in some way. We all have flaws. Issues. Hang ups. We\u2019ve all caused our parents\u00a0headaches\u00a0and\u00a0heartaches\u00a0at some point in our life. People aren\u2019t burdens. \u00a0People are gifts from God. Created in His image for a purpose. Every. single. person. on. this. planet\u2026..in the womb, or out. Let me say it again, this time read it\u00a0slowly. Every person on this plant is a gift from God, created in His image for a great purpose. Only 1 out of 10 kids with Down syndrome make it out of their mother\u2019s womb alive \u00a0which make a mother\u2019s womb a\u00a0 very\u00a0dangerous\u00a0place \u00a0for a baby with Down\u00a0syndrome. Thankfully our son was one of the lucky ones. So was\u00a0 Cade . And\u00a0 Seth . And\u00a0 Julian . And\u00a0 Ellie . And\u00a0 all of these kids .  And these. My great prayer is that God will change the hearts of our culture. That our culture will come to understand the value of human life (even little bitty lives.) That more children like my son will be brought to full term. That we will stop aborting children in the womb for\u00a0 any reason \u2026especially simply because they have an extra 21st\u00a0chromosome. 1 out of 10 is pretty bad odds, but thankfully God likes bad odds.

From breast feeding or bottle feeding to  using a straw  to moving solid food around your mouth with your tongue, all of this helps your mouth develop the ability to talk. Noah was in feeding therapy for a few months prior to 6 months of age to help him drink from a bottle. He breast fed great but when it came to the  bottle  it was a different story, and this mama had to go back to work. He was actually deemed by his speech therapist as one of the hardest kids she has ever tried to feed simply because he wouldn\u2019t hold still. Once we figured out how to stabilize Noah\u2019s core and trunk he started to eat much better. We found that he actually ate best in his car seat which was handy. During this time time we got introduced to the  Nuk brush  and  Z-vibe . They are similar devices and we have used them a variety of ways. Amazon is actually one of the best places to buy the NUK Brush and Z-Vibe. You can actually purchase both of them by clicking on the links below. \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Oral Motor Therapy One reason Noah improved with eating is that we started doing oral motor therapy. Theses are basically exercises and stretches for the mouth that help build strength. We used  Beckman Oral Motor Exercises , but there are others available as well. One disappointing fact if that there is not a lot of research showing that this works, but in my opinion the research just hasn\u2019t been done correctly yet. All of the studies that I found are pretty poor. I think it is definitely something to explore with your speech therapist. Oral Stimulation The Nuk and z-vibe are excellent stimulation devices for the mouth and tongue. We were often told to wake up Noah\u2019s mouth muscles simply by rubbing these devices around the mouth, on the cheeks, gums and tongue. It has helped Noah be able to brush his teeth and eat new textures. I know that texture sensitivity can be an issue for a lot of our kids and this is one way to work on helping the mouth tolerate new sensations. Eating Utensil The nuk came in handy today as Noah\u2019s first eating utensil. Our occupational therapist recommended this to us. The nuk is nice as it doesn\u2019t matter which way it goes in the mouth and things like apple sauce easily stick to it. We didn\u2019t have to worry about scooping or poking, it can just be dipped in the sauce and then straight to the mouth. Noah got the idea pretty quickly. Our OT showed us how to provide guidance at the wrist to help Noah know what to do. Thankfully no apple sauce was launched today. Have you used the Nuk brush? If so what are some ways you are using it? For those of you in oral motor\u00a0therapy\u00a0 what sort of tools are you using with your child?

As you can see our little boy is already in full swing summer mode, and trying to build the world\u2019s most  awesome sandcastle . After taking Noah to a small  man made beach  last summer and seeing how much he enjoyed playing in the sand we were excited for him to\u00a0experience\u00a0a  real beach . He had a ton of fun, and so did we. (He also had a ton of fun last summer  riding a\u00a0dinosaur ,  racing a turtle ,\u00a0 exploring\u00a0a cave , hanging out at the  olympic training center , and  hiking up a\u00a0mountain \u2026and he was only 6 months old! Down syndrome doesn\u2019t hold this little boy back at all!) I\u2019ll be writing more about our summer vacation in another post, but I wanted to check in with all of you and see what sort of fun activities you all have planned this summer. I\u2019m always amazed by how fun and creative this community is, and\u00a0perhaps\u00a0our family will borrow some of your ideas! What sort of fun things do you have planned this summer with your\u00a0family? Take a second to leave a comment below and let us know! And who knows maybe we\u2019ll get to chance to meet some of you.

{"date": ",June,14,2012", "body": "While it\u2019s true that every Thanksgiving brings with it much to be thankful for, this year\u2019s Thanksgiving (our son\u2019s first) was\u00a0perhaps\u00a0our families most thankful Thanksgiving yet. (Whew\u2026.try trying that 7 times real fast!) This year our family has something to be thankful for that less than a year ago we would have never\u00a0imagined\u00a0it even being a part of our life, much less saying we were  thankful  for it. \u00a0But we are. This thanksgiving we\u2019re thankful to have a son with Down syndrome. Our son\u00a0almost came with an extra, extra bonus\u2026. A few days after our son surprised us by being  born with Down syndrome \u00a0we were called to our\u00a0 pediatrician\u2019s \u00a0office to  discuss  something that came back on his  newborn screen . This  something  ended up being the\u00a0possibility\u00a0that our son could have\u00a0 Glutaric Acidemia, type 1  (GA-1), in\u00a0addition\u00a0to Down\u00a0syndrome. Now if you\u2019ve never heard of  GA-1 , you\u2019re not alone. Neither had I until this doctor visit, but I\u2019ll give you the long and short of it:  It could kill you . We were told that it was likely a false\u00a0positive, not to worry (yah, right.), and to go home and enjoy Christmas with our new baby (after taking him to the lab to have some blood drawn.) I\u2019ll never forget walking in the front door of our\u00a0apartment after that doctor visit. I was still trying to wrap my mind around the fact that our son was\u00a0unexpectedly\u00a0born with  Down syndrome  just a few days\u00a0earlier. I was still trying to sort through what that meant for him and for our family. I was still hurt, confused, heavy hearted, and  worried  about our little baby boy. I mean come on, he was only a few days old, and it takes time for a new parent to sort\u00a0through\u00a0all of the\u00a0emotions\u00a0of a  Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0diagnosis . Now not only does my son have  Down syndrome , but he may also have a  very rare metabolic disorder  that could  kill him . Wow! Talk about kicking a guy when he\u2019s down. I\u201dm getting teary eyed just reflecting on that day as I draft this post. You can read more about what I call  the scariest week of my life  if you\u2019d like, but after about a month and a half of testing, which\u00a0included\u00a0taking our few weeks old son to a\u00a0 geneticist  to have his DNS\u00a0sequenced, he ended up  not having  Glutaric Acidemia. Thank God!\u00a0 The 6 weeks that changed my life\u2026forever. \u00a0 Waiting on the test results to come back (about 6\u00a0weeks) really changed my life in more ways than anyone will ever know. When Noah was born I had to think about how our life was going to change as a result of his being born with Down syndrome When I found out Noah may have GA-1 I had to think about how our life was going to change if Noah had Down syndrome and Glutaric Acidemia, including the possibility\u00a0of loosing our son. That was a whole different\u00a0animal. Down syndrome I was ok with, GA-1 (and the reality that our son could die) I was not. I had to have a lot of heart to heart conversations with God during those 6 weeks. I remember pleading with God that our son would  just  have Down syndrome. When all the dusted settled (and before we\u00a0received\u00a0the results) I came to grips with the fact that our children are not are own. They are God\u2019s. They belong to them. We are their parents, their\u00a0stewards. One day they will leave us. They get married, they move out, they get a\u00a0roommate\u00a0and at some point our children die. Sometimes they die after us, and sometimes, sadly, they die before us. I say that not to be\u00a0morbid, but just to remind you (and me) that our\u00a0children\u00a0aren\u2019t forever. We never know what any day may hold. Our children (and us) are only one Doctor\u2019s appointment away from having their\u00a0lives\u00a0changed forever. Yes, that\u2019s scary, but you have a choice\u2026 You can either allow fear to paralyze\u00a0you and keep you from\u00a0enjoying\u00a0the joy of today, or you can move\u00a0forward\u00a0choosing to trust that God\u00a0truly\u00a0does  have the whole world in His\u00a0hands , including you and your family. It doesn\u2019t mean that what your facing isn\u2019t scary. But it does means coming to a very real place in your life where you\u00a0 truly \u00a0trust that God is bigger than your fear, and  He is able  to see you through it. Your fear doesn\u2019t control you. When fear comes knocking at your\u00a0family\u2019s\u00a0door you tell it to go somewhere else,\u00a0because\u00a0fear doesn\u2019t win in your house, God does. All of that to say that on the other side of that 6 week waiting period, I came out a different person. God used those 6 weeks to help me deal with my fear and\u00a0anxiety\u00a0issues. (Yes, my name\u2019s Rick Smith and I\u2019m worrier!) \ud83d\ude42 He wanted to show me that He is able to give us joy even in one of the scariest\u00a0moments\u00a0of our life. Up until that point in my life I had only heard stories about God giving people this kind of joy, but now I know first hand those stories are true. God really can meet our needs when nothing else on this planet can. How amazing is that! So on this thanksgiving (our son\u2019s first) I am extremely thankful that I\u2019m not faced with the reality of\u00a0raising\u00a0a child born with Down syndrome and GA-1. Don\u2019t get me wrong, our God is a big God. If Noah would have had GA-1, He would have certainly enabled us to get through it. However I\u2019m speaking honest and from my heart when I say I am thankful that we don\u2019t have to go down that road. To the parents of a child facing a posable\u00a0Glutaric Acidemia\u00a0diagnosis\u2026 If you ended up on this page somehow\u00a0because\u00a0your child is facing the\u00a0possibility\u00a0of a GA-1 diagnosis I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve only added to your fear. But I want you to know that I\u2019m speaking to you from the heart, and yes as a parent that is scary, very scary. Your child really can die as a result of it. That\u2019s\u00a0perhaps\u00a0one of the scariest things I can think of. Now let me try to give you some\u00a0encouragement. \u00a0 First, there\u00a0are  a lot of false\u00a0positives \u00a0on the newborn screen. and it\u2019s very likely that will be the case with your child. If that\u2019s not the case, GA-1 is like\u00a0most everything medically\u00a0related in that there is a  wide range  of how it affects a person. Your medical team will help you develop a plan for your child that helps keep them from having a metabolic crisis.\u00a0Furthermore, as stressful as newborn screens (and false\u00a0positives) can be, it\u2019s all worth it if it helps just one child catch a\u00a0genetic\u00a0condition\u00a0as early as\u00a0possible. As with almost everything medically related, the earlier a person is\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with a\u00a0condition, the better. I tell you all of this in an\u00a0attempt\u00a0to encourage you. I\u2019m sure you are very\u00a0scared, but know that we live in a time like no other time in history, and our medical community has become very good at helping children with all sorts of conditions (including\u00a0GA-1) live long and healthy lives. Noah\u2019s first Thanksgiving As I\u2019ve\u00a0mentioned\u00a0we have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. I can honestly say that I\u2019m thankful to be the parent of a child with Down syndrome. This child has changed our family\u2019s life in more ways than I could even begin count. I\u2019m thankful that my son is healthy. That he is growing, learning, and developing. I\u2019m thankful for how\u00a0joyous\u00a0and fun this little boy is. It\u2019s awesome being his daddy. \u00a0 Will there be\u00a0bumps\u00a0in the road? Sure. Will there be lots of scary times in our future? Sure, what child doesn\u2019t scare his parents from time to time? But for today, for this first Thanksgiving with our new little baby boy, things are ok. The rush\u00a0of emotions\u00a0we dealt with the few months of Noah\u2019s birth has subsided. I don\u2019t freak out as much\u00a0every time\u00a0we have to take Noah to see his\u00a0pediatrician (although waiting for the results every time Noah gets a  CBC  still causes my heart to beat faster than normal.) I don\u2019t get (as) worried every time Noah gets a little cough. \u00a0 Other than Noah having a little virus (as you can see in some of the pictures) today is a great day of enjoying life, eating lots of yummy food (thanks Abbie!) and enjoying time with family\u2026and being very, very thankful that my son  just  has Down syndrome! I know it\u2019s not Thanksgiving right now, but it\u2019s always good to reflect on things you\u2019re thankful for. So please take a second to leave a comment below and let me know one or two things that your especially thankful for  right now .

{"date": ",June,16,2013", "body": "Father\u2019s day is always a bitter sweet time for me. As I scroll through my  Facebook  and  Twitter  feed on Father\u2019s day I see countless posts of people posting pictures of their dads with captions such as: \u201cThankful to have such a wonderful dad!\u201d \u201cGrateful for this guy\u2019s leadership in my life!\u201d \u201cSo glad to have such a wonderful father!\u201d \u201cI love this man!\u201d As I read these posts I always feel disappointment and sadness since I cannot post a similar one about my own dad. The truth is I don\u2019t ever remember my dad saying he loved me. Ever giving me a hug. Ever going to church with us (much less ever praying for / with me.) My dad didn\u2019t teach me how to shave, treat a woman, how to tie a tie (or how to light a water heater\u2019s pilot light\u2026.I just had to call the gas company to come show me how to light mine\u2026I was scared. Those things look scary.) \ud83d\ude42 I love my father, but the truth (sadly) is that my dad was not a good dad. What Makes A Dad \u201cGood?\u201d Before I go any further I want to say a few things about what I mean when I say\u00a0 good  dad. First, simply being a dad (which basically means you had sex with a woman and played a role in creating a human) does not make a dad a good dad. (Woah, that\u2019s a whole lotta dads!) There are many dads who abandon their children after they\u2019re born (or even worse, encourage their wife to  abort their child  while they are still in the womb!) There are also many dads that live in the same house as their children yet aren\u2019t the father that God designed them to be (such was the case with my dad.) Being a  good dad  is much more than simply being  a dad . I mean no disrespect when I say my dad wasn\u2019t a good one, I\u2019m just stating the truth. A good dad is one who does the things listed below. Sure there are more, but these are the biggy\u2019s. It\u2019s  impossible  to be a good dad and not do  most  of these things. (As you\u2019ll see I\u2019ve listed \u201cfun\u201d as a good-dad-quality\u2026I suppose you can still be a good dad and not be fun. You\u2019ll just be a boring, good dad. \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019ve forgiven my dad for not being the kind of dad that God designed him to be (a good dad.) I love my dad. As you\u2019ll read below my dad is no longer living, but I wish I could go back and time and talk to him before he died (I didn\u2019t talk to him (or even know where he was) about a decade before he died.) I wish I could have told him how things turned out for me. How by God\u2019s grace I was a different father to my son than he was to me. And how that same God wanted to change his life and fill it with joy. But I never got the chance. However, I do have the chance to make things different for my family. To change my family tree. To start new traditions. If you (like me) didn\u2019t have a Godly dad in your life, I want you to know you aren\u2019t trapped by your past. That God is in the business of changing people (and families.) No matter what kind of dad you are today, God wants to make you into a better one.  It\u2019s never to late to be a good dad. 9 Things I Learned About Being A Good Father From Having A Bad One. Although my dad didn\u2019t teach me the things every father should teach his son, I did, however, learn some important lessons about fatherhood from my dad, and these things have greatly impacted the kind of dad I am to my own son. I know a lot of mother\u2019s read our blog, but today\u2019s post is for all the dad\u2019s out there. (Although good mom\u2019s should do all of the same things.) So mom\u2019s please forward this post to all of the dad\u2019s in your life (and all of the will-be-a-dads-one-day); my hope is that all dad\u2019s (myself included) let these nine lessons mark the kind of dad they are. 1. Tell Your Kids You Love Them. Often. It breaks my heart that I can\u2019t remember my dad ever telling me he loved me. I\u2019m sure he did, I just can\u2019t remember it. That\u2019s sad. Don\u2019t let your kids ever say the same thing about you.  Tell your kids you love them and you are proud of them, often.  Tell it to them until they say they are sick of hearing you say it.  Then say it a million more times. Your kids long to hear you say that you love them and that you\u2019re extremely proud of them. They may say they don\u2019t (for those of you raising teenagers) but they do. Trust me. 2. Pray For Your Kids. Often. I don\u2019t remember my dad ever praying for me. In fact, I don\u2019t remember my dad ever praying for anything, ever. That\u2019s heartbreaking. For me and for him. One of the greatest privileges (and obligations) we have as parents is praying for our children. My dad missed out on that privilege. I won\u2019t. Take time to pray for your kids every. single. day. Let them hear you pray. Pray at dinner time. Pray as a family. Pray when trouble comes. Pray when things are good. Pray when you have little. Pray when you have plenty. Let your kids catch you praying. Let them know that you know the One who holds the whole world in His hands. The One who hears us when we pray. The One who is always there for us. Let them know that you have a high regard for prayer. Bottom line; Make sure your kids know (and see you model) that  one of the most manly things that any man man can do is pray. Teach your kids this at an early age. 3. Teach Your Kids Where Truth Comes From Your children are going to spend their entire lives living in a world that\u2019s trying to sell them one lie after other. Our job as parents is to teach them truth and where that truth comes from. Truth ultimately comes from the Bible. The Bible is our standard of what is right and wrong. It gives us fixed points of reference to align our life when the storms of life come our way; like a light house does for a ship at sea. Make sure your house (and your life) revolves around the Word of God. Teach your child what it means to have a Biblical worldview. If you don\u2019t the world will teach them otherwise. And your child will spend their entire life searching for truth in all the wrong places. Don\u2019t let this happen. If you have young children  The Jesus Story Book Bible  is one of  the best  children\u2019s Bibles you can buy. It\u2019s worth it\u2019s weight in gold. Buy it, and read it to your children as often as you can. If you\u2019re an adult and looking to learn more about God\u2019s Word yourself, I want to suggest two books that will change your life forever. \n The ESV Study Bible . This is simply the best study Bible you can buy, and the information contained in it will help you learn what the Bible actually means. \n Living By The Book  \u2013 This book was written by one of  my professors  and it will  transform  the way you read and study the Bible. Trust me. It\u2019s also worth it\u2019s weight in gold. \n \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.\u201d \u2013 Proverbs 22:6 4. Hug and kiss your wife in front of your kids. Often. I\u2019m not talking about a full on make out session. That would just freak your kid out. But show affection to your wife in front of your children. Hug her. Kiss her. Tell her you love her. Tell her she is beautiful. Take your wife out on dates  without  your child. Go on a short (or long!) vacation  without  your children. (I\u2019ll admit, this one is hard to do.) Why is this so important? You want your children to know that their parents\u00a0(and their home) are  secure . That mom and dad are  committed to each other . That mom and dad are in love with each other. That even though their friend\u2019s family may be falling apart, theirs isn\u2019t.  I want my children to know their home is a safe place.  That mom and dad love each other and aren\u2019t going anywhere. Ever. No matter what. My son never has to worry about dad divorcing mom (or vis versa.) We are in this for the long haul. In fact, here are the exact wedding vowels I made to my wife on our wedding day. I want my kids to know I meant every word. (It\u2019s amazing how many husbands forget the vowels they made on their wedding day. Sad.) I, Rick give myself completely to you, Abbie, \n To be your husband in marriage; I will lead you spiritually \n As I submit to the Lord and His Word to guide our lives; \n I will be faithful to God and to you \n and I will never leave you; \n Honor, serve, & cherish you; \n And divorce, whether mental, emotional, spiritual, or physical, \n Will never be an option to me. \n I will forgive you as Christ has forgiven me; \n I will encourage, challenge and pray for you. \n And I will keep Christ at the center of our marriage. \n And I will love with all of my heart, soul, mind, and strength all of the days of my life \n All this I vow to you and to God. Do I always do a perfect job at doing what I said I would do? Nope. Do I always strive to? Yelp. I mean what I said that day. And by God\u2019s grace I will strive to live out those vowels until God takes one of us home. I\u2019m not a perfect dad, but I know where Perfection comes from, and I daily seek to become more like Him. \ud83d\ude42 In case I wasn\u2019t clear: I am madly, deeply, crazy, head over heels in love with Noah\u2019s mom. I fall more in love with her ever day. She becomes more beautiful to me every day. And Noah knows it. \ud83d\ude42 5. Don\u2019t argue in front of your kids. (Well, at least not very often.) \ud83d\ude42 This point goes with the one above. In addition to making your home a secure one for your kids, make it a  peaceful  one.\u00a0Every married couple has arguments. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s healthy. It\u2019s ok. But as parents we should make it our goal not to have them in front of our children. (Yes, I know this isn\u2019t always possible. Trust me, I\u2019m a mess to be married to.) \ud83d\ude42 But we should strive for it. By the way, we should also strive to  fight fair  with our spouse when we do argue. You want your kids to  want  to be at home. You want your kids to think of your house as the most peaceful, loving place on the planet. Sadly,this wasn\u2019t the case with me. Many of my memories growing up are of my mom and dad arguing. It made my home feel unstable (which it was; my parents eventually divorced and my dad abandoned my mother to rise four boys on her own) and un-peaceful and I never wanted to be there as I got into my teenage years. Dads, do all that you can to make your home a place your kids want to be at. Trust me. One day they may not be living with you, and you want them to want to come back. 7. Be Fun. I\u2019ve met a lot of dads (mine included) that seem to have forgotten what it\u2019s like to be a kid. They yell. They scream. Are quick tempered. Grumpy. And outright  no fun  to be around. They don\u2019t read silly stories to their kids, help them build universes made entirely out of legos, go down the slide with them, or put on silly puppet shows for them. In other words that are mean-o\u2019s. Don\u2019t be this dad. Have fun with your kids. Make memories. Laugh with them. Tickle them. Jump in the ball pit with them. Be goofy with them. Create new family  traditions . In other words just be FUN to be around. To combine the last three points;  make sure your house is secure, loving, peacefully, and full of joy.  That is the kind of a house a kid longs to be at, not longs to run away from. 8. Use Alcohol Wisely I\u2019m not  anti- alcohol by any means. Some of the greatest dads I know enjoy a good beer from time to time. However, I am (as is God)  anti-drunkenness . It\u2019s never ok to be drunk. It\u2019s especially never ok to be drunk around your children. My father was an alcoholic, in fact he eventually drank himself to death. Almost all the memories I have of my father involved him drinking.  A lot. As a child I was always scared of my dad when he was drunk. Not because he was physically abusive to us or anything, but because he was a different person when he was drinking. I didn\u2019t feel secure him. He would act strange. Sometimes he would act over-the-top-silly. Sometimes he would yell. Sometimes he would say mean things. Often times he would simply pass out. In other words, he would  act drunk . I didn\u2019t know much about what it meant to be drunk as a kid, all I knew is that when my father was, he was a different person, and that person scared me. Sadly, my dad was that different person most of the time. He had no idea how to handle alcohol. Alcohol is like a deadly weapon. In the hands of someone responsible it can be ok, but in the hands of someone who isn\u2019t, it can be deadly; such was the case with my father. Fathers, you don\u2019t ever, EVER want your children to be scared of you. And being drunk around them is one sure fire way to do just that.  If you\u2019re a person who can\u2019t handle alcohol responsibly than leave it alone.  It\u2019s not worth it. Trust me. 9. And The Most Important Item On This Entire List: Teach Your Children About God. This one really combines all of the points above into one. My friend Reggie Joiner often reminds people that from the day your child is born  you only have 936 weeks with them before they graduate high school. That\u2019s it. After our children graduate high school and (hopefully) go on to college our influence in their life decreases drastically. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so import for us to use those 936 weeks to teach them all we can about God; who He is, what He was done for them, how they can know Him, and how He desires for them to make a difference in the world with their life. \u00a0 When these 936 weeks are done, they\u2019re done. There\u2019s no such thing as a  parenting time machine . You can\u2019t go back and teach your adult child what you wish you would have taught them when they were a child. These 936 weeks are all we have. Let\u2019s make them count. \u201cWhen we understand how much time we have left with our kids, we begin to make what matters, matter more.\u201d \u2013 Reggie Joiner It\u2019s Never To Late To Start Becoming A \u201cGood Dad\u201d Being a good dad isn\u2019t easy. It isn\u2019t autonomous. It takes work.\u00a0Every day I have to make a conscious\u00a0effort to be a \u201cgood dad.\u201d To put my desires aside for those of my son and wife. Some days I blow it (just ask my wife) other days I feel like I did a pretty good job. Thankfully God is always at work helping become the kind of dad he designed me to be, a good dad. If you\u2019re reading this and you haven\u2019t been a \u201cgood dad\u201d please know that it isn\u2019t to late. Today\u2019s the day to tell your children (and your wife) you\u2019re sorry for not being a \u201cgood dad\u201d and that you\u2019re ready to make a change. To do things different. To do things the right way. Get involved in a good Bible teaching church where you can learn God\u2019s Word, and be around other dads striving to be a \u201cgood dad\u201d as well. Spend time reading God\u2019s Word (again,  this is great tool to help you do that ) and praying that God would help transform you into the sort of dad whose children\u2019s love to be around. He can do it. He\u2019s in the business of changing lives\u2026I\u2019m living proof. A Father\u2019s Day Shout Out To My Father In Law (And Mom) Although I didn\u2019t have the sort of father God intended for me to have, I\u2019m blessed that He (God) did put other men in my life to take his place. There have been a handful of men that my life has crossed paths with the last 15 years who have helped shaped me into the sort of dad and husband I am today. One of those men is my father-in-law. I\u2019ve been fortunate to have a font row seat the last 13 years to see the sort of dad my father-in-law is to my wife (and to me.) He is loving, patient, helpful and has many of the qualities that I want to have as a father. He was there  the day Noah was born \u00a0and has  always  been more than supportive and encouraging to Abbie and I as we raise Noah. I could write an entire blog post on how he has loved the past 14 years he has known me (I had a lot of growing up to in my 20\u2019s) \ud83d\ude42 but I\u2019ll just say he is a fantastic father, husband, grandpa, and friend. I\u2019m thankful that God put him in my life. Noah is one lucky kid to have a grandpa like him. In addition I have to say thank you to my mom on father\u2019s day. She played the role of both a mother and a father to me and my three brothers for most of our life. She pulled the weight of two parents. She has gone back to school to get a college degree and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of her. I know there are a lot of mom\u2019s out there doing exactly what my mom did and my hats off to you. God never intended parenting to work that way; I want you to know that you are appreciated and what you are doing is important. To all the fathers out there I want to wish you a happy father\u2019s day. Being a good dad takes a lot of work, but it\u2019s the best job in the world. Keep fighting the good fight. Keeping being the sort of dad whose kid\u2019s look up to and strive to be like. What you are doing is important. We only have 936 weeks from the first day we lay eyes on our kids. Let\u2019s make them count! What sort of dad did you have growing up? Did he model what it meant to be a \u201cgood dad?\u201d If so, how?\u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/noahsdadcom", "http://twitter.com/noahsdaddotcom", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310708257/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0310708257&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/143353083X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=143353083X&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IWD3EE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006IWD3EE&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.bible-equip.org/articles/topical-studies/FightingFairInMarriage.pdf", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/143353083X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=143353083X&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/how-to-be-a-good-dad/", "title": "9 Lessons I Learned About Being A Good Dad By Having A Bad One"},
{"date": ",March,6,2013", "body": "I\u2019m a work in progress. Every day of my life I hope I\u2019m a better person than the day before. My life is a process of taking 2 steps forward and 1 step back but hey, 1 step forward is still a step forward. So I\u2019ll take it. \u201cSticks And Stones May Break My Bones But Words Will Never Hurt Me\u201d = One Of The Most Inaccurate Sayings Of All Time Let me just be very honest for a minute, prior to\u00a0 our son being born \u00a0I used the word \u201cretarded\u201d pretty flippantly. I would use phrases like \u201cthat\u2019s so retarded,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t be retarded,\u201d or \u201cman\u2026I\u2019m so retarded\u201d from time to time without ever even thinking I was using discriminatory language (or hate speech) toward an entire group of people. This is especially disappointing to me since I\u2019m in a profession where words (and their meanings) are vitally important. I spend hours thinking through the words I use, yet I so quickly let that word flow out of my mouth without even giving 2 seconds of thought to it. Shame on me. (I\u2019ve also said things words \u201cduh\u201d and \u201clame\u201d which I have also been told are hurtful\u2026I have cut these words out as well.) Thankfully I know better now. The \u201cR-Word\u201d Is Hurtful After our son was born I quickly learned how hurtful and discriminatory the word \u201cretard / retarded\u201d is. There is even an entire campaign called \u201c Spread The Word To End The Word ;\u201d in fact today is national \u201c spread the word to end the word \u201d day. (I had no idea this day, or\u00a0 World Down Syndrome Day , even existed prior to Noah being born.) I remember my jaw hitting the floor when I saw this short, 30 second, PSA for the first time.\u00a0 Please take 30 seconds and watch it.\u00a0 I promise you\u2019ll think about the word \u201cretarded\u201d in a whole new light. I really wish someone earlier in my life would have taken the time to tell me about the use of this word, and why I shouldn\u2019t use it. I would have stopped immediately. When I hear people use the word \u201cretarded\u201d like I used to I try to take a moment to help them understand why they shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m always\u00a0 very gracious \u00a0about it because I know they don\u2019t mean anything hurtful by it, and they certainly aren\u2019t trying to insult my son or others with intellectual disabilities. In fact there have been a few times where I didn\u2019t say anything simply because I didn\u2019t want to make the person feel bad. But since there is a large community of readers behind this blog I thought I would take a moment to help educate anyone reading this why they too should help \u201cend the word.\u201d Why You Should Stop Using \u201cRetarded\u201d I pulled this info from the\u00a0 spread the word website \u00a0which gives more than a few reasons why I cut the word \u201cretarded\u201d out of my vocabulary and you should too. \n The R-word is exclusive \n The R-word ignores individuality \n The R-word equated intellectual disability with being \u201cdumb\u201d or \u201cstupid\u201d \n The R-word spreads hurt \n The R-word is offensive \n The R-word is incorrect \n The R-word is derogatory \n The R-word fosters loneliness \n The R-word is hate speech (Ouch! I had no idea I was using hate speech all this time!) \n Sign The Pledge To Stop Using \u201cThe R-Word\u201d Spread the word to end the word is doing a campaign where you can pledge to \u2026.support the elimination of the derogatory use of the r-word from everyday speech and promote the acceptance and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities. I believe that all people are created in the image of God, are valuable, and deserve to be spoken about in respectful and loving ways. I know it would be very hurtful if someone called my son \u201ca retard\u201dor if someone used that word to describe something foolish they did (therefore implying that my son is foolish.) If you agree with me, I\u2019d encourage you to\u00a0take 2 minutes and\u00a0 sign the pledge . Do you sometimes use the word \u201cretarded\u201d in jest? (It\u2019s ok to say so, as I mentioned I used to do the same thing.) If so, do you see \u201cthe R-word\u201d differently after this post, and do you think you will try hard to remove the use of that word as a \u201cslag word?\u201d Leave a comment below and let us know.\u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.r-word.org/", "http://www.r-word.org/r-word-effects-of-the-word.aspx", "http://www.r-word.org/r-word-pledge.aspx"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/spread-the-word-to-end-the-word/", "title": "\u201cThat\u2019s So Retarded\u201d \u2013 Why I Stopped Saying This, And You Should Too."},

Travel expenses not reimbursed. Extensive courier duties also required. \n RESPONSIBILITIES: \u00a0The rest of your life. Must be willing to be hated, at least temporarily, until someone needs $5. \n Must be willing to bite tongue repeatedly. Also, must possess the physical stamina of a pack mule and be able to go from zero to 60 mph in three seconds flat in case, this time, the screams from the backyard are not someone just crying wolf. \n Must be willing to face stimulating technical challenges, such as small gadget repair, mysteriously sluggish toilets and stuck zippers. \n Must screen phone calls, maintain calendars and coordinate production of multiple homework projects. \n Must have ability to plan and organize social gatherings for clients of all ages and mental outlooks. \n Must be willing to be indispensable one minute, an embarrassment the next. \n Must handle assembly and product safety testing of a half million cheap, plastic toys, and battery operated devices. \n Must always hope for the best but be prepared for the worst. \n Must assume final, complete accountability for the quality of the end product. \n Responsibilities also include floor maintenance and janitorial work throughout the facility. \n POSSIBILITY FOR ADVANCEMENT & PROMOTION: \u00a0Virtually none.

A balloon payment is due when they turn 18 because of the assumption that college will help them become financially independent. \n When you die, you give them whatever is left. The oddest thing about this reverse-salary scheme is that you actually enjoy it and wish you could only do more. \n BENEFITS: \u00a0While no health or dental insurance, no pension, no tuition reimbursement, no paid holidays and no stock options are offered; this job supplies limitless opportunities for personal growth and free hugs for life if you play your cards right.

That\u2019s right, Noah\u2019s creeping for the first time!  Why do I say creeping and not crawling\u2026keep reading to find out. \u00a0There is some  serious   celebrating  going on at our house once again. Isn\u2019t it amazing how many things you can find to celebrate? Noah has mastered the  inchworm , which is actually a  form a crawling . \u00a0Keeping your abdomen off the ground is known as  creeping  in the world of development. We talked about the types of crawling in our previous  article  and those versions are just as important as creeping. I initially thought that Noah\u2019s version of the inchworm was more work than creeping, however I was quickly taught by our physical therapist that the art of creeping requires a heck of a  core  and a lot of coordination. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if you have noticed the theme that flows through all of these  milestones , but having a strong core is the foundation of most of them. Don\u2019t Rush Walking We have had several occupational therapists who follow our story ask us why we are  rushing  Noah to walk since we seem to post a lot about the  treadmill . They are encouraging us to keep Noah crawling for a little while longer. Even with the treadmill, I promise we have spent ample time working on crawling and creeping. Almost every therapy sessions we work on  quadruped ,  supported kneeling , and  endless core exercises  which helped us to get to this  celebrated moment . I am surprised that Noah still thinks that  large balls  are meant for anything fun. \ud83d\ude42 And as we may work hard on walking at such a young age we also realize he is probably  several months from being able to take his first steps  and he\u2019ll rely on creeping during this time and gain all of the benefits that it provides. The treadmill portion of our therapy sessions is usually 10 minutes or less, so we have to fill up our time some how \ud83d\ude09 Creeping Helps Develop Fine Motor Skills So why does your occupational therapist want your child to crawl and creep? Well\u2026these methods of transportation put weight on the hands, arms and shoulders to help develop strength and  proprioception  into these areas. This pressure helps with grasp, coordination, stability and eventually even things like hand-writing. I think that an occupational therapist may enjoy  an open hand with extended wrist pushing on the ground  the most. This can help with controlling the hand, develops the small muscles, as well as builds the arch of the hand which are all important for later fine motor skills we will want for our kids that we may not even be thinking about yet. \u00a0So we will continue to encourage Noah to creep around our house while we wait for him to walk as we know that he is just mastering his penmanship. Creeping Helps With Walking Creeping continues to have its gross motor benefits as well, as it is part of the journey to walking. In\u00a0Patricia Waters book,  Gross Motor Skills in Children With Down Syndrome , she\u00a0states that creeping helps a child with bending their legs while walking. Without this step a child may tend to keep their legs straight and have problems with balance. It also continues to work on the core and coordinating alternating movements which are essential for walking. Interesting Fact In several countries children tend to walk at an  earlier age  than American babies. This is because standing and walking are encouraged behavior rather than expecting their children to creep like most Americans. These children in other countries (like Africa and India) tend to skip creeping all together. That being said, I think it is also very common for children with developmental delays to skip creeping and go from a form of crawling straight to walking and this is ok. Enjoy your child\u2019s journey as it is specific to them and may be faster, slower, or just different than their peers including those with Down syndrome. If they skip a step or do them out of order it will likely turn out ok, so keep  celebrating all those milestones  your little one continues to achieve. Did you realize that gross motor and fine motor skills were intertwined? \u00a0Did you child creep or do they go straight to walking? Leave a comment below and tell us about it.

{"date": ",February,18,2013", "body": "Ethan was killed by police officers after now leaving a movie theater. I came across a story in  The Daily Mail  about a 26 year old man with Down Syndrome, Robert Ethan Saylor, who was suffocated by police after not leaving a showing of the movie \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d Robert\u2019s death was ruled a homicide\u00a0today. (Meaning these policeman killed this man.) According to reports, Ethan (the man with Down syndrome), stayed in his seat when the film ended, which\u00a0prompted\u00a0movie\u00a0theater\u00a0employees\u00a0to call the\u00a0police. When the  three policeman  (Lt. Scott Jewell, Sgt. Rich Rochford and Deputy James Harris) arrived they handcuffed Robert and placed him face down on the ground where he became \u201c distressed\u201d  to the point of being\u00a0asphyxiated. (read: killed by these\u00a0policemen.) According to  another news report : \u201cPositional asphyxia is typically the result of an intense struggle and often involves a person who is handcuffed and lying on their stomach after the struggle,\u201d writes the Frederick News Post, based on information by criminologist and former law enforcement officer Dr. George Kirkham. \u201c\u2026People often panic and can\u2019t catch their breath.\u201d \n Kirkham described asphyxia as a condition that closely resembles the panic that accompanies drowning. \n \u201cTheir cardiovascular system is just going wild,\u201d he said, adding that such a condition is more likely to occur in those who suffer from a mental disability. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-known phenomenon, and these people need to be trained about it.\u201d I can\u2019t even\u00a0imagine\u00a0what was going on in this young man\u2019s mind when he was handcuffed and forced to the ground by these three police man. He was no doubt scared. He probably had no idea what was going on. And these guys treated him like an animal to the point they murdered him. Just typing out this blog post remind me of how hurt and angry I am. This Has To Stop! This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve heard of a person with Down syndrome (or other special need) being\u00a0mistreated\u00a0by someone in\u00a0authority. A few weeks ago 8 year old Shaylyn Searcy (a little girl with Down syndrome) arrived home from school with her shoes  duct-taped to her ankles  which was done by a school\u00a0official!!! Are you kidding me!  Then there was  Bede Vanderhorst  (a 16 year old teenager with Down syndrome) who was not allowed to fly first class on an American Airlines flight. Next the tragic story of 7 year old Angellika \u201cAngie\u201d Arndt who was  suffocated by her own teachers ! \u00a0Then you have the state of Florida\u00a0 warehousing\u00a0children with Down syndrome . (And don\u2019t even get me started on how  a mother\u2019s womb is the most\u00a0dangerous\u00a0place in the world for a child with Down syndrome .) Just to give you an idea of how bad things are: \u201cIn Maine, 42 percent of people shot by police since 2000 had [special needs], according to the Portland Press Herald. And 58 percent of those who died from their injuries were mentally disabled. \n A research team at John Moores University discovered that 24 percent of [special needs] adults in developed countries have been a victim of some form of violence in the year 2011.\u201d What?!! 24% of adults with\u00a0special\u00a0needs have been a\u00a0victim\u00a0of violence??\u00a0 This has to stop!\u00a0 I pray often for God to change the hearts of people in this world, and that all people would see children like my son as valuable and worthy of love and respect. I pray for our leaders, and educators, and other people in position of\u00a0authority\u00a0to step up and protect people like my son. It breaks my heart to see people that are paid by our tax dollars abusing their power and doing the exact opposite of what they swore they would do. I wonder if they stopped and thought about how that man they were holding down on the ground and\u00a0suffocating,\u00a0had a mom and a dad who loved him\u00a0dearly? \u00a0A mom and dad who no longer have their son on this earth\u00a0because\u00a0he was taken from them by the hands of the crooked cops. God\u2019s grace is big. Even big enough to forgive the police\u00a0involved\u00a0in this man\u2019s death. I didn\u2019t write this post for some sort of online\u00a0revenge. (I do, however, hope these men are held accountable for their crimes.) I wrote this post to shine a light on these injustices, and to once again proclaim my commitment to trying to help put a dent in the\u00a0occurrence\u00a0of these\u00a0tragedies. This has to stop!

{"date": ",July,14,2013", "body": "This weekend we were invited by  Sea World San Antonio \u00a0to come check out their park (which has an awesome new water park!) and to learn about their special needs discount program. I had no idea Sea World offered discounts to families with children raising special needs, but they do, and it\u2019s a great deal. Here are some of the details: Sea World San Antonio Special Needs Discount Program Just as a quick disclaimer, I\u2019m not sure if these discounts apply to all Sea Worlds or just the location in San Antonio, but if you\u2019re not in San Antonio it\u2019s certainly worth giving your location a call and asking them about discounts to families with children with special needs. SeaWorld San Antonio offers a 50% off discount on one-day admissions for our disabled/special needs guests and one (1) companion/chaperone (per disabled guest). Disabled/special needs guest is defined as anyone who is mentally or physically challenged, deaf, or blind. Pretty awesome deal, huh? Noah\u2019s Epic First Time At Sea World This was Noah\u2019s first time at Sea World, and as you can see in the pictures below he had a great time! If you\u2019ve been following our story for a while you may remember Noah\u2019s  first interaction with a sea creature  (a dolphin) didn\u2019t go all to well. However we found that Noah enjoyed the whales (from a distance) much better than the dolphins (up close!)   \u00a0\u00a0         The great thing about Sea World is that it\u2019s much more than just animal shows, in fact this Sea World had and an entire kids area and a water park! This was a big day for Noah since he got to ride his  very first ride!  (His dad is a huge fan of theme parks, so this kid is in for a life time of roller coaster rides, that\u2019s for sure!) I  \u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the rides and animals shows, Sea Word also has an awesome \u201cElmo Rocks\u201d show located in their  Sesame Street Bay of Play area . I know some children with special needs are sensitive to loud music and bright lights, but Noah seems to enjoy them (especially the bright lights of  Times Square! ) At the end of the day we also took the time to (sort of) climb up one of these rope walls (which I totally forget how much they hurt your knees and feet\u2026I mean seriously, why do kids like to play on these things?!) We had a great time at Sea World, and if you are near one I think it\u2019s a great place to visit with your family. The one in San Antonino that we visited is especially awesome since it also has an incredible water park attached to it (not to mention the discount they give to families raising children with special needs.) I know we will certainly be brining Noah back! I\u2019ve also heard great things about  Morgan\u2019s Wonderland  (a theme park for specifically designed for children with special needs which is also in San Antonino) and plan on taking him there some day as well.

{"date": ",June,8,2012", "body": "While I was studying for the Pediatric Board exam only one question I studied remains with me; If language development is delayed or hindered due to other motor delays such as apraxia, then problem-solving is the best indicator of intelligence. I have clung to that statement because I know that Noah\u2019s language will be delayed; so I look for his ability to problem-solve every day. Actions speak louder than words,\u00a0literally. There are various aspects of development and one of those is  cognitive development \u00a0which includes problem-solving as well as language.  Problem-solving is the manipulation of objects to achieve a specific goal . Noah has figured out that by using his very flexible lower extremities that he can get things that are out of reach. Pretty cute right? We thought so. His curiosity and exploration of his world continues to amaze us. Cognitive development starts when a child is born. Some very smart people with PhD\u2019s and MD\u2019s have done the research to see how we can monitor cognitive development from the very first few weeks of life. \u00a0The very first sign is with a child\u2019s eyes.  Tracking  is one of the very first  milestones  your baby will achieve. They will follow faces, followed by objects. \u00a0We have talked previously about how we waited patiently, ok, maybe  not  so patiently for Noah to stare at us.  Typical  babies are able to do this almost at birth, where as children with  Down syndrome \u00a0it may take a few weeks. Don\u2019t let low\u00a0muscle\u00a0tone get in the way of your little\u00a0genius! Cognitive development often has to wait for the body to catch up with  gross  and  fine motor skills . From gaining head control to look around, to being able to lift a hand to bat at an object or bring it to their mouth; attaining the strength to do these things limits further development. One of the important things in helping children with Down syndrome develop is to make adaptations so they can continue to explore and develop all of their needed skills. Take for example laying them on their sides to bat at objects so they don\u2019t have to work against gravity. This is why  early intervention  is so important as all of development works together and delays in one area can filter into others. Catching your child putting their\u00a0intelligence\u00a0on\u00a0display. The best part about today is that no one taught Noah how to do this, he just figured it out. \u00a0His goal was to get one of his favorite  toys  and once he figured out how to grab it with his feet when it was out of reach, he kept doing it over and over again. The definition of intelligence is  the ability to learn, understand or deal with new situations . I think Noah proved he has a bit of intelligence today. \ud83d\ude42 Take some time this week to watch your children at play and see if you can catch your child putting their\u00a0intelligence\u00a0on display by solving a problem in a creative, child-like way! I think you\u2019ll be amazed at what you\u2019ll  catch  your child doing. \ud83d\ude42 What ways have you observed your child  showing off  their intelligence lately?

{"date": ",June,9,2012", "body": "I seriously love every second of being a dad. If only I could freeze time\u2026 There are so many moments throughout the day that make me wish I could touch my fingers together and freeze time like Evie could\u00a0on  Out of This World . (Yelp, I\u00a0totally\u00a0just dated myself by making a referenceto that show, but I don\u2019t care; that show was awesome! I mean seriously, the internet wasn\u2019t even around yet, and her dad lived in a glass cube\u2026and carried moon beams home in a jar. How awesome is that!) But seriously, I\u2019m in awe of our little man; watching him grow and develop\u00a0fascinates\u00a0me to no end. I love learning something new about our son every day. Rather it be a new (and usually funny) facial expression, watching him achieve one of his  developmental milestones , or just sitting back and\u00a0observing\u00a0him interacting with his\u00a0environment.\u00a0No matter what, I can\u2019t get enough. I\u2019m hooked on watching this little boy become who God has created him to be. \u00a0 It\u2019s fun being a parent! If only I had a time machine\u2026 \u00a0 When Noah was  born  I knew very little about  Down syndrome . In fact, pretty much everything I did know,\u00a0I learned from  watching TV \u00a0which meant I had a lot of  parenting fears  that would never come true. One of my the biggest ones was that\u00a0Noah was never going to be able to interact and play with me; you know, like a  typical  child. Yelp, I\u2019ll make another 80\u2019s reference, and say I wish I had a time machine like Marty McFly on Back to the Future! Then I could go back in time and tell my sacred self what it would be like raising a child with Down syndrome only 11 months later. \ud83d\ude42 As you can see in today\u2019s video (if you\u2019re reading this by RSS or email be sure to click the link to check out the post and watch / listen to today\u2019s video) Noah is  super interactive !\u00a0Not only is he\u00a0interactive, but he\u2019s displaying another example of\u00a0his\u00a0intelligence\u00a0by  solving problems  in creative ways. \u00a0 Problem:   He can\u2019t find his daddy (there\u2019s a rubber ball in front of him.) Solution:   Move that ball, and get to daddy (and then laugh as adorable as\u00a0posable!) Pretty smart for an 11 month old, huh? Down syndrome or not. \ud83d\ude42 The fear fades to joy\u2026pretty fast! If you\u2019ve come across this blog and you\u2019re a  new or expecting parent of a child Down syndrome , you probably have some fears and worries about what the future may hold. You may even be scared that your child won\u2019t play, laugh, and have fun with you like a  typical  child. You may even think having a child with Down syndrome means you\u2019re going to miss out on many of the father / son\u00a0moments you had\u00a0imagined\u00a0before\u00a0receiving\u00a0a Down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis. If that\u2019s you, let me just encourage you with this;  fear fades to joy very quickly  for almost everyone I\u2019ve meet that has raised a child with Down syndrome. Things most likely will be ok. You will almost certainly have  decades of fun  in your house. \u00a0 And\u2026if your child isn\u2019t laughing yet, or you\u2019re still having a hard time turn the volume up on today\u2019s video (and play it on repeat if you have to) and know that one day all of those tears that may be streaming from your face today, will one day be replaced with the joyous sounds of laughter. And let me tell you, it\u2019s a sweet, sweet sound. \ud83d\ude42 One more thing, if you are a new parent be sure to check out the over 300 responses on  what to say to someone who has just\u00a0received\u00a0a Down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis . I think you\u2019ll find that my experience isn\u2019t unique. There are thousands of families who will say the exact same. \ud83d\ude42 If you\u2019re a parent, what\u2019s one thing you wish you could go back and tell yourself when you first had your child?

Not by a long shot. As you can see in today\u2019s video, our little boy is sort of like the Energizer Bunny. He keeps going, and going, and going\u2026.and going!\u00a0An hour or so after lying him down I went in to check on him, expecting him to be  sleeping like a baby , but boy was I wrong. Instead of sleeping, he decided bedtime would be a\u00a0great\u00a0time to work on his  core muscles . So there he was trying to pull himself up on his crib. It\u2019s so cute watching him try so hard. This little boy is so tough, and I couldn\u2019t be more  proud  to be his daddy. I love this kid! But it\u2019s all good, I don\u2019t mind at all.

Not entirely sure about the physical\u00a0therapy\u00a0dog. 4. Holding his own bottle! As we mentioned the other day, we tried  lots of bottles  before finding the one that worked best. But what\u2019s funny is Noah really likes to use these little \u201ccheapy\u201d bottles as opposed to some of the more expensive bottles. We don\u2019t mind\u00a0because\u00a0they are a.) cheaper and b.) we get to watch him hold his own bottle. And man, oh man, it\u2019s cute! 5. Work hard. Play harder! There I was playing in the floor with our son, laughing and having a good time, and then all of a sudden\u2026.HE\u2019S OUT! Yelp, out like a light\u2026or so I thought. 6. Working out at the gym\u2026in his crib! Our son really has gotten his money\u2019s worth out of his crib. Not only does he like to sleep in it, but he has\u00a0turned\u00a0it into his on personal home baby gym. I\u2019ve already\u00a0caught\u00a0him turning it into a  crawling exercise\u00a0machine , and\u00a0tonight\u00a0he magically\u00a0transformed it\u00a0into a pull up machine. You see what I mean? After a long day, he wants to keep going\u2026and going\u2026and going\u2026.! \ud83d\ude42 This kid works (and plays) hard!

{"date": ",July,12,2013", "body": "As some of you (especially those of you follow our story on  Facebook ) may remember about a year ago Noah took his first steps! I was lucky enough to not be there \ud83d\ude41 I was hanging out with my family in Colorado for a brief visit so of course Noah thought that was a good time to try out this  major milestone . Thanks to technology I was able to witness it via FaceTime, and over and over again thanks to video. The Journey Towards Learning How To Walk I have realized walking is definitely a journey and not a firm milestone that all of a sudden happens one day. We are not going to claim Noah as a walker on this day, he is actually has a little ways to go before making that declaration. However, so many activities have led to this awesome moment and we will  celebrate  it. We have been working on his  core strength  practically since he was born which is essential in all milestones. He has gone from  sitting  to  pulling up to stand , to  crawling  and then  creeping . \u00a0He has been strengthening his legs as well. \u00a0He have also been working on the  treadmill  helping him learn the pattern of walking. Stages Of Walking Noah has been going through the stages of pre-walking as well. He will walk while holding two hands and will cruise along furniture. He is also a big fan of  push toys . Today Noah is doing what I would call controlled falling and Patricia Winders refers to as lunging steps. At this time he is not quite strong enough to walk while holding one hand only, he is also not standing up on his own without support. We have talked about how Noah does not like to bend his legs and that is one reason he is not able to stand on his own in the middle of a room. I don\u2019t see Noah really walking on his own until he is able to do this important step. He will stand without support once he is placed in that position, but the kid fall right on over when he tries to get to that position on his own. You can see that Noah does not have a lot of balance and he is basically falling forward while taking steps at the same time and lunging towards his destination. He gets pretty excited and his head movements are not helping him either. Motivators For Helping A Child Born With Down Syndrome Learn To Walk A good way to practice lunging steps is to find the right  motivator . Noah is a mover and he is definitely motivated to get from one place to another especially if that location contains an awesome toy or in this case an awesome parent. Finding the right motivator for your child will help encourage them to move from one place to the other. Putting a motivator on a couch and having your child lunge towards that or having them lunge between parents help practice this skill. It helps them get used to the feeling of going forward and eventually catching themselves with their feet so that they will continue on towards walking. As you can tell form the joyous screaming by my husband in today\u2019s video, we are super proud of our little boy! Is your child walking yet? If so how old was your child when they took their first steps? What did it look like? (Bonus points for sharing a video / picture in the comments below.)

{"date": ",February,11,2013", "body": "Noah took his first steps on the  gait trainer  back in December. Do you remember how slow and timid he was? Things have definitely changed with that. He is a speed racer today and knocking into things for fun (typical boy). We don\u2019t use the gait trainer that frequently, but we have come back to it as  Noah is getting closer to walking on his own! Look at those little feet go! When we first started, Noah was barely putting weight on his legs and had just learned to  pull to stand . Currently at this stage he is walking when holding two hands and is cruising with two hands on furniture. Per  Patricia Winders , you should start using a  push toy  when your child can step well with two-hand support. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say Noah steps well\u2026 He leads with his head followed by his belly which is a nice recipe to fall flat on your face. \u00a0I think it may be that he is so excited to get to his new location he flings himself forward (can\u2019t you tell by the expression on his face in the video when he breaks free?) He\u2019s definitely an explorer! This little boy is an explorer! Activities For Pre-Walking Here are a few activities anyone can do at home (for free!) with their child before they start taking their first steps. These exercises \u00a0can easily be worked into things your child is probably already doing (or trying) to do as they play around your house. 1. Standing We have been working on a few things to help Noah prepare to walk. We are wanting him to play in standing as well as stand with his back against a wall. When his back is to the wall we will have him reach for different things on either side. \u00a0This helps develop strength in those muscles needed for walking including the rotation of the body that is needed for balance. 2. Climbing We have also been letting him climb to work on  core strength  as well as building strength in extremity muscles needed for walking. Noah  climbs up the stairs  as if it is the best adventure in the house. He has also started climbing on things like our gates, toys, window sills, and furniture. As much as it gives me a heart attack how can you be mad when he attains such an awesome skill. \u00a0It is also a skill we have not had to encourage much on our own, he gets into trouble all on his own. \u00a0Noah loves to climb! \u00a0The furniture is going to need to be attached to the wall for sure. 3. Cruising Look at this little boy cruise! We also encourage him to cruise. He is sticking to the two hand approach right now, but we are trying to get him to hold our hand and then keep one hand on the item used for cruising. \u00a0He is not as interested in this method of transportation right now. What I Wish We Worked On More: Squatting Looking back the one thing I wished I had worked on more was  Noah\u2019s quadricep strength . This kid won\u2019t squat for anything. His lack of strength in this muscle has affected his balance most of all. He tries to stand with straight legs which may be the most difficult route he can come up with. \u00a0When he sits down, he also keeps his legs straight for a giant plop. He has no interest in bending those knees. One way to work on this is to have them sit on a box that puts their legs at a 90 degree angle and practice standing up from that position, your leg (depending on your size) may be an excellent option as well. I firmly believe that once the kid figures out this he will be a walking pro.  Anyone else have crazy climbers in their house? \u00a0Any tips for keeping your kid safe? Has your child tried any of these pre-walking activities? Leave a comment below and tell us about it.

{"date": ",August,8,2012", "body": "I\u2019m a  huge fan  of the Big Apple. Without a doubt it\u2019s one of my favorite places in the world to visit. My brain really enjoys all of the \u00a0stimulation New York feeds it, and I actually find a lot of beauty in landscape; it makes me think much about the One who is the real creative genius behind all that you see there, but that\u2019s a different post\u2026 (My wife, on the other hand, would trade a trip to NYC for a  relaxing week at the beach  any day of the week. We\u2019re different like that, and it works.) \ud83d\ude42 It\u2019s been my dream to take Noah to New York one day, and we actually had a trip planned to visit even before our Target post went  viral . However, it\u2019s cool how things work out sometimes. As you\u2019ll see in a few posts, we ended up becoming friends with Ryan (the child with  Down syndrome  that appeared in the Target ad) and his family and it turns out they actually live in the New York area. So we were excited to get to spend some time with them on our trip. And we\u2019re off! I remember the last time I was in New York. My wife was sill pregnant with Noah, and I couldn\u2019t stop imagining how awesome it was going to be when I got to bring my son to this incredible place for the first time. I\u00a0thought about the plane ride, and how excited he\u2019d be the entire time, and how he  wouldn\u2019t be able to wait  to finally step off that plane and see New York for the first time\u2026! \u00a0As you can see, that dream really didn\u2019t come true. Ha,ha! (In my imagination he was a little older than 12 months!) However, he was pretty excited about snacking on the sky mall\u2026 I thought about his first taxi ride into the city, and how his wide eyes would be when he crossed over that bridge and saw the New York City skyline for the first time. (In my imagination he was tall enough to actually see over the seat\u2026) However as you saw in the video he did enjoy a nice bottle of milk on his way into the city! One cute bear, and one large city! We got to our hotel a little late so we didn\u2019t have a lot of time to do explore, but we wanted to eat, and I wanted to take Noah to Times Square for the first time. Being that it is winter in NYC it was pretty cold we bundled Noah up like a cuddly little bear (talk about an oxymoron) and headed down stairs. I wondered what it would be like when Noah saw the bright lights of Times Square for the first time. Well, I didn\u2019t have to wonder any longer. It was awesome seeing his eyes fill with wonder and curiosity as took it all in. It really was a dream come true for me! There are no words to describe how much I love this lady and this little boy! I know some children with Down syndrome don\u2019t do well around a lot of bright and loud stimulation, and you may wondering how Noah handled Times Square. I have to say he really enjoyed it. In fact, he\u2019s always been a fan of bright and shiny toys. The brighter, and louder, the better. As he grows up it\u2019ll be interesting to see if this stays the same, and how he\u2019ll react to large crowds. It\u2019s to early to tell that now, although I have noticed that even though Noah is a very  energetic \u00a0little boy he has the tendency to get shy around people sometimes\u2026but who doesn\u2019t? After walking around for a little bit we took Noah into one of my favorite places in New York,  The Times Square Toys R Us , although not as awesome as my  favorite toy story  in the city, we still had a blast! It was getting late and by the time we made it to dinner (NYC Pizza!) our cute little bear, was beary tired. \ud83d\ude42 We passed through Times Square on the way back to our hotel, and even all the lights and sounds of Times Square couldn\u2019t wake Noah up. This kid\u2019s one beary sound sleeper! (ok, ok, I\u2019ll stop!) And by the time we made it back to our hotel he was 100% out and ready for a fun filled weekend! We had a blast in New York and can\u2019t wait to share the rest of our trip with you guys. Have you ever taken your child to Times Square (or another busy place) if so what did they think about it the first time they saw it? What is one of your favorite places to go visit, either by yourself, or with the family? How does your child like places with a lot of stimulation? Are the fans, are not so much?

{"date": ",October,8,2012", "body": "Today\u2019s post is long, but I hope it is helpful and makes a difference in someone\u2019s life as I feel it is something that is often missed in children with\u00a0 Down syndrome . The majority of pediatricians follow the\u00a0 guidelines for health maintenance for children with Down syndrome . Seizures are listed as something to look out for, however us \u201csmart doctors\u201d think it is a hard diagnosis to miss. I mean who wouldn\u2019t realize a child was having a seizure, right? Wrong. I was not aware how common seizures were in children with Down syndrome prior to Noah being born (seizures occurs in 8-10% of\u00a0children\u00a0with Down syndrome) but we have come to know several families that are dealing with this diagnosis. It has broken my heart how long it has taken some of them to get a diagnosis hence the reason I knew this post needed to be written. Infantile spasms (also known as West syndrome) is not a new diagnosis to me as I have dealt with it in residency as well as in my current practice. I think it is an\u00a0 easily missed \u00a0diagnosis in children with Down syndrome as their development and sometimes other medical conditions skew the picture. However, if your doctor has it on their radar it can lead to a much earlier diagnosis. It was on my radar for Noah and he did some things that made me worry that brought us to a neurologist ourselves. (Be sure to watch today\u2019s video located at the top of this post so you can just how\u00a0scary\u00a0Noah\u2019s behavior looked.) 3\u00a0Symptoms\u00a0Pediatricians\u00a0Are Looking For In Order To\u00a0Diagnose\u00a0Your Child Infantile Spasms Infantile spasms have\u00a0 three very specific symptoms \u00a0for diagnosis. \n You have a brief spasm that looks like a contraction or arching of the torso with stiffening of the extremities. It is often described like a hiccup and that is about how long the spasm lasts. They usually come in clusters, and can appear painful and cause the child to cry. \n They are associated with developmental regression meaning that\u00a0 milestones \u00a0that your child used to have are no longer there, such as not being able to crawl or sit up anymore. The child is usually less interactive and grumpy with this regression. \n An Electroencephalogram (EEG) shows brain waves called hypsarrythmia. \n Sometimes What Looks Like Infantile Spasms, Isn\u2019t. Looks scary, huh? Noah started having some strange movements most commonly after he was done eating, but also at other times. It had been going on for several weeks but was becoming more frequent. He would make a grimace and stiffen up his body. They only lasted a few seconds and he would go back to normal. He actually would find them humorous. It looked like a spasm to my eyes however Noah has never had developmental regression and continued to be very happy and engaged with us, which reassured me that this was not infantile spasms. That doesn\u2019t mean that we didn\u2019t want to verify that. We took a video of the episodes and showed our awesome\u00a0 pediatrician . (Bonus tip: if your child is doing something weird always take a video as it will never happen in the doctor\u2019s office). She agreed with me that they looked like a spasm, however he didn\u2019t fit the requirements for infantile spasms like I mentioned above. She referred us to a neurologist and we were set up for an EEG just to be safe. Off to the Neurologist we go. I wanted to share our experience with taking Noah to the neurologist just in case you may ever find yourself their, you\u2019ll know what to expect. What\u2019s An Electroencephalogram (EEG) Like? The room where the EEG is preformed is actually pretty nice. It\u2019s like a mini motel room. You\u2019ll be able to hang out in the room with your child, cuddle with them, etc. Waiting for the EGG. The initial EEG is only 1 hour and you need to have one tired child on your hands. Seizures are most likely to occur in the transition to sleep especially when you are sleep deprived. We put Noah to sleep late, woke him up early and denied him his morning nap. Doesn\u2019t that sound like fun? I love this little boy. Setting up for the EEG is the worst part, it involves a lot of electrodes placed on the head with gel, tape, and some gauze. Noah was not a fan, neither were his parents.Once we were done with that part, Noah was able to calm down and tolerate his new \u201chat\u201d. None of this was painful, just annoying. \u201cI\u2019d rather be watching cartoons!\u201d \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look my bedroom!\u201d \u201cUmmm\u2026daddy; what\u2019s on my head?\u201d The first few minutes of the EEG were spent trying to cause a seizure with lights flashing rapidly and then they wanted Noah to sleep, which was easy considering how tired he was. \u00a0It felt like hours had passed before it was over. We watched TV, played on our phones, and watched our little man sleep. FInally it was over. The results were sent to our neurologist who we would follow up with that afternoon. Noah and his dad cuddling during the EGG. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have all of that gunk out of my hair!\u201d From The EEG To The\u00a0Neurologist. We were able to immediately meet with our neurologist after the EEG which may not be a common occurrence. He had read the EEG and the good news is that he did not show signs of hypsarrythmia or any other sign of seizure.\u00a0 Whew\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6that was a relief. \u00a0Just of note: a normal 1 hour EEG\u00a0 does not \u00a0mean that your child does not have seizures, especially if the events you are concerned about did not happen during that period. \u00a0Hypsarrythmia is something that can be seen outside of the spasms and not just during a spasm so if it is not seen during your 1 hour EEG there is a good chance it is not present despite not having an event. If you are still concerned, keep pressing on for further evaluation. I think the neurologist may have thought that we were really there to figure out how smart Noah was going to be, as he kept telling us over and over there is no way to predict how our kid would end up\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6thanks Dr. Neurologist that wasn\u2019t why we were there, we were just a little worried that our son was having seizures.\u00a0 \u00a0He stated that if the episodes got worse we should follow up. Usually the second EEG lasts 24 hours and is done in the hospital where your child is monitored the entire time and you click a button when your child has the events you are concerned about. He gave us reassurance that Noah was doing great plus some developmental information on how he was doing, and that ended our very long day. \u201cTime to go home!\u201d \u201cSometimes Kids Just Do Weird Stuff.\u201d Even though I really didn\u2019t think Noah had infantile spasms, it was such a relief to be reassured. Noah continued to do these movements for a few months and they slowly decreased in frequency until they stopped. We have heard a few other people say that their child with Down syndrome started to do similar movement around 12 months of age and resolved after a few months without having developmental regression and if an EEG was done it was normal. So with that being said, even if after reading this you are now concerned that your child is making some strange movements the end result can be\u00a0 nothing to worry about . I don\u2019t know why Noah did these movements, it could have been reflux, getting attention, or something he just figured out to do that was fun, who knows. In fact, my husband asked the\u00a0neurologist\u00a0why he thought Noah was making those strange moments with his body and eyes, and the\u00a0neurologist\u00a0said: \u201cSometimes kids just do weird stuff. It\u2019s normal, and there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d\u00a0 Thanks to\u00a0 Facebook \u00a0we have been able to meet so many great people and heard so many stories. I would like to share the story of a child who really does have infantile spasms and their journey to his diagnosis. An Infantile Spasm Diagnosis: William\u2019s Story \u201cHi, I\u2019m William!\u201d William was found to have Down syndrome prior to being born. His parents did an awesome job at preparing as they spoke to other parents, they joined\u00a0support groups, and they even had an appointment scheduled at the Down syndrome clinic in Boston prior to William even being born. They also knew of some things they needed to prepare for such as a possible ventricular septal defect (VSD) and duodenal atresia. William had surgery within 24 hours of being born and went home about 2 weeks later. He had some other things he dealt with such a severe reflux, and tracheomalacia. He ended up having a Nissen (when they take part of the stomach and wrap it around the esophagus to keep food in the stomach and not up in your nose) which seemed to really help him and he was doing great. This is their story\u00a0 in their words \u00a0after these events. \u00a0I added my own two cents in parenthesis\u00a0 3-7 Months He got a little cold in August, and after that things just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t right. We kept treating him for ear infections. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure if he had them since William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ear canals are so small that the doctors couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see in them. But we treated him for it anyway because he was congested and he was miserable. \u00a0He started to gnaw at one or two of his thumbs in the sides of his mouth as if he was teething, which he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. \u00a0His eyes also began to cross. \u00a0He started to lose the ability to focus on anything. He was withdrawing. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure if he could see. Every once in awhile we noticed he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have periods where it looked like his whole body was clenching. I thought perhaps he was retching. I remember telling the pediatrician he had this weird clenching thing he was doing, and wanted to know if it had to do with the Nissen. \u00a0(Children with a Nissen can\u2019t throw up but retch or go through the movements of throwing up without the end result) Things really started to fall apart. He had been rolling, but he had stopped. He was very grumpy. He stopped smiling. He was just not responding to anyone. He had periods of absolute inconsolability. We thought it was his ears. He couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear anything. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even respond to loud noises. We kept on going to the doctors. We got answers like he was teething, or it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his constipation, or it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an ear infection. All of which may have been true. We saw a local opthamologist with regard to his eyes. He said there was something wrong, but structurally he felt the eyes were fine. So, he sent us to Boston. They confirmed that other than having crossed eyes, structurally his eyes were fine. I was still concerned though about his inability to focus. My friend sent me to see an otolaryngologist at Boston Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Due to fluid in his ears, William had minimal eardrum movement out of one ear, and none out of the other. We were scheduled right away for tubes. After that surgery we were told that he did have conductive hearing loss, but that should go away. He began to hear things, respond to voices and startle with loud noises. But he still never visually focused on anything. Throughout, William was still having these periods of clenching. The only way I can describe it was to say it was as if it were exaggerated hiccups. They were typically when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d wake up from a nap. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d last about 5 minutes (meaning clusters of these clenching episodes), and happen several times a day. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d clench and then relax for about 20 seconds, whimpering in between. 9 Months: Diagnosis William and his buddy! Developmentally, William was regressing. He was still not sitting at 9 months. He lacked trunk control, and was wobbling and jerking. He was having trouble lifting his head during tummy time. He was almost completely withdrawn. After his ear surgery he began sucking on his thumb in the center of his mouth for as much as an hour or more, instead of one or two thumbs in the sides of his mouth for a couple of minutes. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure if it was due to the Down Syndrome or something else. We were frustrated. We finally had our first appointment with the Down Syndrome Clinic in Boston. I had taken a video in November, to try to ask whether he was retching from the Nissen. My husband mentioned we should show it at the Clinic (they knew my tip before I even said it), just one more time to see if they could confirm it was a result of the Nissen or not. (See how there are things going on that can confuse the picture of what really is going on) We saw Dr. Emily Davidson at the Down Syndrome Clinic. We explained our concerns about William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of development. We showed her the video. We told her about these clenching episodes that were happening a few times a day, usually when he wakes up. She knew instantly what it was. She picked up the phone and scheduled an EEG. She told us if it was what she thought it was, and she was pretty sure she was right, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be hospitalized for a few days. She told us that she thought William had something called Infantile Spasms, which is a kind of seizure. The video I showed her of William having a spasm was what she called a classic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Salaam\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Seizure. She said it could explain a lot of the symptoms William was experiencing, including the lack of developmental progression. She said there were two types of treatments. One, ACTH, is very successful with Down Syndrome, would be the likely first line treatment. We went to have the EEG, where all sorts of brain electrodes were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153glued\u00e2\u20ac\u009d onto William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head to track his brain waves. The tech forewarned us that William was not going to like it. He was right. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that it was painful. It just involved a lot of measuring, and putting cold glue on his head. He cried and cried. It worked though because he indicated they want to try to wear them out so they sleep. William slept and they tracked his brain waves. Then the tech woke him up. As if on cue, he had one of his spasms. The neurologist came in and told us that Infantile Spasms had been confirmed. I cried. I was just so relieved we had an answer. We were admitted to Boston Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital in the Neurology ward. William, still wearing his electrodes, was monitored for 24 hours in a special room with a camera. They were watching the hypsarrhythmia, or abnormal brain waves, which cause the Infantile Spasms. Whenever he had an episode of spasms, or a cluster, I had to press a button. We were scheduled for an MRI. After consulting with the physician and Dr. Davidson, we opted NOT to have one. The reason for the MRI is to confirm some sort of brain abnormality or some other reason for the child to have Infantile Spasms. However, the correlation between Infantile Spasms and Down Syndrome is so strong, that typically when a baby comes to them without a Trisomy 21 diagnosis, the first question they ask is if they are they sure the child doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have Down Syndrome. So, the probability of trying to find some other underlying disease causing the Infantile Spasms was highly improbable given we already knew that William has Down Syndrome. Collectively we decided the benefit of having the MRI was smaller than the risk of having William sedated. (I couldn\u2019t agree more with this statement) Treatment Given the success of ACTH with children with Down Syndrome, that was the first line treatment that was decided upon. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expensive. Very expensive. $23,000.00 per vial expensive. Thank goodness the insurance company covered it. They shipped William 3 vials to our home. ACTH is a daily steroid injection. I was informed that how it works is that it releases cortisol from the adrenal gland, which works to reverse the hypsarrhythmia, which causes the seizures. The nurses at Boston Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taught me how to draw the medication up and how to inject William. We practiced with oranges and saline. Before we could leave the hospital, we had to show that we could give William the injections. They showed us how to test William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stool for blood and his urine for glucose as the medication can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and elevation in blood glucose levels (which then end up in the urine) like diabetes. \u00a0The medication can also cause elevated blood pressure, weight gain, and irritability. We were lucky enough to have wonderful roommates at the hospital. Their little girl also had infantile spasms. They were EMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, so they had medical training. They gave us great advice, such as to make sure when we were discharged, that the nurses give us the doses in mL, and not units. They forewarned me about the increased hunger and irritability. Their little girl had reflux with ACTH, which is also common, which adds to the irritability. They told us about the Cushing Syndrome, which is puffiness in the face, which is a result of using a steroid. \u00a0They offered a lot of great advice. My very brave husband gave William his second injection of ACTH, and we were released from the hospital. We have the local VNA coming out twice a week to check his blood pressure, and we are going to see our pediatrician twice a week to check his blood pressure as well as review any issues we might be having. We also had to test his stools for blood and his urine for elevated blood sugar daily. 10 Months At this point, we are done with the month-long treatment of ACTH. William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seizures have decreased in number and severity, but have not gone away completely yet. However, he is also starting to progress developmentally. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting to roll more, pick his head up, smile, and focus on people and things. He recently even giggled for the first time, and now is vocalizing for periods of time. Today William is doing great. \u00a0We are thrilled with his progress since February. Stephen and I are very blessed to have such a supportive family and we have found some wonderful doctors and therapists who keep William progressing and us learning every day. We are especially blessed to be working with Dr. Davidson at Boston Children\u2019s Down Syndrome Clinic. \u00a0We truly believe she saved William with the infantile spasm diagnosis and she is a fantastic support and a wealth of information. Also, William is going to be a big brother soon, how exciting is that? Thanks to William\u2019s mom and dad for sharing their story with our\u00a0community. We hope you found their story helpful and\u00a0encouraging\u00a0 And congrats to William on being a big brother. It sounds like he is going to be a great one!

Developmental regression is a very concerning symptom. Yes you can regress TEMPORARILY when new siblings are born, there are changes at home, or a child is sick. It should never \u00a0be a long lasting condition with more and more milestones lost. This is a\u00a0 huge red flag \u00a0and needs to be investigated by your doctor. You also know your child best and\u00a0 if you think something is going on, push for answers . I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have listened to a parent despite thinking everything was ok only to find out there really was something going on. The only person who will advocate for your child is you, so keep pushing if you are concerned. In the end it will be worth it as either you will get reassurance or finally get the diagnosis you have been looking for. Are there any other parents out there who have dealt with infantile spasms? \u00a0How long did it take to get diagnosed? \u00a0How is your child doing now?

{"date": ",October,11,2012", "body": "Noah has started to mimic our actions recently which is actually a really big  milestone  for a child with  Down syndrome . I mean how cute is he playing patty cake with his occupational\u00a0therapist\u00a0today!? I love it when he points to himself with both thumbs. (By the way, that\u2019s also the sign for \u201cme.\u2019 See, I told you  Signing Time works !) \ud83d\ude42 You can see in yesterday\u2019s post he and his buddy are imitating each other  with their head bobs  which is a  great way  to help a child learn how to imitate, with themselves being imitated (does that sentence even make sense). Our  occupational therapist  tries to encourage mimicking by using songs with hand movements, like pat-a-cake, and a few she may have even made up on her own. I absolutely adore the fact that she sings with Noah (which can help a child improve his\u00a0 verbal\u00a0memory .)\u00a0We say a lot of awesome things about our  physical therapist , but our occupational therapist is  equally as awesome  and I am amazed at the fantastic work she has done with Noah. It took Noah a  very long time  to learn to clap, so we love to use songs that involve some serious clapping for him imitate. Imitation Development Once a child starts to mimic it opens up a whole new area of development and interaction.  Imitation and pretend play  is another area that can be delayed in children with Down syndrome.  Typical  newborns have been shown to imitate their mothers  shortly after birth . There have been  several studies  that show that a newborn will mimic facial expressions such as  tongue protrusion , mouth opening, and pouting practically out of the womb. There are also other beliefs that an infant must be imitated to learn imitation, but I have seen the videos of the first theory so I think being imitated just reinforces the behavior. There are several milestones in the toddler years that involve imitation. \u00a0Several of the fine motor skills are probably best learned by imitation from stacking blocks, using a crayon, and the one I can\u2019t wait for  imitating me cleaning \u2026maybe I have to actually do that for it to happen. \ud83d\ude42 \u00a0Simply being able to use  toys  is enhanced when imitation and pretend play is involved. Motor Imitation Helps Speech Development Imitation can cause a drastic change in a child\u2019s  speech development . One of my favorite resources,\u00a0 Down Syndrome Education International , did an assessment of children with Down syndrome at 2 years old and found that  none of them  had vocal imitation. They taught the children motor imitation such as taping the head, a table, or to clap hands and then they worked on vocal imitation. Each child went on to imitate vocally after learning motor imitation. Once they had learned 3-4 sounds they had generalized vocal imitation meaning they would mimic any sound. So now that Noah is mimicking his motor functions, I hope verbal is soon to follow as currently he is not interested in mimicking sounds, specifically \u201cma ma.\u201d \ud83d\ude42 Imitation As A Learning Method Imitation continues to be important in the future as well, and is one of the reasons we want our children  included  in the classroom. While it may be a struggle to get our children to imitate, it eventually becomes one of their strengths. Our kids will model their behavior after the other children in the classroom and learn how to thrive in the real world and interact with their peers. I even used this method through out my medical training as we often said the phrase  \u201csee one, do one, teach one\u201d  as a way of mastering procedures. I think many of us would say it is much easier to do something after watching someone do it first, and the same will be true for our children. Is your child imitating you yet? \u00a0What are some funny things they have done?

{"date": ",February,1,2013", "body": "\nMy parents were nice enough to invite us to go on vacation with them to the Florida Keys this past summer, I think it had something to do with the cute toddler we would be toting with us.  \u201cOff to Florida we go\u2026.!\u201d We went to the middle of the keys called  Hawk\u2019s Cay . You have seen how much Noah loves his  grandma  and grandpa and the feeling is mutual. They were so excited to spend a long period of time with Noah and experience a lot of firsts with him. \u00a0Plus they were very excited to do things like feed him and change his diaper\u2026..which was a nice break for mom and dad. The view from our balcony! First Flan Noah has been on a few  plane rides  in his life. One thing I have learned is that plane changes are no fun with a baby. We picked a route that made us drive a little farther but involved only one plane. It was well worth it. Rick and I are always up for an adventure and to try something new, so being near Miami we knew we needed to try some Cuban food before getting to our final destination. We were able to find the perfect hole in the wall so that Noah could have his first meal\u2026and his first bite of flan\u2026.while on the vacation. I will admit I  hate  flan, maybe it is the fact that something mushy is covered in a gooey liquid and that kind of grosses me out. My husband however thinks that it is the  best desert known to man! . He only gets to enjoy it in restaurants, so he makes sure to try it out whenever it is on a menu. We somehow found a Cuban restaurant that had flan on the menu, and Rick needed to know if it lived up to its claim of \u201cbest ever\u201d. \u00a0Noah seemed to share his dad\u2019s enthusiasm for flan\u2026they are still out of luck of it ever being made in our house. First Dolphins We spent our first full day at the Dolphin Research Center. This place was pretty awesome when it comes to seeing dolphins. This was probably the best thing we did on vacation. You can be up close with the dolphins all day if you want and they do various shows with a lot of education and research that they have done. \u00a0We even watched a dolphin give a sperm sample\u2026yep you heard that right. (Sorry, no videos or pictures of that\u2026.) We were well prepared and little eyes like Noah\u2019s were turned away. It was pretty crazy, but the dolphin was trained to provide that for  educational purposes . However, I thought the center was good preparation for what my parents had planned for Noah later that afternoon when we got back to our hotel.\u00a0My parents were very excited for Noah to have an up close and personal experience with a dolphin at our hotel. I mean what kid would not want to be face to face with flipper? They are these big, friendly, playful animals of the sea. Well, apparently Noah didn\u2019t get that memo and he thought that it was a big, scary, pop up when you are least expecting it animal with really sharp teeth who was trying to eat him. I will admit that Noah was crying during orientation, likely from sunscreen getting in his eyes, so we were not off to a good start. But as soon as that dolphin shot up in front of him, it was all over and he was in hysterics. We had to pass off the baby and enjoy the experience ourselves. I for one have always been a big fan of dolphins so I thought it was great. Hopefully one day we can convince the little man that they aren\u2019t like sharks and we can go swimming with them in one of our future vacations. As you may have guessed based on my career choice (a pediatrician) I am a bit of a nerd. I actually contemplated being a vet and wanted to work at Sea World one day. I asked the trainer at the dolphin experience what it took to be a trainer and she told me that I had to first get my college degree and then I could come intern\u2026I know I look 12 but really   My husband and family thought it was pretty funny. Did she think I was on Teen Mom? First Turtles \nI found us another nerdy thing to do which was the  Turtle Hospital . I know what you are thinking, how cool is that? I was just as excited as you. It didn\u2019t quite live up to the hype. We did learn a lot about turtles and they were doing \u201cserious\u201d surgery on a turtle while we were there. They had great tanks to get up close with the injured or sick turtles. It was interesting to learn how they help them and how important their ability to dive is. They had to add weights to some turtles to help them lose their buoyancy due to an injury. Noah wanted to help feed them which was pretty cute. Overall it was a good experience and would recommend you check it out, just don\u2019t expect an episode of ER or Grey\u2019s Anatomy. \n First Beach We were not near Key West, in fact it was about an hour away from where we were staying. I was amazed at how large the keys actually were. Despite what you may think the keys are not full of beaches. Our hotel had only a man-made beach surrounding a lagoon they also made. A lot of that is due to the fact that the keys are so narrow. Noah got to ride on his first boat in that lagoon. We wanted Noah to have first first real beach experience and play in the ocean. \u00a0We have played on a  fake beach  before, but we were looking for the real deal. Luckily we were able to do that before our trip was over at  Sombrero Beach . Noah didn\u2019t quite know what to do with the sand that stuck to his hands, but he did enjoy the waves. Once his grandpa started turning over sand buckets for him to smash Noah thought it was pretty cool. \u00a0He also liked walking in the water holding our hands. The resistance of the water helped hold him up. He made it the farthest he ever has with walking while holding our hands. \u00a0Looking back he also made his longest sitting record while sitting in the sand (even breaking his previous  sitting record !)\u2026maybe I should open up a PT program on the beach. There was lots of good seafood, and great times at our hotel. I know that grandma and grandpa enjoyed being able to hang out with our family and get some down time.

If you have one in your area I\u00a0highly\u00a0suggest checking it out. The best to describe it is sort of the \u201c Subway \u00a0of pizzas.\u201d You walk to the pizza bar and pick out the various toppings you want on your pizza, and they cook it right in front of you.

{"date": ",September,18,2012", "body": "I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how fun it is to watch Noah grow and develop. He is currently in a stage where he\u2019s\u00a0picking\u00a0up on cause and effect, and I love it! I think the first time I noticed him starting to understand that he had the ability to\u00a0 cause something\u00a0 to\u00a0happen\u00a0himself was one day while watching him play with his\u00a0 toy gum ball machine . (One of our\u00a0 favorite developmental toys !) He would put the balls in the top of the\u00a0gum ball\u00a0machine, press the lever on the side of the toy, and watch the ball come\u00a0twirling\u00a0down. (And his face would light up every. single. time\u2026.just like it was the first time he ever saw it. It was fantastic!) He\u2019s got this cause and effect thing down! For Christmas we got him a\u00a0 Busy Ball Drop \u00a0(what you see him playing with in today\u2019s video.) In less than two months he had already learned how to put the ball in the top, watch it spin down the ramp, and repeat. It is a lot of fun to watch his face light up with joy as the ball shoots down the ramp. I also love the sense of\u00a0accompaniment\u00a0on his face\u00a0afterwards. He could totally tell that he was doing something\u00a0 awesome , and making us very\u00a0 proud \u00a0in the process! (Did you notice in the video that every time he would\u00a0successfully\u00a0get the ball from the top of the ramp, to the bottom, he would glance up and look to his mommy for approval; cute, huh?) Days like today are what I call a \u201cbig win.\u201d But as I\u2019ve mentioned before, most of life isn\u2019t made up of \u201cbig win\u201d kind of days. (Wouldn\u2019t that be awesome!) The truth is most days we need to look for\u00a0 small wins to celebrate \u00a0with our kids. I 100% believe that celebrating those small wins, is what\u00a0motivates\u00a0our kids to make the big wins. And if you really think about it, the same is true for you and I. People long to be validated. To be told \u201cYou\u2019re doing a great job,\u201d \u201cI believe in you,\u201d or \u201cYou can do it!\u201d \u201cMommy, did you see that!?\u201d\u00a0 I meet a lot of parents who are great at telling their children what they are\u00a0 doing wrong , but seldom celebrate what they are dong right. Then they wonder why their children don\u2019t seem to be\u00a0motivated\u00a0to ever do anything great (I\u2019ve worked with a lot of teenagers and their parents.) There were a lot of days where Noah tried to put the ball in the ramp, and was\u00a0unsuccessful. And Guess what? If you would have walked by our house on any one of those days you would have thought we were watching the Superbowl the way we were cheering him on. We weren\u2019t cheering\u00a0because\u00a0he didn\u2019t do it\u00a0 right;\u00a0 we were cheering him on\u00a0because\u00a0he made a step towards doing it right\u2026.and want to be the kind of family that celebrates each step. So today, no matter how\u00a0hectic\u00a0it is, I want to encourage you to\u00a0 catch \u00a0your children doing something good\u2026and tell them about it. Deal?

Noah had been going through a phase at the time of realizing that people\u00a0were strangers\u00a0and crying more than usual, while Enzo was just relaxing and enjoying the atmosphere. The biggest challenge was trying to get two happy babies to look at the camera at the same time\u2026then we started adding adults and it just got worse  Enzo\u2019s Entourage We met up in Miami at an outdoor mall that just happened to be playing some awesome music. Enzo definitely showed off his dance moves. One of the cool facts about this family is that they have since gone on to start their own awareness about Down syndrome in their own way.  Enzo\u2019s Entourage  is a twitter feed that gives updates about Enzo and what he is doing, as well as fun facts about Down syndrome. You can also follow them on Facebook and Instagram. They may even inspire you to start running as I think they are involved in races every other weekend. It is also very cool to see Enzo at swim lessons where he is working on his abs of steel, as well as swimming under water! It makes me want to get Noah in some swim lessons this summer. It is just another way families like you are helping others understand more about Down syndrome. Your Story Is Important You have heard us talk about  how important your story is , and how your story can touch someone else\u2019s life. The internet is a big place and while you may not feel a connection to our story, we hope you find a connection somewhere. You may find another story that is similar to yours and build relationships despite being miles a part. This journey is so much more fun when you realize you are not alone but that other people are out there going through similar circumstances. You can get ideas, be inspired, and may even learn something new. We have complied a list of  Down syndrome blogs  for you to check out and meet other families raising children with Down syndrome as well!  Hopefully that was not the last time we see Enzo in person, but for now it was a brief visit. I think next time we should go to Disney World.

{"date": ",January,1,2013", "body": "Happy New Year! Here\u2019s to a great 2013! It\u2019s hard to believe 2012 has come and gone. Is it just me or do the years seem to\u00a0seriously\u00a0 fly by  once you become a parent?! If your family\u2019s anything like ours there\u2019s so much happening in the course of every day life that it can be challenging to find the time to pause and take a few minutes stop and reflect on how things are going. The good. The bad. And just life in general. As hard as it is to find the time, it\u2019s always a good idea to take a moment to pause and reflect on the blessings and challenges of the past, and the hopes, dreams, and goals of the future. And the start of a new year is a  perfect time  to carve out a little time to do just that. I thought I\u2019d take a few minutes to publicly reflect on our own journey this past year. Spoiler Alert: 2012 Was An Epic Year For Our Family! \nHave you ever had one of those years that couldn\u2019t be described any other way but  epic ? Well that\u2019s how I feel about 2012\u2026epic! I accomplished one of the  greatest goals of my entire life , watched my son achieve some  incredible milestones , had a total blast being a 2nd year dad, and to cap off the year I started a new job working along side one of my life long heroes. 2012 truly was epic. Let me share a few of the highlights. The Target Blog Post That Went Viral 2012 started off with a huge bang due to a  blog post  I wrote the first week of January that ended up going viral\u2026.every since I hit the publish button on that cold January day the first week\u00a0of 2012,\u00a0things\u00a0haven\u2019t slowed down! I remember it like it was yesterday. I was sitting at my local Starbucks enjoying a large house coffee and trying to bang out some words to express how I felt about seeing a young model with  Down syndrome  in the Sunday Target ad. I finished up the post. Hit publish. Closed my laptop. Made a face as I took that last gulp of lukewarm coffee and filled my mouth full of those bitter coffee grinds at the bottom of the cup. And headed home. No big deal. Turns out it ended up being a  very big deal . By the time I made it home the post had already started going viral, and by the time I woke up the next morning the post was in full viral viralness. It was crazy. We had multiple news crews at our home. We quickly learned that you have to be very careful what you say on tv. We gave several  live interviews  including one on  HLN . Noah\u2019s picture ended up on  Time.com . And we ended up meeting, and becoming friends, with the boy model with Down Syndrome that we saw the Target ad and his family. (And they are super awesome!) You can read more of the story behind how that  one blog post helped millions of people learn about Down syndrome  you\u2019d like but there are a couple of things about that post I want you to know: \n I had  nothing  to do with it. Sure, I wrote the words, and hit the publish button, but other than that it was all God. I don\u2019t like to over\u00a0spiritualize\u00a0things, but I\u2019m telling you, there is no way I could have made something like that happen own my own. The only  bragging  I can do is brag on how\u00a0awesome\u00a0God is that He can do something as awesome as choosing to use a simple blog post to help get the topic of Down syndrome and personhood in front of millions of people. I mean wow\u2026.just wow! \n I was thankful that it was used to help spark conversations all over the world about \u00a0Down syndrome as the post was mentioned in numerous publications worldwide. \n I am blown away by the incredible community that formed around this blog, and our  Facebook page , as a result of that post. We\u2019ve met so many awesome friends as a result of people finding us by hearing about that post. Not only that, but many other people have developed friendships with other parents raising a child with Down syndrome in places all over the world! \n I think that\u2019s an  incredible example  of how technology, and more specifically social networks, can be used to do amazing things! I seriously love that! The Rest Of The Year (or) Roller Coaster, Whoo Hoo\u2026.. After that post things went crazy (in a good way.) The purpose of our site is  to give the world a window into the life of a family raising a child with Down syndrome by posting daily, one minute, videos . Well, up until that post we we were really on top of this\u2026then things sort of went down hill.  We got super behind on the  videos , and we\u2019re still trying to get caught up to \u201creal time\u201d on our videos\u2026which we actually do plan on doing, hopefully soon! We\u2019re going to pick some selected videos from each month to help us get caught up, so don\u2019t be surprised if you see Noah  growing up  super fast in the videos we\u2019re about to start posting.  Not only did we get behind on the blog, but I was in my last semester of graduate school when that Target post went viral and on one hand I really needed to finish up my Master\u2019s degree, but on the other hand I  really wanted  to help do what I could to help bring more awareness to Down syndrome while I had the chance (and at the same time be a daddy, a husband, help get Noah to all of his weekly therapy visits, etc\u2026)  To say it was difficult would be a massive understatement. But by the grace of God I ended up  finally completing my Master\u2019s degree . You\u2019d have to know me personally to know how big of a deal this all was, and how unlikely I, of all people, should have ever went to college\u2026must less complete a Master\u2019s Degree! There area no words to describe how I felt the day I walked across that stage. I\u2019m not even sure words are needed, just a thankful heart to The One who can do things with our life we never thought we could. Oh and not only that, a few months after I\u00a0finished\u00a0up, I ended up going to work for (better yet, with) one of my life long\u00a0heroes who also\u00a0happened\u00a0to be one of the main reasons I was even in grad school in the first place. In fact when I wrote  this post , I had no idea I\u2019d actually be working for him a few months later. Life (or should I say, God) is crazy (in a good way) like that sometimes. I just want to encourage any of you out there who want to do something great with you life\u2026..just go for it! The odds may be stacked against you, but God loves bad odds. Trust me. Better yet, trust Him. Our Son, The (Free) Traveler We did lots of traveling this year, and it turns out Noah is a great little expeditionist! It was a ton of fun taking Noah to  New York for the first time . There\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s my favorite city on Earth, and I look forward to lots and lots of trips to NYC with my little boy! But not only did he go to New York, he got his picture on  a billboard in Times Square !!! I mean seriously, how epic is that!!! Noah also went to Key West for a little time at the beach, and we found out that Noah\u2019s  not a fan of dolphins . Like not at all.  I\u2019m not sure how many\u00a0frequent\u00a0flyer miles Noah racked up in 2012, but as you can see\u00a0 archives , he was on the move! Sadly, those  moves  will no longer be free. Since Noah turned 2 this year, we now have to pay for his airline tickets. Ouch! It Wasn\u2019t All Peaches, Master\u2019s Degrees, And Roses\u2026. 2012 wasn\u2019t without it\u2019s share of challenges. I never want to give the impression that our life is perfect or immune to difficult circumstances, because it certainly isn\u2019t. We\u2019ve had some personal difficulties on both my wife\u2019s side of the family and my own, including the death of Noah\u2019s Great grandmother (who thankfully he  got to meet  the year before!) Additionally we thought Noah had Leukemia this past summer. It was if time stood still as we waited on the results of his CBC. It turned out he didn\u2019t have cancer, but boy I  sure learned a lot \u00a0by thinking he did. We started off 2012 with Noah having one small \u201chole\u201d in his heart that we expected to be closed by the time we visited his cardiologist toward the end of the year. I prayed almost every day the hole would be\u00a0completely\u00a0closed up when we in for that visit, and was very confidant that it would be. If only things where that easy\u2026 When he visited his heart doctor in September we found out that not only did the hole in his heart  not close up , but he had  another one ! (Which we thought had closed up last year!) So basically Noah started 2012 with one hole in his heart, and ended the year with  two holes in his heart .  Awesome\u2026. (not) Oh, and I was reminded that you don\u2019t always get everything you pray for. And that\u2019s ok. A Few Things I Could Never Imagine All of that to say 2012 was a super epicly awesome year. That\u2019s just all there is to it. With the exception of a few tough days, I enjoyed every single second of it.\u00a0In case you can\u2019t tell I\u00a0 absolutely\u00a0love  being Noah\u2019s dad. I also\u00a0 absolutely\u00a0love  being a husband to my sweet wife (who I also\u00a0celebrated\u00a0 5 wonderful years of marriage \u00a0with this year!) \u00a0There is a lot (like a lot, a lot) of joy and peace in our house.\u00a0Do we have a perfect family? Nope. Far from it. But we have One who  is perfect  at the center of our unperfect family. I\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0imagine\u00a0going through life without the\u00a0knowledge\u00a0that there was a God who was in control of all things. That\u00a0everything\u00a0in life wasn\u2019t just up to chance. That we didn\u2019t have to just live life with our fingers crossed. I couldn\u2019t\u00a0imagine\u00a0thinking your child had\u00a0Leukemia\u00a0and clinging to a man (or a women) in white coat as your child\u2019s\u00a0only\u00a0hope. I\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0imagine\u00a0living in a world where hoped ends where science ends. There\u2019s no hope in that. I\u00a0couldn\u2019t\u00a0imagine a parent looking at their child and thinking their child came from chaos, from random happenings. There\u2019s just to much order. To much design. To much beauty.  Our children aren\u2019t angels , but they are certainly made in the image of The One who is better than any angel\u2026The Triune God. I couldn\u2019t\u00a0imagine\u00a0seeing our little boy\u2019s face light up with that radiant smile of his, or hear that wonderful little giggle of his, and not help but think about how amazing God is for 1.) Being so creative as to creative\u00a0characteristics\u00a0as wonderful as those, and 2.) For letting us experience that kind of\u00a0beauty\u00a0this side of heaven. I don\u2019t how great of an artist you are, you can\u2019t reproduce something as amazing as baby smiles, and childhood giggles in Photoshop. I couldn\u2019t imagine reaching a major life milestone and taking all the credit for it yourself. As if you somehow, someway created your own brain. Gave it the power to think. The power to write. The power to speak. I couldn\u2019t imagine not giving credit to the One whom credit is due for all things. We (myself included) give\u00a0ourselves\u00a0to much credit sometime. I couldn\u2019t\u00a0imagine\u00a0waking up every day and thinking that I\u2019m one day closer to ceasing to\u00a0exist\u00a0forever and ever. (Although regardless of what you believe the truth is you will\u00a0exist\u00a0 somewhere  forever and ever\u2026but that\u2019s another post for another day..) I couldn\u2019t\u00a0imagine\u00a0waking up every day thinking that this world and all that it has to  offer  is the best it\u2019s ever going to get. I rest in the fact that this world \u00a0is the  worst  it\u2019s ever going to be. Thank God, God Knows What He\u2019s Doing! Ever year that goes by I\u2019m\u00a0continually\u00a0reminded that there is a God, and that God  really does  hold the whole world in His hands\u2026.and that includes me and my family. He knows me. He knows my wife. He knows my little 2 year old boy Noah. In fact He knew our son was going to be born with Down syndrome long before we did. Noah\u2019s extra 21st\u00a0Chromosome\u00a0may have come as a\u00a0surprise\u00a0to us, but it was no\u00a0surprise\u00a0to God. Humans get surprised. God doesn\u2019t. Not only does God  NEVER  get\u00a0caught\u00a0off guard, He is\u00a0sovereign. Which is really just a seminary word for \u201cGod knows what He is doing.\u201d One of the most\u00a0comforting\u00a0verses in The Bible when the storms of life come (and come they will) is Psalm 115:3 which says: \u201c\u2026Our God is in the heavens and He does whatever He pleases.\u201d Now this verse wouldn\u2019t be that good if God were mean, or\u00a0selfish, or rude, or hurtful, or a drunk, or cruel, or wicked. I mean lots of people do whatever they please,  and they\u2019re jerks!\u00a0 But 1 John 4:8 says: \u201c\u2026God is love.\u201d\u00a0 And just in case there were any confusion as to what exactly \u201clove\u201d means, 1\u00a0Corinthians\u00a013 clearly tells us that: \u201cLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\u00a0Love never fails\u2026\u201d So as you can see, it\u2019s a pretty awesome (and big) deal that God is in control of everything that comes our way. Including our children and all that they face. Sort of makes you breathe a bit easier, huh? The\u00a0Secret\u00a0To Our \u201cSuccess\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what you believe (or don\u2019t believe) about God, but I\u2019ll assure you He cares about you. In fact, He loves you. More than you can ever wrap your mind around. Lots of people comment on how \u2018positive\u2019 our blog posts are, how much our family smiles in our pictures, how much joy we seem to have, etc\u2026I just want to make one thing very clear as we go into 2013; all of that joy comes from something\u00a0deeper\u00a0than\u00a0ourselves. All of that joy is just an overflow of the deep sense of joy and peace that we have from knowing the Triune God through Jesus Christ. He is  THE  reason for the\u00a0season. He is  THE  reason for the joy. He is  The  One that has made our life what it is. If you aren\u2019t a Christian this may sound cooky, or wacky, or super  religious,  I get that. But it\u2019s true. Hopefully as you\u2019ve seen us live out 2012 through this website,  Facebook page ,  twitter account , various\u00a0interviews\u00a0we gave, etc, you were able to see something different in the way our family lives its life. A joy that was different. A hope that was different. And our hope is that you would ask us about that hope. We\u2019d love nothing more than tell you all about Him.   We\u2019re  only an email away . I\u2019ve Got A Challenge For All Of NoahsDad.com Readers\u2026If You\u2019re Up For It\u2026 The start of a new year is a great time to reflect, make goals, and try something new. I know lots of folks make commitments to read the entire Bible every year. Have you ever found yourself doing something like this: You go find your huge old Bible, or go to your local book store and buy the biggest one you kind find, open it up to page 1 and get after it. You really are going to it! This is going to be the year you\u00a0 finally  read your Bible cover to cover. There\u2019s the whole 7 days thing, a guy named Adam, and by the the time an apple and a snake come into play you get a little\u00a0disinterested, and\u00a0possibly a lot\u00a0confused (\u201c am I  really supposed to believe animals talked? \u201d you ask yourself!) and you say you\u2019ll start again next year. It\u2019s ok to admit. We\u2019ve all been there. I\u2019m about to tell you something crazy. You ready for this: Don\u2019t Read The Bible This Year! Yelp. You heard me right. Don\u2019t read The Bible this year\u2026.Well, at least not all of it! If your just getting started reading The Bible reading it cover to cover like you would Tom\u00a0Sawyer\u00a0isn\u2019t really  the best  way to read It.\u00a0Especially\u00a0if you\u2019re reading it by yourself and aren\u2019t connected to a good local church and / or small group. It can be confusing. There\u2019s lots in there. And most\u00a0importantly: The Bible isn\u2019t a regular book. It\u2019s much different. It will change you. Tom Sawyer won\u2019t. Let me give you something different to try in 2013. Something I think anyone can do. It\u2019s a cool website called \u201c Join The Journey .\u201d If the thought of reading the entire Bible cover to cover sounds a bit overwhelming, or you\u2019ve never been able to \u201cstick with it\u201d\u2026this is for you!\u00a0Basically you visit the website, enter in your email address and 5 days a week (see, I\u2019m not even asking you to do this every day. You can do this!) \u00a0you\u2019ll get an email\u00a0delivered\u00a0to your inbox with some Scripture, a devotional, and a place to ask questions\u2026 for free! My wife and I are doing this as well which means we\u2019ll be \u201con the journey\u201d with you! This also means you can email us or comment on what you are reading / learning. In other words we can all be on this journey together! I think that\u2019s sort of cool! What do you say, are you up for it? Will you Join The Journey with us in 2013? Just  click here  to get started! \u00a0By the way you don\u2019t have to be a Christian or \u201creligious\u201d to join the\u00a0journey, or even live in the United States\u2026.The Journey is open to everyone, everywhere! If you sign up be sure to leave a comment letting us know and where you are from so we can see who we are \u201cjourneying with!\u201d  Is It Time For A New Bible? If you haven\u2019t picked up a Bible in a long time, or don\u2019t even own a Bible, I think the start of a new year (and a new\u00a0journey) is a great time to pick up a new Bible. If you haven\u2019t gone \u201cBible shopping\u201d in a long time you\u2019d be\u00a0surprised at\u00a0how many awesome study Bibles there are these days. Study Bibles are great\u00a0because\u00a0they have lots of notes throughout and at the bottom of each page to help you understand what you are reading. I can\u2019t think of a better investment for someone wanting to get serious with their Bible reading than a good study Bible. The great news is there\u2019s study Bible for all ages. Let me give you a few of my favorites! Best Study Bible For An Adult If you\u2019re an adult I don\u2019t think there is any better study Bible than  The ESV Study Bible . It\u2019s my go to study Bible and one that suggest everyone pick up. I could go on and on about why I like this study Bible so much, but long story short, you will not find  a better value  than this one. It\u2019s like a mini-Bible course packed up in a Bible. If you haven\u2019t bought a Bible in a long time, or looking for a new one..that is the one! Best Study Bible For Teenager The same study Bible I\u00a0mentioned\u00a0above also makes a  Student Study Bible \u00a0which is  awesome ! It\u2019s\u00a0designed\u00a0to help teenagers dig in and learn their Bible! I think every\u00a0teenager\u00a0should have one of these on their shelf. Best Bible Devotional For A Toddler If you have a little child and don\u2019t own  The Jesus Storybook Bible \u00a0you\u2019re seriously missing out. We listed the Jesus Storybook Bible on our  list of top gifts your child will like better than an iPad , and I wanted to mention it\u00a0again\u00a0here\u2026\u00a0because\u00a0it\u2019s seriously that awesome! The Jesus Storybook Bible contains little stories (packed with big truths) that you can read to your child each night. Each page contains a beautiful drawing that your child will enjoy, and it\u2019s just a very fun book overall. I hope to read this children\u2019s Bible once a year with Noah since he really enjoys it a lot (as do I.) I think it\u2019s important to start reading truth to your child as early as\u00a0posable\u00a0and this book is an\u00a0excellent\u00a0way to start introducing truth to your child, no matter how young they are. And I\u2019m betting mom and dad will learn some truth in the process (I know I certainly do.) If you have any questions about any of these Bibles, or decide to pick one up, be sure to let me know in the comments. I\u2019d love to hear about it! Here\u2019s to 2013 Random fact: did you know that\u00a02013 will be the first year not to contain a repeated digit since 1987? Now you do. You can think me later. But on a serious note, thank you to each and every one of you for being apart of our 2012. It\u2019s really an honor to get to know you and your families. I have no idea what 2013 has in store, but I know who does\u2026and knowing Him, it\u2019s going to be one heck of an adventure! I\u2019m\u00a0excited! I hope this year you\u2019ll join me on the journey, I think it will be fun (and life changing!)\u00a0I look forward to learning, sharing, laughing, and loving with each of you in 2013! Let\u2019s do this! What do you hope to do different in 2013? Leave a comment below and tell us about it. Be sure to also let us know if you decide to join the journey \u00a0and where you are from (it\u2019s free, and easy, so I hope you do) and also if you picked up a new Bible! We want to hear all about it!  Let\u2019s make 2013 the best year of our life\u2026.so far!

Wow, I\u00a0seriously\u00a0can\u2019t believe that in less than an hour our little boy will be playing, learning, having fun, and making friends at his new preschool class! We have opted to put Noah in a  typical \u00a0private and  all day \u00a0preschool as opposed to a school that is for children with Down syndrome. I know there are lots of opinions out there when it comes to a child\u2019s eduction (regardless\u00a0of needs) so if you choose to go another route that\u2019s ok also! This is just the way we choose to go. Noah\u2019s doing great, and we can\u2019t wait to see how he does being around  typical  children all day. Noah\u2019s the only child with Down syndrome at this\u00a0particular\u00a0school so my wife wrote this letter last that that we are going to print out and give to his teachers this morning. I thought I\u2019d share with you. \n \nNeedless to say I\u2019m one proud daddy! I love this little boy so-so-so-so much and I\u2019m super\u00a0excited\u00a0to see him begin this awesome\u00a0chapter\u00a0in his life! And yes,I\u2019m going to be  that  dad this morning. The one snapping pictures like crazy. In fact I\u2019m even brining my external flash. I\u2019m about to go TMZ in here! Dear Teachers I would like to take a moment to introduce you to our son Noah Smith. He is joining your class today and we are so excited for this next journey in his life. We wanted to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about our son and let you know that we welcome any questions you may have (we\u2019re super proud of him, and love to talk about him.) Our son was born with Down syndrome which means that he has an extra copy of his 21st chromosome. I don\u2019t know if you have had the pleasure of knowing anyone with Down syndrome so I hope you don\u2019t mind if I tell you a little bit about what that means. Noah has certain characteristics that are common for children who have Down syndrome including upslanted eyes, low set ears, being a little smaller than you expect for someone his age, but his biggest challenge is hypotonia. Hypotonia does not mean that he is weak it just means that his muscles are more relaxed. You will find him a bit limp when you pick him up. It has made it challenging to reach his gross and fine motor skills and even affects his mouth with forming sounds. We have been working with an occupational and physical therapist since he was 3 weeks old and he has been doing awesome with that. (He will continue to do therapy on Monday afternoons after school.) He started walking this summer and is getting more stable every day. You may hear that ALL children with Down syndrome are angels or just the happiest children ever. While our son may be pretty happy, I think you will find that he also gets pretty stubborn, can get upset and cry, and have any emotion that a typical child goes through. In other words, he is no angel. \u263a Down syndrome however is only part of our son and we also want you to know other things about him. Our hope is that he is fully included in a classroom and makes friends as well as learns. He is very curious and likes to explore. You can see his imagination is starting to grow as he is playing with toys. He likes to climb, so you may want to watch your bookcases and tables. It is not ok for him to be sitting on tables no matter how cute he looks up there. He loves music and dancing. He likes looking at books and being read to. He enjoys rolling a ball back and forth and playing peek-a-boo. You will find his laugh is quite contagious. Don\u2019t let him fool you, he does understand the word no. We expect him to uphold the same rules as other children and to be disciplined when needed. If the appropriate behavior is shown to him, he will likely follow along. He learns best by seeing and then mimicking. It may take him longer to process what is said to him so please be patient with him. We have noticed that when we are singing songs if we give him time to process the hand movements and don\u2019t rush he will copy what we are doing. I think you will find that he is pretty smart and an excellent problem solver. We are so excited to see how he does surrounded by typical children for him to model himself after. Although he does not have words yet he knows many signs and is working on his receptive language. He will spontaneously use \u201ceat\u201d, \u201cdrink\u201d, \u201cmilk\u201d and \u201cmore\u201d. He will mimic many more signs specifically \u201cplease\u201d, \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201csorry\u201d which I hope you encourage him to use. If you have any questions about signs, we would be happy to help with that. We are working with a speech therapist currently at an outside facility and we hope that this year will be the year of a speech explosion for our little man. The most important thing about our son is that he is a child first just like any other child. He wants to play and learn. This is reflected in the language that we use. You will never hear us say Down\u2019s child he will always be a child who has Down syndrome. This is called people first language. We are not big fans of the r word (retarded). We do not like to refer to children without delays as normal but as typical. If you have any questions about him or Down syndrome we hope you feel comfortable enough to ask us. My husband has created a blog for our son which we have used to show the world what it is like raising a child with Down syndrome that has videos and helpful tips. Feel free to check it out at Noahsdad.com. We are very proud of our son and love him more than we could ever express. He isn\u2019t sick or suffering. He was simply born with an extra copy of his 21st chromosome. Thanks for the role you are playing in his life, and thank you for all you do to invest in our children. We appreciate you, and hope you\u2019ll love our son just as much as we do. We look forward to getting to know each of you more.

{"date": ",September,11,2012", "body": "As a father of son\u00a0 born with Down\u00a0syndrome , I\u2019m angry, sad, and hurt after reading a recent article in\u00a0 The Miami Herald \u00a0about the State of Florida \u201cwarehousing \u201d (yes, warehousing!) \u00a0a large number of children with disabilities in \u201chospital-like\u201d institutions, and their follow up article entitled \u201c Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way: Nursing home profits trump sick kids\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 special needs. \u201d \u201c Hundreds of children are currently segregated in nursing facilities \u00a0throughout Florida.\u00a0 They are growing up apart from their families \u00a0in hospital-life settings\u2026 they live segregated lives \u00a0\u2013 having few\u00a0opportunities\u00a0to interact with\u00a0children\u00a0and young adults without\u00a0disabilities\u00a0or to experience many of the social, educational and\u00a0recreational\u00a0activities that are critical to child development.\u201d Unbelievable, right? The Justice\u00a0Department\u00a0Demands\u00a0Justice For Children With Special Needs, and Their Families. In fact what\u2019s going on in Florida is\u00a0 so atrocious \u00a0that the United States Justice Department is stepping in. In a letter to the State of Florida, U.S. Assistant Attorney General, Thomas E. Perez, outlines the results of a federal\u00a0investigation which shows how the\u00a0State is in\u00a0 violation of\u00a0the Americans with\u00a0Disabilities\u00a0Act . \u201cThe State\u2019s\u00a0reliance\u00a0on nursing facilities to serve these children\u00a0 violates their civil rights \u00a0and denies them the full opportunity to develop bonds with family and friends and partake in\u00a0educational, social, and\u00a0recreational\u00a0activities\u00a0in the community.\u201d I\u2019ve\u00a0embedded\u00a0the full letter below so you can read in its\u00a0entirety\u00a0if you\u2019d like. (Warning, it\u2019s heartbreaking, and will\u00a0no doubt make you angry.) If you don\u2019t want to read through the 22 page letter, feel free to scroll to the bottom of this post where I\u2019ve outlined some of the most telling parts of the letter. I\u2019ve made the embed code\u00a0embeddable, so if you\u2019re a blogger, and would like to include the letter on your site, you\u2019re free to do so, simply copy and paste. Be sure to let me know if you have any problems reading it, or embedding it. So what\u2019s the State of Florida doing that\u2019s so\u00a0wrong, and just how are they violating the civil rights of\u00a0hundreds\u00a0of children living with special needs? Keep reading\u2026. The Americans With\u00a0Disabilities\u00a0Act\u00a0Changed\u00a0Everything. In 1990 the\u00a0 Americans with\u00a0Disabilities\u00a0Act \u00a0was passed into law. The ADA,\u00a0among\u00a0many other things,\u00a0states\u00a0that\u00a0children born\u00a0with\u00a0 disabilities \u00a0or other medical conditions\u00a0 must \u00a0be allowed to\u00a0receive\u00a0care and treatment in a\u00a0community\u00a0setting\u00a0 whenever \u00a0 possible . \u00a0 Not in \u2018warehouse\u201d like\u00a0environments\u00a0like what was done to children in previous generations, and is still a very common practice in\u00a0 the\u00a0Ukraine and other Eastern European countries . (Which, by the way, is way I\u2019m such a fan of\u00a0organizations\u00a0like\u00a0 Reece\u2019s Rainbow \u00a0who are making an impact overseas by helping to\u00a0 rescue\u00a0children \u00a0forced to live in these\u00a0environments.) In case you weren\u2019t aware, there was in time\u00a0 in this country \u00a0where children like my son (who was born with Down syndrome ) were basically\u00a0 forced to be raised in a mental institution ! Can you even\u00a0imagine\u00a0a small baby (regardless of if they were born with a\u00a0 disability \u00a0or not) being stripped away from his mommy and daddy and forced to live in a mental\u00a0institution? It causes tears to steam down my face just thinking about. But it really happened. Right here in the United States of America. These children\u00a0received\u00a0little (or no)\u00a0 early childhood intervention , little (or no) formal education, and no real love and support. They were\u00a0 cared \u00a0for by people punching a clock. Their job was to simply make sure that these children ate a few times a day, and remained medicated\u00a0enough so that all they could do is just lay in bed. These children did not receive\u00a0 proper medical care , did not get a chance to\u00a0 build and develop\u00a0meaningful\u00a0relationships , and did not get the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to\u00a0 live in a loving and supportive home \u00a0which is so vital to a child\u2019s success. It was a\u00a0tragedy then. And it\u2019s a\u00a0tragedy\u00a0now. I believe this is the reason you don\u2019t see to many older people with\u00a0 Down syndrome \u00a0out and about today. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve\u00a0received\u00a0a few emails from families who went against the State 40-50 years ago and\u00a0 refused \u00a0to allow\u00a0their\u00a0child to be\u00a0institutionalized; instead choosing to raise their child in their own home. I have the utmost respect for those families\u00a0because\u00a0I can\u2019t even\u00a0imagine\u00a0how difficult that must have been for them. They had\u00a0 none of the\u00a0support\u00a0and resources \u00a0that we have today, yet their children grew up to live rewarding,\u00a0meaningful, and\u00a0fulfilling\u00a0lives. My hats go off to those families. All of that to say that\u00a0because\u00a0of the Americans with Disability Act, today is (supposedly) a different day in the United States for people living with\u00a0disabilities. The State Of Florida\u00a0Apparently\u00a0Didn\u2019t Get the Memo. The U.S. Justice\u00a0Department\u00a0launched an\u00a0investigation\u00a0and found that the State of Florida to have\u00a0violated\u00a0the\u00a0Americans\u00a0With Disabilities Act.\u00a0I encourage you read the U.S.\u00a0Assistant\u00a0Attorney General\u2019s letter I\u00a0embedded\u00a0above to get all the details, but if you don\u2019t feel like reading through the letter, I took the time to do it for you. Here are a few quotes from the Justice\u00a0Department\u2019s\u00a0letter that I think sum it up quite well. (emphasis\u00a0added.) \u201cIndeed, the State has planned, structured, and administered a system of care that has led to the\u00a0 unnecessary\u00a0segregation and\u00a0isolation\u00a0of children , often for many years, in nursing facilities\u2026As a result, many children\u00a0continue\u00a0to be\u00a0separated\u00a0from their families simply because the State has failed to\u00a0identify\u00a0or connect them to\u00a0sufficient\u00a0community-based\u00a0services\u00a0to meet their needs.\u201d \u201cOur review of the State\u2019s system reveals that\u00a0 the State fails to meet its\u00a0obligations\u00a0under Title II of the ADA \u2026by\u00a0 unnecessarily\u00a0institutionalizing\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0children\u00a0with\u00a0disabilities \u00a0in nursing facilities. Many children entering nursing facilities in the State are\u00a0unnecessarily\u00a0separated\u00a0from their families and\u00a0communities for years. With adequate services and supports, these\u00a0children\u00a0could live at home with their families or in other more integrated community settings.\u201d \u201cWe conclude that\u00a0 the State fails to provide services to children \u00a0who reside in nursing facilities in the most\u00a0integrated\u00a0setting\u00a0appropriate\u00a0to their needs\u2026\u201d \u201c Hundreds of children are currently segregated in nursing facilities \u00a0throughout Florida.\u00a0 They are growing up apart from their families \u00a0in hospital-life settings\u2026 they live segregated lives \u00a0\u2013 having few\u00a0opportunities\u00a0to interact with\u00a0children\u00a0and young adults without\u00a0disabilities\u00a0or to experience many of the social, educational and\u00a0recreational\u00a0activities that are critical to child development.\u201d \u201cWe also spoke with many families\u00a0 who want to have their children living at home but report their frustration with State\u00a0policies\u00a0that\u00a0inhibit\u00a0their ability to do so.\u201d \u201cThe State has also implemented policies and\u00a0practices\u00a0that\u00a0 impair access to medically\u00a0necessary\u00a0services and support \u00a0that would enable children to transition home or to other community-based settings.\u201d \u201cMany families members of children in the facilities we visited have expressed their desire to \u00a0bring their children home , or see them move to a\u00a0community-based setting. \u201c I want my baby home ,\u201d said the mother of one three-year-old with Down syndrome\u2026\u201d \u201cThe State\u2019s\u00a0reliance\u00a0on nursing facilities to serve these children\u00a0 violates their civil rights \u00a0and denies them the full opportunity to develop bonds with family and friends and partake in\u00a0educational, social, and\u00a0recreational\u00a0activities\u00a0in the community.\u201d To be honest, I can\u2019t believe the things that I read in the Justice Department\u2019s letter are actually\u00a0happening\u00a0in\u00a0 The United States in 2012! \u00a0A father of son with\u00a0 special\u00a0needs It\u2019s\u00a0insulting,\u00a0hurtful, and\u00a0offensive. \u00a0My heart breaks for the mommies, daddies, and children who can\u2019t be\u00a0together as a family\u00a0because\u00a0the State of\u00a0Florida\u00a0is violating\u00a0Federal\u00a0law. I\u2019m thankful that the Federal\u00a0Government\u00a0has gotten\u00a0involved and has brought these injustices to light. My prayer is that the U.S. Justice\u00a0Department\u00a0follows through on this letter, and sees to it that the state of Florida responds\u00a0swiftly to their requests to \u201cremedy the deficiencies\u201doutlined in their letter. As a dad and a person who values life, I am angry, sad, and hurt. I\u2019m thankful that there are people in our government like Mr. Perez who care enough about\u00a0people\u00a0to step in when they see something wrong. I\u2019m also thankful to know that we have a God who cares about all\u00a0people\u00a0as well. To quote my friend\u00a0 Todd Wagner : \u201cPeople are God\u2019s things, not play things, and God\u2019s someone you don\u2019t want to tick off.\u201d I\u2019m also thankful that I don\u2019t live in the State of Florida.\u00a0 What Do You Think? What are your thoughts about what\u2019s going on in Florida? Also if you have any personal experience with Florida\u2019s mis-treatment of children with\u00a0disabilities\u00a0and their\u00a0families, I\u2019d love to hear your story.

(Does anyone else have that problem?) To be honest if it wasn\u2019t for my wife giving me a heads up I wouldn\u2019t have noticed. She\u2019s a\u00a0huge Glee fan and keeps up with all of the Glee\u00a0gossip. After last season, rumors started popping up online that Sue\u2019s daughter was going to be born with Down syndrome, but it wasn\u2019t until recently that it was confirmed. Needless to say, I thought it was super cool! Not only is it\u00a0awesome\u00a0that Sue\u2019s daughter is the\u00a0 3rd\u00a0character \u00a0to appear on Glee with Down syndrome, but I thought Sue\u2019s\u00a0demeanor\u00a0was\u00a0awesome\u00a0as well! She didn\u2019t seem sad or\u00a0discouraged about her daughter\u2019s Down syndrome\u00a0diagnosis. In fact, I loved how Sue introduced her daughter to one of the students for the first time: \u201cThis is my\u00a0daughter\u00a0Robin\u2026she\u2019s the love of my life, and I\u2019m so, so devoted to her.\u201d I\u2019ve gotta say, I don\u2019t really watch Glee (although I do enjoy some of the music!) but I almost\u00a0 want to start watching \u00a0if nothing more than to support their efforts to help change our cultures view of people with Down syndrome. In case you didn\u2019t know this is the 3rd person with Down syndrome to have an ongoing role on the show. There\u2019s Becky, Sue\u2019s sister, and now Sue\u2019s daughter, Robin. By the way Robin Sylvester is really 7th month old Jordyn Kindle Orr! As a father of a child born with Down syndrome I\u00a0applaud\u00a0the producers of Glee for the efforts to promote and encourage inclusion, be it ever so slightly. I kept watching\u00a0tonight\u2019s\u00a0episode in hopes of seeing more of Sue\u2019s daughter, Robin, and to see what the writers were going to do with Sue Sylvester\u2019s\u00a0character\u00a0and storyline. I\u2019m very curious to see if they explore how Sue feeling about having a child with Down\u00a0syndrome, if she knew ahead of time through prenatal testing, etc. I really do hope we get to see more of her and her new daughter Robyn this season! Did you watch Glee tonight? If so did you notice that Sue\u2019s daughter was born with Down syndrome? (And if you did, did you already know ahead of time?)

{"date": ",August,1,2012", "body": "It\u2019s hard to believe this is our second Christmas as parents\u2026and especially parents of a child with  Down syndrome . Crazy! This 2nd Christmas as new parents is  much different  than our 1st Christmas for a number of reasons. Last Christmas it had only been ten days since we found out our son had Down syndrome. And only a few days since we were told Noah\u2019s new born screen tested positive for  Glutaric acidemia \u00a0(GA-1) and he\u2019d need to undergo several months of testing to rule it out. (Which, by the way, is why I refer to that week as the  scariest week of my life .) There was so much\u00a0 newness \u00a0in our life this time last year, and it\u2019s amazing how much more calm this Christmas is compared to last Christmas. Here\u2019s a few of the new things we were experiencing this time last year. 1. We were new parents We had spent months before Noah was born preparing for his  arrival . We had turned my home office into Noah\u2019s nursery. I still remember it like it was yesterday. I remember going to Home Depot with my wife and carefully studying the various paint color options. Taking home handfuls of those small paint sample cards and going back and forth on what the perfect color for Noah\u2019s new nursery should be. Finally deciding on the color. And finally laying down the first coat of paint on the walls of the room that our son would soon call his home. It was a lot of work (and I learned I\u2019m not a very good painter) but it was fun. It was so exciting preparing for his arrival. We read books. We had showers. We got gifts. We bought tons of clothes, and other fun toys. Then we waited for Noah to come. And we waited. And waited. And waited. I\u2019m not a very patient person, and it felt like foooooreeever before hearing the words I longed to hear from my wife\u2019s OBGYN on December 14, 2010: \u201cWe\u2019re going to induce labor tomorrow morning, so be here at 8 am.\u201d Wow\u2026!!! I couldn\u2019t believe it. We were so excited. So pumped. So ready for this\u2026! (Boy, if I only knew what the next 24 hours had in store.) 2. We were new parents to a child with Down syndrome. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, pretty much everything I knew about Down syndrome prior to Noah being born I had  learned from watching T.V . So not only were we first time parents, we were first time parents of a child with Down syndrome. By the way, if someone from  Barnes and Noble \u00a0is reading this, it\u2019d be cool if you\u2019d put the  down syndrome books  closer to to the parenting books for people like me. I had to track back and forth between the two sections. \ud83d\ude42 3. We were experiencing so many new emotions and feelings. I can\u2019t even begin to describe all of the new emotions and feelings we were experiencing. We were new parents, we had just found out our son had Down syndrome, we had also just found out he may have been born with GA-1; our entire universe at had just changed in the blink of an eye. But we still had a wonderful first Christmas with our little boy (and he scored lots of  fun christmas gifts !) (By the way, each of us are only one phone call away from having our entire lives changed by the way. Such is the adventure of life.) I have to say this year, with all it\u2019s ups and downs (pun intended) has been the best year of my life. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. I am so madly in love with my wife and little boy. I know it sounds sort of clich\u00e9 but I really feel like I\u2019m living a dream. God has invited each of us in to this  awesome story  He is writing. It\u2019s the adventure of a life time, and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Here are some images from our son\u2019s second Christmas. It was a sweet, sweet time in our home. And I\u2019m looking forward to many more. By the way, I know it\u2019s summer but what better time to think about Christmas than in July! \ud83d\ude42 How did you and your family spend this last Christmas?

{"date": ",October,1,2012", "body": "We decided to surprise my mom for her birthday and take a trip to Colorado. By surprise I mean that I called my dad and asked if my mom was near by, he said no, and continued on with saying we would like to come and what dates would be good, followed by my mom getting on the phone and asking what we were talking about\u2026so much for that surprise dad\u00a0 Happy birthday to my mom! (Noah\u2019s Grandma!) Family Comes First I have been blessed with a truly great father (as well as other family members including the\u00a0 best children\u2019s librarian ever ) and thus Noah has a pretty awesome grandpa. He made a decision when I was young to move to the mountains of Colorado from the cities of Kansas so he could watch his family grow up and enjoy life. I can say with certainty that one of my parents, if not both, were at every \u00a0dance or piano recital, every sports competition, every awards banquet, and anything that might have involved an audience that I was involved in as a child, and let me tell you \u00a0I tried to do everything. They have continued this involvement into Noah\u2019s life as well as their other grandchildren. It\u2019s truly a blessing for Noah to have such\u00a0 supportive grandparents . I hope that we are also living a life that says that our faith and our family are the most important things for us. As well as creating some fun\u00a0 family traditions \u00a0along the way. Don\u2019t you just love that smile? The Fishing Boat\u2026.A Grandpa\u2019s Dream Come True My dad is a\u00a0 huge fisherman , and he\u2019s especially excited to get Noah fishing! In fact, since Noah was born my dad has been talking about how fun it would be to get Noah on his boat. Today was truly a special day as Noah and his grandpa spent some time\u00a0 playing around \u00a0on his boat. I spent many a day in this boat trolling for trout and Noah got to explore the boat for the first time today. I can just see the gleam in my dad\u2019s eye as he envisions the day that Noah catches his first fish. We have a pond in our back yard and Noah will likely start there as my dad stocks the pond with fish and keeps them well fed. My nephew caught his first fish there when we\u00a0 visited the previous summer . He will graduate to the boat after that and then who knows if Noah will ever want to come back to Texas with us. A Slightly Better Swing Set We also had quite the\u00a0 swing \u00a0set in our back yard. It was built by my dad and grandpa when we moved to Colorado. Notice that it is still standing some\u00a0 30 years later. \u00a0I don\u2019t know if our\u00a0 plastic version \u00a0will say the same thing in 30 years. My dad couldn\u2019t resist letting Noah go down the slide just once (probably more). He of course did this when I wasn\u2019t home as the women in the family would have strictly forbidden it as you can see it is a pretty intense slide. Grandpa is full of these types of tricks, his best being that there is always some candy in his shirt pocket which comes in handy with young grandchildren. Sharing Firsts We are truly blessed by having a\u00a0 supportive family . They love Noah and encourage him daily. They were so excited that they were there for Noah\u2019s\u00a0 first sign \u00a0as they are usually hearing about firsts on the phone, through our\u00a0 videos (they get sneak peaks at Noah\u2019s\u00a0 firsts ) and even through Skype. They truly love watching Noah grow up and are his biggest cheerleaders. I look forward to all the mischief I can only imagine Noah and his grandpa will get into over the years.

{"date": ",September,12,2012", "body": "Ever heard of\u00a0 Vegemite ? I\u00a0hadn\u2019t\u00a0until being\u00a0introduced\u00a0to it by our friend\u00a0from\u00a0Australia, Libby.\u00a0Apparently\u00a0they eat this stuff like peanut butter over there! In fact, based on\u00a0all the conversations I\u2019ve had with\u00a0people from\u00a0 Down Under \u00a0I kind of think all they eat over there is Vegemite and Tim Tams! (Hmmm\u2026I wonder if anyone has ever tried Vegemite\u00a0 on \u00a0their\u00a0Tim Tams? Maybe I\u2019m on to something?!) Vegemite; A\u00a0 Different \u00a0Kind Of Peanut Butter. Libby\u00a0was kind enough to send us a tube of Vegemite along with the\u00a0delicious\u00a0Tim Tams that we\u00a0 devoured \u00a0savored. (Parent ProTip: If you\u2019re going to\u00a0 give your 14 month old a Tim Tam , at 8 pm, in his bedroom, on the carpet, be sure to lay down a towel first.)\u00a0 If you\u2019ve never had the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to enjoy that fine Aussie treat known as Vegemite I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way I can adequately\u00a0describe it to you. Trust me when I say it\u2019s something you really do have to\u00a0 experience \u00a0for yourself. (Maybe I\u2019ll try to import some so I can do a\u00a0 giveaway !) Since I can\u2019t really describe it to you, I thought I\u2019d tell you the\u00a0ingredients and\u00a0let your\u00a0imagination\u00a0do the rest. \u201cVegemite is one of several yeast extract spreads sold in Australia. It is made from leftover brewers\u2019 yeast extract and various vegetable and spice additives. It is very dark reddish-brown, almost black, in color, and one of the richest sources known of Vitamin B. It\u2019s thick like peanut butter, it\u2019s very salty\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t know what kind of peanut butter they eat in\u00a0Australia, but Vegemite doesn\u2019t taste like any peanut butter I\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0 It\u2019s All In The \u00a0Method, Or So I\u2019m Told. Just like the other famous\u00a0Australian\u00a0treat,\u00a0 The Tim Tam , certain\u00a0 methods\u00a0 must be used if one is to fully\u00a0 enjoy \u00a0their Vegemite. (In case you weren\u2019t aware there are several ways for one to fully enjoy a Tim Tam. There\u2019s the Tim Tam Slam, the\u00a0Tim Tam Shotgun, the Tim Tam Bomb, and the Tim Tam Explosion. I went with the more simple method of simply stuffing them into my mouth.)\u00a0 \u201cHmmm..I wonder if that\u2019s something I can eat\u2026?\u201d Apparently\u00a0the proper method of enjoying Vegemite is as follows: \n Toast a slice of bread. \n Place a small amount of butter on the toast. \n Spread a \u201csmall\u201d layer of Vegemite across that warm, buttery, toast. \n Enjoy your Vegemite. \n Of course I have no idea what a\u00a0 small \u00a0layer means. Does small = the size of a pin drop, a teaspoon, a tablespoon, or some\u00a0special\u00a0 Aussie\u00a0measurement , Not to mention that a\u00a0 small \u00a0bowl of\u00a0rocky\u00a0rock ice cream to me, is not the same as a small \u00a0bowl of rocky road ice cream to most.\u00a0 Regardless, since there was no picture of what was meant by a\u00a0 small \u00a0layer of Vegemite on the back of the package, we just winged it. Looks like a \u201csmall layer\u201d to me.\u00a0 And judging by the look on Noah\u2019s face, I think we did alright.\u00a0 I think he likes it, don\u2019t you?\u00a0 If You Can Eat It, Noah Will Try It! I\u2019m not really surprised Noah slammed his Vegemite toast; there isn\u2019t much this little boy\u00a0 doesn\u2019t \u00a0like.\u00a0A lot of children don\u2019t like to eat certain textures of food. Not Noah. He\u2019s like our little goat, and will eat anything he get put in his mouth. Well,\u00a0 almost \u00a0anything. For some strange reason he\u2019s recently started spitting out mashed\u00a0potatoes\u00a0of all things. It\u2019s super random. He\u2019s always enjoyed them. Then one day, out of the blue, he just decided he didn\u2019t want that stuff anywhere near his\u00a0mouth. Funny, huh? \u201cHmmm, what\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Vegemite you say? I don\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d \u201cHmmmm. I\u2019m not quite sure. Maybe if I had just a little bit more\u2026\u201d \u201cAhhh..there you go! I like it!\u201d After Noah finished up his Aussie snack I dared my wife to try some. Which she did. Then she\u00a0dared\u00a0me to have some. And I did\u2026. Let\u2019s just say my experience wasn\u2019t quite the same as my Noah\u2019s! \u201cMore please!\u201d I hear Vegemite is an\u00a0 acquired \u00a0taste\u2026but I think I\u2019ll just stick to the Tim Tams.\u00a0 Have you or your children ever had Vegemite? Are you a fan, or not so much? Also are there any kinds \u00a0of food textures that your kids won\u2019t touch with a ten foot pole? What are some ways you\u2019ve helped them overcome that?

Well, actually they decided to\u00a0unofficially\u00a0change the name from \u201c Mom Next Door \u201d to \u201c Couple Next Door \u201d for\u00a0their\u00a0fall issue since they wanted to write about our entire family, and well because, umm\u2026I\u2019m not a mom. \ud83d\ude42 I had actually just saw an\u00a0article\u00a0they had recently published about\u00a0 Matt Chandler and his family , and I liked what I read on their website about the purpose behind their\u00a0publications\u00a0so we agreed to do the article. \u00a0 \n \u201c[Thrive Magazine is a] publication that serves as a resource for families living with learning differences and special needs. More than 117,600 children living in North Texas have special needs; in that 117,600 are children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, autism, those who are blind, deaf, are in wheelchairs, have Asperger\u2019s, attention or sensory issues. Thrive assists parents of children with special needs by reporting on issues directly related to their lives, building community among families of children with special needs, and promoting acceptance.\u201d One of their writers, Nicole Jordan, came to our home and spent some time hanging out with us, learning about our  story , how we\u2019re using social media to help connect other families raising children with  Down syndrome , and understanding more about why we started this  blog . (I use the word \u201cblog\u201d very loosely since this site has become much more than that, it\u2019s become a community for\u00a0literally\u00a0thousands of people all across the world.) A few weeks later we connected with them again and did a photo shot for the article. Although\u00a0I\u2019m not sure why Noah looks so zoned out in the picture they selected, but he\u2019s typically much\u00a0 expressive \u2026and  happy . Maybe all the\u00a0strobe\u00a0lights, and clicks from the camera freaked him out. \ud83d\ude42 Big thanks to Thrive Magazine! We were very happy with the article and think Nicole did a  great  job telling our story and about our passion to help the world see that people born with Down syndrome are\u00a0worthy\u00a0of life. Thank you Nicole and the entire the staff at Thrive\u00a0Magazine\u00a0for all that you do to help show the world that children like Noah are so  worth it! It\u2019s so important for the media to keep publishing stories about people with special needs, and helping the culture to exchange inaccurate and outdated\u00a0stereotypes with true and accurate ones. I want to\u00a0thank all of the  news\u00a0organizations \u00a0that have\u00a0leveraged\u00a0their influence to do just that. From a father raising a little boy born with Down syndrome, thank you. Every positive article you write helps the world understand, and understanding goes a long way. By the way, if you are a member of the media looking to write a story, I\u2019m\u00a0encourage\u00a0you to drop by our  Facebook page  and connect with some of the almost  20,000 people  there; many of whom are parenting a child with Down syndrome, or  special need,  and would\u00a0 LOVE \u00a0another\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to brag on their awesome kids! \ud83d\ude42 Please\u00a0continue\u00a0to help us tell these stories.

{"date": ",September,14,2012", "body": "Our little Superman! Now that I\u2019m a parent I find myself saying things I\u00a0 never \u00a0would have\u00a0imagined\u00a0actually saying as a parent. Like yesterday, when I found myself saying this to my son\u2019s cardiologist: \u201c The hole in my son\u2019s heart\u2019s\u00a0 only \u00a01mm?!\u201d Ha,ha\u2026who would have ever thought! Yesterday Noah had a follow up\u00a0appointment with his\u00a0cardiologist, and we got some news we\u00a0weren\u2019t really\u00a0expecting. Not\u00a0 necessarily \u00a0bad news, just unexpected. Since many you may not have been following our son\u2019s\u00a0story from the\u00a0 very beginning , I thought I\u2019d give you a quick time line of his heart conditions, including an update from\u00a0yesterday\u2019s\u00a0appointment. Our First Concern, Noah\u2019s Heart. In case you haven\u2019t read Noah\u2019s\u00a0 birth story , he was born on Dec 15, 2010 (he\u2019s 20 month\u2019s old) and we found out he had\u00a0 Down\u00a0syndrome \u00a0a few hours after his birth. \u00a0My wife\u2019s first question to our\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0was, \u201c Is his heart ok? \u201d (By the way, I love the fact that the first thing on her mind was his heart, not him having Down syndrome. I love my wife.) \u00a0 Speaking of hearts\u2026.he stole ours since before he was born! My wife\u2019s a pediatrician and is well aware that\u00a0children\u00a0born with Down syndrome often are born with\u00a0 serious heart\u00a0complications . One of those is an AV Canal\u00a0which\u00a0often requires open heart surgery right away; thankfully Noah did not have this.\u00a0Our\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0reassured us that although she could hear a small heart murmur, there were no\u00a0 major \u00a0problems\u00a0with his heart. She told us the the cardiologist would be in the next day to do a full exam on Noah\u2019s heart. Noah\u2019s Heart At Birth The next day we learned from our son\u2019s (awesome)\u00a0cardiologist\u00a0that he was born with 2 small holes \u00a0in his heart; an\u00a0 Atrial Septal Defect \u00a0(ASD), and a\u00a0Patent Ductus Arteriosus\u00a0(PDA.) Since my wife\u2019s a Doctor sometimes Noah\u2019s Doctors rush through things without\u00a0explaining\u00a0them well,\u00a0 assuming\u00a0 that she already knows it all (she\u2019ll be the first to tell you she doesn\u2019t) but not Noah\u2019s cardiologist. Not only did he take his time\u00a0 explaining everything to us , he drew us these really\u00a0 fun \u00a0pictures as well. (I like pictures!)\u00a0 I\u2019ll never forget the day I got this picture! We were told there weren\u2019t any immediate\u00a0concerns with Noah\u2019s heart and we just needed to schedule a follow up appointment in a few months to see how things were progressing. Noah\u2019s 2 Month Cardiologist Follow Up This was our\u00a0first\u00a0official\u00a0visit\u00a0with Noah\u2019s heart doctor and we got some great news! The PDA that was there had\u00a0 completely\u00a0closed up on its own , and the ASD had\u00a0shrunk\u00a0to only\u00a0 5mm wide! Woot! 1 Down, 1 To go! We were told to schedule a follow up in 6 months and if the ASD got smaller, or remained the same size, no surgery would be\u00a0required to fix it! However if it enlarged we would have to talk about what the\u00a0 next steps \u00a0were on fixing it. This of course made me extremely nervous. Who wants to think about the \u201cnext step\u201d for their infant, when we all know the\u00a0 next step\u201d \u00a0is really doctor code for heart\u00a0surgery. Not me. Noah\u2019s 8 Month Follow Up On today\u2019s visit we\u00a0received\u00a0some more fantastic\u00a0news, Noah\u2019s ASD had shrunk down to only 2mm !!!\u00a0And as you can\u00a0imagine\u00a0we were\u00a0 extremely\u00a0happy \u00a0to hear that. (Be sure to check out the \u00a0videos and pictures from that visit .) In fact, today\u2019s visit was so good they didn\u2019t even have to draw us one of those pretty heart diagrams!\u00a0 Waiting to find out if our son was going to have to have heart surgery (do I look nervous?)\u00a0 Noah\u2019s\u00a0cardiologist\u00a0informed us that the hole in his heart was\u00a0 so small \u00a0that even if it\u00a0 never closed up \u00a0it wouldn\u2019t cause him any problems what so ever in the future. In fact, they wouldn\u2019t even need to do anything to correct it. She was also fairly\u00a0confidant\u00a0that by the time we came back for our next follow up (in 12 months) it would be closed up as well. (I liked that option\u00a0 a lot \u00a0better!) Noah\u2019s 20 Month Check Up (Yesterday\u2019s\u00a0Appointment) Yesterday we went to Noah\u2019s\u00a0cardiologist\u00a0 fully expecting \u00a0for Noah\u2019s remaining heart hole (the ASD) to be closed up\u2026and being told we never had to visit the heart doctor again\u2026. \u2026.but it\u2019s never that easy, is it?\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing a little Winnie The Pooh Can\u2019t Fix!\u00a0 After Noah\u2019s EKG and\u00a0echocardiogram we waited\u00a0 patiently \u00a0for his\u00a0cardiologist\u00a0to come in and tell us the good news. After examining him, and listening to his heart she said \u201c everything looks great! \u201d But before I could say\u00a0 Yah! Sweet! Awesome! \u00a0she added, \u201cThe ASD has shrunk down to 1mm, and it looks that PDA we thought had closed, is still open.\u201d Umm. Wait? Are you telling me that Noah came to the hospital with one hole in his heart, and now he\u2019s leaving with two? I thought you just said\u00a0everything\u00a0looked\u00a0 great ? The last time I checked having two holes in your heart isn\u2019t great.\u00a0 \u00a0(By the way, I didn\u2019t say any of this out loud.) She goes on to tell us that the the PDA that we\u00a0 thought \u00a0had closed\u00a0over 18 months ago is so small that it didn\u2019t even show up during the last two echocardiogram, and they just happen to see it during today. (Perhaps\u00a0because\u00a0Noah was lying so still this time, while the last few time he was moving all about?) He\u2019s just chilling. She assured us that is was\u00a0 no big deal \u00a0at all, and\u00a0both\u00a0of his heart\u00a0defects\u00a0are so small that they would\u00a0 never cause him any problems , and would\u00a0 never require any\u00a0surgery \u00a0what\u00a0so ever. So it was actually great news! But like I said above, it just wasn\u2019t what we\u00a0expected\u00a0to hear. Oh, and this time we got another one of those\u00a0 fun \u00a0pictures.\u00a0 I\u2019m A Crier, And I\u2019m Not Afraid To Admit It! Even though it we were getting fantastic news, I started tearing up as soon she started talking to us about his heart. Not so much\u00a0because\u00a0the news was bad or anything. It had more to do with the fact that just a few weeks ago I stood in a NICU room praying with our friend and his 12 month old little boy who was lying there was with his chest wide open and hooked up to countless machines that were keeping him\u00a0alive. He had just had a\u00a0 open heart surgery \u00a0the day before, and there were some\u00a0complications. His mom and dad hurt, and my wife and I hurt with them. That little boy\u2019s name is Carson, and he\u2019s back home now and\u00a0 doing fantastic . But, I\u2019m still very\u00a0sensitive \u00a0when I think about all that they went through, and they were on my heart and mind today as we were talking about Noah\u2019s heart. But it\u2019s all good. I have no shame in\u00a0admitting that\u00a0I\u2019m a cry baby!\u00a0 \u00a0Good thing my wife is\u00a0 3 million times\u00a0tougher\u00a0than me ! We\u2019ll visit the\u00a0cardiologist again\u00a0in 18 months just to have another check up and make sure everything is A-OK with his heart.\u00a0 Fantastic .\u00a0 Thank You. Thank You. Thank You. We wanted to say thank you so much to all of our friends on\u00a0 Twitter \u00a0and\u00a0 Facebook \u00a0for loving on our son so much. We really\u00a0appreciate\u00a0all of your prayers and\u00a0support\u00a0 I\u2019ve said this a million times, but we really do\u00a0 consider you guys our friends . Thanks for all of your\u00a0encouragement, and for being a part of our story with us. It really means a lot to us to know that are so many people\u00a0care about our son.

{"date": ",August,6,2012", "body": "[This post is a part of the \u201c New Parent Guide To Down Syndrome \u201d blog series. Be sure to check out the  other posts! ] \u201cWatch their head\u201d has a whole new meaning when handling most infants with  Down syndrome . You may have noticed\u00a0that your child with Down syndrome feels a bit different in your arms than a  typical  child.  Hypotonia  effects every muscle from the neck, abs, and even the mouth. It is not necessarily muscle weakness but a  decrease in tone . Tone involves tension or resistance held in a muscle at rest. This makes your child feel  floppy . There are various ways to look for hypotonia. When holding the child under their armpits they will practically slip through your fingers. Also when holding them in the palm of your hand they will lay like a wet noodle. You can pull up on their arms and look for head lag, and with hypotonia the baby will not be able to bring their head off the ground. Simply watching them in their bassist can also give you a hint as they will lay spread eagle with arms and legs outstretched just like Noah is below. 6 Tips On How To Hold An Infant With Down Syndrome I have handled a lot of infants in my training and hypotonia makes it a bit difficult. However it also makes for one snuggly baby. I can\u2019t get enough of Noah cuddles. As you start your adventure with Down syndrome you will start to do several exercises to help battle hypotonia. You will hear a lot about midline, meaning that your baby can bring their arms and legs to the middle. Here are some tips we learned on handling your baby as well as positions you can use. 1. Swaddling Swaddling your baby (like the above picture) will help them keep arms and legs midline (and sleep well). If you don\u2019t know how to swaddle watch this  awesome video  by our friends over at  The Fun House . You can use a large receiving blanket, or buy the handy  SwaddleMe Blanket \u00a0like the one we are using on Noah in the picture above.\u00a0I recommend the  velcro ones \u00a0because\u00a0as your child get older and starts to try to escape you can get them super tight and the become baby straight jackets. Noah couldn\u2019t figure out how to escape which meant that he and mommy slept longer. (And what mommy doesn\u2019t enjoy a little  extra  sleep.) \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 2. Provide extra support to the baby\u2019s head Provide extra support to the head and remind people who hold your baby to do the same. I know that people always say this with a newborn, but it is even more true with a child with hypotonia due to the head lag that we talked about earlier. When holding the baby up, try to avoid holding underneath the armpits as the child will slip through and you will put extra stress on those joints.  Hold around the rib cage  just beneath the armpits where you can get a firm  grasp  (as pictured above). You also want to creep your fingers up to the back of the neck to offer head support. 4. Pay attention to the limbs. Make sure you do not get their arms or legs caught in odd positions, as it is easy to overstretch their joints. Just be aware of where their limbs are as they can end up in some odd places without you noticing. 5. Sideline is your child\u2019s friend. Laying your child in a side lying position will help them bring their hands and legs midline and can help them play with toys and interact more with their environment The most important position your child should work on is tummy time. You want to do this as often as possible. They can lay flat on their belly or you can use a pillow (like a  Boppy Pillow ) to prop them up a bit. \u00a0This position will help them build head control which is needed before moving on to the next developmental steps. I hope these tips help you learn to hold and support your new infant with Down syndrome. Please be sure to leave a comment with any questions, and I\u2019d be happy to try to jump in and answer them. What challenges did you have when learning how to hold your new baby with Down syndrome. If you have other children in what ways did you find holding and supporting your child with Down syndrome different than with your children? Leave a comment and tell us about it, we\u2019d love to hear your feedback.

{"date": ",June,7,2012", "body": "Q: What\u2019s The Best Bottle For a Baby With Down Syndrome? A: The one that works! (read on) Since Noah was born I have become quite the expert on baby bottles. In fact, I have no shame in\u00a0admitting\u00a0that I know  way more  than a man should know bottles. \ud83d\ude42 Lost in a sea of baby bottles\u2026. I know the\u00a0difference\u00a0between slow-flow and fast flow; I know that some bottles have BPA in them (although\u00a0I\u2019m not really sure what BPA is, other than that it\u2019s bad for you!) I know that some baby bottle nipples are  naturally shaped  (meaning\u00a0they are shaped like a\u00a0woman\u2019s\u00a0breast) so that a baby can latch on to them more easily. U know there are traditional\u00a0shaped\u00a0nipples, vented\u00a0shaped\u00a0nipples, multi flow nipples, slotted multi flow nipples, and even adjustable nipples! There are orthodontic nipples, elongated nipples, bell shaped nipples, latex nipples, and silicone nipples (Wow, that\u2019s\u00a0a lot\u00a0of nipples!) Sure, I may know way more than any man should know about baby bottles, but it\u2019s all good. There\u2019s no shame in my baby bottle game. But you\u2019re probably wondering why (or how) I\u2019ve become such an expert on baby bottles. Let me explain. Finding the right bottle for our a baby with Down syndrome Although some children born with  Down syndrome  aren\u2019t able to breast feed, we were\u00a0fortunate\u00a0in that Noah could. However, when it was time for him to start using a bottle we had a hard time finding one that worked well for him. One of the\u00a0 characteristics\u00a0of Down syndrome  is hypotonia\u00a0(low muscle tone) which can make it hard for children with Down syndrome to use a bottle (and breast feed.) In\u00a0addition\u00a0to his low muscle tone, we also had some fear that he has aspirating while drinking from his bottle and had to have a  barium swallow study \u00a0preformed on him to rule it out (if you\u2019ve never seen a swallow study before, you can watch a short  video  of Noah\u2019s here.) \u00a0It turns out he wasn\u2019t aspirating at all, rather he was just drinking  way to fast . In other words, we needed to slow this cowboy down! So here we were on a mission to find the best bottle for our son with Down syndrome. I almost wore my fingers out searching google for the best bottles for children with Down syndrome. Then I thought we were going to have to take out a second\u00a0mortgage on our  new house  just so we could buy (and try out) all of these different baby bottles. Seriously, if you came over to our house you\u2019d think we were baby bottle testers\u00a0considering\u00a0how many different bottles we have stocked piled in our\u00a0cabinet. To be honest it was sort of\u00a0frustrating\u00a0trying to find a bottle that worked well with our son. We would buy one and milk would spill all over him (and us) when he drank from it. We\u2019d buy another and he\u2019d almost pass out trying to drink from of it due to how hard he had to suck to get anything out of it. We\u2019d get another and he\u2019d made all sorts of scary gasping /\u00a0choking\u00a0sounds (hence\u00a0the reason we did the sallow study.) All I wanted to do was find a bottle that worked well for my son, and allowed him to eat\u00a0comfortably, but it seemed like such a\u00a0challenge. I wondered if other parents had such a hard time finding a bottle that worked well. After much trail and error we finally found a few great bottles that seemed to really due to the trick. So which bottle worked best? I personally think all the\u00a0bottle reviews you\u2019ll find out there are\u00a0irrelevant. Every baby is unique and has different feeding needs. We were using using a speech /  feeding\u00a0therapist  with Noah and would bring Noah\u2019s bottle in with us to his speech\u00a0therapy\u00a0appointments\u00a0so she could watch him drink from it and give us feedback on how that particular\u00a0bottle\u00a0was working for him. If it wasn\u2019t working out, we would try a different one the next time. We repeated this\u00a0process\u00a0until we found one that worked best. In\u00a0addition, Noah\u2019s speech\u00a0therapist\u00a0had us use a  Z-Vibe  to perform the Beckman Oral Motor\u00a0exercises\u00a0on him, which helped him to gain\u00a0additional\u00a0muscle tone in his mouth, therefore helping him drink from his bottle (and breastfeed) better. I\u2019ll mention the three bottles that worked best for our son (and a bonus 4th bottle), but treat this list (and all the bottle reviews online) with a grain of salt. They provide a good starting point, but you\u2019ll want to work with your\u00a0child\u2019s\u00a0speech therapist and/or\u00a0pediatrician\u00a0in order to find the best bottle for your child. I\u2019ve learned that bottles are pretty much like everything else, what works well for one child may not (and probably won\u2019t)\u00a0necessarily\u00a0work well with your child. I think choosing the best bottle for a child with Down syndrome (or any child) boils down to trail and error. Yes, it will be  costly . Yes, you may get\u00a0frustrated\u00a0when you spend money on a bottle only to have to shelf it\u00a0because\u00a0it didn\u2019t work well with your child (even though the online reviews said it was \u201cthe best.\u201d) Yes, you\u2019ll go through a lot of bibs as milk spills all over the place. But in the end, it\u2019s all worth it. As you can see in today\u2019s video, Noah really enjoys drinking from his bottle, and feeding time has become a much more positive time for us. With that being said, if you are looking for a good bottle for your son or daughter with Down\u00a0syndrome, here are a few that we had\u00a0successes\u00a0with during our bottle hunt. Feel free try one (or none) of them out. Like I said, these are just what worked for us, and may / may not work well for your child. 1.\u00a0Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottles The  Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottle \u00a0is the one Noah\u2019s using in today\u2019s video (and the one we have stuck with.) It\u2019s a great bottle, and the only thing I don\u2019t like about the AVENT bottle is that it\u2019s short and fat (instead of tall and skinny like most other bottles) which makes it hard for him to hold by himself. However, you\u2019ll notice in today\u2019s video that he\u2019s\u00a0actually\u00a0holding the bottle by himself for the first time! I\u2019m so  proud  of this little boy. This is our go to bottle for Noah, and a winner for us (and him!) \u00a0\ud83d\ude42 2. Playtex Drop-ins Nurser Bottles The  Playtex Drop Ins Nurser Bottle \u00a0uses little \u201cdrop in\u201d bottle liners that are supposed to help keep the air out of the bottle while your baby is drinking from them. My wife really liked them, but I\u00a0personally\u00a0didn\u2019t. The bottles are fine, I\u2019m just not a fan of the liners. I think they\u2019re messy, and I found it sort of hard to push the liner up into the bottle as he was drinking. My hand was to big to fit inside the bottom of the bottle to push the liner up so I had to use a wooden spoon. To much work if you ask me. (Like I mentioned above, this is just my personal\u00a0opinion. They are great bottles, I just didn\u2019t like the liners.) 3. The First Years Breastflow Bottle The  First Years Breastflow Bottle \u00a0is another great bottle. They are designed to mimic a mothers breast, which they claim allows for the breast milk or formula to flow naturally like their mothers breast. Noah did really well with this bottle, although not quite as well as he did with the AVENT bottle I mentioned above. Bouns Bottle: Medela Storage Bottles I\u00a0wanted\u00a0to mention these  Medela Storage Bottles \u00a0briefly. Although they are meant to store breast milk from the Medela Breast pump system, we found they worked really well for Noah once he was a little older (10-12 months) since he wasn\u2019t really\u00a0having\u00a0a problem drinking from a bottle at that point and we\u00a0weren\u2019t as\u00a0concerned\u00a0with flow as we were when he was younger. I liked these bottles\u00a0because\u00a0they are so small which enabled Noah (and his small hands) to hold on to them by himself. (The other bottles I mentioned are much bigger, and he had a hold time wrapping his small hand around them, and holding them by himself when they were full of liquid due to how heavy they became.) The only drawback is these bottles only hold 2 ounces so if you are doing a typical 8 ounce feeding you have to fill them up four times. This is ok with me since Noah had such a great since of accomplishment holding and drinking from his bottle with  no help  from mom or dad. How about you? What bottles have you tried and liked (or disliked?) Did you have a hard time finding your child a bottle that worked well for them? Take a second to leave a comment and tell us about your baby bottle experience. \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00433OQO6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rickwsmcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00433OQO6", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006FHBAQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rickwsmcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0006FHBAQ", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R1SOSG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rickwsmcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001R1SOSG", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XBX4K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rickwsmcom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0009XBX4K"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/best-bottle-down-syndrome/", "title": "Choosing The Best Bottle For A Baby With Down Syndrome, And 3 Recommendations."},
{"date": ",August,7,2013", "body": "We\u2019re excited to announce that  NOAH\u2019S A BIG BROTHER!!! And as you can tell by looking at that super duper smile on this face, he is excited!!! And so are we! In fact, we got to see our new baby and hear his/her heart beat for the first time last week\u2026and yes, I teared up! New life is such a beautiful thing. Like all proud parents I have no shame in sharing pictures and videos of my children every chance I get (yes, I\u2019m one of  those  parents) so let me be the first to introduce you to either\u00a0Speck Wildhorse Smith (if we have a boy) or\u00a0Audio Science Smith (if we have a girl.) \u2026..Just kidding, I saw those names on a list of the  strangest celebrity baby names ! (Although\u00a0Pilot Inspektor Smith does have a nice ring to it.) \ud83d\ude42 Introducing Noah\u2019s Brand New Little Brother Or Sister! If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video is worth millions. Just take a few seconds and watch the video of our 9 week old baby\u2019s heart beating. (For real, you won\u2019t be disappointed.) I mean seriously. THAT IS THE SOUND OF A 9 WEEK OLD\u2019S HEART BEATING INSDIE OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING! IS THAT CRAZY OR WHAT?!!?? I have no idea how anyone could listen to something like that and believe that 1.) The little baby growing inside my wife isn\u2019t a human being, and 2.) That there isn\u2019t a God. #MindBlown Will We Be Doing Any Sort Of Prenatal Testing? If you read  Noah\u2019s birth story , then you know we didn\u2019t know Noah had Down syndrome until 3 hours after he was born. It was a total surprise to us. (Talk about a shock.) We didn\u2019t do any testing when my wife was pregnant with Noah, and we aren\u2019t going to do any this go round either. I\u2019m not against prenatal testing  if  it\u2019s used to help a parent prepare for any surprises in advance, and  not  for checking to see if a child is worthy to born. (Did you know  a mother\u2019s womb is the most dangerous place in the world for a child with Down syndrome ?) I personally think all of these prenatal tests cause more stress, worry, and anxiety they they are worth, and would personally never want to have them preformed. Most importantly, the results of the test wouldn\u2019t change anything for us in any way. God\u2019s been in the business of making people for a very long, and He\u2019s really good at it. We trust Him\u2026no matter what He has up His sleeve. \ud83d\ude42 God Knows What He\u2019s Doing I do have some \u00a0thoughts to share about how I feel regarding having a child after having a child with\u00a0 Down syndrome. \u00a0This pregnancy feels different (emotionally) than when my wife was\u00a0pregnant\u00a0with Noah. I\u2019m still processing some of it, and will share more in a later post. It doesn\u2019t feel different in a bad way, it just feels different. Again, we trust God. He\u2019s in control. He knows what He\u2019s doing. And if I\u2019ve learned anything from Noah\u2019s birth, it\u2019s: God\u2019s plan is ALWAYS better than my plan, and His plan is usually always DIFFERENT than my plan. And I\u2019m ok with that. Oh\u2026and one more thing\u2026..I totally should have thought through the name of my website a little more! \ud83d\ude42 I can\u2019t wait to share more about our new little baby with you as he/she grows and develops! Noah is so excited to be a big brother, and we are so excited to welcome a new little one to our family!

{"date": ",August,4,2012", "body": "I believe there are a handful of events that occur in a person\u2019s life that changes them forever. We\u2019re pretty confidant we\u2019d recognize these events the movement they happen. In some cases we will, but more often than not we won\u2019t. In fact, we may not fully understand how one of these events has changed our life until long after the event occurs. These events often camouflage themselves in the routine. In the normal everyday things we do, day in and day out. It was during the course of one of these normal, everyday, activities that I\u00a0was blindsided\u00a0by an event that changed my life, and the\u00a0life\u2019s\u00a0of\u00a0thousands\u00a0of others. Forever. Let me tell you about\u2026. The Target Post That Changed Everything I remember it like it was yesterday. I was sitting at the same wobbly table, in the same\u00a0uncomfortable\u00a0wooden chair, at the same local\u00a0Starbucks I always go to when I like to write blog posts and drink coffee. I had just came across a Target ad that featured a young child model ( Ryan Langston ) that just so\u00a0happened\u00a0to have been born with  Down syndrome , like our son, Noah. I thought it was pretty cool so I decided to write a blog post about it before heading home. I titled the post, \u201c Target Is \u2018Down\u2019 With Down Syndrome: 5 Things Target Said By Saying Nothing At All \u201d and wrote about a few things\u00a0about\u00a0the ad that really stood out to me as a father raising a\u00a0child\u00a0with special needs, specifically Down syndrome. Nothing Fancy. Nothing special. It was just a quick blog post I wrote while sipping on some Pike Place (I\u2019m a house coffee kind of guy.) It\u00a0certainly\u00a0wasn\u2019t going to win a\u00a0 Pulitzer Prize . In fact, just a few months prior I had written an  Open Letter To GQ\u00a0Magazine \u00a0which didn\u2019t generate anywhere near the same kind of attention of this blog post. Another day, another post. At this point in time (back in\u00a0January\u00a0of 2012) I was publishing a new blog post pretty much every day, and had been for months. Our site had a growing community behind it, as did  Noah\u2019s Dad Facebook page , and\u00a0I enjoyed getting to meet so many new and\u00a0seasoned\u00a0parents raising children with Down syndrome. All of that to say there was nothing\u00a0particularly\u00a0 special  about this particular\u00a0blog post. Before I pushed the publish button on this post I had been blogging for months on this very website. I had been blogging for years before becoming Noah\u2019s Dad on my personal site. And I\u2019ve been a tech geek every since I first heard those three magical words, \u201c You\u2019ve got mail .\u201d I mention all of that just to say I didn\u2019t  feel  anything\u00a0different\u00a0when I wrote this post. I didn\u2019t think there was anything\u00a0 special  about this blog post, or that it was soon to go viral. In fact, by the time I had finished writing it, I was already thinking about what I was going to write the next day. It seriously felt just like blog post. Nothing super-duper. Now I will say I try to spend a lot of time and effort on each and every post I publish, so that it brings value to those of you who take the time to read them. So while it still took some time to write, it didn\u2019t\u00a0necessarily\u00a0take any more time. It was all in a day\u2019s work. Another day, another post, so to speak. \ud83d\ude42 ***** I hit the publish button. Closed my\u00a0laptop. Finished up my coffee. And headed home. Blog post written. Mission\u00a0accomplished. Looking forward to having some family time, some dinner, and some fun with my wife and son. I checked my stats at the end of the day and noticed a huge traffic spike from the time I published that blog post to the time I was crawling in to bed. In fact, here\u2019s what I saw: Wow! That\u2019s a lot of web traffic for one day! But we had gotten large traffic spikes in the past, and figured it would go back down to normal the next day. Boy was I wrong\u2026 **** Day 2 (or) The day my website almost blew up! I woke up the next morning to an inbox full of messages from  reporters , notes from people all over the world that had read the blog post\u2026.and from the company that hosted our website saying that I had  greatly exceeded \u00a0my web hosting bandwidth\u2026.ooops.. In fact, it hadn\u2019t even been 24 hours since I hit the publish button and I already had  millions of hits ! I thought my website was going to blow up! Thankfully they upgraded me to a private server fairly quick, and my site was only down for a few hours. As you can the page views jumped quite a bit on day 2, especially with my site being down for several hours through out the day, and at other times running extremely slow as it tried to keep up with the traffic it was\u00a0receiving. (Side note: For those of you who may not be as geeky, or why it looks like I only\u00a0 had \u00a0a few\u00a0hundred\u00a0thousand views instead of millions, let me explain. Page impressions are the number of\u00a0 pages \u00a0on a website that are viewed in a single day. A website\u00a0 hit \u00a0is the number or requests made to a\u00a0web-sever\u00a0in a single day. Each time a person views a single page on a website\u00a0multiple\u00a0requests are being made to the server that runs that website in order to load the page. In other words every image, style sheet, video, java script file, etc a page contains would require a request to the server (a hit) for that\u00a0particular\u00a0file. This, by the way, is why our then current web host wasn\u2019t very happy when this post went viral. Our server wasn\u2019t\u00a0equipped\u00a0to handle millions of hits a day (nor did it need to be) however this site now runs on a much more\u00a0sophisticated server that works well for our sites unique needs.) To say I was surprised that the blog post was receiving so much traffic and attention would be an\u00a0understatement. But for some reason this\u00a0particular\u00a0blog post seemed to really resonate with people. However, I figured the almost 80 thousand page views I had on January 3rd would pretty much be the end of it. Boy was I wrong\u2026.again\u2026. **** Day 3 (or) The day my life\u00a0changed. Seriously. I woke up on January 4th seriously thinking everything was going to calm down. That my site traffic would dip back down to normal, and everything would level off. Well, it didn\u2019t. I had even more emails and phone calls from the press wanting to talk to me about our site, our story the target ad, why we were so passionate about helping the world learn about Down syndrome. It was\u00a0unbelievable. We talked with  Time ,  Headline News ,  ABC , and various other news outlets; all of which wanted to help us spread the\u00a0message\u00a0that Down syndrome is ok! And the traffic didn\u2019t die down: In fact we ended up with over  40 million hits  for the month of January.\u00a0Unbelievable! (Good thing we upgraded our server!) This is the point where everything changes. This Target blog post is the point in our story where everything went into full speed ahead mode for us. It\u2019s the point in our story where everything changed, and I wanted to be sure I talked about since it is such a huge part of story. Throughout the course of all of this  media blitz  friendships\u00a0were being formed between people all over the world. Some met in the comments section of our blog, others on our fast growing, and very active Facebook page. But it was happening and it hasn\u2019t stopped. I\u2019m not sure where it will all lead, but we are just honored to be a part in it. To join with the thousands of other amazing families who are telling\u00a0their\u00a0stories as well. Thanks for your friendship, support,\u00a0encouragement, and most of all for letting us be a part of your life. It\u00a0truly\u00a0is an honor. If you\u2019ve been following our blog, you may have noticed we\u2019re just a  tiny \u00a0bit behind (Heck, we just got around to posting about  Christmas !) \u00a0The reason for this is we are telling the story of  Noah\u2019s life  via one minute videos (in the order they\u00a0happened.) \u00a0You\u2019ll be able to keep track of where we are in his story via the data that appears quickly before each video. We are trying to get caught up as fast as we can, so we can blog at \u201creal time.\u201d Thanks for being\u00a0patient\u00a0with us, and for following (and sharing) our story. Keep telling your story! It\u2019s powerful, and next time it could be you! I meet so many people who tell me they either a.) want to start a blog but don\u2019t\u00a0know\u00a0how, or b.) feel disappointed\u00a0because\u00a0not many people read their blog. I\u2019m going to\u00a0elaborate\u00a0on these in an upcoming blog series, but i wanted to just touch on them real quick. Anyone can start a blog. Yes, even you! If you don\u2019t already have a blog, don\u2019t know how, think it\u2019s confusing, etc\u2026it\u2019s not! There are\u00a0seriously\u00a0so many tools\u00a0available\u00a0to help you get started that creating your own blog is seriously  grandma-proof  (no offense to all the tech-savy grandmothers out there!) If you have every thought about starting a blog, but ended up not because you thought it would be to hard, think again! Now is the time. I\u2019m going to be writing an upcoming\u00a0series\u00a0on blogging including why I think every parent of a child with  special needs  should have a blog, some step by step tutorials on how to get started, etc. If you\u2019d be\u00a0interested\u00a0in me writing something like this, or any any suggestions of a topic you\u2019d like me to write on relating to blogging, please let me know in the comments. As I\u2019ve said a million times,  you have a story to tell , and if I can play any role in helping you tell it, I want to to do it! Want more blog readers? Be sure you\u2019re paying attention to these 5 blog essentials! I\u2019m often asked by people how they can get more traffic to their blog. I mean heck, writing a blog takes a lot of time, and if you didn\u2019t want\u00a0anyone\u00a0reading what you wrote you\u2019d start a diary, not a blog, right? I\u2019ll be honest I don\u2019t have a magical\u00a0formula, but there are 5\u00a0characteristics\u00a0I\u2019ve noticed about blogs that have a high level of\u00a0readership. I\u2019ll\u00a0elaborate\u00a0on each of these when I write my blogging series, but\u00a0briefly\u00a0here they are: 1. Passion This one is simple. Blog about what you are passionate about. For me, I blog about my experience as a new parent raising a boy born with Down syndrome. I\u2019m head over hills in love with my son, so it\u2019s easy for me to write about that \u201ctopic.\u201d I could never write a blog about  Tupperware  for instance\u00a0because\u00a0it\u2019s not my passion. But to each his own. 2. Consistency: \u00a0 This one can be a bit challenging, but it\u2019s a simple concept. If you want to have a blog that people read, you actually have to  add  new content on a consistent basis for them  to  read. I\u2019ve seen a lot of blogs that haven\u2019t been updated in months (sometimes years!) You can\u2019t do that and expect to have a lot of readers. I mean why would they keep coming back to your blog if there is nothing new for them to read? You should be telling a story through your blog and it\u2019s important that you don\u2019t just leave your readers hanging. I tell most people starting out to try to write a new blog post at least once a week. Which should be easy since you\u2019re writing about what your passionate about, right? 3. Community:  Don\u2019t make your blog all about you. Get to know people through your blog. Respond to comments. Ask questions about their family, etc. As your blog grows and you get more and more comments you may not be able to respond to each and everyone, but I think it\u2019s important to reply to as many as you can. Not because it\u2019s some unfun blog chore that you  have  to do, but because it\u2019s genuinely fun to get to know and build\u00a0relationships\u00a0with other people.\u00a0We think it\u2019s an honor when someone takes time to leave a comment on our blog. We love getting to know people, and comments is a great way for us to do that. We don\u2019t always get to reply to each one, but we try, and we always read every single one. One of the great side\u00a0benefits\u00a0of building a community around your blog is that as your readers get to know and trust you more they will tell others about you (word of mouth.) Treat your blog readers well, get to know them, become their friends, and  genuinely\u00a0care about them  and they will send more and more readers your way. I mean why wouldn\u2019t they?\u00a0They want their friends and family to experience the same great community they are. It\u2019s a win-win! \ud83d\ude42 4. Luck:  When I pushed the publish button on this Target blog post I would have never guessed in a million years it was going to go viral, and have an impact on millions of people across the globe. It was seriously just a little luck, and a lot of God (but that\u2019s a different story.) You can\u2019t know when something like that is going to happen, but if you are writing about what you are passionate about, and creating a community around your blog, you are certainly putting yourself in a good position for luck to find you. \ud83d\ude42 5. Kindness:  I think kindness may be the  most important  awesome blog\u00a0characteristic\u00a0of them all. You know, The Golden Rule. Treating others as you would like to be treated. Not being a meany. I think this one sort of takes care of itself if you following the first characteristic\u00a0and blogging about what you are passionate about. I don\u2019t know to many people that are\u00a0passionate\u00a0about being unkind to others, if you know what I mean. Of course, it\u2019s your blog, and you can write about whatever you choose to write about, but in the long run I\u2019ve found that being kind goes a long way in building an online community around your blog, and\u00a0ultimately increasing\u00a0your website traffic. People aren\u2019t huge fans of negativity. They are drawn to things that are positive. Things that inspire them. Things that help them solve a problem. Things that teach them something new. People are drawn to powerful stories. And if you are a parent trust me, you have a  powerful story . Sure you can use your blog to write about a bad experience you had at a local\u00a0restaurant, or about a grudge you have with a family member, but why? Life\u2019s to short, and let\u2019s be honest it\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0really help anyone. And if you do this often enough people may start to get confused on what your actually passionate about. So my advice is to focus your time (and writing) on things that help and\u00a0encourage, not tear down and\u00a0destroy. I have found that that simply works best. Changing the world doesn\u2019t always feel \u201cmagical.\u201d So that\u2019s the story behind my most popular blog post of all time. It could happen to any of you, and it should. Just remember you don\u2019t always\u00a0recognize\u00a0life changing events the\u00a0moments\u00a0they happen. They\u00a0camouflage\u00a0themselves\u00a0in the routine. In daily blog posts. In walks to the park with your children. In creating  family\u00a0traditions . In\u00a0 Celebrating\u00a0wins . And in all the other wonderful things we so often we take for granted. But never forget that its typically in the course of these daily  routine  run-of-the-mill non-events where we find find ourself being blindsided by something that changes our life for ever. A wow moment. A  game changing \u00a0moment. So stay faithful, stay at it, and most of all  keep telling your story . You never know how many people your story could impact, and even if it  only  impacts one person, you\u00a0succeeded\u00a0in changing that person\u2019s world forever. Changing\u00a0the world doesn\u2019t always feel magical. Most of the time it feels pretty routine. Never forget that.\u00a0 As for me, my world is changed forever. We\u2019ve joined with the many others you are working so hard to show the world that Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0is ok. We\u2019ve given millions of people a window into the life of a family raising a child with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0and showed them that it\u2019s ok. We don\u2019t live in a sad story. We live in a great one. We have met many new friends who are helping to change the world as well. We\u2019ve seen the need for more and more people to tell their stories, and to keep getting these stories in front of the world. To help them exchange\u00a0inaccurate\u00a0and false assumptions about people with Down syndrome with accurate and true ones. The almost 20 thousand families on our Facebook page help us to this. Every time you post a pictures, share a story, or give someone a word of\u00a0encouragement, the world see that, and they take notice. They see stories about our kids and our families and they see we are ok. Sure there are challenges, but so what?! The joy we get in return makes all the challenges worth it. We are ok. And we are showing the world we are ok. And the world is changing. Slowly, but it\u2019s changing. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to each and everyone of you. It\u2019s an honor to be on this journey with you.\u00a0Collectively\u00a0we are making a difference. I also want to thank\u00a0 Tim Nudd  who mentioned the Target post an article he wrote for\u00a0 AdWeek \u00a0that I believe played a huge role in the mainstream media picking up the story. I\u2019m not sure he even knew just how wide this story was going to spread, but I\u00a0appreciate\u00a0the attention he gave to this issue, and helping the eyes of the world see that  children with Down syndrome are our co-equals . They aren\u2019t  less than . They are fully worthy of life just like us. Just like every person on this planet. Thank you Tim. Have you ever thought about starting a blog to tell your story? If you have a blog now, why did you start it? What\u2019s the biggest challenge in keeping up with it. And what do you like most about blogging? Take a minute to leave a comment and tell us about it.

When I first learned that Noah was  born with Down syndrome  I worried about how different Noah would be than  typical  kids, and that scared me. It turns out that  raising a child with Down syndrome is much more normal  than I would have ever imagined. Like over  150 million other people , I\u2019ve been sharing images almost daily to our  Instagram account . I\u2019ve been doing this\u00a0for a few years now in my attempt to show the world than children with Down syndrome are much more \u201clike\u201d other than children than \u201cunlike\u201d them. So I thought I\u2019d take a look through my Instagram archives to see how many pictures I\u2019ve snapped and shared of Noah eating one of his favorite foods,  Eggo Waffles .\u00a0It turns out there were six, and here they are. Random. But cute. Enjoy. 6 Cute Pictures Of My Child Eating Waffles I could watch this kid eat waffles all day! What\u2019s your kid\u2019s favorite food to eat?

{"date": ",October,23,2013", "body": "I\u2019ll be honest, when Noah was born pretty  everything I knew about Down Syndrome I learned by watching TV . I \u00a0knew very little about what life was like for a person with  Down syndrome , and had a lot of fears and questions about my child\u2019s future. I wondered if he would play like  typical  kids. If he would smile and laugh like  typical  kids. If he would go to college like  typical  kids.  And if he would ever be able to drive a car like\u00a0 typical  kids. As I\u2019ve mentioned before most of my fears were  never came true , and the fact is there are people with Down syndrome that can do all of the things mentioned above\u2026 including getting their driver\u2019s license and driving a car! Down Syndrome And Driver\u2019s Licenses From time to time I\u2019m asked questions like, \u201cCan people with Down syndrome drive a car?\u201d or \u201cCan people with Down syndrome get their driver\u2019s license?\u201d and since I\u2019ve  heard  stories of people with Down syndrome driving, I\u2019ll typically answer \u201cSure, they can!\u201d However, I thought I\u2019d take some time to do some research and publish a post about it so the next time I\u2019m asked the question I can send it to them (and so can you.) I have to say, I was encouraged by all of the stories I found as I was writing this post. People with Down syndrome are breaking all sorts of inaccurate stereotypes and  accomplishing milestones  many (wrongly) assumed they never would (or could.) 7 Stories Of People With Down Syndrome Who Got Their Driver\u2019s License I want to remind you that getting a driver\u2019s license doesn\u2019t determine a person\u2019s worth. A person has value and purpose  simply because they are created in the image of God , regardless of anything they do or don\u2019t do here on Earth. The truth is, Noah may never get his driver\u2019s license or drive a car, and I\u2019m ok with that. I really am. I choose to\u00a0 celebrate, not compare \u00a0our boy to anyone else. Noah is unique, and is his own person. Heck, he\u2019s not even three years old yet and is already\u00a0 making a difference all over the world ! I love this kid. I hope the stories listed below encourage you and that after reading it you help us create more  awareness  by sharing this article on you Facebook, twitter, linking to it on your blog, etc! Thanks so much! 1. Jay Nothnagle A came across Jay\u2019s story on the  National Down Syndrome Society\u2019s website \u00a0and was greatly encouraged! When Jay was 16 his parents enrolled him in a driver\u2019s education course at his high school and he took the courses but not the exam. When Jay was 18 his neuro-psychological exam indicated that his judgment and problem solving skills where at a level of \u00a0a 15 or 16-year-old (which is the average driving age for many teenagers.) Jay\u2019s parents got him a tutor who helped him study for the drivers permit test and after six months of studying was able to pass the oral exam on his first try! Then Jay preformed his driving evaluation at a local rehabilitation hospital with a driving simulator, which Jay also passed with flying colors! But receiving his driver\u2019s permit wasn\u2019t enough\u2026. Jay\u2019s driver\u2019s ed teacher worked with him and his parents drove with him for an hour a day for six month. When he was 21 years old he took the driver\u2019s license test and passed it with  no restrictions  except eye glasses! Jay has his own truck and drives to work, Special olympic practices and social events! How cool is this! I\u2019m proud of Jay and I don\u2019t even know him! Source:  A Green Light To Driving 2. John Marrs When John was 15 years old he started his driver\u2019s training classes, and received his drivers permit which allowed him to drive with an adult. Then at 18 his parents took him to the DMV where he was able to pass his driving tests and become a licensed driver! Source:  Young Man With Down Syndrome Gets His Driver\u2019s License 3. William Loughane William Loughane, a 26-year-old, special olympic gold medallist, was the first person with Down syndrome in Ireland to receive his Driver\u2019s license. William drives his Toyota Yaris to commute to his job, and to go into town! Source:  Man With Down\u2019s syndrome become first to pass driving test 4. Clayton Marr Clayton Marr was the second, and youngest, person with Down syndrome in New Zealand to receive his Driver\u2019s license at 19 years old. Clayton helps his mom and dad put wine into boxes, tapes them up, and takes them to local supermarkets in his\u00a0Mercedez-Benz smart car. I also agree with this great quote from Clayton\u2019s dad: It\u2019s important young people with Down syndrome keep in touch with mainstream kids. One reason they achieve so much this way is because they set goals against their peers\u2026 Source:  Down Syndrome Teen Gets License 5. Kelly Fitgerald Kelly Fitgerald is one of only two people with Down Syndrome in New Zealand that has her full driver\u2019s license (I\u2019m assuming Clayton is the other.) Check out this video to learn more about Kelly\u2019s story. 6. Meredith Martin Meredith is a 24-year-old women with Down syndrome from Nebraska who has her own apartment, has three jobs (works at a local hospital, a grocery store, and an assisted living facility\u2026wow!) and has her driver\u2019s license! She\u2019s also active in her church, her community, and enjoys kickboxing, pilates and riding her bike! Wow, you go girl! Source:  National Down Syndrome Congress Self Advocate Council 7. Jon Jon is a volunteer at Petaluma Valley Hospital and drives to visit patients, take their requests for meals, delivers flowers, and helps our when needed\u2026and has his driver\u2019s license! His mother says that Jon is the best driver out of all their children, because he never speeds or takes chances, in other words he is careful. And how about this, because Jon has his driver\u2019s license he gets to take his girlfriend of 4 years on dates to the movies\u2026by himself! Now that\u2019s pretty awesome\u2026and encouraging! Source:  How Jon Learned To Drive These are just a few stories I found of people with Down syndrome driving cars and getting their driver\u2019s license. What I find really encouraging is that these stories are from the last few years which means we are just getting started! \u00a0The future really is bright for people with Down syndrome! What\u2019s your thought after reading this post? Do you know other people with Down syndrome who have their driver\u2019s license?

It doesn\u2019t matter if you have a child with special needs, or a  typical child,\u00a0 this hotel has you covered! There isn\u2019t much to today\u2019s video because I wanted to enjoy my time with Noah and my wife and not be worrying about trying to take a video. Not to mention this hotel has a fantastic\u00a0 waterpark  (complete with a lazy river!) built in so I left my phone / video camera in the hotel most of the time and enjoyed the fun! (But I hope you still enjoyed seeing him splash around in the kiddy pool!) If you\u2019re looking for a vacation that your entire family can enjoy, this is your place. It\u2019s hard to believe this place is so close to  our house\u00a0 (San Antonio is about a four hour drive from Dallas.) \u00a0There\u2019s so much to do at the JW Marriott that you feel like you\u2019re at a tropical oasis, not a mere four hours from the hustle and bustle of Dallas! We spent a lot of the day just hanging out by the pool relaxing. It was nice! I was especially glad that I could catch up on a little reading. \ud83d\ude42 Noah\u2019s a  huge fan  of the water! He loves  pool parties ,  beaches , and  boats \u2026.just not  dolphins ! The resort has a really fun kiddy pool and I enjoyed getting in the water with Noah and splashing around. I also enjoy watching him just play and have fun. This little kid\u2019s laughter and joy is contagious! We had a fun time visiting  Sea World , and having out at the JW Marriott Hill Country Resort.

(Although we\u2019re not eating nearly as good as we\u2019re accustom to\u2026my wife is an  amazing  cook!) One of Noah\u2019s (and my) favorite toys are his  Duplo cars \u00a0and  Lego City sets . They are easy for him to play with, he gets a ton of use out of them, and they have a ton of great  occupational therapy  benefits.\u00a0I\u2019m pretty sure\u00a0he could play with them all day long (as could I.)

{"date": ",October,25,2013", "body": "Creativity and imagination are important skills to work on in childhood just like learning to  crawl  and  communicate . A lot of people think that creativity is a gift, but I truly think creativity is something that can be practiced and developed. Imagination is also becoming more of a lost skill as kids are sitting in front of TVs that provide all the imagination they think that they need rather than creating the stories themselves. Creativity Has No Limits Today I wanted to help Noah explore his creative side. When I think of Noah\u2019s future I hope that there are  no limits  for him, but I also sometimes worry about what his future holds. I figure that the arts are a way for him to express himself  without limits  whether it be painting, drama, music, cooking, taking pictures, etc. There are several great programs and people we have already been exposed to that express themselves artistically while also happening to have Down syndrome. For example, recently I was encouraged by the fact that  Will and Kate are putting the artwork of\u00a0Tazia Fawley\u00a0up in Prince George\u2019s room . I was impressed by Tazia\u2019s steady hand and brilliant use of colors. I want to encourage that behavior in Noah at a young age. I was far from talented at art, but what child doesn\u2019t love creating something on their own? I remember being so proud to show my parents my art work, to have my mom use a pot holder that I had woven together, or to play the piano with them listening. Finger Painting Is A Great Start We\u2019ve never done finger painting so I thought why not start with that? (Be sure to check out the cute video below.) I know you\u2019re probably wondering how I\u2019m going to get over the mess based on my issues with  self-feeding , but I came up with a brilliant idea of letting Noah fingerprint this in his plastic swimming pool! It was a short adventure but I think Noah liked it. The biggest challenge was getting Noah to  keep the paint out of his mouth! We were using non toxic paint, however  Pinterest  has some recipes for  finger paints that are ok to eat  which may be a better option.\u00a0I simply put globs of paint on the paper and encouraged Noah to get his hands dirty, or maybe I should say colorful. Noah\u2019s art is proudly displayed in our playroom today. I think this was as encouraging to me as it was for him. Hopefully this is just the first of his artistic adventures. I was inspired to look at other great ways to cultivate creativity and came up with these ideas as well as awesome products to help our little ones create and develop their creativity at the same time! Activities, Toys and Books to Cultivate Creativity Inspiration I\u2019m absolutely fascinated by this book by Usborne titled  My Very First Art Book . It provides you with an example of someone\u2019s art work like Rembrandt or Edgar Degas followed by an activity inspired by that style. It shows you how to use various techniques such as ripped paper, splattering paint, collage, prints, dots, to simply using a brush to create works of art similar to the artist featured. \u00a0I never know where to begin when I sit down with crayons and a blank piece of paper myself and this is an excellent idea starter for both you and your child. Painting Painting is an excellent way to let your child explore creativity while getting the bonus of working on fine motor skills. \u00a0Starting with finger painting and moving up to a brush. \u00a0We used\u00a0 Crayola Finger Paints \u00a0and  Melissa and Doug Finger Paint Paper Pad \u00a0to\u00a0create Noah\u2019s masterpieces and they worked really well. \u00a0The colors were bright and he was surprisingly easy to clean afterwards. \u00a0When looking for brushes, I found\u00a0 Melissa and Doug Jumbo Paint Brushes \u00a0which seem to be the perfect size for Noah\u2019s hands to help him grip. What painter doesn\u2019t need an easel. \u00a0I personally like  Ikea\u2019s easel  as it is very cheap, but the  Artist Easel  by KidKraft looks awesome as well. And don\u2019t forget the  spill proof paint cups . Beyond Paper Creativity goes beyond paper. You can make models, structures or even puppets.  Play-Doh  is an excellent way to help your little one use their hands to create something. I know I struggle with what to make with Play-doh besides a snake, but there are several kits that can get you started with ideas such as  The Fun Factory Deluxe Set If you follow our  Facebook page  you realize my husband enjoys building with Legos. This too is a great way to broaden the imagination especially if you create something different than the picture on the box. Pinterest also had a great idea of creating your own  lego puzzle book  to challenge your kids. \u00a0I thought that would be a great idea to help Noah learn patterns and colors. \u00a0We have started with the  Duplo  blocks which  he (and my husband) love . I found a really cool kit that helps you  make your own sock puppet . \u00a0Thanks to the laundry monster we have a lot of single socks in our drawers and I know that Noah would not only like making them but seeing them come to life. \u00a0Rick is an excellent story teller and is able to come up with amazing adventures on the spur of the moment. \u00a0These socks don\u2019t know what they are in for. Cooking Don\u2019t forget the kitchen! This is where I express my creativity lately, and I\u2019ll admit it is not always a good ending.:) Based on the fact that chefs are predominately male I am not quite sure why kitchen sets are usually catered towards females. This didn\u2019t stop us from getting the amazing  KidKraft Espresso Kitchen  that I am slightly jealous of since it is nicer than my own kitchen. Noah has just started creating his own masterpieces in his little kitchen and serving them to me. We\u2019ve added things like cookies in the oven, a tea kettle on the stove, and\u00a0 Betty Crocker 43 piece Pots and Pan set  \u00a0has\u00a0a good combination of food and supplies. I hope to continue this in the future by bringing Noah into my not so fancy kitchen and having him help out. Hopefully it will move beyond him just licking the bowl. \u00a0 Imaginative Play Toys such as  Fisher Price Little People Animal Sounds Farm  or any of their Little People products encourage imaginative play. \u00a0I love when Noah sets up his animals and places them in various positions around the farm. They often get a ride in the  Kidoozie Tractor \u00a0around the farm. \u00a0There are several play sets that allow kids to create stories and activities themselves. As great as  cause and effect  toys are, there is something special about seeing your child making up their own activities based on their imagination. \u00a0 Music One of Noah\u2019s favorite ways to get express his creativity is to rock out on some musical instruments. His favorite probably being the drum and the maracas. He has spent a little time on the keyboard too. \u00a0 B. Parum Pum Pum Drum  comes with not only a drum but a variety of musical instruments your child may enjoy. I was a piano player myself and wouldn\u2019t mind seeing if Noah could one day learn to read music and play an instrument of his choice. What things do you do at home to cultivate creativity? \u00a0What is your child\u2019s favorite creative activity? Do you children like to participate in any of the arts? How do you encourage their creativity?\u00a0 We\u2019d love to hear some of your ideas, favorite websites for inspiration, photos, etc in the comments below!\u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/will-kate-painting-gift_n_3915196.html", "http://www.pinterest.com/noahdaddotcom/", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/69172544247185277/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0794530184/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0794530184&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004UBH3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00004UBH3&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ID2YBW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ID2YBW&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5J7W0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000M5J7W0&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50021076/", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T1EVW6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002T1EVW6&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAB7I4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FAB7I4&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IWIT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00000IWIT&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZZV22U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000ZZV22U&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://facebook.com/noahsdadcom/", "http://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=lego%20puzzle%20book", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RL7VNO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002RL7VNO&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017L3SPU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0017L3SPU&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00592BOAO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00592BOAO&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NNMSVG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002NNMSVG&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQHYWK4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CQHYWK4&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063JQJ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000063JQJ&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WE34HC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003WE34HC&linkCode=as2&tag=rickwsmcom-20"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/develop-creativity-in-children/", "title": "The Epic List Of Activities, Toys And Fun Ideas To Help Your Child Develop Their Creativity"},

Not to mention this kid is  changing the world  in more ways than I\u2019ll ever know this side of Heaven\u2026and I think that\u2019s awesome! Thanks to all of you for reading out blog, being a part of our  Facebook community , and supporting us these last three years. It\u2019s been fun getting to know your family as well and we\u2019re looking forward to making a lot more memories with you all!

These past six years have been the best ones of my life! Even though the title of this blog is \u201c Noah\u2019s Dad \u201d make no mistake about it, everything we do is a  team effort . My sweet wife is an amazing mother, wife, and friend and I couldn\u2019t imagine being on  this journey  without her! In fact, she\u2019s a  super hero ! It\u2019s Been A Sweet Six Years! For each wedding anniversary we try to give each other a gift from the \u201ctraditional list.\u201d The 6th wedding anniversary gift is \u201c iron and sweets \u201d and my creative wife bought me a juicer\u2026so I could make  sweet  tasting juice! \u00a0Get it?!

{"date": ",September,10,2012", "body": "One of the greatest rewards of\u00a0sharing\u00a0our son\u2019s\u00a0journey\u00a0online is without a doubt all of the\u00a0 amazing families \u00a0we get to meet in the process. This past year we\u2019ve gotten to know so many great people through the comment section of this site, our\u00a0 Facebook \u00a0page, our\u00a0 Twitter \u00a0page, our\u00a0 YouTube Channel , our\u00a0 Google + \u00a0page, and heck, even through our\u00a0 Pinterest \u00a0page! (Yah, I\u2019m a guy and I use Pinterest, so what?)\u00a0 We really do consider it an honor to be on this journey with so many of you. It\u2019s also been a privilege\u00a0for us to get to know some of you as you\u2019ve shared your family\u2019s story with us. So, thank you. A\u00a0friend\u00a0from Down Under. One of the things we really like to do as often as\u00a0possible\u00a0is take things from online, to\u00a0 offline. We love getting to meet and build friendships with families in\u00a0 real life . (Besides, it\u2019s really hard to hug someone online. And\u00a0sometimes\u00a0people just need a hug.) We get the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to connect with people all over the world, and meeting for a play date isn\u2019t always an option when you someone live across an ocean. So we do the next best thing; video chat! Skype is awesome! (And isn\u2019t Ruben a Cutie!) We first met Libby and her wonderful family through our Facebook page. And we\u2019ve had the awesome\u00a0privilege\u00a0of getting to them even better during our\u00a0numerous\u00a0Skype video-chats. Isn\u2019t technology awesome?! Here\u2019s 3 super cool facts about Libby and her family I thought I\u2019d share with you: 1) They are from\u00a0Australia. (Hello, can we say awesome\u00a0accent? Which leads me to fact number 2) Their\u00a0daughter\u00a0can do an\u00a0 incredible \u00a0 Charlie Bit Me Impression ! 3) Libby and her husband have 5 fun kid-o\u2019s; 3 beautiful little girls, and 2 boys. Her youngest son, Ruben, was born with Down syndrome (and is super\u00a0adorable!) A milestone of\u00a0chocolate\u00a0proportions! In case you didn\u2019t already know this, Australia\u00a0has these amazing \u00a0chocolate\u00a0snacks called\u00a0 Tim Tams . And would you believe that our new friends from\u00a0Australia\u00a0offered\u00a0to\u00a0 send us some ! Hello, can you say awesome! A package from Australia! So that makes today\u2019s\u00a0 milestone \u00a0even more awesome! Not only is this Noah\u2019s first\u00a0chocolate\u00a0candy bar\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s his first Tim Tam! Yum! Pretty Sweet, huh! (pun intended.) To say he enjoyed it would be an\u00a0understatement.\u00a0 Quick note to the\u00a0chocolate\u00a0haters out there: When I posted about Noah\u2019s\u00a0 first tri p to\u00a0 In-N-Out Burger \u00a0we\u00a0received\u00a0a few messages from some\u00a0 bothered \u00a0 grumpy \u00a0 rude \u00a0 quick-to-judge \u00a0 un-fun \u00a0 considerate \u00a0people who took the time to tell us in a very\u00a0 rude \u00a0 un-loving judging \u00a0 grumpy \u00a0 snarky \u00a0 direct \u00a0way that they were\u00a0 concerned \u00a0about Noah\u2019s diet and our parenting skills. I see absolutely no reason to be concerned\u2026.\u00a0 Just in case anyone reading this is a\u00a0chocolate\u00a0hater, and perhaps\u00a0also\u00a0concerned\u00a0for Noah\u2019s diet, and\u00a0perhaps\u00a0already have their fingers on the keyboard ready to fire off an email to me about how bad\u00a0chocolate\u00a0is for kids, or how by giving Noah this Tim Tam we\u2019re\u00a0allowing him to become another\u00a0statistic\u00a0of the\u00a0 national\u00a0obesity epidemic , or\u00a0that we\u2019re\u00a0irresponsible\u00a0parents (yes, someone\u00a0actually\u00a0wrote in and told us that.) Or that we\u2019re just trying to plump our kid up early so he can be on\u00a0 The Biggest Looser \u00a0some day. Or that kids shouldn\u2019t eat\u00a0chocolate\u00a0because\u00a0Jenny McCarthy thinks\u00a0chocolate\u00a0causes kid\u2019s ears to fall off. Before you do that, let me set your mind your ease. Everything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s all good. Your fingers can rest.\u00a0 BALANCE. One of our favorite words is balance. Almost everything in life is\u00a0unhealthy\u00a0if done in\u00a0 excess \u00a0(just ask my mom about the time I tried to eat that entire bag of grapes\u2026,my stomach hurts just thinking about it.) So unless you\u2019re\u00a0allergic\u00a0to it, chocolate, in\u00a0moderation,\u00a0 isn\u2019t bad for you . Heck, even a Happy Meal is ok every once in a while. And you can even\u00a0substitute\u00a0the fries for fruit if you want. Your kid still gets the toy, you still look like a fun parent, and all is well. (By the way, we\u2019ve even been known to let Noah watch a little TV while he\u2019s eating his kid\u2019s meal! *gasp*!)\u00a0 I\u2019ve meet a lot of parents who are anti-this, or anti-that. You know the type. The ones who are known by everyone\u00a0 for what they\u2019re\u00a0against ,\u00a0 rather than what they\u2019re for . Don\u2019t be\u00a0 those \u00a0parents. Fun Isn\u2019t A Curse Word. Strive to have\u00a0balance\u00a0in your life and family.\u00a0Some parents are\u00a0wound\u00a0so tightly they\u2019ve\u00a0forgotten\u00a0what it\u2019s like to have fun. They run their home like a mini-boot camp. Their kids are so worried about what will\u00a0happen\u00a0to them if they get Play-Doh on the carpet or a crayon mark on their clothes, that they lose\u00a0their\u00a0sense of wonder,\u00a0curiosity, and\u00a0 creativity . Don\u2019t be\u00a0 those \u00a0parents. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong to have\u00a0convictions. Or structure. Or rules. In fact, we need those things in our homes and culture now more than ever. I\u2019m just reminding you to\u00a0remember\u00a0to\u00a0 laugh .\u00a0To have\u00a0 fun . To\u00a0 enjoy \u00a0parenting again. You only get one shot at it and it\u2019s over. So take advantage of it. \u201cChocolate makes me happy!\u201d \u2013 Noah And if you\u2019re one of\u00a0 those \u00a0parents, I want to encourage you to stop\u00a0worrying (and\u00a0gossiping) so much about which parents in your\u00a0neighborhood\u00a0allow their kids to watch tv, or eat happy meals, or\u2026..go to In-N-Out Burger, and instead redirect that\u00a0energy\u00a0and passion into\u00a0 creating memories \u00a0with your family. I think you\u2019ll find it\u00a0 much \u00a0more rewarding.\u00a0 Now I hope you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m off to search Pinterest\u00a0in hopes of finding some fun Halloween\u00a0costume ideas. Here\u2019s to hoping we get more candy this year, than\u00a0 last ! Big thanks to Libby and the family for their amazing friendship, and for sending us these\u00a0delicious\u00a0treats! We\u2019ll be sending you some Pop Tarts soon!\u00a0 I\u2019ve got a question for you\u2026. Speaking of fun, what\u2019s the last thing you\u2019ve done that caused your kids to laugh. What\u2019s the last \u201cfun thing\u201d you\u2019ve\u00a0done. Together. As a family?

{"date": ",September,8,2012", "body": "One of the\u00a0 biggest fears \u00a0I had when Noah was\u00a0 born \u00a0was\u00a0that\u00a0we\u2019d never have any friends who\u00a0could\u00a0 really \u00a0relate\u00a0to us. Sure, we had lots of friends with young children, but none of them had a child with\u00a0 Down syndrome . So even though they could\u00a0relate\u00a0to us as a parent, there was no way they could relate to us when it came to raising a child born with Down syndrome. The problem was I had\u00a0 no idea \u00a0how to meet other parents who had kids with Down\u00a0syndrome. I mean was there a local coffee shop where all of these awesome families hung out every week? And even if I found it, what if there was some sort of secret password I had to know in order to get in the door? \u201cI\u201dm sorry, I can\u2019t let you in!\u201d A fear many new parents of children with special needs have\u2026. I was new to the world of Down syndrome and had\u00a0 no clue \u00a0how I\u2019d ever find a supportive group of friends who could totally relate to what I was going though. And on top of that,\u00a0 I\u2019m in extrovert! \u00a0I\u2019m supposed to be good at this sort of thing.\u00a0 I\u2019ve gotten a lot of feedback from other parents who are in the exact same place as I was 13 moths ago. They\u2019re worried they\u2019ll never be able to find a good group of friend, who\u2019ll be able to really understand what they\u2019re going through. Most fears are just like the monster under the bed\u2026not real. Well it\u2019s been a little over a year since Noah was born (he\u2019s 13 months in today\u2019s video) and it turns out my fears of not finding any friends never came true. We\u2019re blessed to be surrounded by a great groups of friends who can relate to us, cry with us, laugh with us, and most importantly share life with us. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m too busy playing with my friends to sleep.\u201d Sadly, I know that not everyone\u2019s experience has been the same as ours. I know that some of you have had a hard time finding friends who have children with Down syndrome. Some of you feel like you\u2019re\u00a0 totally alone \u00a0on this journey. In fact, I\u2019ve heard from more than one person that when their child was born their family, and in some cases even their spouse, offered\u00a0 no support . This breaks my heart. 3 ways you can find and make new friends today. I wanted to share some of the ways we\u2019ve made new friends over this past year. I understand that every situation is different, and that not all of these will apply to every person. However, my hope is that this list will give you a good starting point, or spark a totally different idea in your mind. 1. Be Transparent. Don\u2019t push people away, be transparent! The day after Noah was born, we sent out a blog post called \u201c Spoiler Alert: Our Son Was Born With Down Syndrome \u201d to our friends and family. We had already talked to our closest group of friends and family in person or over the phone, and wanted to send out an upbeat email to the our bigger group of friends and family; friends you only talk to once a month, coworkers, classmates, etc. It was important for us to let as many people know about Noah\u2019s\u00a0 extra 21st chromosome \u00a0as possible so the news was out and the open, and hopefully to help minimize any award conversations. Who cares about 6 degrees of separation? All you need is one! \u201cHey, we should be friends!\u201d By telling as many people as we could as quick as we could about Noah\u2019s Down syndrome diagnosis, we made it possible for our friends to \u201c refer a friend .\u201d It sounds kind of cheesy, but that\u2019s exactly what happened. You never know who you know, that knows someone, raising a child with Down syndrome; and would love to\u00a0 introduce you to them! We had several friends reach out to us almost immediately after learning that Noah was born with Down syndrome, and offered to connect us with friends of theirs who wanted to offer their friendship (and encouragement) to us. We\u2019ve met some of our closest friends after being introduced to them by a mutual friend. In fact, part of the reason I started this site was because of some\u00a0 encouragement \u00a0I received from one of our\u00a0 new friends . If you are struggling to find supportive friends I want to encourage you above all else\u00a0 to be transparent \u00a0with your\u00a0 current \u00a0friends. I\u2019ve talked with people who have kept their child\u2019s Down syndrome diagnosis\u00a0 from their own family \u00a0for over a year! (I\u2019m serious!) Here\u2019s a protip for you, don\u2019t do that. \u2018Today you are you, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is youer than you.\u2019 \u2013 Dr. Seuss Be a proud parent. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. Your child\u2019s Down syndrome diagnosis\u00a0 is not your \u201cfault. \u201d Don\u2019t allow your fear of what someone else\u00a0 may \u00a0think of you prevent you from being transparent about your child, concerns, fears, hopes, and dreams. You never know who you may know who knows someone that could turn out to be just the friend you need, at the moment you need them the most. (Wow, trying saying that 5 times real fast.) So tell the world how\u00a0 proud \u00a0you are of your child, and who knows you may just end up making a new best friend in the process.\u00a0 2. Don\u2019t Be A Hermit Put your coat on and head out the door! New friends await. Unless the only friends you\u2019re wanting to make are Mormons, and cable tv salesman, you\u2019re going to have to get out of your house! \u00a0Sure there are a lot of great websites out there where you can meet other families,\u00a0 ahem , but if you\u2019re wanting to meet some\u00a0 local friends , you\u2019re going to have to turn off the computer, and get out of your house. If you\u2019re an introvert, or especially shy, this may be a challenge for you, but I\u2019ll assure you the benefits\u00a0 far outweigh \u00a0any uncomfortableness\u00a0you may feel. It\u2019s time to un-plug, and head out! Yes, I\u2019m talking to you.\u00a0 When Noah was born we were contacted by our local Down syndrome support group,\u00a0 The Down Syndrome Guild of Dallas . They asked if they could send us out some\u00a0 resources \u00a0(which, by the way, were\u00a0 much more helpful \u00a0than anything we received from the hospital when Noah was born, but that\u2019s a different post) and told us about their\u00a0 new parent \u00a0meeting. To be honest, my first thought was, \u201cOh brother\u2026.I don\u2019t really want to go hang out with a bunch of weird parents.\u201d (Which is an odd thing for me to say considering how weird I am.) We ended up going to the new parent meeting, and even though it was pretty emotional, we ended up meeting some great people, many of whom we\u2019ve become great friends with. If your city has a local Down syndrome support group I\u2019d\u00a0 highly recommend \u00a0you get involved. Our local group does various activities throughout the year, including a weekly Mommy and Me class that my wife enjoys, and a bi-weekly happy hour for dads. Find a local Down syndrome support group.. To find out if your city has a local Down syndrome group, simply go to Google and type in \u201cDown Syndrome Support Group [Your City].\u201d Additionally, the National Down Syndrome Congress , has a great searchable database of local support groups in the United Sates, and the Gifts website has a comprehensive list of\u00a0 Down syndrome support groups \u00a0outside of the U.S. By the way, I\u2019ve met several people who have driven hours to come to some of the Guild\u2019s events because their city doesn\u2019t have a support group. So if your city doesn\u2019t have a local group you may want to find out if another major city that\u2019s in driving distance from you has one, and consider if it\u2019s worth the time and resources it would take for you to be a part of it. Lots of other options\u2026 In addition to local Down Syndrome support groups, there are lots of other places you can go to meet to new people such as neighborhood parks, indoor playgrounds, and your local church. If you\u2019re in a major city chances are there\u2019s a church in your area that has a \u201cspecial needs ministry\u201d and attracts a lot of families raising children with Down syndrome. I think a good church is one of the best places \u00a0to meet new people and develop friendships. 3. Take Matters In To Your Own Hands Our local Down syndrome support group is excellent. However we really wanted to find a way to connect with families raising young children on a more regular basis, and create a comfortable environment where we could invite other parents we had met (which will happen if you are following rules 1 and 2.) Since nothing like this existed my wife and a few other moms decided to take matters into their own hands and create something to feel this need. What they came up with was a monthly dinner party called \u201c Rockin\u2019 21 .\u201d (Kids with Down syndrome have a triplicate copy of their\u00a0 21st chromosome .) What is \u201cRockin\u2019 21\u2033\u2026.? Rockin\u2019 21 is basically a monthly get together for parents raising children with Down syndrome that meets in one of a few different homes we rotate from. Anyone who wants to come is welcome, and\u00a0 we average 40 to 50 people each month ! (The only down side is we have to clean our house spic and span clean when it\u2019s our turn to host, but it\u2019s totally worth it.)\u00a0 Just look at all these awesome kid-o\u2019s! What makes the Rockin\u2019 21 get togethers so fun is they are\u00a0 purposely laid back , and give people the chance to just relax and get to know each other.\u00a0We typically do them on the last Sunday of the month, between 4:30-6:30. As far as food goes, we do it \u201cpot luck\u201d style. One of the other moms is an event planner and does an\u00a0 incredible job\u00a0 of \u00a0 organizing all of the various snacks, drinks, desserts, etc. People aren\u2019t pressured to bring anything if they don\u2019t want to, or can\u2019t afford it, and we always have more than enough food! It works out great! Another great thing about these get togethers is it allows new parents a chance to see and interact with children who are just a\u00a0 little bit \u00a0older than their own. This makes it not so overwhelming for new parents, as well as provides a great deal of hope and encouragement. Also, since these Rockin\u2019 21 parties are open to whomever would like to attend we often get a chance to meet people from other cities who decided to make the drive.\u00a0 How cool! In fact, several people whom I first met, and invited, through our\u00a0 Facebook community \u00a0have not only joined us, but have become \u201creal life\u201d friends of ours! For example this is how we meet our good friends, the\u00a0 Koch\u2019s , whose son, by the way just had an\u00a0 amazing recovery \u00a0from open heart surgery!\u00a0 Woo Hoo! Do what works for you! Depending on where you live \u00a0having a monthly dinner may not work for you, but perhaps there is something else awesome you could do to help people meet and develop new relationships. Don\u2019t be afraid to think out side the box, and don\u2019t get discouraged if the first few (or 20) ideas fail.\u00a0 Just keep trying. \u00a0There\u2019s a lot of creative mom\u2019s that read this blog, and I can\u2019t wait to hear what sort of ideas you come up with! Don\u2019t get frustrated if your first idea isn\u2019t awesome. Meeting new people and finding new friends can be a challenge for everyone, but\u00a0 it isn\u2019t impossible . I want to encourage you by reminding you that\u00a0 You\u2019re not alone \u00a0on your parenting journey.There are lots of people out there who would love to have the chance to call you a \u00a0friend and walk with you on this journey ( unless of course your a meany. In that case, first stop being a meany. Then, start being nice. Then, there will be lots of people who would love to be your friend .)\u00a0 Making new friends takes effort,\u2026but it\u2019s totally worth it! We want to hear from you! What has your experience been with finding other parents who could relate to you after your child was born? Has it been easy, or a challenge? What are some of the ways you have meet new parents? \u00a0For all the seasoned parents out there, what tips do you have to help parents develop friendships with other parents who are on similar parenting journeys?

{"date": ",February,15,2014", "body": "If I\u2019ve learned anything from being parent these last few years it\u2019s this; you  never know  when your child is going to achieve a  major developmental milestone ! Noah\u2019s been working hard lately trying to learn to walk on his own. He\u2019s been able to  take a few steps  on his own for a while now, and he recently  learned to stand up on his own , but today, at 22 months old\u2026out of the blue\u2026did something\u00a0 ah-mah-zing \u2026.! Today Noah became an official walker! Yelp, that\u2019s right. Noah is a full fledged walker! I \u00a0brought him to a local  library story time  this morning and were plying in the room after everyone left when he decided to stand up on his own and take a step, then another one, and another one, and another one\u2026.and you get the point. I couldn\u2019t believe it! Once he figured out what he was doing, he wouldn\u2019t stop. Although it won\u2019t always be awesome to have to chase down a toddler, it was certainly awesome today! What Age Do Children With Down Syndrome Start Walking On Their Own? One of the questions people often ask is \u201c When do children with Down syndrome walk on their own? \u201d According to the  major milestone guidelines \u00a0children with  Down syndrome  learn to walk\u00a0 without support 3 steps or more \u00a0 between the ages of  16 and 42 months  with the average being 24 months. Don\u2019t Let A Milestone Chart Steal Your Joy I know as a parent it\u2019s easy to get caught up on these milestone guidelines, but I \u00a0want to encourage you to try hard not to. 16-42 months is a  wide range , and your child will grow, develop and hit their milestones on  their \u00a0 time, now yours. (Our what some text book says.) If you find yourself \u00a0becoming consumed with these milestone charts, and feel discouraged because your child isn\u2019t hitting their milestones as soon as some other child, let me give you two pieces of advise: \n Don\u2019t compare  your child to any other child, and \n Celebrate every accomplishment , no matter how  small  it seems. \n I find that practicing these two things helps me focus on Noah and how God is working in  his life , rather than how God is working in  everyone else\u2019s life . As\u00a0President Theodore Roosevelt once said; \u201cComparison is the thief of joy.\u201d \u00a0 Don\u2019t let someone else\u2019s child (or what your child  can\u2019t  do) rob you of the overwhelming joy that your child brings. Parenting is way to awesome for that! A Few Tips To Help Your Child Learn To Walk We\u2019ve written a lot on our site about Noah learning to walk.

{"date": ",October,19,2013", "body": "In my  last post  I mentioned how much joy it brings me to see Noah doing things that\u00a0 typical  children do. When we first learned  Noah was born with Down syndrome \u00a0I remember wondering if I\u2019d ever get a chance to play with Noah the way I thought I would before I knew he had Down syndrome\u2026if that makes sense.\u00a0In fact that was one of several  fears I had about rising a child with Down syndrome \u2026that never came true. Noah\u2019s almost two years old in this video and it seems like he is in a stage right now where he is achieving new  developmental milestones  every day,  and \u00a0I love it!  In today\u2019s  video  you\u2019ll actually see two of my favorite things Noah\u2019s starting to do, laugh out loud and roll a ball back and forth on the floor! Words can\u2019t describe how  proud  I am of this little boy. His  fine motor skills  aren\u2019t developed enough to control his \u201cpush back\u201d of the ball (though they are quickly getting there) however as you can see in the video he is working hard to push the ball back towards me once it comes to him.\u00a0Rolling the ball back and forth is really the first \u201cgame\u201d we\u2019ve gotten to play together, so it\u2019s been fun as a dad to finally be able to interact with him like this.  I could seriously play this game with him all day! Something else I could do all day is listen to his laugh. I mean seriously,  how cute can one kid be?  (By the way, if you want to see something super adorable  check out his laugh when he was just a few months old! ) It\u2019s so much fun playing with Noah and seeing how expressive he has become. His little face lights up my life! Parents, moments like these are priceless. Don\u2019t forget to savor everyone of them because they come and go fast. Kids don\u2019t stay kids for long, and if you close your eyes you\u2019ll miss them! And if you\u2019re a  new parent of a child born with Down syndrome  I hope videos like these give you hope and encouragement. You may be scared now, but you have a lot to look forward to\u2026trust me! Has your child started rolling the ball back and forth yet? Also how old was your child when they started to laugh?

{"date": ",October,19,2013", "body": "One of the biggest surprises after raising a child with Down syndrome these last (almost) three years is how little I actually think about Down syndrome. I\u2019ve even written about how I often  forget our son has Down syndrome . We\u2019ve been blessed in that other than  a few small heart issues , Noah\u2019s been a pretty healthy little boy. He\u2019s doing well in  school , meeting his  milestones , and  dancing all around our house likes a boss ! Noah\u2019s our first child, and for the last three years has been the only child in our house ( although that\u2019s about to change ) so I don\u2019t have another child to  compare  him to do. So being a parent of a child with Down syndrome is the only version of parenting I know. Raising a child with Down syndrome is my  normal . And it\u2019s all good. Like I said, for the most part I don\u2019t know even think about Down syndrome most days until\u2026.  Noah Gets Petechia Yelp,  petechia . Remember that sweet little picture at the top of this post? At first glance it looks like everything is all good hair, blue eyes and  straw cups \u2026but if you look a little closer you\u2019ll see\u2026. Petechia, Leukemia, and Down Syndrome It\u2019s amazing how something as small as those little red dots can cause me so much fear and anxiety. I also hate how I can be having a perfectly great day, having fun with my little boy, then catch a glimpse of those tiny little red dots (bruises) and go into worry mode. (I\u2019m a bit of a worrier\u2026but I\u2019m getting better.) \ud83d\ude42 In case you weren\u2019t aware petechia  can be  a symptom\u00a0of\u00a0leukemia, which children born with Down syndrome are at a grater risk of developing than a  typical  child. (But what you may not know is that  children with Down syndrome\u00a0have substantially higher survival rates and lower relapse rates than  typical  kids \u2026all thanks to that extra 21st chromosome!) Every time I see one of those little red dots (Noah gets them almost every time he gets sick) my mind goes to the worse case scenario\u00a0and I immediately start to think he has cancer. \u00a0I\u2019m thankful that Noah has a  great pediatrician \u00a0and that my wife is one herself\u2026otherwise I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d be at the doctors office / ER room three days a week to get Noah a  CBC ! They have been great at calming my fears these last few years of parenting. \ud83d\ude42 Google Isn\u2019t Your Friend (Or Your Pediatrician) When It Comes To Stuff Like This. Although petechia can be a symptom of leukemia (which you will think your child has if use Google) that\u2019s not the typical reason kids get it, especially if it\u2019s not\u00a0 accompanied by other symptoms, like bleeding . Here\u2019s a quick parenting pro tip before we go any further: DO NOT USE GOOGLE TO TRY TO DIAGNOSIS YOUR CHILD WITH ANYTHING. EVER! Google is the quickest way to turn your chid\u2019s common cold into the\u00a0 black plague , cancer, polio, AIDS, and a brain tumor\u2026in your mind, that is. In fact I wish I could give Google a 1st place ribbon for \u201c The Ability To Cause People Unnecessary\u00a0Worry. \u201d By the way using Google to diagnose things for yourself, especially in the middle of the night when you are sick and tired is also a really dumb thing to do\u2026..or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. \ud83d\ude42 Trust Truth (Often Given By Your Pediatrician)\u2026Not Google. The truth of the matter is Noah has a virus this weekend and children can get petechia when they are sick and running a fever\u2026.and especially when they are vomiting (and Noah\u2019s doing all three of those things.) If a typical child had petechia I wouldn\u2019t even worry about it, it\u2019s not a big deal, and I really shouldn\u2019t let things like that bother me. To be honest I get less and less worried each time Noah has petechia. Especially  after the time it spread from his head to his toes in a matter of hours \u2026.and he ended up being fine. It was just a typical reaction to the virus he had. If he didn\u2019t have cancer after all of that, I\u2019m \u201cok-er\u201d with a few dots here and there! He\u2019s a toddler, and toddlers get sick. And sick toddlers sometimes get petechia. It\u2019s all good. That\u2019s truth. And truth always trumps google. (By the way, isn\u2019t it funny how we can trust some 22 year old girl that owns an Etsy shop and spends 20 hours a week on Yahoo Answers and Baby Forums more than we\u2019ll trust our own Doctors sometimes? We\u2019re funny people. And the internet is a funny place. ) But still\u2026I hate\u00a0petechia. I hate how it reminds me that that  extra 21st chromosome  Noah has does bring with it some real challenges. I wish he wasn\u2019t at a higher risk for developing leukemia. I wish every time I saw one of those dots on him my heart didn\u2019t freeze. I hate how I let stuff like that take away some of my joy and replace it with fear. But as I\u2019ve said before,  fear doesn\u2019t win in this house. And so when fear starts to win I remember that there is a God who is in control. Who loves me. Who loves Noah. And Who holds the whole world in His hand. And so while I may worry, He doesn\u2019t. He knows what He\u2019s doing, and He can be trusted no matter what happens; cancer, or no cancer. But still\u2026I hate petechia. (Side note: If you ever have any medical concerns about yourself, or your child, you should seek immediate\u00a0medical attention. Don\u2019t take anything you read on the internet as medical advice, especially this blog. No ones story is your story, and every kid is different. A forum, website, or WebMD will never be able to take the place of a Medical Doctor. So if you have any concerns, give them a call!) What causes you\u00a0unnecessary worry when it comes to your children and what do you do when feel worry and anxiety start to creep into your mind?

It\u2019s the\u00a0 who \u00a0that\u2019s important, not the\u00a0 what .\u00a0 We\u2019ve had all kinds of fun daddy dates.

Today I decided to take Noah to breakfast for a daddy date.\u00a0If you\u2019ve been following our blog the last few weeks, you may have noticed that Noah\u2019s been on a\u00a0 developmental growth spurt \u00a0lately. \n \nOur little guy has always been a\u00a0 very curious \u00a0little boy, however his (lack of) strength has sort of kept that curiosity contained. Not so much anymore. His strength is\u00a0 quickly \u00a0catching up with his curiosity! In fact his milestone spurt has happened so fast that I felt like I had an all new Noah on my hands today at breakfast this morning! Don\u2019t let his innocent little face fool ya\u2026..\u00a0 Parenting Ain\u2019t Easy, But Somebody\u2019s Gotta Do it! I\u2019m not 100% sure when the last time Noah and I went out to eat by ourselves. I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s been at least a \u00a0few weeks, and I seriously don\u2019t remember him being\u00a0 this \u00a0all over the place. Instead of sitting in his high chair just\u00a0 waiting \u00a0patiently\u00a0for for some\u00a0 yum yum \u00a0in his\u00a0 tum tum , he wanted to jump out of his seat and grab his own food. I seriously had a hard time trying to feed the two of this this morning. Every time I moved my hand for 2 seconds to put some food in either my mouth (or his) Noah would try to come out of his seat, stand up on the seat, try to grab the syrup bottle, the utilities, the plates, my coffee cup, or whatever else he could try get this hands on. I felt sort of like I was playing that whack-a-mole game. Not in the sense that I was whacking him with a big rubber mallet, but in the sense that just as fast I\u2019d get one things under control, something else would pop up. Every time I\u2019d get one of his hands under control, his other one would pop up out of no where. Then I\u2019d get that one under control and then a foot would pop up out of no where. Then a hand again, than another hand. Then another foot. Then another hand. and another, and another, and another\u2026. Wait, how did this kid get 17 hands!?!?! I don\u2019t want to make it sound like we had had a bad time, because we didn\u2019t. Not by a long shot. He was just being a cute, curious toddler, that\u2019s all. In fact, I really like how curious and fun he is. He\u2019s truly is his fathers son.\u00a0 5 Quick Thoughts On Single Parenting\u2026 As I was staying busy keeping Noah busy I couldn\u2019t help but think about how nice it would be if my wife was there to give me a hand with our son. Then I started thinking about what it would be like if every meal, every time Noah went out to eat, was just like this one? \u00a0I thought about what it would be like to be a single parent. I was at breakfast alone with my son this morning by\u00a0 choice , but there are a lot of \u00a0mommy\u2019s and daddy\u2019s who do this every day, and it\u2019s not by choice. ( most of the time.)\u00a0 As we ate our pancakes, I thought about the single parent friends that we currently have, and I left with a whole new respect for the single moms and dads that are doing this day in, and day out. Here\u2019s a few thoughts I had this morning: 1. Being a single parent is really hard. 2. Each of us should go out of our way to help and support the single parents in our lives. 3. You have to be incredibly strategic in order to feed yourself, and your child, without a) spilling anything \u00a0a ton of stuff on the floor, your clothes, or maybe even the people sitting next to you; b) having your child reach onto the table and grab anything in arms reach; c) having your child crawl / jump / dive bomb out of their high chair; and d) having your food get cold (in fact I think this last one might be an impossibility.) 4. If you\u2019re in a restaurant and you see a single parent walk in with a baby in one hand, and diaper bag in the other, offer to help them out with their high chair. Especially if it\u2019s during a busy time, and the wait staff forget to set it up for them. (On a side note why do 9 out 10 restaurants have a broken high chair clasp? Isn\u2019t that against some sort of child-saftey-law or something? I recently went out to dinner, somewhere else, and the waiter had to bring me 4,\u00a0 yes 4 , high chairs before brining me one with a clasp that actually buckled. Come on restaurants. You can do better than that.) 5. This one\u2019s pretty random, and is more an observation, but it\u2019s hard to drink coffee out of a coffee mug with no lid, much less try to put cream and sugar in it, when there\u2019s a baby near by wanting to grab it. I think restaurants should notice if someone is there alone with a child, and ask if they could put cream and sugar in the coffee for them. (It\u2019s not about being high maintenance, it\u2019s about being efficient)\u00a0 I think all single parents deserve TWO naps a day.\u00a0 If you are a single parent out there my hat goes off to you.

{"date": ",September,1,2013", "body": "Back in February I wrote about Ethan Saylor;  a 26 year old man with Down syndrome who was murdered by police over a 12 dollar movie ticket . Ethan Robert Saylor went to watch a screening of \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d and after the movie was finished \u00a0briefly left the theater before walking back into the theater to watch the movie a second time. The manager called three off duty police offers who were working as mall security guards to come and remove Ethan. The three officers quickly stormed in the dark theater screaming for Ethan to get out of his seat (which I\u2019m guessing terrified \u00a0him; he wasn\u2019t sure what was going on, or who these men were yelling at him. Remember Ethan has  Down syndrome  which is a  mental disability , and there\u2019s a good chance he didn\u2019t understand he was breaking a rule by entering that theater a second time.)\u00a0He had no context who these three men were screaming at him in the dark theater. While all of this was going on, Ethan\u2019s aide (caretaker) had arrived at theater to pick him up from the first showing, and tried to explain to the police officers that Ethan has a mental disability and to allow her to get Ethan out of the theater. Her pleas were ignored, and the deputies forcefully pulled Ethan out of his seat, forced him to the ground, and handcuffed him. He was terrified. In fact, witnesses described hearing Ethan  crying and calling out for his mom.  The three police officer struggled with Ethan and held him down on the ground at the bottom of a 3 man dog-pile him so hard and so long that they\u00a0fractured the cartilage in Ethan\u2019s throat (usually the result of\u00a0 manual strangulation )\u00a0and\u00a0choked\u00a0him to the point he\u00a0he stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest. Within minutes Ethan Robert Saylor was dead. Let that sink in. Three police offers working as mall security guards choked a 26 year old man with Down syndrome to death on a Saturday afternoon over a misunderstanding\u00a0involving\u00a0a ten dollar movie ticket. Ethan\u2019s death was ruled a  homicide\u00a0by\u00a0asphyxiation , but the grand jury failed to indict the officers involved and they were allowed to return to duty without any consequences. Ethan\u2019s family has a lot of questions. And so do I. (As does the entire Down syndrome community.) How The Power Of Social Media Is Helping Bring Justice To Ethan After the police who murdered Ethan were cleared of all charges (even though his death was ruled a homicide) Ethan\u2019s family turned to the power of social media to help them find some justice. They  created a website \u00a0telling their story. They started a hashtag ( #JusticeForEthan ) and asked people to tweet out specific quotes and a link to their site using the hashtag.  Bloggers got behind it . And now they are harnessing the power of social media to help open up an independent investigation into Ethan\u2019s death. Ethan\u2019s family has created a  Charge.org petition , which as of today has  320,000 signatures  calling for their\u00a0Governor (Martin O\u2019Malley)  to conduct \u00a0an independent investigation into Saylor\u2019s death and for proper training for police. Part of the problem is that police officers in Maryland aren\u2019t trained enough in how to deal with developmentally disabled people like my brother. I think training is an important next step in making sure that what happens to my brother never happens to anyone else. We need a comprehensive, independent investigation that will show all sides of the truth; unbiased and thorough.\u00a0I want my governor and attorney general to get justice for my brother, and to implement training protocols so that no other family will ever have to experience the pain my family feels. I love seeing so many people banning together and leveraging their social networks to make sure this story isn\u2019t forgotten. And now it\u2019s time for me to do the same. Will You Please Sign The Petition? This blog, and  our related social media accounts , has developed into a rather large platform over the course of the last several years. So large in fact we think together we (this means you!) can help the Saylor\u2019s get the rest of the signatures their petition needs. Would you please mind taken 2 minutes  to read and sign the petition ? After reading it will you please email, tweet, or share this link on your  Facebook page  asking your friends to please sign the petition as well? \u00a0(If you are on twitter consider copying and pasting the following tweet: \u201cDown Syndrome isn\u2019t a cause of death. #JusticeForEthan ) It Could Happen To My Son (Or Yours.) I could write all night about why this matters, but here\u2019s the very short answer: Noah\u2019s going to grow up to be a 26 year old man with Down syndrome one day (God willing.) There will \u00a0be times when Noah doesn\u2019t understand something and there will be times when people don\u2019t understand him. That scares me. Would happened to Ethan Saylor could easily happen to Noah Smith one day. Most people don\u2019t know anyone with special needs, and most people certainly have never been properly  trained  on the  specific characteristics  of those various special needs. Some people may be afraid of Noah. Some people will probably call him names. Some people won\u2019t know how to act around him. Some people will feel awkward. Some people will probably mistreat him, or try to hurt him (either emotionally or physically.) I\u2019m not\u00a0omnipresent so I can\u2019t always be there to protect him. I also want Noah to be able to be as independent\u00a0as he can. I want him to hang out with his friends. To go to high school football games. To the mall. To the movies. To do some of the typical stuff that we all do\u2026without worrying about him being hurt (or murdered!) by three over zealous police officers who want to be \u00a0tough guys. As I\u2019ve said before\u00a0 things have to change . This has to stop. Signing a petition won\u2019t stop it. Only God changing the hearts of people will. But it will help. By signing the petition you are helping stories like this stay in the public eye. You\u2019re helping to bring accountability to those you need it. You\u2019re helping to provide training so that hopefully when my son (or yours) misunderstands the rules at a movie theater he won\u2019t end up on the ground under three grown man and choked to death. Signing the petition won\u2019t make everything better, but it \u2018ll help. Not All Stories Have A Happy Ending (This Side Of Heaven.) Ethan was someone\u2019s son. Someone\u2019s brother. Someone\u2019s friend. He was created in the image of God, and God loves him. His family family loved him. He was a human being worthy of respect and dignity. My mind keeps trying to reply the day Ethan died. I can\u2019t even imagine how heart breaking that scene must have been. Ethan crying out for his mom, terrified as three strangers burst into a dark movie theater screaming and yelling, threw Ethan to the ground and put their hands around his neck so hard he couldn\u2019t breath. Ethan\u2019s aide screaming for the three police officers to \u2018PLEASE STOP!\u201d The young movie theater employees that called the police snickering\u00a0outside the theater about the \u201cweird guy who is getting arrested for sneaking into the movie theater.\u201d The people sitting in that dark theater watching and listening to all of this; scared to speak up because they didn\u2019t want the same thing to happen to them. Those three cops treating Ethan with no dignity. Beating him up. Not caring that they were about to take the life of a son who would no longer be coming home to his parents. And then there\u2019s Ethan\u2019s parents. I can\u2019t even imagine how they must have felt when that got that call. When they learned the details that their son died at the hands of the very people whose job it is to serve and protect us. When they found out their son\u2019s death was a\u00a0homicide, that he was choked to death. And then when they found out that the tree men who murdered their son were cleared of any wrong doing (by the local sheriff\u2019s department who certainly wasn\u2019t unbiased) \u00a0and allowed to go back to work like the whole thing had never happened. It literately makes me sick. It makes me sick that it could happen to my son. That it could happen to your son. I\u2019m thankful that even though we live in a world filled of evil, God still holds the whole world in His hands, and we can trust Him. I hope you\u2019ll take a few minutes to  sign the petition  and help Ethan\u2019s family get the number of signatures they need to open up an independent investigation regarding their son\u2019s death. But as I mentioned, that won\u2019t fix the real problem. Only God can truly provide the remedy we\u2019re really looking for. So I pray tonight. For my son. For Ethan\u2019s family. For our world to come to see all people as people created in the Image of God and deserving of love.it. I hope you\u2019ll \u00a0pray with me. (And sign the petition.) P.S.

{"date": ",September,5,2013", "body": "Could there be a new \u201ccure\u201d for  Down Syndrome ? The internet is buzzing today after the September 4th edition of\u00a0 Science Translational Medicine \u00a0 published \u00a0 a recent study about how a team of scientists from John Hopkins University used an  experimental compound to reverse the Down syndrome like learning deficits in mice. Fox news reports  that they accomplished this by: \u201c\u2026injecting a small molecule known as a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist into the brains of genetically engineered mice on the day of their birth. The treatment enabled the rodents\u2019 cerebellums to grow to a normal size, allowing them to perform just as well as unmodified mice in behavioral tests\u2026\u201d Roger Reeves , one of the researchers behind this study, had previously found that a characteristic of people with Down syndrome is having a cerebellum that\u2019s approximately 60% the size of a  typical  person. In order for that important brain region to grow and develop, a small population of cells in the brain must quickly divide and multiply shortly after birth. These brain cells require a specific growth factor known as\u00a0 sonic hedgehog pathway  (not to be confused with one of the  greatest video games of all time ) in order to stimulate the cells to grow and divide. The researches determined that a person with Down syndrome  did not  respond as well to this growth fact, and it actually stunted the development of the cerebellum (the region of the brain import to cognitive processing and emotional control.) So they thought if they could stimulate the cells at birth they could make up the deficit. In order to test the theory, Reeves and his team used some genetically engineered mice which had extra copies of about half of the genes found in the 21st chromosome, which caused the mice to have many of the characteristics of Down syndrome such as a smaller cerebellum and learning difficulties. The researchers injected these mice with a sonic hedgehog pathway agonist on the day of their birth. Here\u2019s what they found: \u201cFrom that one injection, we were able to normalize the growth of the cerebellum, and they continued to have a structurally normal cerebellum when they grew up.\u201d In further testing the \u201cmice with Down syndrome\u201d preformed just as well as \u201ctypical mice\u201d at tests that measured their spatial learning and memory capabilities. In other words, they \u201ccured\u201d some of the  characteristics of Down syndrome  in these mice. This treatment\u00a0has yet to be proven effective in humans with Down syndrome, and future research is needed to determine exactly how and why the injection improved the mice\u2019s cognitive abilities. It\u2019s also important to note that this study is aimed at  new babies  born with Down syndrome, unlike  this study  that is working on improving the life of people already living with Down syndrome (like my son.) Studies like this bring up a lot of questions and thoughts for me; to many to go into on this blog post. However, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts about this study and the conversation about \u201ccuring Down syndrome\u201d in general. Would you allow your child to take medication to help them with some of the cognitive / learning delays that is often a characteristic of people born with Down Syndrome?

{"date": ",February,10,2014", "body": "We\u2019re proud to announce that Noah reached another  major milestone  toady\u2026 standing up on his own! \u00a0Most children actually stand on their own (without help from people or objects, which  he has been able to do for a while ) before taking their\u00a0 first steps , but not our little guy!\u00a0In fact,  we recently posted a video  of him trying to stand on his on, but not quite being able to. \u00a0This is probably due to his desire to be moving rather than stand still. Kids are going to achieve their milestones in their own time and in their own order which is fine by me, why follow the \u201crules.\u201d In today\u2019s video you can see Noah going from plantigrade (feet and hands on the floor like a bear walk) to standing. As we have mentioned before, this kid does not like to bend his legs so he is making this harder on himself to try to stand with straight legs. He also doesn\u2019t stay long in standing and tries to sprint to another location. \u00a0I have a feeling once Noah starts walking I am going to have to buy a new set of running shoes! 4 Activities to Practice Standing We have been working on several activities to help our son stand on his own, here\u2019s a few things that have helped him learn to stand up by himself: 1.  Pulling to stand  using objects or people. \u00a0You can see our  previous post  that talks about some exercises to help prepare for this. This can be from sitting, kneeling, half kneeling, or squatting. 2. Encourage play in the standing position. \u00a0Some of our favorite examples of toys for this are the  Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Fun With Friends Musical Table , the  B. Zany Zoo , and  Fisher-Price Little Super Star Sing-along Stage  (which I recommend finding at a second hand store as they are no longer made but are frequently sold for insane prices on Amazon.) You can also put favorite toys on the couch and let your child play in standing that way as well. 3. \u00a0Place your child in standing without something in front of them for support,  for example with their back against a wall/furniture , or placing them in standing in the middle of the room. I found that I was the best motivator to keep Noah in this position, however you may have to hold toys to keep them entertained. This is how we helped Noah learn to take his first steps. 4. \u00a0Get into standing from a sitting position, for example sitting on a box/stool that puts their legs at a 90 degree angle and getting them to stand from there. \u00a0This is a task I will admit we never worked on much outside of his therapy sessions but I wish we had. Today his hard work paid off as he is getting into standing on his own in the middle of a room. This is Noah\u2019s last major motor milestone before becoming an official walker. When did your child stand on their own? \u00a0Did they start walking shortly after this? \u00a0Do you have any other activities you found helpful for this?

Man, time really does fly. You Have To Crawl (Or Drag Your Feet) Before You Can Walk. I remember when Noah first started on the treadmill I wondered if treadmill therapy for kids\u00a0 really  worked. I mean as you can see in the videos below, in the beginning\u00a0they would  just  strap him in to a special holster, lift him up to where his feet just barely touched the treadmill, turn the treadmill to a very low speed, and he would just drag his feet across it. It didn\u2019t  seem like  it was doing anything. But it was helping him learn to walk! It\u2019s amazing how far Noah has come since we first started, and how well he can walk after just 15 months of treadmill therapy. We\u2019re obviously\u00a0 huge fans  of treadmill therapy\u00a0and our son is a living testimony that treadmill therapy for kids really does work! Because we\u2019ve seen the results first hand, we\u2019ve written extensively on this topic. Some posts that have been very helpful to people are:  The benefits of Treadmill therapy ,  How treadmill therapy can help kids learn to walk , and  the\u00a0Free Download of the Procedures To Use The Treadmill Training In Infants With Down Syndrome . If you\u2019re interested in learning more about how this sort of therapy can help kids learn to walk I encourage you to check those posts out. Noah\u2019s Progression On The Treadmill I thought it would be fun to list all of Noah\u2019s treadmill videos so you can get an idea of the type of progress he has made, and how it has helped him learn to walk. Isn\u2019t it amazing how much of a difference a little bit of time (about 15 months) plus a lot of hard work, love and encouragement can make in a child\u2019s life? Press play on these videos and see the progression for yourself. Aug 30, 2011 Sept 7, 2011 Sept 20, 2011 Oct 18, 2011 Dec 12, 2011 Jan 23, 2012 Oct 16, 2012 \u00a0Treadmill Therapy Works!

And if you know any doubters, feel free to share this post with them (including your child\u2019s physical therapist.) I\u2019m so proud of this kid. I know I say that all the time, but I can\u2019t say it enough. I\u2019ve never met a more hard working toddler. All this kid has ever known is hard work.

{"date": ",February,12,2014", "body": "When Noah was  born  one of the fist things someone said to me \u201c There\u2019s never been a better time in the history of the world for someone to be born with Down syndrome! \u201d I think that\u2019s a fantastic (and true) quote, and I couldn\u2019t agree more. There are so many  resources  (and research) available today to help children with  Down syndrome  reach their full potential, all of which will only continue to grow as we head into the future. So that quote will continue to be  more \u00a0 true  as time goes on. How awesome! We Hit The Pediatric Therapist Jackpot! We were very fortunate to have found a team of  outstanding  physical, occupational, and speech therapists when Noah was only a few weeks old that have helped him in more ways than we count. We are incredibly grateful for these folks! What I especially love about this team of therapists is that they are always trying new techniques to help Noah reach his goals. (Be sure to check out this list of  characteristics to look for in your child\u2019s therapist .)\u00a0For instance they started using  pediatric\u00a0treadmill therapy  with Noah  before he was even 12 months old!  In addition to that, they have recently started using a therapy dog to help him learn to walk on his own! Pretty cool, huh? How Noah uses a therapy dog to learn to walk. As you can see in the video, Noah\u2019s physical therapist has him hold on to the dog\u2019s leash and \u201cwalk the dog\u201d while sits \u00a0behind him in a rolling chair holding on to his hips to help him keep his balance and\u00a0 maintain \u00a0correct posture. He is pretty\u00a0 wobbly \u00a0and hard to hold on to due to his\u00a0 hypotonia , but all and all I think he did a great job, and couldn\u2019t be more  proud  of him! 5 Benefits Of Using A Therapy Dog To be honest I had no idea what the benefits of using a therapy dog with our one year \u00a0were, but upon doing a little research found out there are many. Here\u2019s a few of the ones that stood out to me: \n A Steady Gait:  Properly trained therapy dogs are able to move forward at a steady pace that\u2019s easily adjusted as the child speeds up or slows down. In other words,  the dog will keep up with the child. \u00a0Since Noah\u2019s just learning how to walk, he isn\u2019t very fast or steady, and we don\u2019t have to worry about a therapy dog like the one he\u2019s using in today\u2019s video charging forward unexpectedly pulling Noah with him. \n Motivation:  Studies have shown that therapy patients enjoy doing tasks that aren\u2019t normally enjoyable (like\u00a0physical\u00a0therapy\u2026.which is hard work!) when they are doing things the animal enjoys. In other words, \u201c Let\u2019s go walk a cute dog today. \u201d sounds a lot more fun than \u201c Ok, it\u2019s time to go to physical therapy today and work really hard which will ultimately help you learn to walk. \u201d Both\u00a0achieve\u00a0the same goal, but the first one sounds a heck\u00a0of a lot more fun! (By the way, I\u2019m still tying to find a way to change \u201cIt\u2019s time to do laundry so we\u2019ll have clean clothes.\u201d into a fun game like this. If you think of anything please let me know.) \n Increase Attention Span:  Children (and dads, like me) can find it hard to maintain focus on a specific task for long periods\u00a0of times. In fact, some days Noah isn\u2019t into therapy at all, and doesn\u2019t want to do anything while we\u2019re there. However, studies have shown than when therapy dogs are present children are more engaged and can stay focused on the task much longer. As you can see in today\u2019s video Noah did a great job walking around the building with the dog and didn\u2019t want it to end when he was finished. \n Increases Confidence:  As a child starts to see improvements toward their therapy goals while using a therapy dog, there confidence goes up , which \u00a0results in the child meeting more  milestones  and becoming stronger in existing areas. \n Reduces Anxiety and Fear:  Working on a new goal can create fear and anxiety no matter how old (or young) a person is. The use of animals in therapy produce a calming effect, and helps the child feel more comfortable so that they can work on their therapy goals. \n These five tips are just the tip of the iceberg.\u00a0There are lots of other benefits to using therapy dogs and many studies out there for you to read if you\u2019re interested in learning more. Here\u2019s a few fun pictures of Noah getting his therapy dog on\u2026! It\u2019s Hard Work\u2026And A Marriage Tip For Husbands As I mentioned, we\u2019re thankful to have therapists involved in Noah\u2019s life who are on the cutting edge, and not afraid to try to news things to help him grow and develop. We\u2019re also  extremely proud  of our little boy and  how hard he works  day in, day out. Words can\u2019t describe how I feel as a dad seeing how far he has come.  I love this kid. Oh, and after I saw how much Noah enjoys large dogs I  surprised  my family with this guy. Quick note to all the husbands out there: while it may seem like a good idea to surprise your family with a puppy-that-will-end-up-being-a-70-poud-dog-someday without talking to your wife first. \u00a0It\u2019s not.

{"date": ",October,16,2013", "body": "I\u2019m always on the look out for fun toys that serve a dual purpose. I\u2019m looking for toys that are \u00a0 fun  and that help my child\u00a0 learn and\u00a0develop . Whenever I find toys like this, I call that a\u00a0 toy win ! And I\u2019m sure as a parent you like hearing about toy wins, so sit back, relax, and let me tell you about this one. \ud83d\ude42 A while back I came across the awesome\u00a0 Fisher Price Roll-a-Rounds Swirlin Surprise Gumballs machine  (which also made our list of the  best Fisher Price learning toys .) To be honest, I\u2019m not sure where I first saw this toy, but I\u2019m guessing it was at one of Noah\u2019s many  occupational therapy visits . (I seriously think we have bought this kid every toy we\u2019ve ever seen any of this therapists use! Can any of you other parents relate to this?) \ud83d\ude42 Because Playing With Toys Is Just So\u2026Typical. I love watching Noah play and have fun with his toys! I remember when Noah was  first born  I (unnecessarily)\u00a0worried that he would never play with toys like a  typical  kid (I had a lot to learn about Down syndrome!) I also remember being very encouraged when I saw videos of other children with Down syndrome playing and having fun\u2026just like a  typical  kid. So it\u2019s a lot of fun seeing our little Noah doing so many of the things I always feared he wouldn\u2019t do! (If I only knew then what I know now!) achievements So if you\u2019re a  new parent of a child with Down syndrome , I hope all of the  videos  on our website replace some of your fear with hope. All children are unique in their own way, and just remember  to celebrate, not compare your child\u2019s achievements.   Your child will do amazing things , and one day the fear you are feeling will be replaced with joy! 6 Reasons Why The Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Count and Color Gumball Machine Should Be On Your Child\u2019s Toy Shelf! The toy you see in the video above is the\u00a0 Fisher Price Roll-a-Rounds Swirlin Surprise Gumballs machine  which you can still order by  clicking here . However, it looks like Fisher Price has released a cheaper version of this toy called the\u00a0 Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Count and Color Gumball Machine  which does pretty much the same thing for about twenty dollars less, and who doesn\u2019t like to  save money!? #ToyWin For those of you looking to pick up a  fun developmental toy  for your child, I thought I\u2019d give you a few reasons why the Fisher-Price Gum-ball machine (or which ever one who choose to purchase) makes a fun (and useful) toy for your child. 1. It Helps Your Child Learn Cause And Effect Relationships We\u2019ve talked before about the  importance of cause and effect relationships , and how toys help our children develop in this area. The Fisher Price Gum-ball machine helps teach your child cause and effect as they learn that pushing down on the lever will release the balls down the ramp accompanied by flashing lights and fun music (which almost all kids love!) It took a while for Noah to get this, but when he finally did I celebrated him  big time!  It\u2019s such a  proud parenting moment  when your see your child accomplish  developmental milestones  like this! Even what seems like seemingly small accomplishments for  typical  kids, are big wins for ours! 2. It Helps Your Child Learn Problem Solving Skills As you already may be aware,\u00a0 problem solving is an indicator of intelligence for children With Down syndrome \u2026and this toy helps them develop those valuable problem solving skills! The problem is your child will want to make those balls come racing down the ramp accompanied by the fun music and flashing lights, but how, oh how will they ever make that happen? \u00a0 Ah-ha!  They have to learn that the only way to solve their little toy problem, is by pressing the  magical  level on the side of the toy! And\u00a0 ala peanut butter sandwiches  style, their problem is solved! They think it\u2019s just fun and games\u2026but you know it\u2019s much more!  #DevelopmentalWin 3. The Flashing Lights And Fun Music Are Great Developmental Motivators! We\u2019ve also mentioned the  benefits of\u00a0developmental motivators \u00a0in a pervious post as they can often give your child the motivational push they need to accomplish their developmental goals. And the Fisher Price GumBall Machine gives you (and your child) double developmental motivators for your money! Every time your child correctly presses the lever to release the balls they are greeted with  flashing lights and fun music  which motivates them them to continue to repeat the action. And what parent doesn\u2019t  absolutely love  toys that light up and make music! \ud83d\ude09 (On a side note the music isn\u2019t very loud, especially when compared to some of the  other toys  out there. In fact it\u2019s very subtle, so you don\u2019t have to worry about this toy distracting you while you\u2019re trying to watch  Modern Family !) By the way, the lights and music can also help with  sensory development , which is a bonus toy win! See, all of those  annoying  lights and music on your children\u2019s toys do serve a purpose! 4. It Helps Your Child Develop Fine Motor Skills Fine motor skills  are developed when your child is using their hands to do an activity, and are important for many of the tasks our children will do in their life.\u00a0When your child picks up the small plastic balls that go into the top of the cookie jar toy they are doing several things to help them develop their fine motor skills. Here\u2019s just a few: weight bearing on their hands, postural control, shoulder stability, muscle development, development of the arches of their hands, thumb, and webspace, separation of the two sides of their hand which helps with in-hand manipulation, bilateral integration, and the development of their hand and finger strength! And to think\u2026I used to think toys were just for playing! Who knew all of those toys lining the shelfs at our local toy store were really just cleverly disguised\u00a0 therapy tools ! 5. It Has A Fantastic P.O.I. (Playability On Investment) In this video Noah\u2019s only one year old (we\u2019re a little behind on our videos, but we\u2019re trying to get caught up!) and he\u2019s almost three at the time of this writing and  he\u2019s still playing with this toy!  As a parent I\u2019m always looking for toys that are built to last, and have some\u00a0longevity. Anyone else ever bought their child a Christmas present only to find it abandoned under a pile of wrapping paper collecting dust less than a day later? Yah, you won\u2019t get that with this toy!) 6. It\u2019s A Gum ball Machine!!! Because seriously\u2026who doesn\u2019t like gum-balls, and the machines they go into! Without a doubt the\u00a0 Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Count and Color Gumball machine\u00a0 would make a great addition to your child\u2019s toy collection. It\u2019s a lot of fun, has great P.O.I . (longevity) and helps them develop in countless ways. I can\u2019t recommend this toy enough! And seriously, didn\u2019t Noah look super cute when he was playing with it? That little I\u2019m-So-Proud-Of-Myself Smile was written all over his face\u2026and I love it! By the way, if you\u2019re looking for some other great toy recommendations be sure to check out our  Christmas gift guide , and  great toys for under 25 dollars \u00a0as well!

And if you end up buying this toy please be sure to leave a comment and let me know, as well as what you thought about it once your kid has played with it!

{"date": ",October,22,2013", "body": "We\u2019re a  huge fan  of teaching Noah baby sign language to help him communicate with us. We have been  watching Baby Signing Time  videos since he was about 9 months old. I was a skeptic at first but have continually been impressed by how signing has helped Noah have a voice and understand the things in his environment. In fact, I even wrote a post about  how I went from being a skeptical mommy and pediatrician to a baby signing time believer! Only 1 Year Old, And Already Making Sentences Using Sign Language! It\u2019s amazing to see our son, who is only 1 year old and born with Down syndrome, not just using sign language, but putting his sign words together to for sentences. Check out the video below to see for yourself! I may have even cried a little when I was able to meet  Rachel Coleman  because I\u2019m so thankful for what she has done to help our little ones communicate. Baby sign language has been such a gift to us. Noah has learned quite a few signs and will do them if asked. He will spontaneously say \u201cmore,\u201d \u201ceat\u201d and his favorite food \u201cbanana.\u201d Noah\u2019s First Sign Language Sentence Today I thought that I would challenge him to put some signs together for the first time. With  verbal prompting only  Noah is able to say \u201c more food please \u201d followed by a \u201c thank you .\u201d I was  so excited , and Noah got to eat more so he was happy too. It was so much fun to see him put all of these words / signs together to form a sentences. As you can see above he actually signed \u201cMore food, please. All done. Thank you.\u201d \u2013 I love it! We Can\u2019t Stop Talking About Baby Signing Time! I am a big fan of  Baby Signing Time Volume 2  as it teaches manners with \u201cplease\u201d, \u201cthank you\u201d and \u201csorry\u201d. Even if Noah can\u2019t speak yet he can still be polite which I love. \u00a0Noah is prompted to sign \u201cthank you\u201d at the end of his  therapy sessions  or when he gets something. \u00a0It kind of looks like he is blowing a kiss which is pretty darn cute. Rachel knows just what signs our little ones need to learn at first.  Volume 3  for example uses stop and go (among many other signs). I never realized how important stop is. We have been able to get Noah to at least stop and look at us with this word and hopefully it will help me keep him out of danger. Not Just Words, But Understanding\u2026. I truly feel that these videos have not only taught Noah the sign but the  understanding  of the word. \u00a0Thanks to Rachel\u2019s teaching style of including song, written words, visualization and examples of kids using the signs it helps hit all of Noah\u2019s senses so the information sinks in. His vocabulary is building each day even if he can\u2019t say a word yet. We can prove this by showing Noah flashcards and he signs the appropriate word to us, he is one smart cookie (he knows that sign too). \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m really happy to see all of the progress Noah has made with his baby sign language, and super proud that he is putting his words together to form sentences for the first time. It\u2019s a lot of fun to be able to communicate with our little guy! \u00a0 If you aren\u2019t already using Baby Signing Times I can\u2019t recommend their entire program enough!

{"date": ",September,6,2013", "body": "I\u2019ve seriously have one of the best jobs in the entire world! I work with some of the most fun people in the world. I get a chance to spend my days making an impact in the lives of others. My co-workers (who are also some of my closest friends)  welcome Noah  and love on him as if he was one of their own. And we have a  very fun  and ( sometimes extremely ) competitive work atmosphere. The majority of our staff is  really  into sports and so every year we have a staff wide Final Four Bracket contest.\u00a0If you know me in  real life  you know I\u2019m not really into sports, like at all. I\u2019d much rather discuss the  New 52 \u00a0than\u00a0 Final Four Brackets\u00a0 anytime. I\u2019m just being real. #NoShame The Office Final Four Bracket Content Fast forward:\u00a0 I ended up coming in  dead last \u00a0in our Final Four Contest\u2026partly because I was out of the office for about a week with a horrible eye infection and wasn\u2019t able to even turn in a bracket\u2026but that\u2019s a different post\u2026. \ud83d\ude42 Part of the contest rules was that the four people who came in last in the brackets had to create a Harlem Shake video that would be played in front of the entire staff. The video that the staff ruled the best out of the four would get the same prize as the winner of the Final Four Bracket Content (which was an awesome date night with your spouse to a epic hotel downtown and 150 dollars for a nice dinner.) \u201cWanna Go To Harlem To Shoot A Harlem Shake Video This Weekend?\u201d Once again, if you know me in  real life \u00a0 you also know I\u2019m very\u00a0sporadic and enjoy having fun. So even though we live in Dallas I decided why not  go to Harlem  to shoot my Harlem Shake video\u2026.the weekend before the video was due\u2026.with my two year old\u2026and wife\u2026and a cameraman\u2026who is also my friend / co-worker\u2026 who my wife had never met \u2026.all staying in the same small NYC hotel..I mean why not\u2026 #ThatsHowIRoll All four of the videos were INCREDIBLE! As I mentioned, I work with some of the most fun and creative people on the planet and really wasn\u2019t sure I who was going to win. The other videos were great, and it was a  very close  call. But in the end mine \u00a0won. I\u2019ve posted the video below for your viewing pleasure. Few quick things I want to mention: \n My wife is awesome. Like really awesome. \n No, we didn\u2019t actually take Noah to Harlem. He stayed at the hotel while my friend and I went to Harlem (at midnight!) to shoot a few of the scenes (and where we also met the super cool guys that make a cameo at the end of the video.) \n You may say we didn\u2019t abide by the \u201cofficial\u201d  Harlem Shake Rules  (which was also brought up by my co-workers and almost caused me to loose the contest) to which I replied : there are no \u201cactual\u201d Harlem Shake Rules. No one is  really  doing the  real  Harlem Shake in any of these videos. They are just jumping around having fun. I mean seriously, do you really think these  Sea Lions  know how to do the \u201creal\u201d Harlem Shake? LOL\u2026! \n I LOVE working in an environment full of so many creative and fun people. \n If you\u2019re a parent, be one that likes to create memories with your kids. Have some fun with them. I\u2019m not saying you have to dance around with cartoon characters in Times Square (I\u2019m a strange guy) but do something!

Thankfully, I have a super sweet wife who understands and was very gracious with me when I kindly asked if we could go on an epic summer road trip instead of joining her parents in St. Thomas over the next 10 days.

(And hopefully dad will get some time to check out the  pinball hall of fame , the shop from  Pawn Stars , and  Boys II Men  in concert!) \n On Monday or Tuesday we\u2019ll head to Las Angeles, then to Anaheim, CA where will hang out at  Disneyland \u00a0\u00a0and  Calforina Adventure Park \u00a0for a few days. \n Depending on how we feel (and if we want to spend more time at Disney) we may visit\u00a0Santa Barbra before making the trip back to Dallas! \n We\u2019ve been on  road trips  before, but this is by far the longest\u2026and the first over five\u00a0hour one with both our boys!

{"date": ",February,9,2014", "body": "We were excited to learn that the  National Down Syndrome Society  wanted to feature our little boy\u2019s picture in a special video to be shown in the heart of Times Square to kick off the New York City Buddy Walk, and help rise awareness about  Down syndrome ! I\u2019ve already mentioned how much I enjoy New York, and especially  Times Square \u2026so this was a particularly\u00a0 special parenting moment for me.\u00a0(In fact, I\u2019m such a fan of NYC that this was actually his  second time  to go\u2026and he\u2019s only  one\u00a0year old!) The Interview A few days before we left for NYC our local NBC affiliate came out to  Our Children\u2019s House At Baylor \u00a0(where Noah receives his various therapies) to  interview us  about our story and our upcoming trip. I thought they did a great job with the interview, and was glad they got some footage of Noah working hard at one of his occupational therapy sessions. I\u2019m thankful for news organizations like NBC that take the time to tell stories worth telling. I hope more of the mainstream media will devote airtime to telling stories of life that give people hope and encouragement. By the way, I think Noah did a great job on camera (for a one year old!) I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s because he\u2019s had  a lot of practice ! You can watch the entire interview below: The (Pukey) Plane Ride Noah\u2019s been on a lot of  plane rides  in his short, one year old life, and generally does very well on them\u2026 but not this time! \u00a0I\u2019m not sure if we were having a bumpy flight, or he had an upset tummy, but either way he  threw up on me  in mid-flight. It was very un-awesome\u2026 I have to admit, having my child vomit on me while on a crowded and cramped airplane was really,  really  gross! But\u2026I also have to admit that after the initial\u00a0shock of being puked on was over (and almost throwing up myself) I was  more concerned  with how he felt than the small (and texture!) of his lunch all over my shirt.\u00a0There\u2019s no sadness quite like seeing your child sick and not being able to do anything about it. I was also worried about him throwing up the rest of the flight, but thankfully I had on an undershirt, Noah fell asleep, and the rest of the flight went smoothly. \ud83d\ude42 Hanging Out In New York City! After making it to NYC (and taking a shower!) we had a chance to wonder around the city and do a few of things that I like to do every time I\u2019m in New York. Like\u2026 Play on the  Big Piano  at FAO\u00a0Schwarz\u2026 Stock up on some  awesome candy  from the FAO\u00a0Schwarz candy bar\u2026. Take Noah to the free story time at FAO Schwarz \u2026 (can you tell I really like FAO Schwarz?) Eat some  delicious  NYC pizza\u2026 And hang out at 30 Rock and Time Square! The National Down Syndrome Society Times Square Video After a fun day of hanging out in the city we were ready to see what we came to NYC to\u2026Noah\u2019s sweet little face on the big screen in Times Square. After waking up and grabbing a quick snack, we headed down to Times Square to check it out! As we walked up to the street to the sport where the video would be playing we could already see a crowd gathering, which was pretty cool! After waiting for a few minutes, the video finally started to roll! It was fun hearing all of the families and friend scream and yell when they saw their child\u2019s picture displayed on the big screen! And then the moment we were waiting for\u2026Noah\u2019s adorable little mug up on the big screen proudly proclaiming to the world that  all life is valuable!  I love this kid. After the video was over a few different families that follow our blog recognized us and came up to introduce their self. What a fun treat it was for us to meet other families who have been encouraged by our little boy! It was our privilege to meet them and we\u2019re so glad they came up and said hi and allowed us the privilege of meeting their family! Check Out Noah In The 2012 Times Square Buddy Walk Video For Yourself Didn\u2019t get a chance to make it to NYC to watch the video in person? No worries, we\u2019ve got your covered! Press play below and you can watch the entire video in full! (Be sure to let us know in the comments below if your child makes an appearance in the video as well!) Crossing The Finish Line At The New York City Buddy Walk! After watching the Times Square video and making some new friends we grabbed a cab and headed to Central Park for the Buddy Walk. Although we\u2019ve been to our  local Buddy Walk before , this was our first Buddy Walk in New York, and it was awesome! Without a doubt the best thing about this Buddy Walk was seeing our little one year boy  walk across the finish line  all by himself! It was a  proud parenting moment  for sure! The Buddy Walk After Party! After crossing the finish line we hung around for the after party, which was a ton of fun! It was seriously a huge dance party with friends, music, dancing, and an appearance by Noah\u2019s Buddy,  Chris Burke , aka Corky from  Life Goes On !  It was epic! We always enjoying getting to spend time with  the Lyons  when we\u2019re in New York. They have an awesome family, and a very cool son,  Cade , who also has Down Syndrome. And\u2026.if you\u2019re into  good books  I would  highly encourage  you to pick up Rebekah\u2019s book, \u201c Freefall To Fly: A Breath Taking Journey Toward A Life Of Meaning \u201d as soon as possible! Our New Friend, Rachel Coleman From Signing Time My wife has already written about  why she cried  when she met  Rachel Colman  for the first time, but long story short, she has played a large part in helping our little boy (and many others)\u00a0 learn to talk ! So it was a very special moment for both of us to be able to meet her, and \u00a0tell her thank you for all she has done to help our little boy learn to communicate with us. If you don\u2019t already know about  Baby Signing Time  please take a second to read  this post , then grab  disk one  as soon as possible! Trust me on this one! Headed Home After a very fun trip to New York we headed home with a full heart. We\u2019re so proud of our boy and how he is literally  changing lives all over the world . We had a great time seeing many of our old friends, and making some new ones. Thanks to everyone who reads this blog, comments on our Facebook page, supports our mission and helps us spread the word to the world that  Down syndrome is ok . That all life has meaning, value, and purpose! It\u2019s our honor to fight the good fight with all of yout! Have you been to a Buddy Walk? If so, how was your experience?

Most people agreed with me, but a few didn\u2019t.\u00a0In fact, one person actually \u00a0left a comment saying,  \u201cI\u00a0used to love this page \u2026.[but] I really want to cuss you all out ..\u201d  LOL\u2026Wow! You want to \u201ccuss me out\u201d because of a Facebook status update? Yikes! *hugs* I realize that a few folks may have misinterpreted / misunderstood the meaning behind my comment so I thought I would write a blog post explaining the meaning behind my Facebook comment this morning. Does God really only give \u201cspecial kids\u201d to \u201cspecial parents?\u201d \u00a0The answer is both yes\u2026and no. In other words, I think that statement is both whack\u2026and un-whack. Let me explain. Why The Saying \u201cGod Only Gives Special Kids To Special Parents\u201d Is Whack. Before I begin, please allow me to make a few simple observations so we\u2019re all on the same page: When someone says this statement what they typically mean is that God only gives children with a disability \u201c(special kids\u201d) to great parents (\u201cspecial parents\u201d) or parents that are somehow able to raise a child with a disability better than the all the other parents in the world. (I also know this is \u201cfiller talk\u201d because they don\u2019t know what else to say, which is ok. I\u201dm not saying I\u2019m offended by the comment, or that it\u2019s a hurtful thing to say\u2026I\u2019m simply saying the comment is \u201cwhack\u201d\u2026.or untrue.) One other point of reference; good parents  love their children  and do everything within their ability to help them grow, develop, and become the people God created them to be. They don\u2019t harm, abuse, or murder them. Ok, here we go. 1. Most Of These \u201cSpecial Parents\u201d Abort Their \u201cSpecial Kids.\u201d It\u2019s no secret that a mother\u2019s womb is the  most dangerous place in the world for a child with Down syndrome . More than 90% of children suspected to have Down syndrome in the womb are aborted\u2026 for no other reason than that they may have Down syndrome . That\u2019s tragic\u2026and whack! Good parents (special parents) don\u2019t murder their children\u2026regardless of if they have  Down syndrome  (\u201cspecial kids\u201d) or not.\u00a0This point alone shows us that the statement \u201cGod only gives special children to special parents\u201d is indeed, whack. In fact, based on the facts you\u2019d have to say; \u201cGod seems to give more children with Down syndrome to parents who are going to murder them.\u201d or \u201cThe odds are that if you are pregnant, and based on prenatal testing find out that your child may have Down syndrome, you will be a bad parent\u2026not a good (or \u201cspecial\u201d) one. (Remember, \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cspecial\u201d parents don\u2019t murder their children.) If you are raising a  child with Down syndrome , you are in the  minority , not the  majority  of good (aka: \u201cspecial\u201d) parents. Most parents of children with Down syndrome abort them. In other words; most parents of \u201cspecial kids\u201d (kids with Down syndrome) aren\u2019t \u201cspecial\u201d (or good) parents, in fact by definition, they are bad parents. One more time:\u00a0good parents don\u2019t murder their children. 2. \u201cSpecial\u201d (Good) Parents Don\u2019t Abandon Their Family I\u2019ve talked to more single mothers than I want to count whose husband divorced or abandoned them after their \u201cspecial\u201d child was born. Divorcing your wife or abandoning your family isn\u2019t something a \u201cspecial\u201d (good) parent does\u2026.rather something a whack (bad) parent. By definition not being there for your wife and child makes you a \u201cbad\u201d parent (I think we can all agree that abandoning your child certainly doesn\u2019t make you a \u201cgood\u201d parent.) 3. Families That Aren\u2019t Rising A Child With Special Needs Aren\u2019t \u201cLess Special\u201d Than Those That Are I don\u2019t know what I would feel like if I didn\u2019t have a son with Down syndrome and someone told me \u201cGod only gives special kids to special families.\u201d Should I feel hurt? Should I feel offended that that person (or God!) doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a \u201cspecial\u201d (aka: good) parent? Also is the reward for being a \u201cgood\u201d (aka: special) parent, having a child with Down syndrome? If so, and I didn\u2019t have one, should I keep trying to be a better (aka: more special) parent until God deems me \u201cspecial\u201d enough that He would give me one of these \u201cspecial\u201d children? None of these things make much sense to me\u2026and in fact, they seem a little \u201cwhack\u201d to be honest. \ud83d\ude42 By the way, I know TONS of \u201cspecial\u201d (aka: good) parents that don\u2019t have a \u201cspecial child\u201d (aka: child with a disability.) So if God truly does only give \u201cspecial kids\u201d to \u201cspecial parents\u201d he must also give \u201cnon-special\u201d (typically developing) kids to \u201cspecial parents\u201d (aka: good parents) also. Why The \u00a0Saying \u201cGod Only Gives Special Children To Special People\u201d Is Un-Whack. To be fair I actually think this statement at its core is true. It is  very much true  that God \u00a0gives \u201cspecial children\u201d to \u201cspecial people.\u201d But it has nothing to do with a child having a disability, or a parent raising a child that does. Let me explain; 1. All Children, And Their Parents, Are \u201cSpecial\u201d All people have \u00a0infinite value and worth not because they are born with a disability, or parenting a child who does.  Genesis 1:27  tells us that; \u201cGod created humankind in his own image..\u201d\u00a0 In other words, every person on this planet is \u201cspecial\u201d because each and every person on this planet is created in the image of the most \u201cspecial\u201d Person that has ever existed, God. Also in  Psalm 139:13-14  we\u2019re told that; \u201cFor you created my inmost being; \u00a0 you knit me together\u00a0in my mother\u2019s womb.   I praise you\u00a0because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0your works are wonderful\u201d In other words, God created every person on this planet, and everything He creates is \u201cwonderful\u201d or \u201cspecial\u201d\u2026not because they were born with a disability, or parenting a child who does\u2026but simply because  God made them! That\u2019s pretty awesome!\u00a0 So, Does God Only Give Special Children To Special Parents? The bottom line is God  does  give special children to special people. All parents are special and all children are special. Period. Having a child with special needs doesn\u2019t make you any  more  special than any other parent raising any other kid, sorry. I know some parents like to use their child having a disability as a way to say they are \u201cmore\u201d special than \u00a0other parents, but it\u2019s simply not true. Please stop. Just be a parent. A parent raising a child with a disability. You don\u2019t have to be \u201cmore special\u201d than other parents. You are as special as any parent can be\u2026\u00a0 just because you are made by God, and in the Image of God.\u00a0 You (or your child) can\u2019t be any  more special  than that. How To Be A \u201cSpecial\u201d Parent While it\u2019s true that are parents are \u201cspecial\u201d since every parent is created in the image of God, not all parents are \u201cgood\u201d parent. As I mentioned above, some parents abandon their children and their family, some parents murder their children, some parents never teach their children about God, and many other parents pursue their careers more than they pursue a relationship with their child. This isn\u2019t being a \u201cspecial\u201d (aka: good) parent\u2026it\u2019s being a \u201cwhack\u201d (aka: bad) one. If you really want to be a \u201cspecial parent\u201d (aka: a good one) put in to action  some of the things good parents do , and teach them\u00a0 how to grow up be a \u201cspecial\u201d man or women . Good parents are rare these days. There are no magic time machines, and you only have one shot to be a  game changing \u00a0one.\u00a0Make it count! I believe every parent  is  a \u201cspecial parent\u201d (created in the image of God) and has the ability  to be  a \u201cspecial parent\u201d (aka: a good parent) as well. No matter your background, upbringing, or what kind of parents you had growing up.\u00a0Every child (special needs or  typical ) has his or her own set of challenges. Parenting isn\u2019t easy\u2026.but it\u2019s awesome, and there\u2019s nothing else like it. Above All, Show Grace. Lastly, if you are a parent of a child with Down syndrome (or any other disability) I want to encourage you to have\u00a0 tons and tons of grace \u00a0with people. Most\u00a0people have no idea what to say and I totally get that. (By the way, if that\u2019s you\u00a0 here\u2019s a few suggestions .) I would never want to make anyone feel awkward, or discourage them from having the courage to say something \u00a0(even if what they are saying isn\u2019t\u00a0 necessarily \u00a0true.) So lighten up, give people the benefit of the doubt, and always assume the best about people. I feel a similar tension about people saying the word \u201cretarded.\u201d\u00a0I hear people saying that word all the time, and most of time they have no idea\u00a0 why it\u2019s offensive , or why they should stop saying it.\u00a0I usually know the person and their heart / motive isn\u2019t to be offensive or hurtful, so I don\u2019t say anything simply because I don\u2019t want to make them feel bad, especially if it\u2019s in front of a group of people.\u00a0It\u2019s a weird tension that I\u2019m still trying to figure out myself. (By the way, I\u2019d be interested to hear how you handle this in the comments.).if you see me out a Oh, \u00a0and if you see me out and about and happen to tell me that \u201cGod only gives special kids to special people\u201d don\u2019t worry\u2026you won\u2019t offend me or hurt my feelings. In fact, I\u2019ll probably just smile and say \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d (And maybe email this post to you.)\u2026.Just don\u2019t tell me that \u201c all kids with Down syndrome are angels .\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\ud83d\ude42 I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on all of this in the comments below. Just please don\u2019t \u201ccuss me out\u201d \u2026because that wouldn\u2019t be very \u201cspecial\u201d\u2026or nice! \ud83d\ude42 ", "outgoing_links": ["http://facebook.com/noahsdadcom/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gabe-lyons/raising-children-with-down-syndrome_b_1260307.html", "http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm", "http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+139%3A13-16&version=NIV", "http://wordsfromwags.com/gods-man/", "http://wordsfromwags.com/gods-man/"], "link": "http://noahsdad.com/special-kids-to-special-parents/", "title": "Does God Really Only Give \u201cSpecial Kids To Special Parents?\u201d Spoiler Alert: Yes\u2026and No."},
{"date": ",September,9,2012", "body": "We\u2019re extremely thankful that Noah has the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to work with some of the best developmental\u00a0therapists\u00a0in the world. Ok, so I may be just a  little  biased, but the people who works with him really do have  all the\u00a0qualities \u00a0we look for in\u00a0a pediatric\u00a0therapist! So we\u2019re happy. \ud83d\ude42 What he don\u2019t know, won\u2019t hurt him. (In fact, it\u2019ll help him!) One of the things I really like about Noah\u2019s\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapist\u00a0is the wide\u00a0variety\u00a0of\u00a0developmental\u00a0activities she uses to help him develop. I also like how great she is at\u00a0disguising\u00a0hard work\u00a0as fun play. Noah works out hard during his visits, but you\u2019d never know bases on the huge grin on his face the entire time! For instance, Noah could be thinking he\u2019s  just  playing a fun game, but he\u2019s really  learning how to grasp !\u00a0Other times\u00a0he could think he\u2019s  just  playing with a ring stacker, but he\u2019s really  learning how to transfer objects ! And when he thinks he\u2019s just playing with a ball, he\u2019s really  learning how to sit . I love it! We\u2019ve all been tricked\u2026and it\u2019s ok! Since becoming a parent I\u2019ve learned that many of my favorite childhood\u00a0activities actually served a  dual\u00a0purpose ; the  swing set , the  slide , and today I found out that\u00a0 even\u00a0the ball pit \u00a0*gasp* are  good for you ! And I thought I was just playing around all these years, who knew? I feel so\u00a0deceived. \ud83d\ude42 Today Noah\u2019s\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapist\u00a0introduced\u00a0him to the  ball pit  for  the very\u00a0first time ! As you can see in the video it took him a few minutes to get warmed up, but once he did he was having a ball. (Literally!) But not only was he having fun, he was\u00a0unknowingly\u00a0working on his gross motor skills. ( Shh\u2026I don\u2019t tell him, if you don\u2019t!)\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0 the ball pit helps kids with  low muscle tone , like Noah,\u00a0strengthen\u00a0their  core  since they have to work\u00a0 against \u00a0the balls as they play. (So I guess I should say thank you to  Chuck E Cheese  for helping me have the  abs of steal  I have today\u2026not!) The ball pit isn\u2019t just \u201cchild\u2019s play.\u201d Today Noah\u2019s\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapist\u00a0introduced\u00a0him to the \u00a0ball pit \u00a0for\u00a0 the very\u00a0first time !

And while you can find lots of them at  Amazon , Babies R Us, or Bye Bye Baby, there are a few simple ways you can make your own, and save a little money in the process. (Which is always a plus, besides who doesn\u2019t like a little DIY project.\u201d 1. The Inflatable Pool Ball Pit Noah\u2019s\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapist\u00a0suggested that we make our own ball pit by purchasing a small\u00a0inflatable\u00a0 kiddie pool \u00a0and a bag of plastic balls. You may already\u00a0have a blow up pool around your house, and if that\u2019s the case all you need is this\u00a0 100 pack of Fun Ballz \u00a0and your all set! 2. The Pack and Play Ball Pit Our friend  Kelle  is great at coming up with super creative (and easy) ways to save money on kid stuff. As I was telling her about the inflatable pool idea, she mentioned that she had used her  Pack \u2018N Play \u00a0as a ball bit.

{"date": ",February,7,2014", "body": "As you can see in today\u2019s video Noah is trying hard to stand up on his own. I just love how hard he tries! Our little boy is seriously one of the  hardest working  one year olds I know! He works so hard at his physical therapy appointments, and I can\u2019t even guess how much time he has spent doing  treadmill training . And while he\u2019s  sitting up on his own ,  crawling on his own , and even  taking steps \u00a0on his on, he isn\u2019t quite ready to walk or stand up on his own quite yet. But he\u2019ll get there. When I took this video I remember wondering if Noah would  ever  walk on his own. Ok, that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration. I knew he would walk eventually, but it just seemed like it was taking  forever  for him to even stand up on his own. (Although he had recently learned to  pull himself up to a standing position\u00a0on his own , and took his  first steps , which was huge!) I continually remind myself that every child is unique, will meet their  milestones  at different times and try to focus on  celebrating, not comparing . When I do that my heart fills up with pride for my child, instead of bitterness in my heart of what other children can do, that Noah can\u2019t. In other words, when I line my heart up with truth, I start thinking about true things, and life is good. It\u2019s so much fun watching him learn to connect the dots. He\u2019ll get there, and I\u2019m enjoying every moment of his journey. If you\u2019re a parent of a child with Down syndrome I want to remind you to enjoy every second with your chid. Don\u2019t let comparison or developmental milestone charts steal  one once of joy  from your life. Every child is unique, and uniqueness deserves to be celebrated. Have a great day!

{"date": ",October,15,2013", "body": "Today we took Noah to get his first  real  haircut. I say that because this was actually the second time we\u2019ve taken Noah to get a haircut. I can\u2019t really count his first hair cut as his first\u00a0 real \u00a0haircut however since all he did was  sit on my lap  at the end of one of my haircuts and have my hairstylist give him a  trim . Oh and he wasn\u2019t a fan, but really, what toddler really likes to get a haircut? I\u2019ve heard horror stories from other parents about their frustrating experience trying to get their child\u2019s haircut, and I was worried how Noah would do when he had to actually get a  real haircut . Thankfully, we found a place that specializes in giving kids haircuts, but not just that\u2026they actually specialize in giving  children with special needs haircuts ! Pretty awesome, huh? Check out the video below of Noah getting his first haircut from  Snip-Its \u00a0below then keep reading to see why we like this place! 3 Reasons You Should Take Your Kid To Snip-Its For Their Hair Cuts I thought Snip-Its was a local chain, but it turns out they actually have  locations all over the United States . For those of you looking for a great place to take your toddler (or child with special needs) to get a haircut I thought I\u2019d give you a few reasons why Snip-Its rocks! If you don\u2019t live in one of the areas where they have locations I\u2019d love to hear about your experiences getting your child\u2019s hair cut, where you go, how your children do with haircuts, etc, in the comments below (and I know other parents would as well as children\u2019s haircuts are a topic that come up often.) 1. They have a fun, kid-friendly atmosphere. From the second you walk in you are greeted by a super fun environment that really draws kids in. Snip-Its feels more like Disney Land than a barber shop. Each station your child sits at as a television that plays cartoons that helps to distract kids from the hair cut awesomeness! (Although Noah really wasn\u2019t feeling the cartoons, he was more concerned with those metal blades coming towards his head!) But still, the environment is fun, and one that your kids will enjoy walking into. 2. The Hair Stylists Are Trained To Work With Children Unlike\u00a0most barber shops who cut people\u2019s hair of all ages, Snip-Its only cuts children\u2019s hair so they are trained to help them calm down and get their haircut. The entire time Noah was getting his hair cut the lady that was cutting his hair would stop and blow bubbles, show him toys, etc. It doesn\u2019t mean he has all smiles (as you can tell from the pictures and video) but I could see kids liking this place. As I mentioned they are also trained to work with children with special needs, and even have a video on their website about how they support the  autism community . That\u2019s pretty cool in my book! Oh, and something else, they were kind and patient, both important qualities for someone who cuts children\u2019s hair! \ud83d\ude42 3. Your kids get a prize at the end of the haircut! As you saw in the video above Noah got to get a prize after his haircut was over, and hey, who doesn\u2019t like prizes!  \u00a0 We really had a great experience getting Noah\u2019s first real haircut done at Snip-Its. The hair stylists were kind, patient, and Noah really liked it here (for the most part.) Noah\u2019s only one year old at the time at this video, and I don\u2019t know many one year olds who love getting their hair cut, but all and all I think he did great! We will certainly be going back to Snip-Its for future hair cuts. By the way, they also do some fun themed\u00a0 birthday parties , which I\u2019m assuming would be pretty fun for a little girl! Have you ever been to Snip-Its? Where does your child go for hair cuts, and how does your child do when getting haircuts?

I can seriously be sitting right next to him, on guard and ready to catch him when he falls, and he can\u00a0 still \u00a0find a way to bump his head, leg, arm, you name it. (And let\u2019s not even talk about how many times I\u2019ve had this conversation with my wife: Me: Oh my gosh, I\u2019m so worried! Why does Noah have all these little\u00a0bruises\u00a0all over his body? You don\u2019t think he has cancer do you?\u00a0 \n My wife (a\u00a0pediatrician): No Rick.

I\u2019d be in the ER every other day with a silly question. Yelp, I\u2019d be\u00a0 that \u00a0parent. (And I\u2019d be totally cool with it!)\u00a0 \u00a0By the way, we actually\u00a0 both \u00a0got\u00a0 a little \u00a0worried that Noah had Leukemia once, but he didn\u2019t. But, boy did I\u00a0 learn a few things \u00a0after going through that little scare. Anyway, it\u2019s been a lot of fun watching Noah start to pull up on stuff, and inchworm all over our house. It\u2019s seriously one of the cutest things I\u2019ve ever seen. On top of that, new milestones \u00a0means getting to buy new baby toy! Which is always fun\u2026for both Noah, and I!\u00a0 Our Search For The Best Push Toy\u2026 Noah likes his little friend, Mr. Dino! Noah\u2019s been going through\u00a0 treadmill\u00a0therapy \u00a0to help him learn to walk, and we\u2019ve been seeing some great results. In\u00a0addition\u00a0to the treadmill, his\u00a0therapist\u00a0uses a\u00a0 gait\u00a0trainer \u00a0as well as a variety of different push walkers to \u00a0help him learn to walk. Every parent of a child with\u00a0 Down syndrome \u00a0knows that\u00a0 true\u00a0developmental\u00a0gains \u00a0don\u2019t happen during your child\u2019s short weekly physical\u00a0therapy\u00a0visits, but from all the fun play time they have at home. We call it \u201c intentional play .\u201d (In fact my wife wrote a great post\u00a0explaining\u00a0how\u00a0occupational\u00a0therapy\u00a0helps your child\u00a0 learn to play .) Since we do a lot of\u00a0 intentional playing \u00a0at our house we wanted to find Noah the\u00a0 best push toy\u00a0/ walker \u00a0we could find. We tried (and\u00a0returned) several. Some (like the toy shopping carts) weren\u2019t\u00a0heavy\u00a0enough on the front end (even if we loaded the basket up with stuff to weigh it down) and they would flip over on him. Instead of listing all the ones we tried and what we didn\u2019t like about them I thought I\u2019d just tell you about the one push toy that we like the best\u2026.and is helping our son learn to walk on his own. (Which, is probably what you\u2019re really\u00a0interested\u00a0in.)\u00a0 The Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! Stride-to-Ride Dino: Our Favorite Push Walker! Out of all of the push walkers we tried the\u00a0 Fisher Price Stride to Ride Dino \u00a0was without a doubt our favorite. (In fact it even made our list of\u00a0 top toys !) If you are looking for the best walker for your child (regardless of if they have Down syndrome or not) I can\u2019t recommend\u00a0this one enough. As you can see in the video Noah\u2019s able to\u00a0 pull himself up \u00a0on it, and even takes some tiny first steps! There\u2019s a lot of reasons why I like this Dino walker, but let me give you just a few. 1. It doesn\u2019t flip over!! The best thing about this walker is,\u00a0 it doesn\u2019t tump over \u00a0when Noah pushes it. Most push toys (like the toy shopping cart) are built so that a child gets\u00a0 behind \u00a0it and pushes. The Stride to Ride Dino is different. As you can see in the video, the legs of the dino spread apart, which allows a child stand to between them and push it; this keeps it from turning over. Hello?\u00a0 Can you say awesome!\u00a0 t\u2019s a little hard to explain, but let me just tell you, we\u2019ve tried a lot of toy walkers, and this was the only one that didn\u2019t flip over! Which make it a keeper! 2. It lights up and plays fun music! When it comes to toys, the brighter the better as far as Noah\u2019s\u00a0concerned! Most of the other toy walkers I\u2019ve seen don\u2019t really have any \u201celectronics\u201d in them. The Fisher Price Dino on the other hand, does. As the child pushes the walker, the dino\u2019s horns light up and it plays fun music; and since this the horns are in front of the child, the\u00a0flashing\u00a0lights and fun music become a\u00a0fantastic\u00a0 developmental\u00a0motivator ! 3. It\u2019s grows with your child! Toys aren\u2019t cheap, and as a parent I\u2019m also looking for good deals on toys; and the longer life a toy has, the better value! This push toy is a great value because it\u2019s really\u00a0 two toys in one ; it\u2019s not only a great push toy, but it\u2019s also a fun riding toy. The legs of the\u00a0dinosaur\u00a0can be pushed\u00a0together\u00a0and locked (this prevents them from opening while your child is\u00a0playing\u00a0with it) which transforms the dino from a \u201cstride\u201d toy, to a \u201cride\u201d toy! (Hence the name \u201cStride-to-Ride!\u201d\u00a0 So not only can your\u00a0toddler\u00a0use this toy to learn to walk, they can also have some fun being pushed around the house. (However, Noah\u2019s legs are to short to push himself around at this point.)\u00a0 4. It just looks fun! The dino push toy just looks a lot more fun and colorful than\u00a0a lot\u00a0of the other walkers out there, don\u2019t you agree! And who doesn\u2019t like cute, fun stuff!\u00a0 Just look at that cute little face! If you\u2019re looking for a great push toy, this is the one to get. Trust me. It\u2019s that good.\u00a0 I can honestly say Noah gets a lot of use out of it, and if you are\u00a0looking\u00a0for a fun, easy to use, push toy that won\u2019t turn over, this is the one to get. You can find this walker at Babies R Us, Target, or my personal favorite place to find good kids deals online;\u00a0 Amazon \u00a0(who, by the way, offers\u00a0 free shipping \u00a0on this toy if you live in the United States! \u2013 Sorry friends outside of the U.S.) By the way, be sure to check out our post on the top\u00a0 developmental\u00a0toys , and let us know some of your favorites as well.

{"date": ",September,4,2012", "body": "It\u2019s been a fun time in the Smith household\u00a0lately as we\u2019ve had the\u00a0privilege\u00a0of watching our son go through a\u00a0 developmental\u00a0explosion . In the last few months he has\u00a0 sat up by himself \u00a0, gotten his  first tooth , begun to  self feed , has become a  master\u00a0inchwormer , and has pulled\u00a0himself\u00a0up to a  standing position  for the first time! And today he decided to add another\u00a0developmental\u00a0 milestone  to his ever growing list;\u00a0 climbing up the stairs\u00a0for the first time ! I think I can, I think I can\u2026.I know I can! Noah\u2019s been working on\u00a0stair\u00a0climbing for a while now so it was fun to see the sense of\u00a0accomplishment\u00a0(and smile) on his face when he finally reached the top of the staircase. As you can see at the\u00a0beginning\u00a0of the video, it wasn\u2019t easy, but he stuck with it! Noah\u2019s\u00a0therapists\u00a0have been teaching him to crawl up the\u00a0stairs\u00a0for months, and just like\u00a0 The Little Engine that Could  we\u2019ve been chanting \u201cI think I can, I think I can\u2026.\u201d to cheer him on, and today he decided to turn \u201cI think I can\u201d into \u201cI know I can!\u201d I love when that happens! Helping your baby become a Stair Master Crawling\u00a0up\u00a0stairs\u00a0is one of those  gross motor skills  that\u2019s important for your child to learn. If you live in the United States your child may be\u00a0involved\u00a0in\u00a0 Early Childhood Intervention  (ECI) or\u00a0involved\u00a0with a\u00a0private\u00a0physical\u00a0therapist who will help them learn to crawl up stairs. If your child\u2019s physical\u00a0therapist hasn\u2019t started\u00a0working\u00a0on stair climbing yet and you think they should, be sure to ask them about it.\u00a0Communication\u00a0with your child\u2019s\u00a0developmental\u00a0team is important. So never be afraid to ask questions. Sometimes parents worry that their questions may come\u00a0across\u00a0as offensive, or as if they are second guessing the\u00a0therapist (or medical professional) but  most  of the time this isn\u2019t true at all And heck, even if does come across as offensive, who cares? \ud83d\ude42 This is your child you\u2019re talking about here, I think it\u2019s worth the risk.\u00a0In fact, medical\u00a0professionals\u00a0typically\u00a0appreciate\u00a0when parents ask questions. You\u2019d be surprised how many parents\u00a0 aren\u2019t \u00a0actively\u00a0involved\u00a0in their child\u2019s\u00a0developmental\u00a0progress, and this is one of those times when a \u201chands-off\u201d approach isn\u2019t best. So I give you full\u00a0permission\u00a0to ask away.) \ud83d\ude42 On a\u00a0side note; It\u2019s important to remember that even though Noah is 12 months old in this video, your child may learn to climb up\u00a0stairs much\u00a0earlier, or much later. And that\u2019s ok. As parents we have to\u00a0constantly\u00a0resist the\u00a0temptation\u00a0of  comparing  our child\u2019s development to someone\u00a0else\u2019s. Your chid will grow and develop at their own pace, and that\u2019s ok. \ud83d\ude42 7 tips to help your child learn to climb up 1-2 stairs If you\u2019re\u00a0interested\u00a0in helping your child learn to crawl up the\u00a0stairs at home,  Patricia Winders  shares some great tips in her book  Gross Motor Skills in Children With Down Syndrome: A Guide for Parents and Professionals \u00a0(a book every parent of a child with Down Syndrome\u00a0should\u00a0own. Also be sure to check out our  top resources  post for more great books to add to your library. She notes that babies will be ready to start learning to climb up\u00a0stairs\u00a0once they have started  creeping or crawling \u2026or in Noah\u2019s case,\u00a0inch worming! \ud83d\ude42 \n \n Place your child on his feet on the stair below the landing and place his hands on the landing. (The landing being the flat area at the top of the\u00a0stairs.) \n Place a  developmental\u00a0motivator\u00a0 (like a toy) on the landing, and of of their reach. \n See if he will try to move after the toy on his own. If not, bend one knee and place it on the landing. Hold his knee and wait for him to move his body forward. \n Continue\u00a0to practice this activity until he can move up by himself without your help. \n When he climbs up on the landing from the first\u00a0stair\u00a0place his feet on the second\u00a0stair\u00a0from the top. Place his hand and a toy on the landing. \n See if he tries to climb up. Climbing up will require: a.) moving each knee up to the first step; b.) sliding his hands forward on the landing; c.) moving onto his feet; d.) moving each knee onto the landing. \n Supervise him so he is safe and help him as needed. Position\u00a0yourself\u00a0behind him and help him learn the movement required If his feet slide, block them from sliding. \n \n As always, be sure to check with your child\u2019s\u00a0pediatrician before\u00a0attempting\u00a0any of these tips. Every child is unique and what works for one may not work for all. (By the way, here\u2019s a few\u00a0suggestions\u00a0on  choosing the right\u00a0pediatrician \u00a0for your child.) Has your child\u00a0started\u00a0climbing the\u00a0stairs\u00a0her, or are they still working on it? Do you have any\u00a0additional\u00a0tips for helping a child master the\u00a0stairs?

{"date": ",October,14,2013", "body": "\u00a0**The following is a guest post from\u00a0Hayley Goleniowska who blogs at  Downs Side Up  which\u00a0has been voted the  Down Syndrome blog  in Europe two years in a row. Her daughter Natalia (who was born with Down\u00a0Syndrome\u00a0 is a clothing model and \u00a0campaigns for ad inclusion.** I write a little blog from the UK, called Downs Side Up and the guys at  Noah\u2019s Dad  have always been a great source of inspiration for me. So you can imagine how enormously honoured I was when Rick asked me to pen a guest post for him as part of  Down Syndrome Awareness Month . But what to write? What Does A Mother In the UK Have In Common With Mothers In the United States? I sat myself down with a cup of Earl Grey tea and began thinking. Thinking about his audience, in other words you dear reader, and I began to feel nervous that I might not find anything to say that you could relate to.\u00a0 Would you see through my writing with its strange spellings of \u2018colour\u2019 and \u2018realise\u2019 that my computer tries to correct, past my quirky little jokes, to the person beneath that is me, a slightly eccentric little English woman, with my smallish car that prefers to be driven on the left, and my compulsive urge to say \u2018trousers\u2019 instead of \u2018pants\u2019 (which are something else entirely to me! But we won\u2019t go there.), past all that to a campaigner, a blogger,  a parent just like you. Would you wonder if I\u2019m drinking my tea with my little finger aloft? Would you ask yourself if I\u2019ve visited the dentist this quarter? Will you want to know if I cause trouble at football matches or, conversely, if I look like a modern day Mary Poppins? (Well, come to think of it there are similarities\u2026) Will you want to know if I\u2019m friends with the Queen? (I\u2019m not by the way, but I have met the Prime Minister\u2019s Wife at their home Number 10 Downing Street at a thank you reception, which was a rather proud moment.) But then, right there I had made an assumption about you, my American friends, I had drawn upon a ridiculous stereotype of what I think that you think my differences are, and in doing so I was guilty of keeping the preconceptions alive. And then, right there I saw my starting point. \u201cNone Of Us Are \u2018Standard Issue\u2019 Down\u2019s Syndrome Parents\u201d For just as I am no more the \u2018typical\u2019 \u2018average\u2019 \u2018norm\u2019 of a Brit and you are not a cookie-cutter American, none of us are \u2018standard issue\u2019 Down\u2019s Syndrome parents either and our children won\u2019t conform to a certain type either. Children with Down\u2019s syndrome (yes, yes, I know, that\u2019s how we write it over here) are \u00a0of course as individual as their families, their cultures, their church groups, their communities and schools. And at the root of it all we are unique individuals with our funny little habits and ways of doing things, our likes and dislikes, but we do all share the human spirit, the common experience of life, those primal feelings of pride and love and fear that come from the heart and not the head. Not all of you will have felt the fear and desperation that washed over me when we passed from the blissfully ignorant, arrogantly complacent time before Natty\u2019s arrival, into the world of Down\u2019s syndrome. Not all of you will have had the \u2018bad news\u2019 about the diagnosis broken to you by a consultant using hushed embarrassed whispers, accompanied by tears and sorries from your midwife, while your baby was out of sight and reach. This after hours not daring to ask because you dared not ask about what you na\u00efvely thought was your worst nightmare and your brain could absolutely not formulate a question because you were terrified of hearing the answer. Many of you will have shared the helpless feelings as you put your child\u2019s life into the hands of a heart surgeon, a medical angel of the highest order. You will understand the fear that crushes your chest and makes it hard for you to breathe as you pace the corridors praying for your child\u2019s life, waiting for the call that the surgery is over. Some of you might have been lucky enough to know and love someone with Down\u2019s syndrome before your wonderful children entered your worlds. How I envy you. How I wish I have known then what I know now. Natty has been an amazing teacher and has taught me well, but it took precious time to learn what life is really all about. I cannot turn back the clock, I cannot go back to those early days and simply see Natty for the beautiful and vulnerable baby she was, our miraculous daughter, as she lay in an incubator fighting for her life, unaware of the stigma attached to her extra chromosome. But I can make a difference for other new and prospective parents. I can melt away the fear and buy them irreplaceable time, time to bond a little sooner. I can tell them that their children have exciting and full lives ahead of them for the world is their oyster. Likewise I can advise doctors on how better to deliver unexpected news, but never bad, and provide early support for new parents and siblings. What We All Share In Common As Parents Raising Children With Down\u2019s Syndrome And this is where we all share one important thing in common, for  as different as we all are we all want the very best for our children and young people in our care . However we started this journey, none of us could be prouder of our children, nor would any of us want to change a single hair on their heads. We all want to dispel the myths that continue about Down\u2019s syndrome, take away the fear and ignorance that surround it, remove the false stigma, stop prejudice and support other parents further behind us on the journey. \u00a0A Few Down\u2019s Syndrome Myths We Hope To Debunk I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard some of these, or similar in your time as a parent. \n No, my \u2018old eggs\u2019 probably wasn\u2019t the only factor in Natty having Down\u2019s syndrome. \n No, we didn\u2019t \u2018have testing then\u2019, but if we had she would still be here. \n No, Down\u2019s syndrome isn\u2019t \u2018terrible\u2019 and you don\u2019t have to feel sorry for us. \n No, I would never have \u2018considered having her adopted\u2019. Yes some \u2018babies with DS can breastfeed/nurse\u2019. \n Yes, she is \u2018musical and loving\u2019 because we are as a family. She\u2019s also funny and moody and manipulative and clever and sad sometimes too. \n Yes, she\u2019 cute\u2019 right now because she is 6, but she will grow into an independent young woman with a mind of her own. No, you can\u2019t \u2018catch Down\u2019s syndrome\u2019. \n No, our other daughter doesn\u2019t \u2018have it too\u2019. \n Yes, she is \u2018pretty\u2019, don\u2019t be so surprised. She loves modeling and showing off to the camera. She does it professionally. \n I don\u2019t think you can just \u2018have a touch of it around the eyes\u2019, that\u2019s like being a \u2018bit pregnant\u2019 I guess. \n Alongside wanting to join together to bust these myths we all want to shout from the rooftops that as much as our children might have certain traits,  characteristics  or hurdles that they share, they are not defined by their Down\u2019s Syndrome. I never show my hurt if someone if unintentionally insensitive. I simply draw them in to chat and leave them a little more educated. That\u2019s not to say I haven\u2019t run back to my car and cried on many an occasion though. In The End, We\u2019re Really All Just A Bunch Of Balloons And as I made my notes for this Noah\u2019s Dad post on the back of a sheet of Natty\u2019s colouring in, I noticed I had drawn circles around each key idea with squiggly lines going from one to another. They looked like a bunch of balloons! How very like a bunch of balloons we all are I thought to myself! Each a different shade or colour, some larger than others, some flying a little higher, other cushioning and supporting, holding their neighbours high, some visible, some anonymous within the group. We move in the wind together but none in exactly the same way.  Without one another we don\u2019t have the same impact. The world of blogging and online support groups is an incredibly small one. It\u2019s so very easy to make contact and help one another online and geographical distance is rarely a barrier these days. And for the support and love from across the globe, I thank you all, my fellow balloons. Bio:\u00a0 Hayley\u2019s blog Downs Side Up has been voted top DS blog in Europe two years in a row.

The awesomely large billboard, located in one of the busiest parts of\u00a0Florence, Italy\u00a0features the very popular (and overused) phrase\u00a0\u201c Keep Calm It\u2019s Only An Extra Chromosome \u201d on an orange background with a picture of an adorable girl with Down syndrome.

{"date": ",October,11,2013", "body": "Dear OB/GYN, I\u2019m the father of a two year old boy named Noah who was  born with Down syndrome , and whom we love very much. I understand that in the course of your day to day work you often have the difficult responsibility of telling parents news they never thought they would receive \u2013 \u00a0that there\u2019s a good possibility that the little boy or girl in their mothers womb is going to be born with  Down syndrome . Why I\u2019m Writing You This Letter My hope in writing you this letter is to tell you some of the\u00a0 things I wish I would have known \u00a0the day we found out our son was born with Down syndrome. Our son  did not have a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome , and our  amazing pediatrician  did a great job of calming our fears, honoring the life of our boy, and letting us know we were in this together as she delivered Noah\u2019s diagnosis.\u00a0However, as you\u2019ll read below, our interactions with our OB/GYN were not as positive. As an OB/GYN you will likely be the person who delivers the prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. Hopefully this letter will help you to deliver a Down syndrome diagnosis to your patients in a way that honors the child, and gives parents hope and encouragement. I can only imagine what you must feel the moment you first become aware that you\u2019re going to have to give a Down syndrome diagnosis to a new parent, one who likely has no idea the news that you\u2019re about to drop on them. But the truth of the matter is you\u2019re still going to have to have the conversation, and as the first point of contact for a new parent of a child with Down syndrome you have a lot of influence and authority. Those parents are going to be clinging to every word you say, and watching every facial expression that comes across your face. How you deliver the Down syndrome diagnosis to those parents could be a matter of life and death, literally. When our son Noah was born, my wife\u2019s OB/GYN\u2019s first words to us were  \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d  followed by \u201cWould you like some antidepressants?\u201d We were scared, anxious, and worried; the last thing we needed to hear from a medical  professional  was \u201cI\u2019m \u00a0sorry.\u201d And my wife certainly didn\u2019t need antidepressants. But our story isn\u2019t unique. In fact,  I\u2019ve heard from countless parents  of children with Down Syndrome whose OB/GYN did a poor job of communicating to them their child had Down syndrome, or even worse tried to convince them to \u201c terminate the pregnancy .\u201d Sadly, a lot of parents take their OB/GYN\u2019s  advice  and abort their child. You may be aware that  approximately 92% of children diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted .  This shouldn\u2019t happen . Doctors, like yourself,\u00a0 have to  do a better job of delivering a Down syndrome diagnosis. You have to give parents true, accurate, and up to date \u00a0(not inaccurate and outdated) information about Down syndrome. The stakes are to high. A Reminder Of The Oath You Took When you became a Doctor you were required to take the\u00a0Hippocratic Oath which states: \u201c\u2026That I will lead my life and practice my art with integrity and honor, using my \n power wisely\u2026That above all else I will serve the highest interests of my patients through the \n practice of my science and my art\u2026\u201d Using your  power wisely  means that you understand that as a Doctor and the first person to tell a new parent that their child is going to possibly be born with Down syndrome that you have  tremendous power,  and it\u2019s been famously said that \u201cWith great power comes great\u00a0responsibility.\u201d And that responsibility is toward your patients (both in, and out of, the womb), to whom you have sworn to serve their  highest interests . With that in mind, I wanted to share a few thoughts on how to deliver a Down syndrome diagnosis to parents that will allow you to use your  power wisely , and serve the  highest interests  of  all  your patients: 5 Ways To Properly Deliver A Down Syndrome Diagnosis 1. Say \u201cCongratulations,\u201d Not \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if the child is diagnosed with Down syndrome prenatally, or after birth (as in the case of our son,)  always congratulate the parents  for the child they have conceived, or the child that was just born. As I mentioned, my wife\u2019s OB/GYN\u2019s first words to us after our son was born was \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d  Don\u2019t say that . This is the birth of a child, not a funeral. And  the birth of a child always calls for congratulations. 2. Keep A Positive Demeanor I know you\u2019re nervous, you\u2019re about to have an awkward conversation with some parents, and you have no idea how they\u2019re going to respond to what you\u2019re about to tell them, but  please stay positive.  After all you\u2019re talking about someone\u2019s child. You\u2019re the  professional  and the parents are going to follow your lead. If you look like it\u2019s the end of the world, they may think it is also.\u00a0 But it\u2019s not. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u201d a beautiful new baby who is longing to meet his or her new parents. So please, please, please get over your fear and nervousness, put a smile on your face, and tell them that their new little one has a surprise for them, then  help them understand what causes a child to be born with Down syndrome . This is important as some mothers think it\u2019s their \u201cfault\u201d that their child has Down syndrome, and that they may have done something wrong to  cause it . 3. Tell Them There\u2019s Never Been A Better Time In The History Of The World For A Child To Be Born With Down Syndrome There\u2019s a good chance that you don\u2019t personally know anyone who has Down syndrome, and an even\u00a0better chance that you aren\u2019t up to date on the current information about what life is like for children with Down syndrome. But you should be. I\u2019ve heard stories about OB/GYN\u2019s telling parents that children with Down syndrome suffer, won\u2019t ever be verbal, are sick all the time, and have all sorts of health problems. Sadly, most of these OB/GYN\u2019s are telling their patients this information based on information that is decades old from when they were in medical school. What\u2019s even more heartbreaking is that this inaccurate information causes many of their patients to make a fear based decision (aborting their child) that they regret for the rest of their life. I hope that you would never tell an already scared, worried and shocked parent this harmful\u00a0information. The truth is, there really has never been a better time in the history of the world for a child to be born with Down syndrome. Now, there are  countless resources  available to help people with Down syndrome reach their full potential. Today people with Down syndrome go to college, have careers, drive, get married , are public speakers, become actors and actresses, play (multiple) musical instruments, live independently, and  live meaningful and productive lives . In fact, American Journal of Medical Genetics recently  published a study  that showed that\u00a0parents of a child with Down syndrome have a more positive outlook on life because of their child with Down syndrome. In other words they are happy (not sad and depressed) because of their child with Down syndrome! I recently told a reporter from Headline News that  there\u2019s no reason to be sorry for us , or for Noah\u2026and I meant it! It\u2019s important that you paint an  accurate picture  of what their new child\u2019s life could possibly be like, and an accurate picture is  a hopeful one . When you took the\u00a0Hippocratic Oath you swore that you would use your power (and influence) wisely, so be sure you don\u2019t unwisely and irresponsibly use this power and influence to scare someone into making a decision to end the life of their baby; especially if the information you are giving them to base that choice on isn\u2019t accurate.  Give them hope, not fear. The blood of that little baby is on your hands if you try to tip the scales towards fear and worry and in turn cause them to \u201cterminate their pregnancy.\u201d Remember, you are to use your power wisely, and serve the highest interests of your patients. That little baby in the womb is indeed your patient. Be sure you take good care of him or her, that little baby\u2019s life depends on you. 4. Let Them Know You\u2019d Be Happy To Connect Them With Another Family Raising A Child With Down Syndrome That Can Answer Their Questions And Give Them A Window Into What Life Is Like Rising A Child With Down Syndrome. When you tell a parent that their little child has a\u00a0 chromosomal abnormality\u00a0 they are going to be scared. They will more than likely cry. That\u2019s ok, it\u2019s a normal thing to do. They are mourning the loss of the  imaginary child  they made up in their mind, the child that didn\u2019t have Down syndrome. As they morn the loss of that imaginary child, they will also begin to construct a new child,  their child with Down syndrome. Those parents will probably be like me, and not know much about Down syndrome. They may begin to imagine their new child based on their inaccurate information about Down syndrome, and this will cause them a lot of  unwarranted fear . People are scared of the unknown, and Down syndrome will likely be an unknown for a lot of your patients receiving the diagnosis. It\u2019s your job to help make some of the unknown, known, and by doing so hopefully remove \u00a0some of their fear so they can walk forward in hope. One of the best ways to help new parents learn about Down syndrome isn\u2019t by giving them an outdated pamphlet, and telling them to go home and \u201cthink about it.\u201d It\u2019s by  introducing them to another family who has a child with Down syndrome\u00a0 and allowing them to see what it\u2019s like raising a child with Down syndrome, first hand. My wife and I are currently  expecting another child , and are using a different OB/GYN this time who actually asked us if she could pass our contact information along to one of her other patients who is expecting a child with Down syndrome, to which we quickly and excitingly responded,\u201d Yes!\u201d\u00a0 I would encourage you to do the same. We have a  Facebook page  where lots of families share pictures and stories of their children with Down syndrome, and we also  have a website  where we share 60 second videos of our son Noah just living life and doing things that  typical  kids do. If you don\u2019t know a parent locally that has a child with Down syndrome I would encourage you to reach out to your local Down Syndrome support group.\u00a0 They would be thrilled  to give you a parent contact. In addition, you can  email me  and I\u2019ll happily provide you with my \u00a0information that you can give out to any of your patients. My wife (who is a pediatrician and the mother of a child with Down syndrome) and I would love to talk to any of your patients anytime about what it\u2019s like rising a child with Down syndrome, and I mean that. As a OB/GYN your knowledge about Down syndrome only goes so far. The way you present the diagnosis to parents will largely be swayed by your opinions, experiences and stereotypes of people with Down syndrome, and the \u00a0facts about Down syndrome . It\u2019s ok to be honest about that with your patients.  You\u2019re a Doctor, not God. You aren\u2019t expected to know everything about everything, so please take that pressure and burden off of yourself. The best thing is to tell new and expecting parents that you don\u2019t personally have a child with Down syndrome (assuming you don\u2019t) but that you would like to connect them with a parent who does. Tell them it may help them to see that raising a child with Down syndrome is not as scary as they may think. I think connecting an expecting parent of child with Down syndrome to a parent of a child with Down syndrome is the most\u00a0responsible, helpful and honest thing you can do to help a parent who has just received a Down syndrome diagnosis. In fact, I\u2019m convinced that if every woman who\u2019s baby has received a prental Down syndrome diagnosis could hang out with our son Noah for just thirty minutes  the abortion rate for children with Down syndrome would be almost zero. 5. Don\u2019t Suggest That The Parents \u201cTerminate The Pregnancy\u201d Because The Child Has Down Syndrome I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve been told by another parent of a child with Down syndrome that their Doctor continually suggested (to the point that they felt pressured) that they \u201cterminate their pregnancy.\u201d This suggestion goes against the\u00a0Hippocratic Oath which you swore to abide to. It \u2018s not a wise use of your power and influence, and does not serve\u00a0the highest interest of your patients; either the baby in the womb who is your patient and whom you are suggesting to their parents that they murder (abort / terminate) him or her, or the mother who is also your patient whom you are suggesting murder their child and live with the guilt and regret of their choice for the rest of their life. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, as a Doctor  you have a tremendous amount of influence with your patients , and they are looking to you with trust for guidance, hope, and encouragement. Regardless of what your views are on abortion, and rather or not you are \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201c pro-choice, \u2018 (I\u2019m fully, 100%, always\u00a0 for life  by the way) I\u2019m sure we can agree on the fact that selectively aborting a child based solely on the fact that they have three copies of their 21st chromosome as opposed to two is wrong. In fact,  some states have even made it illegal to abort a child due to a\u00a0genetic abnormality . So please don\u2019t plant the seed of abortion in your patients mind simply because there\u2019s a chance their child is going to be born with Down syndrome. Instead,\u00a0 plant seeds of hope, encouragement\u2026and life. Abortions never  solve  any problem, rather they create a multitude of many more. The Future Of Down Syndrome Is In Your Hands As an obstetrician the future of children with Down syndrome is literally\u00a0in your hands. You have the ability to help parents receiving a diagnosis of Down syndrome to understand that there truly has never been a better time in the history of the world for a child to be born with Down syndrome. You need to let them know they aren\u2019t alone, and that having a child with Down syndrome is nowhere near as scary as they probably think that it is. As you give them current and up-to-date information on Down syndrome, and help connect them with other parents raising children with Down syndrome with a smile on your face and \u201ccongratulations\u201d on your lips you are helping to replace some of your patients fear and anxiety with hope and truth. And that\u2019s a great thing. Parents like me love our children, and honesty wouldn\u2019t change one chromosome on them. Really, we wouldn\u2019t. But even more than that than I believe that all humans are created in the image of God, are fearfully and wonderfully made, and deserve a chance at life. As an OB/GYN I believe you also love life, and no matter how many times you deliver a baby, or hear a child\u2019s heart beat on a\u00a0sonogram you never get over the wonder of new life. I hope this letter helps you to have that same sense of wonder for all new life, no matter how many chromosomes that tiny little life has. Thank you for all that you do, and for playing such a big role in a family\u2019s life. Parents never forget the birth of their children. For the rest of my life I\u2019ll never forget the way our OB/GYN handled the birth of our son Noah. Those two words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d will forever be ingrained in my mind. I hope that your patients remember different things about you. I hope they know you value all human life. That you love their child. That you love them. And that true love doesn\u2019t count chromosomes, it sees beauty in all life. Use your power and influence wisely Doctor. Babies like my son are counting on your to save their lives from  the most dangerous place in the world for a child with Down syndrome , their own mother\u2019s womb.

{"date": ",September,4,2012", "body": "This is the 3rd story I\u2019ve posted like this. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s\u00a0because\u00a0I\u2019m becoming more sensitive to stories about people\u00a0with\u00a0 Down syndrome \u00a0being treated unfairly, or if the media is just starting just starting to report more stories like these. Either way, I think this story deserves to have some attention. American Airlines refuses to allow a teenager with Down syndrome to fly first class? The Daily News published a\u00a0 story today \u00a0about a 16 year old boy with Down syndrome, and their family,\u00a0being denied boarding on an American Airlines flight.\u00a0The Vanderhorst\u00a0family claims they purchased first-class tickets for their\u00a0Newark to Los Angeles flight, and were\u00a0 kicked off the plane \u00a0before\u00a0ever even getting on it,\u00a0 because\u00a0their teenage son had Down syndrome . In fact, the family\u00a0believes\u00a0that American Airlines\u00a0specifically banned their son from the flight\u00a0because\u00a0they didn\u2019t want someone with Down syndrome sitting in first class. \n \nRobert\u00a0Vanderhorst, Bede\u2019s father,\u00a0said he and his wife were told that their son\u2019s behavior could \u201cdisrupt the pilot, since their first class seats were close to the cockpit.\u201d After the Daily News published their story American Airlines released\u00a0the following\u00a0statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Asking the family to take the next flight was a decision that was made with careful consideration and that was done based on the behavior of the teen. Our customer service team worked with the Vanderhorst family and the EWR [Newark airport] team, as well as the crew, tried to get Bede comfortable. Unfortunately, the crew determined he was still agitated.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00a0 My first thought? \u201cMaybe it was a good thing American Airlines didn\u2019t let the\u00a0teenager\u00a0board the plane.\u201d I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m very skeptical when I hear a story like this. I\u2019ve noticed that\u00a0 some parents \u00a0of children with special needs are\u00a0 hyper\u00a0sensitive , and interpret\u00a0every un-fun\u00a0situation\u00a0that\u00a0happens\u00a0to their\u00a0child\u00a0as someone singling them out\u00a0because\u00a0they have special\u00a0needs. There 15 month old with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0can\u2019t ride\u00a0 The Texas Giant ? It\u2019s\u00a0because\u00a0he has Down Syndrome! Their 3 year old with\u00a0Autism\u00a0 can\u2019t buy\u00a0pancakes\u00a0after 10:30 \u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0morning at\u00a0McDonald\u2019s? It must be\u00a0because\u00a0their\u00a0daughter\u00a0has\u00a0Autism! Their 15 year old with\u00a0cerebral palsy can\u2019t\u00a0buy a last minute ticket to see the new Harry Potter movie\u00a0because\u00a0the movies\u00a0sold out? No way! It has to be because the movie\u00a0theater\u00a0doesn\u2019t like people with\u00a0cerebral palsy! My second thought when I first read this story was: \u201cOh brother\u2026.it\u2019s another one of\u00a0 those \u00a0parents.\u201d In American Airlines response, they said that Bede Vanderhorst (the teenager that wasn\u2019t allowed on the plane) was \u201c agitated \u201d and that they couldn\u2019t get him \u201c comfortable .\u201d If that was the case, and the teenager was out of control, then American Airlines\u00a0 shouldn\u2019t\u00a0have let him on the plane . Down syndrome, or no Down syndrome. I don\u2019t want to fly with someone who is \u201cagitated\u201d and could pose a risk to the\u00a0flight. This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with their son having Down syndrome, it has to do with him being out of control. It\u2019s not American Airlines fault that their child has some\u00a0behavior\u00a0problems, and is\u00a0considered\u00a0a \u201cflight risk.\u201d (I would label \u201cbeing agitated\u201d as a behavior problem.) The Vanderhorst Family: Robert, Joan, and their son, Bede I also read that the parents were already talking about suing American Airlines,\u00a0which\u00a0only made more suspicious\u00a0that these parents were indeed\u00a0 those parents . Again, these were just my\u00a0initial\u00a0thoughts. Then I saw this video\u2026. When American Airlines told the family that their son couldn\u2019t board the plane\u00a0because\u00a0of \u201csecurity\u00a0concerns\u201d Mrs.\u00a0Vanderhorst grabbed her camera phone (thank the Lord for technology!) and recorded some of American Airline\u2019s gate agents telling\u00a0them\u00a0that their son\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u00a0be allowed on the\u00a0flight. You can hear the mother sobbing in the background, and very hurt because of the way they felt they were being treated. Even when I heard that part of the news interview, I still thought, Yah, but maybe their son\u00a0 was acting out of control. Let\u2019s see some video of their son. Then the camera pans over to their son, who is not \u201cagitated\u201d at all. In fact, it appears that he is simply sitting quality in his seat, waiting to board the plane. No matter how thin the pancakes, there\u2019s always two sides\u2026 I\u2019ve learned in life that there are always\u00a0 two sides to every story . It\u2019s easy to jump down the airlines throat and\u00a0assume\u00a0the worst. I\u2019ll be\u00a0honest, I would have liked to have seen some video 20 minutes before this one.\u00a0Perhaps their son was\u00a0behaving\u00a0inappropriately and the parents\u00a0weren\u2019t\u00a0paying attention\u00a0because\u00a0they were to busy checking email on their iPhone (anyone else\u00a0guilty\u00a0of this beside me?) The\u00a0then, once the family found out they weren\u2019t able to board the plane, they\u00a0scolded\u00a0their son, told him to sit down quality, and that\u2019s the only part that made the video. I have no way of\u00a0knowing\u00a0since I wasn\u2019t there. On the other hand, American Airlines said in their statement that the pilot\u2019s talked to the family and tried to help their child get \u201ccomfortable.\u201d The family\u00a0claims\u00a0that is an outright lie, and that no pilot spoke to them prior to their son getting kicked\u00a0off the\u00a0flight. Also there are no witness\u2019s to their son\u2019s claimed \u201cbad behavior.\u201d I\u2019ve been to many airports, and very\u00a0seldom\u00a0are they not busy\u2026\u00a0especially\u00a0on a Sunday afternoon. It sure seems that if their son was\u00a0indeed\u00a0behaving\u00a0 so\u00a0inappropriately \u00a0as to cause a\u00a0safety\u00a0concern for other passengers, there would have been\u00a0 a lot \u00a0of witnesses. Additionally,\u00a0 The Huffington Post \u00a0is reporting that the family didn\u2019t even get to fly on a later American Airlines flight, instead the Huffington Post is reporting that the family was rebooked on an United Airlines flight\u2026in the coach section of the plane. And to make matters worse,\u00a0 KTLA \u00a0is reporting the\u00a0family\u00a0did not even\u00a0receive\u00a0a refund for the the first class upgrade fee they paid. Again, I wasn\u2019t there, and I have no idea what\u00a0really\u00a0happened. To be honest, I\u2019m 100% sure American Airlines as a company doesn\u2019t deny passengers\u00a0with Down syndrome, or any other special need , to board a flight,\u00a0regardless\u00a0of where they sit. Could you\u00a0imagine\u00a0the\u00a0liability\u00a0on their hands if that was the case? However, I could see an uninformed (and\u00a0perhaps\u00a0ignorant) gate agent that doesn\u2019t know anything about\u00a0 Down syndrome \u00a0make a really bad decision.\u00a0Perhaps she saw someone who was different \u00a0than her, and instead of getting past her\u00a0uncomfortableness and simply talking to the family, and maybe even asking if their son required any\u00a0special\u00a0assistance on the\u00a0flight (he wouldn\u2019t have by the way, but maybe she didn\u2019t know that) she instead made a very poor (and hurtful) decision. (Which\u00a0incidentally\u00a0happened\u00a0to Glen Beck on a\u00a0 recent\u00a0flight\u00a0with American Airlines .) I have no way of doing for sure. But I sure hope this didn\u2019t really happen as the media is reporting it. And thank you Lord, for not letting me be that dad,\u00a0because\u00a0I\u2019m not 100% sure how I would have responded.\u00a0 By the way, in case you were wondering if it\u2019s hard for someone with Down\u00a0syndrome\u00a0to fly on an\u00a0airplane, check our this video of our son\u2019s\u00a0 first flight , and you tell me.\u00a0 What do you think of this story? Did American\u00a0Airlines\u00a0make a huge mistake? Are the parents blowing things out of\u00a0portion? Or, is it just to hard to tell? By the way, have you ever felt\u00a0discriminated\u00a0against\u00a0while\u00a0traveling\u00a0with your child with Down syndrome? Or on the other side of the coin, do you have any fun travel stories to share? (I like those better!) Be sure to leave a comment below and tell us about it.

{"date": ",September,5,2012", "body": "Noah\u2019s making a straw look easy today! If you watched today\u2019s video you\u00a0may be wondering why in the world he\u2019s \u201cdrinking\u201d his baby food through a straw through! I\u2019ll explain why at the end of this post. I\u2019ll also tell you about how it\u2019s a great oral motor exercise that you can do at home to help\u00a0strengthen\u00a0your child\u2019s mouth\u00a0muscles. So just stick with me.\u00a0 Yelp, Noah\u2019s DRINKING his fruits and vegetables for lunch! My goal: Have Noah\u00a0Transition\u00a0Off The Bottle by 12 months.. It\u2019s been quite the journey to get him to this point. We started using a straw when Noah was\u00a0 6 months old . It was slightly successful initially but then Noah started pushing the straws away and was not interested so I gave up for awhile. (Sometimes it\u2019s best to give our kids a break so that learning new\u00a0habits\u00a0remain fun instead of becoming\u00a0frustrating; which ultimately\u00a0have the reverse effect from what we want.) I however was determined to have him\u00a0 off the bottle by 12 months . This is what I tell everyone else to do, so I better practice what I preach. I however realize that this is not possible for all children especially those with\u00a0 Down syndrome . Bye, bye bottle\u2026. There are different options for weaning off the bottle, you can go to a sippy cup, a straw cup or an open cup. The majority of pediatricians will now recommend a straw cup as\u00a0 it is better for oral motor development \u00a0as well as keeping the cavities away. As a parent of a child with Down syndrome, the straw cup was the only option I considered as I knew that it would serve the double\u00a0purpose of\u00a0 building muscles \u00a0and\u00a0 helping with speech development \u00a0which you can read about in our post \u201c Why A Straw Cup Is Better Than A Sippy Cup \u201d There are about 5 different types of straw cups in our cabinets as of now. Much like\u00a0 choosing a bottle , a straw cup is going to be an individual choice for a child. I am going to tell you what worked for us, but it may not work for your child. I also did this without the help of a speech therapist, so don\u2019t consider this\u00a0 expert \u00a0advice.\u00a0 The Search For The Best Straw Cup It is important to remember that this is not a quick process of \u201cuse a bottle one day\u201d and \u201cuse a straw cup the next\u201d (well maybe some of you will get lucky). You have to guarantee that the child is getting enough fluids while they are transitioning to the straw cup, so you will still be using the bottle until they figure it out. I however would get quite frustrated with my husband for breaking out the bottles because they were easier and less messy than the straw cups,\u00a0especially\u00a0as Noah was learning how to use a straw. (Just a quick side note to remember to be patient with your child as they are\u00a0transitioning\u00a0from the bottle to a straw cup; they will spill milk on\u00a0themselves\u2026.and on you. It\u2019s just something that comes with the\u00a0territory.) But he looks so cute with his bottle\u2026.. Here\u2019s a quick look at some of the various straw cups we used before finding the best straw cup. (And don\u2019t worry, I promise to still tell you why Noah\u2019s drinking his baby food from a straw.)\u00a0 1. The Playtex Straw Cup Playtex Baby Lil\u2019 Gripper Twist \u2018n Click Straw Cup We started out using the\u00a0 Playtex Baby Lil\u2019 Gripper Twist \u2018n Click \u00a0straw cup. The reason I chose this cup was that it was the only one labeled as being able to squeeze the cup and liquid would go up the straw. I knew that part of the process was being able to push liquid into the child\u2019s mouth so that they realized what the straw was for. Noah kind of got the idea of what to do with his lips but rarely was successful at actually getting liquid. He eventually just started pushing the cup away or dodging the straw. 2. The Honey Bear Straw Cup Honey Bear Straw Cup, by Talk Tools \u00a0 Honey Bear Straw Cup \u00a0is the famous straw cup from\u00a0 Talk Tools . \u00a0Our occupational therapist was attempting to get Noah to like the straw again close to his birthday. We attempted to use the honey bear, which I am sure a lot of you have used with huge success. Noah however thought it was terrifying and did not want that bear near him let alone in his mouth!\u00a0 I have never seen him cry when presented with a straw cup, but this bear must have given him quite the look. Needless to say we didn\u2019t try this at home. I think that we have found cups that mimic the good things about this cup minus the scary bear. 3. The Juice Box The classic juice box! Easy, and cheap. When I first started thinking about using a straw our good friends at\u00a0 The Fun House \u00a0told me that I should use a regular, good old juice box. She said that she taught her son to drink from a straw the first time by using this. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t listen to her initially. She told me that I could easily spray a little bit of the juice in the mouth and once they got a taste they would want to figure out how to get more. So after months of trying to get him to drink from our straw cup, I tried the juice box. I kid you not, I sprayed a little bit into Noah\u2019s mouth and he locked down on it and went to town. I do not promise the same results, but I do encourage you to try it out. Why did the juice box work so well? Here are my theories as to why the juice box worked well for us. \n Noah rarely, if ever, had juice and he thought it was awesome and wanted more. \n There is no valve on this straw (much like the honey bear) so you don\u2019t have to work too hard to suck it up. The playtex cup doesn\u2019t have a valve but it is much harder to actually get liquid up, it is even harder to push up. \n The straw was bent and rested against his tongue rather than hitting the top of his mouth. I think that was the biggest realization as I continued working on this with Noah, he only sucked when it was against his tongue. Granted this is not the ideal way to suck, but it is a good place to start. I think one reason he pushed the straws away was because he didn\u2019t like it hitting the roof of his mouth. \n You are able to easily squeeze liquid into the mouth \n The straw is small and therefore requires less force to actually get liquid up by sucking. I would get into the physics of that but I don\u2019t want to bore you. \n 4. Rubbermaid Litterless Juice Box Just look at that lip closure! Now that I knew that Noah was capable of using a straw I just had to find the right cup that replicated the juice box so he could get his milk. Our friend\u00a0 Gretchen \u00a0recommended the\u00a0 Litterless Juice Box . You can order them from Amazon (see the previous link) but\u00a0I have also found them at Wal-Mart and The Container Store. I think that the latter consistently has them whereas I have yet to see another Wal-Mart with one. They worked great, I just kept losing the straw inside. There is an angle to the straw so that it is not hitting the roof of the mouth and Noah was able to suck well. \u00a0It also has the ability to be squeezed and liquid easily goes into the mouth. 5. Take and Toss Straw Cup: Our Favorite Straw Cup! The winner of straw cup show down however was the\u00a0 Take & Toss Straw Cups . They do not have a valve and are surprisingly spill proof (although they do not survive drops to the floor as well as others. 6 reasons the Take and Toss Cups are so awesome! 1.\u00a0You can easily squeeze liquid into the child\u2019s mouth. 2. You can hold it vertically without it spilling to rest the straw on the child\u2019s tongue. 3. They are also extremely cheap and easy to find. 4. You get 5 cups for about 3-5 dollars. 5. They come in fun colors. 6. They seem to work (at least for the people I have suggest them to.) I have sent a few friends home with these to try and they usually have good success. 6. Our next cup to try: The Lollacup! The Lollacup is fun\u2026and functional! There is one cup out there that we have yet to try but when I saw it on TV I knew that the people who\u00a0invented\u00a0it were brilliant. One of the shows Rick and I enjoy together is\u00a0 Shark Tank . A couple went on with their straw cup and it looked to me like pure genius. The\u00a0 Lollacup \u00a0has no valve, a soft straw, a weighted straw inside so that it got all the liquid when it was tilted in the hands of a toddler and had handles. Knowing the wave of the future will be straw cups based on what\u00a0 pediatricians \u00a0are recommending, it was one of those things where you say \u201cwhy didn\u2019t I think of that\u201d. Regardless of what straw cup you choose, remember to stay at it! Noah had\u00a0 lots \u00a0of leakage around the mouth initially and has consistently gotten better. Rick used to get very frustrated with the leaking hence the reason he offered the bottle. We have done off and on\u00a0 beckman oral motor exercises \u00a0that may have helped, but considering\u00a0 how often we actually did\u00a0them \u00a0the fact that we didn\u2019t do them as often as we should have,\u00a0I doubt it was a lot.\u00a0 I think simply\u00a0 using the straw consistently \u00a0built strength in the mouth. So don\u2019t give up if it is a mess for awhile, they will get stronger. We have now been able to use straws with valves, however I do not like the straw cups that make you almost bite the straw to create an opening and then suck through a valve. Those cups are hard even for me. They are meant to be completely spill proof, but they are practically drink proof as well. We have had great success with the playtex brand now that Noah knows what he is doing and Noah can used their \u201cadvanced\u201d straws. \u00a0With these cups I actually trust him to drink in the backseat as well as around the house. \u00a0I would not put a Take & Toss cup in his hands alone in a backseat for fear of the top coming off. Ok, so why was Noah drinking his baby food from a straw?? He\u2019s getting this whole drinking from a straw thing down! If you watched the video at the top of the page, you may be wondering why Noah is drinking his pureed baby food through a straw. Well, I guess you can say we \u201cupgraded\u201d the food Noah takes in from the straw, so to speak. Let me explain. Anna, the wonderful mother of\u00a0 Ellie , taught me how to\u00a0 really give the mouth a workout . She recommended putting a straw through the tops of pureed baby food, and so in this video you see Noah doing that for the first time today. As Anna\u00a0mentions in her\u00a0 blog post , this is a great exercise to help strengthen your child\u2019s\u00a0 oral-maxillary facial muscles \u00a0(try saying that 3 times real fast!) We like to use the small plastic\u00a0containers\u00a0like the one you se in the picture above. It\u2019s a\u00a0 much cheaper \u00a0way to easily eat the purees. And for\u00a0those of you who have to use thickening fluids in your child\u2019s milk or formula, the straw through the top of the baby food container may be something you want to\u00a0consider\u00a0trying. As far as finding a good straw to use; I use the straws from the Take & Toss cups I mentioned above. They are hard plastic and hold up nicely. It think Noah definitely enjoyed it, just don\u2019t let his mouth know it got quite the workout.\u00a0 What tips do you have for teaching your child to drink from a straw? \u00a0What are you favorite straw cups? By the way, if you try out this little tip, be sure to come back and leave a comment\u00a0telling\u00a0us how it went.

If you do mention it on your blog please leave a comment below with a link so I (and others) can check out your blog!* Today kicks off  National Down Syndrome Awareness Month \u00a0which is an entire month dedicated to helping the world see what it\u2019s like raising a child with  Down syndrome  (don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t know there even was such a thing as \u201c down syndrome awareness month ,\u201d I didn\u2019t either until after\u00a0 Noah was born .) \ud83d\ude42 I personally believe  every day  is a great day for parents like myself to help others learn about some of the unique challenges of raising a child with Down syndrome as well as how much children with Down syndrome have in common with  typical  children. However, I do think having an entire month specifically dedicated to raising awareness about Down syndrome is a fantastic jump start to help us all remember that  every day  an great opportunity to rise awareness. 16 Ideas To Help You Make The Most Of Down Syndrome Awareness Month For those of you who have ever wondered, \u201c How can I help raise awareness for Down syndrome? \u201d I wanted to give you a few suggestions to help you make the most of National Down Syndrome Awareness Month and help people understand what it\u2019s like having a child with Down syndrome! I hope these ideas help you, and I\u2019d would love to hear what are you doing as well. So please be sure to leave a comment after reading this post and let me know what you\u2019re doing for Down syndrome awareness month! By adding your own ideas in the comments you\u2019ll help turn this post into a great list of Down syndrome advocacy resources! 1. Tell Your Story! Tell Your Story! Tell Your Story! Did I mention you should tell your story? \ud83d\ude42 Telling your story is without a doubt  the most significant way you can create awareness about Down syndrome  and make a difference in your community (and quite possibly the world!) What I mean by \u201ctell your story\u201d is just that\u2026tell your family\u2019s story to others every chance you get. Now don\u2019t cram it down their throat, but as you build relationships with others, just take the time (and get over any awkwardness you may feel or worry about creating) to talk with them. Let others have a window in to your life, let them know how you felt when you first received your child\u2019s Down syndrome diagnosis, what sort of challenges you face, and most importantly all of the great things your child is doing. I\u2019ve already wrote about how  your story how tremendous power , but only when you tell it! As I mentioned you should tell your story every chance you get, not just in person, but through your social media channels and blogs also. You never know how much of an impact you can make when you take the time to tell (or write) about your story. Heck, I had no idea when I wrote  this post  it was going to  help millions of people learn about Down syndrome , and be written about by press all over the world wide  Time ,  The Huffington Post ,  ABC ,  Headline News ,  Life News , and  many others . We even had the opportunity to tell our story on a few television interviews as well. Here\u2019s a couple of them. Now this isn\u2019t going to happen every time to everyone, but if you impact 1 person or 1 million people, you are still making an impact and thats what counts! So this month especially be sure you take time every chance you get to tell your story! You never know how you could change the world just by taking the time to let others in to your world, so go for it! 2. Make A Informational Down Syndrome Video wistiaEmbed = Wistia.embed(\"ca2407aa26\"); Another great idea to help rise awareness and tell others about Down syndrome is to create a simple informational video. I made the video above with my Nikon D7000 and\u00a0 cheap \u00a0lighting set up  I bought from Amazon, but your video doesn\u2019t even have to be this \u201cgood.\u201d Heck, today almost everyone has a video camera on their cell phone or computer so pull it out and give it go. Just speak from the heart, have some fun, and be yourself. Don\u2019t worry about getting everything right. (As you can see from my example I sure didn\u2019t.)\u00a0After recording your be sure to email it to your friends, share it on your blog, Facebook, and any other social media channel that you may have. (And don\u2019t forget to come back to this blog post and share your video in the comments below because I want to see it!!! By the way, feel free to post the video I made on your blog as well if you\u2019d like. All you have is click the \u201cembed\u201d button above and past it on your site. Be sure to let me know if you have any questions, I\u2019d be glad to help! 3. Use Your Facebook Community As A Way To \u201cCrowd Source\u201d Helpful Down Syndrome Information I asked our Facebook community what they would want to tell someone about what it\u2019s like to rise a child with Down syndrome and just look at all of these responses! So much great info here! Try asking your Facebook community a question and see what happens. 4. Create A Down Syndrome Resource / Achievement Board On Pinterest It seems like everyone is jumping on Pinterest\u00a0these days, which makes it an awesome place to tell your story, and give people a window into your wold. We created a  board of Down syndrome resources , but you could create one that highlights achievements by people with Down syndrome, a list of Down syndrome blogs, or something entirely different. If you end up doing this, be sure to leave a comment with a link to your boards because we want to check them out! 5. Have A Party! We realized there were a lot of families in our area raising young children with Down syndrome and while our local Down syndrome guild (support group) is great, most of their activities are aimed at older children (teenagers) with Down syndrome. So my wife and a few of her friends decided to throw  a monthly party  where families raising a baby / toddler with Down syndrome could get together and have fun! We\u2019ve done this for over a year now, and it\u2019s one of the very best ways to build friendships with other parents in the same life stage as you rising a child with Down syndrome. If this is something you\u2019re interested in doing, I would suggest talking with your local Down syndrome organization; we\u2019ve found that ours has been extremely supportive of what we are doing! 6. Talk To Your OB/GYN If you\u2019re a women talk to your OB/GYN about what it\u2019s like raising a child with Down syndrome. Be sure to them know that if they have a patient whose baby is diagnosed with Down syndrome that you are available and would to connect with them and  tell them your story! By the way, our OB/GYN actually asked us if she could give our contact info to a patient she had whose baby was diagonised with Down syndrome\u2026.how quick do you think we said YES!? 7. Tell A Down Syndrome Fact A Day On Your Facebook / Twitter Account Lots of people are doing this. Just share one fact a day about Down syndrome on your twitter and / or Facebook page. You never know what sort of conversations you are going to start just by doing this one simple thing! 8. Allow People To Ask Questions About Down Syndrome On Your Facebook (And Be Sure To Answer Them) Check out all of these great questions people asked! 9. Volunteer With Your Local Down Syndrome Support Group My wife and I are on the new parent committee of our local Down syndrome support group. This is a great opportunity for us to meet new parents of a child with Down syndrome and once again\u2026 tell our story!\u00a0 Your local Down syndrome group probably has lots of ways for you to volunteer your time. Why not give them a call this week and ask them where you can plug in? Be sure to leave a comment below and let us know if this is something you end up doing! 10. Share Pictures Of Your Life Via Instagram Instagram is blowing up. What a great way to tell your story via quick snapshots.  We\u2019re on Instagram , are you? 11. Start A YouTube Channel YouTube is another great way for you to tell your story via videos. Videos are powerful. In fact, watching videos about children with Down syndrome is one of the reasons I started this site! Youtube is a great way to take and share quick moments from your life to give people a window into just how  normal  your life really is.\u00a0The videos don\u2019t have to be long, and you don\u2019t have to be a professional videographer to change the world via Youtube. In fact we like to share fun moments from our life like this: Check out our YouTube channel  for some ideas, and be sure to let us know if you end up doing this, because we want to see your videos! 12. Do A \u201cTop Ten Blogs By Families Raising A Child With Down Syndrome\u201d Post On Your Blog. This is an easy one. If you have a blog, do a simple blog post where you list 10 families raising children with Down syndrome. Feel free to include ours, and check out this list of  Down syndrome blogs  for other families you can include on your list. By the way we also have a \u201cblog badge\u201d on the bottom of our side bar that we\u2019d love for you to grab and share on your blog! If you end up doing this let us know! If you don\u2019t have a blog, you could post one family\u2019s blog per day on your Facebook and/or twitter account! 13. Start A Google Plus Page That Talks About Down Syndrome (And Allows You To Tell Your Story!) Another easy one.

{"date": ",September,2,2012", "body": "Today was a big day for our little 12 month old. In fact, today was\u00a0 such \u00a0a big day, it\u2019s earned an entry on Noah\u2019s\u00a0 lifetime milestone \u00a0list! Crushing\u2026. So what\u00a0happened\u00a0today that was\u00a0 so \u00a0amazing? Did he\u00a0 ride a\u00a0dinosaur ? Nope, been there, done that. Well, did he\u00a0 ride an elephant ? Nope, been there, done that as well. In fact, today\u2019s milestone\u00a0 even tops \u00a0Noah\u2019s first trip to\u00a0the\u00a0 comic book store ! Which, by the way, is a big deal when you have a \u00a0geek \u00a0for a father.\u00a0 Ok, are you ready\u2026.wait for it\u2026here it comes\u2026.today our 12 month old, dashing,\u00a0adorable, son had his VERY. FIRST. KISS! Don\u2019t get me wrong, we don\u2019t endorse first kisses for one year olds or anything. He can\u2019t even sign \u201cI Love You\u201d yet. Besides, did\u00a0you happen to notice how un-smooth he was with his post-kiss\u00a0flirting\u00a0in the video? He got a little nervous and tripped over his toy\u2026.so he\u2019s still got some growing up to do.\u00a0 \u00a0However, it looks like our little boy\u2019s going to be quite the ladies man, so we\u2019ll have to keep our eye on him.\u00a0 Meet Lilly. Noah\u2019s Best Friend\u2026 With\u00a0Benefits She\u2019s playing hard to get\u2026. Lilly\u2019s the daughter of our friend Laura (who, by the way, makes amazing\u00a0 texture blankets ) and is about 6 months younger than Noah. Since my wife and Laura are best friends, he\u2019s got to hang out with Lilly a lot. It\u2019s been a ton of fun watching them interact and play. And in case you\u2019re wondering, yes, it is\u00a0possible\u00a0for guys and girls to\u00a0 just be friends .\u00a0 He\u2019s not as innocent as he looks.\u00a0 Neither is she\u2026\u2026\u00a0 We\u2019re\u00a0extremely\u00a0blessed that Noah has a such a wide\u00a0variety\u00a0of friends to share life with. Some of his friends have Down syndrome,\u00a0and\u00a0 others \u00a0do not. We think it\u2019s\u00a0important\u00a0for him to be accepted and\u00a0included\u00a0with people who don\u2019t have down syndrome, and we also what him to have friends that know\u00a0 exactly \u00a0what it\u2019s like to have an\u00a0 extra copy \u00a0of your 21st\u00a0chromosome. Friends don\u2019t count\u00a0chromosomes\u2026. Lilly has no idea that Noah has Down syndrome and probably won\u2019t for years. That is the other lovely thing about friends at this age, they have no idea the differences that the world knows too much (or should I say too little) about. Noah and Lilly love each other just because. They don\u2019t judge. They don\u2019t\u00a0 compare milestones. They don\u2019t make fun of each other, or hurt each others feelings. They just play. Most of the time\u2026\u00a0 \u201cUmmm..what just happened? You were kissing me five minutes ago?\u201d Today provided some serious entertainment as Lilly got a little boy crazy and gave Noah his FIRST KISS. \u00a0She just crawled right up and smacked one on him. I can say I don\u2019t blame her since he is a such a\u00a0handsome\u00a0little boy, if I don\u2019t say so myself.\u00a0 Noah responded appropriately by pulling her headband, and snapping it against her forehead\u2026just like a typical boy. \u00a0I think Lilly forgave him. \u00a0I hope these two have years of adventures in front of them. Did I mention Lilly is also a ninja? Who do you consider your child\u2019s best friend? What are some funny things you have seen them do together?

{"date": ",October,6,2013", "body": "It\u2019s hard to believe that our  official Facebook page  passed the 50,000 mark last month! I can still remember the day I started this page (and our blog) back in May of 2011 (which means we\u2019re only a little more than  two years old!)  and trying to get just twenty five of my friends to \u201clike\u201d Noah\u2019s page so we could get a  custom URL ! Thanks to my mom, brothers, wife, and friends for making that happen! It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019ve only been telling our  boy\u2019s story  for only a little over two years. It goes without saying that I never expected this thing to take off like it has.\u00a0Our family has made countless friendships literally all over the world through this blog and our Facebook page. In addition to the friends we\u2019ve made, we also receive messages on an almost daily basis about how this blog and Facebook page has been a source of encouragement and hope for parents who have received a Down syndrome diagnosis\u2026which is awesome since creating  Down syndrome awareness  is one of the main reasons I started doing all of this in the first place! 7 Amazing Statistics From Noah\u2019s Facebook Page Since 50 thousand Facebook fans is a pretty awesome milestone I thought it would be fun to share a few statistics with you about who is part of this amazing community! I think you\u2019ll see that we (our collective group of Facebook fans) are really making an impact  around the globe , and truly showing the world that  Down syndrome is ok! 1. Our Facebook Page Is Reaching An Average Of Over A Million People Per Month! Without a doubt the most amazing about our Facebook community (and the entirety\u00a0of our social media proprieties including this blog) is just  how massive  of an audience / community we have created. Our little boy has developed a very large platform, and it\u2019s not something we take lightly. The following screen shot is from  just one week  of Facebook activity. You can see the total reach of our Facebook page is over 400 thousand a week, which easily puts the reach of the  just  the Facebook page to  over a million and a half people a month!   When you add to that the number of people who connect with us on this blog, our  twitter ,  Google Plus ,  Pinterest ,  Instagram ,  YouTube channel  and email list, the numbers are staggering! As you\u2019ll see below, not only are we reaching lots of people, we\u2019re reaching lots of people  across the globe! Thank you  for being a part of this journey with us. It\u2019s amazing to see how God is using our little boy to bring hope and encouragement to so many people all across the world. What a privilege and honor it is to be a part of this!

I admit, I had no idea where Uruguay was located, but now I do! 3. More People Visit Our Facebook Page From Karachi, Pakistan Than Any Other City In The World! I found this statistic very interesting: when you look at the individual cities where people are Facebook fans are from, Karachi, Pakistan ranks number 1! At the time of this writing we have 1,1779 fans in Karachi compared to the 530 fans we have here in Dallas (where we actually live!) \u00a0In other words,  more people visit our Facebook page from Karachi, Pakistan than that are from Dallas, TX \u2026that\u2019s awesome!!! In fact, Dallas is number 5 on the list, with\u00a0Cairo, Egypt taking the number two spot! Once again, there are people with Down syndrome living all over the world! If you\u2019re curious here\u2019s a list of the top cities where are \u201cfans\u201d are located.  Do your see your city on here?

This one wasn\u2019t surprising to me. I know that mom\u2019s tend to be more \u201cinto\u201d stuff like this. Heck, let\u2019s be honest\u2026my blog is really a  mommy blog  by a dad. It\u2019s all good. So any way, shout out to all the ladies out there! 5. Almost 50% of our Facebook Fans are Women between the ages of 25 and 44 Again, not a huge surprise here either. Check out the chart to see more details about the age and gender of our Facebook friends! 6. More people visit our Facebook Page On Friday Around 3 PM Than Any Other Day / Time Most of our Facebook fans seem to be online on Friday afternoons, but surprisingly almost an equal number of our fans are online all seven days of the week. And even though our largest group of fans are online during the 3 o\u2019clock hour, it\u2019s actually pretty steady from about nine in the morning until about four in the afternoon. Since about 80% of our Facebook fans are women, almost half of those women are between the ages of 25-44, and the majority of our visits occur between 9 am \u2013 4 pm, my assumption is there are a good number of stay at home moms checking out our Facebook Page while their kids are at school. I could be totally wrong, but it seems to support the data. Another interesting statistic is that\u00a0 there are over 6,5000 fans checking out our Facebook page 24 hours a day \u2026.even in the wee hours of the morning. Crazy, huh? 7. We Get Facebook Messages Like This On A Regular Basis I wish I could post every email / Facebook message that we receive. While we don\u2019t get a chance to reply to all of them we do them all, and they encourage us greatly. We literally\u00a0get messages from all over the world, many of them just like this one: \u201cHello, I have just had my screening test, and was given a high risk of having a child with Trisomy\u00a021, I have read your story and had liked your Facebook book page. I have been so scared and worried and been crying since I found out my results, you have really given me \u00a0hope and made me,feel somewhat at rest and help me know that my life isn\u2019t ending. Thank you so so for your page and your story. Your little boy is a stunner.\u201d Emails like this keep me going and really remind my why I keep this blog going. If you\u2019ve ever sent me an email or left a comment on my blog or Facebook with a note of encouragement or telling me a story like the one above, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! You have no idea how much that means to me, please keep them coming! \ud83d\ude42 One More Thank You! Our entire family can\u2019t say thank you enough for all of your encouragement\u00a0these last few years. It\u2019s truly been our pleasure to get to know so many of you (some of whom we\u2019ve even  got to meet in  real  life .) We\u2019re looking forward to continuing to share our story with your and learning more about yours, both on our Facebook page, and this blog! Which of these Facebook statistics stood out the most to you? How long have you been following us on Facebook, and do you remember how many fans our page had when you first \u201cliked\u201d it? Leave a comment below and let us know\u2026also be sure to let us know where in the world you\u2019re from and how our Facebook page has\u00a0encouraged\u00a0you. Thanks so much!

{"date": ",September,3,2012", "body": "We\u2019re in full swing  when-is-this-kid-going-to-take-his-first-steps \u00a0mode around our house. And it isn\u2019t just his mother and I who are\u00a0excited\u00a0about Noah learning to walk\u2026. I can tell by the look on Noah\u2019s face that he\u00a0 really  wants to take take those first steps. But he isn\u2019t quite there\u2026yet. On the\u00a0other hand, he\u2019s one of the fastest  inchworm-ers  I\u2019ve ever seen! These feet were made for walking, and that\u2019s just what they\u2019ll do\u2026.. Treadmill\u00a0therapy plays a huge role in helping our child  learn to walk . He\u2019s only 12 months old in today\u2019s video, and he\u2019s been doing treadmill\u00a0training\u00a0for half of his life, literally. (His physical\u00a0therapist\u00a0started him on the treadmill when he was only  8 1/2 \u00a0months old !) It\u2019s amazing to see how far he\u2019s come since he  first started \u00a0walking on the treadmill. The first few times he put his little feet on the treadmill he didn\u2019t want to do anything. (Or maybe he didn\u2019t know what to do?) But as time went on, and he became more\u00a0comfortable\u00a0on the treadmill, he\u2019s started to put one of his tiny feet in front of the other! As you can see in the video, he\u2019s making some great\u00a0progress\u00a0and really starring to get use to the motion of walking. He\u2019s nowhere near walking\u00a0independently\u00a0at this point, but he\u2019s well on his way. And we owe a large part of that to his treadmill therapy (and his amazing  physical\u00a0therapist !) I\u2019m so  proud  of this little boy! And to be honest, I really don\u2019t care how long it takes him to learn to walk. I\u2019m just enjoying being his dad and getting a front row seat to seeing his grow up. If anything I wish I could  slow it down , not speed it up. What you don\u2019t know, won\u2019t hurt you\u2026.. Noah\u2019s our first and only son (at least at the time of this writing) and I have no idea what the\u00a0 typical  age range is for when a child should \u00a0 start walking. To be honest if I didn\u2019t have friends with young kids I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even know that our son had developmental delays. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing, or a bad thing, but I don\u2019t mind. My wife on the other hand is a pediatrician and is surrounded by young kids all day. She knows milestone charts and developmental guidelines like the back of her hand, so our\u00a0knowledge\u00a0when it comes to when a kid is  supposed  to (fill in the blank with whatever milestone you\u2019re hoping your kid will achieve next.) However I have to say even with all of the knowledge, she still does a fantastic job at\u00a0 celebrating and not comparing . (Which is another reason I love her so much!) You would seriously crack up if you could hear some of our\u00a0conversations. Here\u2019s an example: Me: Is it normal for a 12 month old to wear 3-6 month clothes? My wife: Nope. Me: Oh, ok. Cool. ***** Again, I love my wife. \ud83d\ude42 Want to learn more about how treadmills help children learn to\u00a0walk? If you\u2019re interested\u00a0in\u00a0learning\u00a0more about treadmill training for\u00a0children\u00a0with Down syndrome\u00a0 Dr. Ulrich , who pretty much invented treadmill\u00a0training\u00a0for babies with Down syndrome, gave us\u00a0permission\u00a0to make\u00a0available\u00a0the\u00a0 protocol\u00a0for treadmill\u00a0training \u00a0as a free download. I\u2019d\u00a0highly\u00a0suggest checking it out, and even showing it to your\u00a0child\u2019s\u00a0physical therapist in case they aren\u2019t aware of it. Has your child ever used a treadmill in physical\u00a0therapy? Has your\u00a0therapist\u00a0discussed this with you as a\u00a0option for your child?
