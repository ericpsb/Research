Your children are your children, your children are not \"autism\". \"Autism\" is just a word used to describe a set of behaviors, it is not something they can be. \u00a0So love your children but feel free to hate \"autism\".\n\n2. Not everything your children do is because of autism. \u00a0Autism may be pervasive developmental disorder that has an incredibly broad impact but it doesn't cause every problem behavior does not it grant every area of talent. \u00a0So if your child is good at something that is probably because they are good at it. \u00a0If they have issues it could be something other than autism causing them.\n\n3. Autism is not \"genetic\", at least not in the way that most people mean when they say \"genetic\". \u00a0Genetic alterations do play a role in autism but autism is not solely (or even largely) controlled by our genes. \u00a0So ignore all of the breathless announcements about new discoveries about \"autism genes\" because it is not going to be that simple. \u00a0Autism (or more likely autisms) is going to look a lot like cancer when it comes to genes - there will be genes that increase risk but none that directly cause the condition.\n\n3. Autism is an ongoing disruption of biological homeostasis. \u00a0Your body is an exceptional machine that works extremely hard to keep things in balance. \u00a0Autism, whatever it is, comes in and takes a sledgehammer to that carefully maintained balance and then keeps it out of balance. \n\n4. Recovering from autism is a two step process. \u00a0First you have to try and find and correct the underlying biological issues that are preventing progress and causing problematic behaviors and then you have to teach the skills that were not learned normally.\n\n5. The number of people with autism is growing at an extremely alarming rate. \u00a0You can argue about what factors are artificially inflating the numbers but at the end of the day you are still left with a substantial real increase. \u00a0The rate of this growth shows no signs of slowing down. \u00a0If you are not concerned about this then you are either not paying attention or are in denial. \u00a0Autism is not the only developmental disorder growing like this.\n\n6. The online autism \"community\" is largely filled with asshats pushing their own ideology. \u00a0You can and should ignore most of them. \u00a0Don't focus on an ideology but instead find the bits and pieces that work for your family.\n\n7. Organizations such as ASAN are top 1 percent of the autism world. \u00a0Yes, most of them have something that you might be able to call autism but it bares little resemblance to what the other 99 percent of people with autism look like. \u00a0Their slogan might be \"its all about us\" but they really have no clue about what life is like for the other 99 percent of people with autism.\n\n8. Parents, you need to achieve peace with your children having autism. \u00a0You need to take time for yourselves and to find a way to relax and enjoy yourselves. \u00a0If all you \u00a0do is live and breathe autism 24 hours a day then you will burn out.\n\nTake care and good luck.\n\nMatthew Joseph\n\nP.S. Why was it so very hard for everybody to understand that M.J. was initials and not a women's name? \u00a0I mean, really, if I had dollar for every time someone called me she...\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-end-of-beginning.html", "title": "\nThe End of the Beginning\n"},

Even in the self-protective annals of the CDC, this study is a stinker.\u00a0\n\nBut putting that aside, the fact that Jalen fell off a developmental cliff TWO OR THREE DAYS after vaccination ought to make somebody in the editing room at that TV station, or some mainstream outlet somewhere, sit up and take notice.\u00a0\n\nThis happens all the damn time, people! These kinds of parental accounts, combined with the $2 billion plus awarded in vaccine court, including to Hannah Poling; the known properties of vaccination, and the concommitant rise of mercury and vaccines with the autism epidemic, are far more than enough to start asking tough questions.\u00a0\n\nIt's not going to be very PC to say this, but one of the most vivid images from the end of World War II is the Allies making local villagers walk through a newly liberated concentration camp. The message was -- how can you say you did not know?\nOrac, aka David Gorksi - \"You hate your children\" -\n\nIt\u2019s very clear that many antivaccinationists hate autistic children. The language they use to describe them makes that very clear. Such children are \u201cdamaged\u201d (by vaccines, of course); the parents\u2019 real children were \u201cstolen\u201d from them (by vaccines); they are \u201ctoxic\u201d (from vaccines); the \u201clight left their eyes\u201d (due to vaccines). Autism is an \u201cepidemic,\u201d a \u201ctsunami,\u201d even a \u201cholocaust,\u201d with \u201cdenial\u201d of that \u201cholocaust\u201d being equivalent to Holocaust denial. All of this likens autism to a horror on par with these calamities, and paints vaccines as the instrument of annihilation of antivaccinationists\u201d \u201creal\u201d children.\nBoth arguments are full of it. \n\nAny possible connection between vaccines and autism is not straightforward and obvious. \u00a0Yes, there have been some high profile cases of vaccines being implicated in autism but no one has been able to document a larger or more widespread relationship. \u00a0Just because the average doctor, parent, or journalist follows the lead of the experts in the field - experts who have served them well - does not mean that they are akin to Nazi sympathizers.\n\nAnd on the flip side, the idea that talking about perceived damage to your children means that you hate them? \u00a0I don't think I quite have the words to describe how utterly stupid that argument is. \u00a0I'm not quite sure what sort of person hears a parent say that they think their child was injured and turns around and tells them that they must not love their child. \n\nI think this comic from SMBC sums up the current state of the autism-vaccine wars quite well and, if the above exchange is any guide, we might be close to the optimal solution in the final frame-\n\n\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2013/04/weekly-wrap-big-disconnect-in-autism-coverage.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2013/04/06/can-antivaccinationists-knock-it-off-with-the-autism-holocaust-analogies-already/", "http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=2939", "http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20130407.gif"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2013/04/autism-vaccine-war-reaches-new-height.html", "title": "\nAutism-Vaccine War Reaches New Height of Stupidity\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 26, 2014", "body": "\n\nI don't think it will come as a shock to anyone who has been reading this blog over the years that I don't care for the idea of neurodiversity. \u00a0The core idea of neurodiversity - that everyone is different and should be accepted for who they are - is a pretty simple and obvious idea and one that I completely agree with. \u00a0But the neurodiversity movement doesn't stop with just that simple idea and piles so much other crap on top of it that core principle is distorted beyond recognition.\n\nYou start with the idea that a person should be accepted as a person even if they are different and you end with with random people wandering the internet screaming at autism parents such as myself that they hate their children. \u00a0For example, here is a recent example of a comment that one of these lovely people left here not too long ago -\n\nI never get tired of allistic parents thinking they know more about autism from having young autistic children than actual autistic adults who have been autistic for decades. Really great. Love it. (All sarcasm, sorry.)\n\nIt's not worth trying to convince martyr parents like this one, Anon. He's utterly convinced he's an authority while he continues to use functioning labels and make ableist jabs at an autistic person who disagrees with him. (Also seems to support Autism $peaks? Gross.) I'm so freaking tired of trying to Google helpful info about autism and getting only results from whiny parents trying to 'correct' their kids or whatever.\n\nReally, if this is how he reacts to actual autistic people who DO possess the ability to respond to him and voice our opinions, I can only imagine how nasty he must be to his kids, whether he realises it or not.\u00a0\n\nAnon, if you wanna talk more about autistic stuff with actual autistic people who won't try to talk over each other, send me an ask (you'll need a tumblr account, sorry) at (REDACTED) and I'll give you my real URL once I know it's you and not OP or his gross curebie fanclub.\u00a0\n\nOtherwise, yeah, don't waste your energy on this guy. I'm about to use my Google Blocklist to make sure this trash blog doesn't show up in the results for me anymore.\u00a0\n\nReally sorry for OP's kids. We've all been there, but sure, of course he knows what's best even though we're expressly telling him he's wrong from experience, right? (more sarcasm, sorry)\nIn the interests of full disclosure, I did delete this person's (repeated) comments and simply told him (repeatedly) to go away. \u00a0This isn't a woe is me or pity party post and in the not too distant past I might have engaged this person and tried to change his mind. \u00a0But you can only have the same discussion so many times before it really just gets old.\n\nThe point is that attitudes like this are one of the comment end results of neurodiversity. \u00a0You start with the idea that everyone should be accepted for who they are and end with people who think differently are not accepted. \u00a0It never ceases to amaze me that none of the neurodiversity advocates recognize the inherent hypocrisy of their position.\n\nSo with that in mind it is interesting to look at where neurodiversity starts. \u00a0One person was nice enough to perform, as they put it, a \"public service\" and give their opinion about what all of the terms surrounding neurodiversity mean. \u00a0I would like to draw your attention to the basic definition of neurodiversity that was provided\u00a0since it is a common one -\n\nWhat It Means:\u00a0\n\nNeurodiversity is the diversity of human brains and minds \u2013 the infinite variation in neurocognitive functioning within our species.\n\nWhat It Doesn\u2019t Mean:\u00a0\n\nNeurodiversity is a biological fact. It\u2019s not a perspective, an approach, a belief, a political position, or a paradigm. That\u2019s the neurodiversity paradigm (see below), not neurodiversity itself.\u00a0\n\nNeurodiversity is not a political or social activist movement. That\u2019s the Neurodiversity Movement (see below), not neurodiversity itself....\nI think the seeds of where the neurodiversity movement goes wrong are in this basic definition so lets break it down. \u00a0Is an \"infinite variation in neurocognitive functioning within our species\" a \"biological fact\"?\n\nThe answer is no for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first reason is a rather pedantic but also important one. \u00a0The word \"infinite\" has a very specific meaning -\" limitless or endless in space, extent, or size; impossible to measure or calculate\". \u00a0The human brain is clearly not limitless or impossible to measure. \u00a0In a more general sense you can't take something that is finite and get to infinite simply because there are lot of possible permutations. \u00a0The number of theoretical combinations might be an very large number but it is still finite.\n\nMaybe a better way of saying this is that you can't represent infinity in about 1.5 kg of tissue.\n\nIts very romantic to think of the human brain as having infinite possible configurations but the word simply doesn't fit. \u00a0There are going to be a finite number of configurations that your brain can be in, which leads to the next point.\n\nOf all of the theoretical combinations that your brain can be in, how many do you think are valid state in which your brain would function? \u00a0Just because the underlying biology can be put together in a certain way doesn't mean that brain would actually function in that configuration. \u00a0By function I mean not only things that are outward behaviors but also little unimportant things like keeping our body running.\n\nI don't have an exact answer to how many configurations are valid but basic biology tells us that our cells need very specific and narrow conditions to live. \u00a0The body has many redundant systems whose purpose appear to be to keep the itself operating within parameters. \u00a0I would presume the same holds true for how the brain wires itself. \u00a0Just because a brain could be wired a certain way doesn't mean that way will produce a result that would actually do anything or be able to sustain the basic biological functions of a person.\n\nI would estimate of all of the possible permutations of the human brain only an extremely small number of the permutations would be able to run the human body and produce a result that resembles anything even close to what we understand as a person.\n\nSo no, the \"biological fact\" isn't that \"infinite variations\" are possible. \u00a0The \"fact\" is that while the number of possible variations may seem to be impossibly large to us, it is in \"fact\" quite a small range that will actually work.\n\nA good analogy here might be how we think of color. \u00a0The human eye can perceive what some might consider an almost infinite variation in colors. \u00a0But in \"fact\" we can only see an extremely narrow range of the possible spectrum. \u00a0The human eye is very limited in its range and yet to our narrow perspective the range seems impossibly large.\n\nOnce you leave the romantic idea, or \"biological fact\" if you prefer, of infinite possibilities behind you can start considering what the possible set of variations are going to be. \u00a0Without getting too far afield, let's just assume that out of the possible set of configurations there are going to some that are more common than others. \u00a0There is a substantial body of evidence that suggests that this is the case and there are many reasons why it could be true.\n\nThis common set is what most people think of as \"typical\" or \"normal\". \u00a0Those words have a lot of extra meaning packed into them but the basic idea is that most people, for whatever reason, are going to be inside this range. \n\nSo what about the people who don't fit inside this \"normal\" range, the people that the neurodiversity movement is so concerned about? \u00a0Going back to the basic idea you shouldn't assume that a person is somehow less of a person because they don't fit into some typical range. \u00a0But this statement isn't an extrapolation of \"biological fact\" but rather an ethical one.\n\nNeurodiversity is an ethical construct that is based on extremely human ideas and that is why it starts going so wrong at the very start. \u00a0Neurodiversity conflates the ethical idea of a person having value because we have chosen to value people with the idea that all of the possible biological permutations have the same desirability or value.\n\nInside the limited set of permutations that can occur in your brain that will produce a result that is a \"person\" there are going to be some permutations that are more desirable than others. \u00a0The limited human set still allows a wide variety - some permutations are going to give you the ability to function better than others while some permutations are going to take away abilities that almost everyone else has.\n\nEthics tells us that we value people because they are people. \u00a0It does not tell us that value people because of a specific trait nor does it does say that not valuing a specific trait means that we devalue the person. \n\nEthics also tells us that we should help people who need help. \u00a0It doesn't say that you look at a person and say, yep, there are permutation XYZ and it is wrong to try and help because that would \"change\" them in the same way that it wouldn't tell you that should leave a person bleeding to death on the street because that is an equally valid permutation of the human state.\n\nProponents of neurodivesity apply it to autism and value the difference simply because it is different and, as such, worth protecting. \u00a0That leads to the end result of attacking people who try and alter the difference. \n\nBut the underlying ethical idea is that a person has value because they are a person and not the specific permutation or condition that they are in. \u00a0That is one of the reasons why I always say person with autism rather than autistic person. \u00a0The person is the thing with value not the permutation that is autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://neurocosmopolitanism.com/neurodiversity-some-basic-terms-definitions/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2014/10/neurodiversity-biological-fact-or.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity : Biological Fact or Fiction?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 30, 2014", "body": "\n\n\nIt's that time of the year again - winter is finally starting to fade, spring is in the air, and Autism Awareness month is right around the corner. \u00a0Which means that it is time to play one of my favorite games - rationalize about the latest massive increase in the rate of autism.\n\nIn case you haven't heard, the CDC just this week released the latest in its series of reports on autism prevalence. \u00a0This new report which looked at children who were eight in 2010 found that overall 1 in 68 children had a form of autism - 1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls. \u00a0 \n\nSince a picture is worth a thousand words, here is what the CDC's autism prevalence figures have looked like over the past 10 years.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see the autism prevalence figures from just this one source have more than doubled in just ten years. \u00a0I have to wonder how much higher the rate is going to have to go before public health officials and the medical community start taking the problem seriously. \u00a0What does the number have to be before we stop trying to explain away the increase and start acknowledging that the increase just might be because more people are developing autism?\n\nThe CDC's explanation this year is a mixed bag of more children with typical intelligence being recognized, \"better awareness\", and, somewhat strangely, saying that even more awareness is needed in certain areas. \u00a0Entirely missing from the explanation or interpretation is anything that suggests there might be a very real problem.\n\nHow can it be that after ten years of study the CDC can't figure out if the increase is real? \u00a0How can they say in their 2000 report when the new, unexpectedly high rate was 6.7 per 1,000 -\n\nStudies of ASD prevalence in the United States during the 1990s have identified rates of 2.0 - 7.0 per 1,000 children, a greater-than-tenfold increase from rates of 0.1 - 0.4 per 1,000 children identified during the 1980s. [...] However, because the number of persons identified for services is dependent on multiple factors (e.g., changing eligibility criteria, increased awareness, and changes in service availability), aggregate data might underestimate prevalence and should be used with caution in examining population-based trends.\nAnd now, ten years later, when the rate is 14.7 per 1,000, when there are more than 2 children with a diagnosis of autism for every one back then, they say -\n\nThe global prevalence of autism has increased twentyfold to thirtyfold since the earliest epidemiologic studies were conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s. At that time, prevalence estimates from European studies were one in 2,500 children in the population, and by the 2000s prevalence estimates from large surveys were 1%\u20132% of all children. Although the underlying reasons for the apparent prevalence changes are difficult to study empirically, select studies suggest that much of the recent prevalence increase is likely attributable to extrinsic factors such as improved awareness and recognition and changes in diagnostic practice or service availability.\nHow can the expected rate of autism go from 1 per 1,000 to 6.7 per 1,000 to 14.7 per 1,000 and the explanation stay the same? \n\nTo preempt any snarky comments, yes, there are some external social factors that can explain away some of the increase without their being an actual increase in the number of people with autism. \u00a0But to suggest that there were 14 people with autism in the past for every 1 that was identified but no one noticed due to social issues is just absurd. \u00a0It is very hard to miss a large number of children who have functional language issues, don't socialize well, have restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, sensory issues, and the tendency to meltdown on a regular basis.\n\nThe other part of the CDC's explanation, the idea that increase is bring driven by children with more typical intelligence, is complex one that would require its own post. But, suffice it to say, like last year's \"later diagnosis\" theory it doesn't hold up under close scrutiny. \u00a0The increasing IQ numbers could easily be attributable to the increasing availability and use of early intervention services such as speech therapy and ABA. \u00a0If you start increasing a child's receptive and expressive communication ability and teach them how to better self-regulate then, everything else being equal, they will be score better on an IQ test.\n\nBesides which, since these numbers are in line with last year's NSCH increase but are based on one static age, how can you reconcile the current findings with last years? \u00a0Especially since the median age of diagnosis did not change in the current CDC report from the one before? \u00a0Oh wait, you try to do it like so -\n\nComparison of findings from the ADDM Network 2010 surveillance year with results from the CDC 2011\u20132012 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) on parent-reported ASD prevalence (5) revealed some similarities. Collectively, these two studies used three complementary data sources: health (ADDM), education (ADDM), and parent-report (NSCH). The report based on NSCH data estimated ASD prevalence of 2.0% among children aged 6\u201317 years in 2011\u20132012. Like the ADDM Network, NSCH also found a large increase in ASD prevalence compared with its previous estimate, which was based on 2007 data. The NSCH attributed this increase to children who received diagnoses at an older age, with a greater proportion judged as having mild (less severe) ASD according to parent report. Although not synonymous with ASD without co-occurring intellectual impairment, the increased number of children with milder ASD diagnosed at an older age in the NSCH study parallels the increasing percentage of children with normal intellectual ability and ASD identified in the ADDM Network.\nIn other words, the NSCH report attributed the increase to increased number of milder, more intelligent children being diagnosed later in life (i.e. after age 8) and the current CDC report says that is comparable to milder, more intelligent children being diagnosed earlier in life (i.e before the age of 8)? \u00a0Even though the NSCH data is more recent than the CDC data? \n\nTo leave you on a happy note, the most recent data from the CDC is already quite stale because it is talking about children who were born in 2002. \u00a0It doesn't tell us what the rate of autism is in children who are being born today. \u00a0Given that the rate has gone up considerably every time we look at a later birth year I think it is safe to assume that the rate for children born today is much higher than 1 in 68.\n\nIf you want to get an idea of what the numbers might look like for children born after 2002 you can look at the NSCH numbers. \u00a0But \u00a0the NSCH data contains a lot of extra noise that makes it hard to compare to the CDC numbers. \u00a0However, if you take the data from the last three NSCH data sets, pull out the data on the children who were eight at the time, and chart it with the CDC numbers by birth years you get a somewhat clearer picture -\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers aren't exactly comparable because of differences in how they are derived. \u00a0The NSCH data is based on parental report and might be overstating the rate. \u00a0But the NSCH data also covers a much larger part of the country than the CDC numbers do so might be more representative of the country as a whole. \n\nIn any event, I think it is interesting that the two disparate data sets are showing the same trend. \u00a0If you measure the same thing in two different ways and come up with a similar answer then that tells you your answer is probably correct. \n\nIf the trend in the two data sets has continued to current day then the autism number for children born today will be about 1 in 25. \u00a0Maybe in twelve years when the CDC releases data for children born this year we will be treated to explanations about how our awareness is so much better than it was today. \u00a0Because, like ten years ago today, we would finally be seeing the half of the autism population that we can't see today.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.public-domain-photos.com/free-cliparts-3/shapes/arrows/arrow-up-red_benji_park_01.png", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6302a1.htm?s_cid=ss6302a1_w", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/-T0XiUiLaWdU/UzgQJMbbKBI/AAAAAAAAAiU/1aNC4JaW1es/s1600/CDC_2014.png", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5601a1.htm", "//4.bp.blogspot.com/-_joE_HIp5Rk/UzgQPctNDgI/AAAAAAAAAic/h07asaTt_pY/s1600/CDC_NSCH_2014.png"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2014/03/autism-rising-emperors-new-clothes.html", "title": "\nAutism Rising : The Emperor's New Clothes\n"},

Not the autistic person who\u2019s doing it.\u00a0\nThe idea here is that stims happen, can't be controlled, and that the only reason that parents try to stop stims is that they are embarrassed.\n\nHere's another one that is so hyperbolic that it would be funny if it weren't so sad -\n\nLet me be extremely fucking clear: if you grab my hands, if you grab the hands of a developmentally disabled person, if you teach quiet hands, if you work on eliminating \u201cautistic symptoms\u201d and \u201cself-stimulatory behaviors,\u201d if you take away our voice, if you...\u00a0\n\nif you...\u00a0\n\nif you...\nThe overriding theme of this last one is that stopping or redirecting stims to tantamount to child abuse. \u00a0Yes, the point is that the common phrase \"quiet hands\" is somehow taking away this person's voice. \u00a0And here I was under the impression that it is autism itself that causes problem with expressive communication. \u00a0Silly me.\n\nI could go on to point out other examples of this meme but I think you get the point - stopping stims is bad. \n\nAs a parent whose children who have to struggle with autism, I couldn't disagree more. \u00a0Stims are not some harmless thing that can be ignored. \u00a0Stims can and regularly do stop a person with autism from being able to function or learn. \u00a0And, in some cases, stims can directly harm a person or put them in harms way.\n\nNormally I would just let these things go and simply ignore what is being said. \u00a0The people who are making statements like these presumably have a diagnosis of autism and know how their personal stims affect their daily lives. \u00a0I might think that they take an extremely shallow view of stimming and what it is like for people who aren't quite so high functioning but I don't like to nitpick what people with a disability say about their disability. \u00a0Especially since a lack of understanding of what others are thinking or experiencing is a large part of the disorder that they are struggling with.\n\nHowever, this time I ran across that first article because someone pointed it out on twitter and highlighted it as a \"great post and discussion\". \u00a0This person, in my opinion, really should know better and should understand the nuances and issues surrounding stimming in autism. \n\nBut apparently that isn't the case. \u00a0Apparently the idea that stims are harmless is gaining traction and acceptance even among people who should know better. \u00a0So lets talk about what is wrong about that idea starting with a definition of what a \"stim\" is. \n\nA stim is any behavior whose purpose is self-stimulation. \u00a0The behavior is typically going to target or involve one of the following things -\n\n\nOne or more of the five senses (sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell)\nThe vestibular sense (balance, movement, acceleration)\nPain or pleasure\nAnything else that can induce a feeling or sensation\n\n\nIn one sense, everybody has stims because everybody has behaviors that are designed to stimulate themselves. \u00a0But there are very clear differences between a \"typical\" person's stim and an autistic stim and these differences come down to a matter of choice and a matter of degree. A \"typical\" person can control their behaviors and can choose when and where to engage in them. \u00a0They control their behaviors, their behaviors don't control them. \u00a0\n\n\n\nIn autism, there is a definite lack of choice and a definite lack of ability to control the level or degree of the stimulation. \u00a0Stims happen for a variety of reasons, some internal, some external but the person with autism doesn't necessarily have the ability to rein in or stop the behaviors even if they wanted to.\n\nSo, the question is then why do parents try to get their children to stop stimming? \u00a0If it stimming is really a compulsion that people with autism are being forced to do or a way of dealing with some external factor, why do mean parents like myself try to squash it?\n\n\nThe short answer is that the cause, effect, and context of the stimming very much matters. \u00a0Stims happen for a variety of reasons, have variety of effects, and both the cause and effect can change depending on the context of what is going on when the stim happens. \u00a0You can't make blanket statements about a stim being good, bad, or harmless without considering the whole picture.\n\nAnother reason to address stimming is to give the child the ability to recognize what is causing the need to stim, giving them the skill set to deal with the stim, and teaching them to better regulate themselves and their environment so that they can function better. \n\nThough the overriding reason, to me at least, is to give the person the ability and option of controlling their behaviors rather having their behaviors control them. \n\nLet talk a little bit about the cause, effect, and context of stimming and why it matters starting with some common causes of stimming. \u00a0Here is a short list of some common causes -\n\nSensory overload or underload. One of the things about sensory processing in autism that is often overlooked is that the sensory imbalances goes both way - there are sensory avoidance issues as well as sensory seeking issues. A stim can be caused by a need for more sensory input as easily as it can be caused by too much input.\n\nAn external factor that increases the person's level of stress, anxiety, fear, or some other mental state. \u00a0This reason is really about a failure of self-regulation - something else happens and the the person has no way to cope with the situation and resorts to stimming to relieve the pressure.\n\nAn internal failure of self-regulation. \u00a0This is an internal failure to self regulate some aspect of a life and this failure leads to stimming. \u00a0A couple of examples would be not sleeping at night, not eating when hungry, or not stopping to rest when tired.\n\nBiological imbalances. People with autism can (and often do) have certain biological imbalances that can lead to the need for stimming. For example, pica or mouthing can be caused by iron deficiency. \u00a0\n\nA compulsion for the stimulation, i.e. a repetitive behavior. \u00a0Another way of looking at this is that the stim and resulting sensation is addictive - the person craves the sensation and doesn't feel right without it.\n\nAs you can see, there are many different and varying reasons for stimming. \u00a0The above list is far from complete but each of the causes on the list needs to be addressed differently. \u00a0You can't address a sensory issue the same way as you address anxiety nor can you address iron deficiency the same way as lack of sleep. \n\nThe point is to properly evaluate and address a stim you need to get some idea of why it is happening, what a person is avoiding, or what they are getting out of it.\n\nAlong those same lines, an increase in the number or types of stims can point to a some new problem or issue that needs to be addressed. \u00a0If you are dealing with a person who is either non- or minimally verbal then this change might be the only sign of the problem. \u00a0For example, my children are sensitive to noise so they have a \"stim\" where they hold their ears. \u00a0However, if they start holding their ears more than normal than it can be a sign that they have an ear infection. \u00a0Or it could be a sign that something else is stressing them out.\n\nLets move onto the effects of a stim. \u00a0Simply put, the effects of a stim are as varied as the forms of the stims themselves. \u00a0But, in general, you have to consider the following questions when evaluating whether a stim needs to be addressed -\n\nDoes the behavior interfere with the person's ability to function or learn?\nDoes the behavior interfere with another person's ability to function or learn?\nDoes the behavior harm the person or does the behavior pose a safety risk?\nDoes the behavior harm another person or does the behavior pose a safety risk?\n\nThe overall goal of addressing stims is to stop or redirect behaviors that stop a person from being able to function or learn. \u00a0For example, if you have a child at school who can't sit in a chair and has to constantly move about the room and scream, then they are not going to be able to function and learn at school. \u00a0If you put them in a mainstream classroom then their behaviors might stop the other children from learning as well.\n\nThe goal is also very much about stopping the child from endangering themselves or others. \u00a0Contrary to popular myth, flapping, spinning, and humming aren't the most common stims. \u00a0There are quite a few others and many of them can be downright problematic.\n\n\nTo give you an example, two of my daughters have a stim where they hit or push on their chins with the palm of their hands when they are either stressed or tired. \u00a0If they are \"just\" pushing on their chin it isn't the end of the world but it certainly isn't good for them. \u00a0However, it is a short step from just pushing to slamming their palm into their chin and that could cause some real damage. \u00a0As a result, we do not tolerate that particular stim and stop them every time we see them start it.\n\nThe last part of the equation is that the context of the stim can influence or change both the cause, effect, and acceptability of a particular stim. \u00a0Some stims are going to be perfectly fine in one situation but very problematic in others. \u00a0Take for example the common stim of flapping. \u00a0Flapping comes in many forms, from a simple hand movement all the way up to moving the entire arm rapidly.\n\nFlapping is harmless, right? \u00a0Well, yes and no - it all depends on where you are and how you do it. \n\nIf the person is at home and relaxing them flapping is probably going to be harmless and shouldn't be stopped. \u00a0But what if they are standing close to someone and their flapping involves their entire arms? \u00a0What happens if the person is standing in a crowd of people and starts hitting people around them with their flapping arms?\n\nTaking it one step further, when a person is flapping they usually are paying less attention to their surroundings. \u00a0So what happens if a person starts flapping while they are crossing a street or walking through a parking lot and stops paying attention to the cars going past?\n\n\nNeither one of these is a contrived example - we have had both happen several times to the point where we have had to work on getting the kids' flapping under control - and flapping is a relatively harmless stim. \u00a0There are stims that are far worse and more impairing than flapping.\n\n\nThe final part of the puzzle is what you do about problematic stims and this is the major bit that self-advocates don't seem to get or understand. \u00a0Children with autism do not learn like typical children. \u00a0You can't necessarily just talk to them about what part of a stim is a problem or when it is or isn't appropriate like you could a \"typical\" child.\n\nAt best the child with autism might have trouble applying what you saying when faced with the urge to stim, at worst they won't have the functional communication to understand what you are trying to explain. \u00a0This is why many parents use one of the forms of behaviorism to help them teach their children.\n\nTwo of the core ideas with behaviorism is that you have to be consistent and that you start with small, manageable bits of behavior and work your way up. \u00a0You don't start with a problematic stim in the most stimulating and stressful environment, you instead start teaching them to control the stim in a more relaxed, less stress environment and work up to the harder environment. \u00a0And, if the child doesn't have the ability to understand that different locations have different rules, you have to consistently stop or redirect the stim every time that it appears. \u00a0Alternatively you establish one place were the stim is allowed and stop it everywhere else.\n\nI've really just scratched the surface of the issues involved with stimming in autism but I hope the point is clear. \u00a0Stimming is not a one dimensional \"the parents are just embarrassed\" sort of issue and any discussion that just focuses on that is not a \"great discussion\" of this complex issue.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://musingsofanaspie.com/2013/07/24/socially-inappropriate/", "http://www.thinkingautismguide.com/2011/11/on-quiet-hands.html", "https://twitter.com/DrBrocktagon/status/361469252055740416"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2013/08/stimming.html", "title": "\nStimming\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, December 22, 2013", "body": "\nJust in time for the holidays, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) has put out a new video promoting its views of autism.\u00a0 The video is pretty much in line with most of what they have said in the past but there is one very prominent theme that I wanted to talk about. So, first thing first, if you haven\u2019t seen the video, go watch it here.\u00a0  Did you notice how non-verbal autism was portrayed?\u00a0 If you missed it, here are a few lines from the video about what it means to be non-verbal -  People know what \"nonverbal\" means: I can't speak, so I use my computer to communicate. Even though I couldn't talk, my parents believed that I could understand speech.  My parent's got me a computer so I could speak with them.\u00a0 Once I learned to type, I never stopped.\u00a0 Now I have conversations with my family every day. The presumption in all of these statements is that, even though a person is non-verbal because of autism, their language ability is intact.\u00a0 That they can still understand language when someone uses it with them and will be able to demonstrate that ability if given the proper assistance. Unfortunately that presumption is badly wrong and, quite frankly, very damaging.\u00a0 When a person is non-verbal because of autism it is because autism is disrupting their ability to receptively understand and expressively use language.\u00a0 This disruption is pervasive and will likely impact their ability to use language in any form. What the video seems to be referring to is a form of verbal apraxia which is another disorder that is sometimes (but rarely) co-morbid in autism.\u00a0 In this disorder the person has problems speaking, i.e. verbally using language, because they have problems producing speech. It can be difficult to tell the difference between apraxia and non-verbal autism because there can be so much overlap and only a specialist is going to be able to make a proper differential diagnosis.\u00a0 But there are few differences that you will typically see. People with apraxia will typically have the ability to receptively understand language and the ability to expressively communicate using methods other than speech.\u00a0  People with non-verbal autism don\u2019t typically have a problem making the basic sounds of language or putting those sounds together to form words but rather are unable to use those tools to emit language. But perhaps the most important difference is that the conditions need to be treated differently.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know that much about treating apraxia but I do know that to teach a non-verbal person with autism to communicate you have to try and teach them how to use and understand language. Over time you would expect, given the proper help, that people with either condition will improve and find ways to work around their disability.\u00a0 But if you are expecting a non-verbal person with autism to be able to suddenly one day type fluently with both hands and use perfect language to express complex philosophical ideas about why Autism Speaks doesn\u2019t represent their views on autism, you are going to be disappointed. It takes a long time and a lot of hard work to learn to use language and it doesn\u2019t happen simply because someone reads to them and they see letters as colors. I know from personal experience that my two mostly non-verbal twin daughters have made significant progress over the years.\u00a0 They can now understand simple ideas when someone talks to them, they can repeat most words, they can say simple sentences, they can write words, they can read aloud, and they can even type. But what they can\u2019t do yet is use language in any form to express more than the simplest thoughts, hold even a simple conversation, or use language to learn abstract ideas.\u00a0 The disruption in their ability to use and understand language is profound and is at the core of their autism. The twins, along with their more verbal younger sister, fall into the part of the spectrum that involves severe language disruptions.\u00a0 This part of the spectrum makes up at least half of all cases of autism.\u00a0  One of the things that I have learned over these past eight years is that the one thing you can\u2019t do is sit back and expect that the person understands language or is going to regain the use of language on their own.\u00a0  You can\u2019t just \u201caccept\u201d the person is different and keep throwing incredibly complex language at them and hope they will learn.\u00a0 The available evidence suggests that doing so can hinder a child\u2019s ability to learn to use language. The good news, if there is anything good about language issues, is that there are quite a few good resources for how to approach the problem.\u00a0 For example, this book covers the basics of how to work on teaching communication and, if you want a a primer on what is known about the language disruption in autism, I would recommend this book. But keep in mind that with even the best methods and using a variety of supports and accommodations that is it going to take a while to overcome the non-verbal aspect of autism.  \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZVccsyDqvg", "http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/apraxia.aspx", "http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Language-Children-Developmental-Disabilities/dp/0981835651/", "http://www.amazon.com/Developmental-Language-Disorders-Diane-Williams/dp/1597561894/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2013/12/asan-on-non-verbal-autism.html", "title": "\nASAN on Non-Verbal Autism\n"},

\u00a0Since this post is going to be up on autism awareness day, I guess there should be a serious point rather being rather flippant about the whole thing. \u00a0OK, here is the little bit of the serious that I hinted at above, but I don't think it is going to be a popular point.\n\nThere is a lot of talk in the autism community about how autism advocacy should be entirely about the people who have autism. \u00a0After all, they are the ones who get to experience the joy of autism first hand. \u00a0But the one idea that gets lost in all of the rhetoric of \"nothing about us without us\" and other feel good slogans such as \"I shouldn't have to change\" is the cost of autism to entire extended family. \n\nFor every one person with autism there are typically going to be at least three, four, or many more other people who are going to be\u00a0profoundly\u00a0impacted by that person's autism as well. \u00a0So, as unpopular as this idea is going to be, autism advocacy shouldn't be completely about just the people who have autism. \n\nDon't misunderstand, this isn't some woe is me rant from yet another parent. \u00a0I am not saying that autism has ruined my life or any other such tale of misery. \u00a0I actually like my children and enjoy spending time with them; as I said above, they are truly great little girls and I wouldn't give them up for the world. \u00a0I may wish that they didn't struggle with autism but I certainly wouldn't trade them for other \"normal\" children.\n\nBut, at the same time, living with autism - even if you don't experience it first hand - extracts a high professional, social, personal, and health cost and these costs are not limited to the immediate family. \u00a0Everybody who is involved feels some of the impact of autism whether it be the parents who bear the brunt of the dealing with the joy of autism on a daily basis to grandparents to other family members and friends who try to help out. \n\nAnyway, that is the serious bit of awareness - the cost of autism to people other than those who have autism. \u00a0So, if you happen to know a family whose children have autism (and given how common it is now, you probably do) try to be nice to them. \u00a0They are dealing with a lot and can use any help you can provide.\n\nThanks\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2013/04/for-sale-extra-autism-awareness.html", "title": "\nFor Sale : Extra Autism Awareness\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, March 30, 2013", "body": "\nYet another paper has been released that shows that, yet once again, vaccine have nothing do with with autism. \u00a0This paper adds to the piles and piles of studies on this topic that are meant to reassure parents that vaccines have no relation whatsoever to autism. \n\nUnfortunately, this paper appears to be yet another paper that purports to dismiss a link between autism and vaccines without actually addressing the core underlying issues. \u00a0Or, to be perfectly honest, I should say that it seems to be yet another paper dismissing the link because I only skimmed it and didn't analyze it in any depth. \n\nI only read enough of the paper to realize that it didn't tackle any of the questions that I have about a potential link between vaccines and autism and repeated some rather obnoxious speculations about how an infant could \"theoretically could respond to thousands of vaccines at once\" before I lost patience and interest.\n\nIf you are interested, the full text of the paper is available here and I encourage you to read it and form your own opinion.\n\nI don't think that anybody (rational) would argue that a healthy child *should* be able to easily take a single vaccine or even a few of them at a time, although I would not go anywhere near Dr. Offit's claims a child can handle the equivalent of thousands of shots at once. \u00a0I don't think most (again rational) people would argue that vaccines aren't a good thing.\n\nJust to be perfectly clear here in case someone wants to try and misinterpret what I am saying, vaccines = good. \u00a0You should vaccinate your children although you should do so in a manner that is consistent with your child's well-being and not simply because some schedule says that it must happen on this date. \u00a0I will elaborate on that last bit in a minute.\n\nBut getting back to the core issue, one that I don't think I have ever seen tackled directly by mainstream medicine, is whether there is something different about the children who (theoretically) develop autism after vaccinations or whether it is whatever else if going on at the same time or immediately after that causes the problem.\n\nIs it the stress of vaccination or the resulting fever on the body that exacerbates some underlying issue ala Hanna Polling, is it the constant use of acetaminophen to treat resulting fevers that depletes potentially scarce supplies of glutathione leading to other biological disruptions, is it the extra stress on an already disregulated immune system, is it a combination of all of these or something else entirely, or it just figment of parents' imaginations?\n\nI know from my own experiences with my twin daughters that medical practitioners sometimes seem more concerned with giving vaccines on a rather arbitrary and predefined schedule rather than when it is in the child's best interest. \u00a0The twins, at one year old, had just both been through a rather nasty cold/flu, rotavirus, an ear infection, and several rounds of antibiotics within a few short weeks when they received the MMRV at a routine visit.\n\nBefore this time period they were developing slowly but within normal parameters for twins but afterwards they lost some skills and their development stalled for years. \u00a0I certainly don't think the vaccine \"caused\" their autism as their younger sister also went on to develop a milder form of autism but I certainly think it did add stress when they could least handle it. \u00a0It certainly wasn't a medically prudent time to be giving them a vaccine.\n\nBut here we have yet another paper suggesting that parents like me are just imagining things without actually taking the time to look at specific children to see what else might be going on that could change a routine, safe, and necessary medical procedure into something else.\n\nI am getting rather sick and tired of papers trying to absolve something of responsibility when we can't even be sure what the thing is. \u00a0I completely understand that the existing body of literature shows that there isn't a simple causative relationship between vaccines and autism. \u00a0But it is a large jump from that statement to the presumption that vaccines play no role whatsoever in autism. \n\nBefore we can completely clear vaccines of any involvement in autism, we have to first understand what autism is and what can cause it. \u00a0Only then will we be able to analyze whether there is some involvement or not.\n\nSo how about we spend more time doing basic research into the biology of autism and investigating the scores of biological abnormalities seen in people with autism and less time beating a dead horse. \u00a0The only way to convince people who have questions is to actually answer those questions, not to keep repeating the same thing over and over again.\n\nSorry, I will get off the soapbox now.\n\n", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "Saturday, March 23, 2013", "body": "\n\n\n\nAs I talked about last time, a new paper was just released that found the the prevalence of autism in school aged children was about 2%. \u00a0This figure is (yet another) sharp upwards revision from last year's surprising 1.1%. \u00a0It seems like every year or so we are treated to yet another vastly higher estimate of autism prevalence and every year we are treated to the same reasons for the increase.\n\nWell, the good news is that the increase shown in this years data is being blamed on something slightly different. \u00a0The bad news is that this year's explanation doesn't hold up on close examination. \n\nThe official line this years seems to be that the roughly 70% jump in the autism rate is mainly attributable to children with a milder form of autism being missed at a younger age and being \"discovered\" later on in life. \u00a0Which is basically a variation on the \"better diagnosing\" line that has been used to explain away part of the increases for more years than I can count.\n\nThe conventional wisdom before this paper is that most - but not all - children with autism will be diagnosed by the time they are eight years old and that children with a diagnosis at that age are more likely than not to keep the diagnosis. \u00a0There are a couple of reasons for this belief, not the least of which is by this age most children have been in school for two or three years and that problems that their autism cause will be apparent to their teachers and when they are compared to their typical peers. \u00a0It also doesn't hurt that that it has been demonstrated\u00a0empirically\u00a0by several studies over the years.\n\nThis paper is seeking to amend the conventional wisdom to allow for a large number of \"milder\" case to be diagnosed at a later age and for this group to account for a substantial portion of the autism population.\n\nSo, the question is then whether the data underlying this paper supports that idea or not. \u00a0To answer that question I pulled the underlying data from the 2011/2012 National Survey of Children's Health and did some analysis of the data.\n\nFor the following analysis I am using the children in the NSCH data set that have a current diagnosis of autism. \u00a0I will also be using the 1.1% (1 in 88) prevalence estimate that was published by the CDC last year and will also be making some brief usage of the data from the NSCH 2003 and 2007 survey years. \u00a0These different data sets aren't completely compatible but they are good enough for my purposes.\n\nFirst up, lets consider the idea that a substantial number of children in the 2012 population came a diagnosis later in life. \u00a0If the explanation offered by the paper is true and that a large part of the 0.9% increase is due to later diagnosis then that should be apparent by looking at the age when the children in the survey were diagnosed.\n\nThe good news is that the 2012 survey has this data so we can directly look at the number of children diagnosed by age. \u00a0I am going to used the following age ranges because they (should) be representative of the different times when a child might be diagnosed.\n\nAges 0 to 4 are children who are not yet in the school system and represent the group that is picked up by early screening and early intervention efforts.\nAges 5 to 8 represent the children who are just entered the school system. \u00a0Conventional wisdom tells us that most children with autism will be detected by the end of this period.\nAges 9 to 12 are children who have been in school for a while but have not yet experienced the higher social demands that comes with adolescence\nAges 13 to 17 are the children who are likely to experiencing the increased social demands of adolescence and where you would expect the children with the mildest forms of autism - forms that are primarily social in nature - to be detected.\n\nBelow is a chart that shows the percentage of the autism population that was diagnosed in each age range.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see the majority of children, about 82%, were diagnosed by the time they were eight years old, as is expected. \u00a0A simple back of the envelope calculation suggests that 1.6 of the 2% prevalence was diagnosed by age 8 which leaves 0.4% being diagnosed later in life, although that depends on what you mean by later in life. \u00a0If later in life means older than 8 that means the 18% of the population but if later in life means the teen-aged years (13 and up) then that means only 4% of the population.\n\nRegardless, the idea that the majority of the 0.9 increase in autism prevalence is being cause by older children being missing simply doesn't hold water even under a generous reading of \"older children\".\n\nBut that is across the entire data set. \u00a0Lets do a similar analysis but break down the prevalence not only by the age the child was then they were diagnosed but also by the age that they were when they were included in the survey. \u00a0The following chart does exactly that and charts the prevalence per 10,000 using the same age brackets as last time.\n\n\n\n\nNow this chart shows a couple of very interesting things.\n\nLets start with the most obvious thing - the age of diagnosis in the oldest children shows a different profile than the data set as a whole. \u00a0In this group, the number of children diagnosed before the age of 8 roughly corresponds to last year's 1.1% prevalence and the additional increase of prevalence is coming from children who were diagnosed after the age of 8. \u00a0Just as a point of reference, the children in this group are older than the children that the CDC's 1.1% estimate was based on.\n\nSo in the oldest children, the paper's idea that the increase in prevalence comes from older children being diagnosed does hold up. \u00a0The numbers work out pretty well too, you could attribute about 0.7 of the increase in prevalence to older children being diagnosed.\n\nBut if you look at the younger age groups you see the bad news. \u00a0Both of the other groups of school aged children have a higher prevalence than the oldest age group and both groups are made up almost entirely of children diagnosed by the age of 8. \u00a0Or, in other words, the paper's idea falls completely apart and the higher prevalence in the younger children is not being caused by missed diagnosis of milder children when they get older.\n\nThen there is the other little disturbing trend that is visible in the data - the number diagnosed in each age range is climbing as the children get younger. \u00a0Look at how the blue section (children diagnosed between 0 and 4) is larger in the 9-12 group than it is in the 13-17 and the 5-8 group is larger than the 9-12. \u00a0The same pattern appears in the red section.\n\nKeep in mind when you look at the chart that some of the sections include the current age are going to be incomplete. \u00a0So the green section in the 9-12 year olds is going to grow as this age group gets older as will the red section in the 5-8 year olds, as will the blue bar in the 0-4 year olds.\n\nThere seem to be two trends in this data - there are children being diagnosed later in life (who are presumably milder) AND the actual prevalence of autism is growing per birth year.\n\nTo illustrate this, lets look at the data from the 2003, 2007, and 2012 NSCH survey years. \u00a0The earlier years don't have the age of diagnosis available and the 2003 survey didn't ask the exact same questions but it is close enough.\n\nThe following is the approximate prevalence per age from all three surveys, the data from the earlier surveys has been shifted to the age that the child would have been in 2012 and I removed the 0-4 age group because, as you can see above, the detection rates are quite low in this group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same two trends are visible here as well - the prevalence for the specific age grows each survey year but the prevalence in children born later is higher still.\n\nI think this data makes the overall trend quite clear - the rate of autism is growing by each birth year.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.public-domain-photos.com/free-cliparts-3/shapes/arrows/arrow-up-red_benji_park_01.png", "http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr065.pdf", "http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/slaits/nsch.htm", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kg6dc2qGA0I/UU22Qx1PCEI/AAAAAAAAAZ8/VyNxoYpr19I/s1600/rising_chart1.png", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/-KsJSK4Tel2M/UU22Q7kfImI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/VfldzaiQU0E/s1600/rising_chart2.png", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/-fddRT3nLlCg/UU22Q3Mf0aI/AAAAAAAAAZ4/eGsPbOgDPrg/s1600/rising_chart3.png"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2013/03/autism-rising-by-numbers.html", "title": "\nAutism Rising : By the Numbers\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 21, 2012", "body": "\nOver at Left Brian Right Brian, Sullivan (aka Matt Carey) is attempting to make an argument that there can be a genetic epidemic. \u00a0He says -\n\nIt\u2019s a phrase that is heard a great deal in online discussions about autism: there are no genetic epidemics. Genes don\u2019t change quickly enough for a genetic condition to see an increased prevalence over a single generation, right? Well, yes and no.\nBefore going on to suggest Down Syndrome might be a model for how a genetic epidemic might work. \u00a0But while it is true that Down Syndrome is caused by an underlying genetic mutation and that the number of people with Downs is increasing, it does not classify as a \"genetic epidemic\".\n\nThe main reason is that for the most part1 Down Syndrome is not an inherited condition. \u00a0A child does not have Downs because their parents passed along any sort of mutation. \u00a0Downs is caused by a mistake in cell division during the development of the egg, sperm, or embryo. \u00a0So while there is a genetic mutation responsible for the condition, the mutation is caused by some non-genetic factor.\n\nDown syndrome (again, for the most part) doesn't run in families. \u00a0Having one child with Downs only slightly increases your chance of having a second child with Downs.\n\nAnd a person with Downs in unlikely to pass the condition along to another generation because most people with Downs have problems with fertility. \u00a0Men with Downs are thought to be sterile and women are only fertile about a third of the time. \u00a0Although, if a person with Downs has a child, there is a significant chance that their child will inherit their condition.\n\nSo while Downs might be caused by genetic mutations (aka is \"genetic\"), it is not a \"genetic epidemic\" because the increasing number of people with Downs is not due to the mutations becoming more common in the gene pool. \u00a0What is causing the increasing number of people with Downs is due to a few social changes.\n\nFirst, there is an ongoing trend for women to have children later in life and maternal age is a demonstrated risk factor for Downs (although, as a side note, I have never read a good explanation as to why exactly that is the case). \u00a0The risk of having a child with Downs increases with age, going from 1 in 1,600 when a mother is twenty to 1 in 1,000 at thirty and 1 in 90 by forty. \n\nSecond, people with Downs are surviving longer. \u00a0Down syndrome comes with a variety of related health problems and these problems can shorten a persons life. \u00a0About eighty years ago, people with Downs often didn't survive past their tenth birthday. \u00a0Over time that age has gradually increased so that today people with Downs can expect to live to 50 and beyond.\n\nFinally, people today seem to be more willing to have a child with Downs. \u00a0Abortions of children with Downs is a contentious subject, but as life expectancy and quality of life for a person with Downs has been improving, there seem to be fewer abortions.\n\nThese three factors can explain the modest increase in the number of people with Downs that has been seen over the past several decades. \n\nSo, back to Sullivan's original argument, there is no \"genetic epidemic\" of Down Syndrome. \u00a0There isn't really even an \"epidemic\" of Down Syndrome - the growth has been modest and is what would be expected given the social trends listed above.\n\nMore importantly, there aren't that many similarities between Downs and autism -\n\nIn autism, there is no single mutation that can account for more than a small fraction of cases and yet having one child with autism does significantly increase the risks of having another child with autism. \u00a0Down Syndrome centers on a mutation on one chromosome while autism has been tentatively linked to many places across our genes. \u00a0So, from the little we know about the genetics of autism, the underlying genetics of autism and Down Syndrome are quite different.\n\nAutism does not automatically come with medical conditions that shorten life expectancy. \u00a0And there is no prenatal test for autism2 and so there are no widespread abortion trend that is reversing.\n\nAutism is growing much, much faster than Down Syndrome. \u00a0Over a twenty four year period (1979 to 2003), the number of people born with Down Syndrome grew by 31.1%. \u00a0Over the same time period, the number of case of autism grew from about 2-4 per 10,000 to 66 per 10,000 or about 1500%3. \u00a0If you take a more conservative time period (2000 to 2008), autism has grown about 160%. \u00a0Anyway you slice it, autism is growing significantly faster than Downs.\n\nThe only real link between Downs and autism is parental age, and that is a nebulous one at best. \u00a0Some studies of autism involving parental age show a small relationship with maternal age but not paternal age, some show a relationship with paternal age and not maternal, some show a relationship with both, and some show no relationship to either. \n\nAt the present time, the best that we can say is that there might be some relationship between maternal or paternal age and risk of autism. \u00a0Compare that to Down Syndrome where there is a clear link between maternal age and the risk of having a child with Downs. \n\nSo, not only is Sullivan wrong to suggest that there is a \"genetic epidemic\" of Downs Syndrome, he is wrong to suggest that there is any epidemic of Downs at all or that this tells us anything about what is going on with autism. \n\n1. There are actually three different known types or styles of genetic mutations that can cause Down Syndrome. The most common one, trisomy 21, accounts for more than 90 percent of cases and is almost never inherited. \u00a0Another form, which is almost not normally inherited, involves a mutation of chromosome 21 where only some of the cells have the mutation and others don't. \u00a0The final form, called\u00a0translocation Down Syndrome, can be passed from carrier parents to children. \u00a0However, only about 4% of Downs cases are these type and only about half of these cases involve inheritance.\u00a0\u00a0Source\n\n2. Well, technically, there are prenatal tests for some known genetic forms of autism, such as Rett Syndrome and Fragile X.\n\n3. A large part of the growth in autism from the 1980 to 2000 is probably due to the condition being added t the DSM III and then its changes in the DSM IV.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2012/11/20/there-cant-be-a-genetic-epidemic/", "http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0815/p837.html", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/124/6/1565.long", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/down-syndrome/DS00182/DSECTION=causes"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/11/a-genetic-epidemic-of-down-syndrome.html", "title": "\nA Genetic Epidemic of Down Syndrome?\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 2, 2013", "body": "\nI took down my prior entry about the post at Wrong Planet because it appears that the offending post was removed from the site and I don't want that person's words to live on at my site. \u00a0But the post, and the way it was mishandled by Wrong Planet, reminded me of the much more worse incident in Newtown and how the autism community responded to that.\n\nI didn't write anything about the tragic incident in Newtown because there wasn't (and still isn't) much known about why Adam Lanza did what he did or whether his mental problems involved autism or not. \u00a0I also didn't write about it because the incident hit a little too close to home. \u00a0All three of my children are in a single elementary school and their autism would make all three sitting ducks if someone like Lanza showed up at their school.\n\nSo I did what any sane parent would do, I stuck my head in the ground and tried to ignore that the incident happened. \u00a0I saw the initial tentative link to autism, I saw the response from the ignorant public, and I was (for once) extremely glad that my children are disabled enough by their autism that the incident would pass by unnoticed for them. \n\nBut what I saw of the autism community's response to the incident before I started ignoring it bothered me almost as much as the initial incident. \u00a0Here you have a community who fights to get their disabled members accepted by society, who fights to break down the stigma associated with autism, and who tries to increase the general awareness of autism is and isn't and the almost universal response from this community was to throw people with other mental disorders under the bus.\n\nThe community could have taken this tragedy as an opportunity to talk about the desperate need for more services and supports for all adults with a disability. \u00a0The community could have talked about how there is a growing problem of young disabled adults who are utterly dependent on their parents for support and what impact the lack of supports has for these families. \u00a0But instead of doing that, the autism community instead tried to distance itself as much as possible from the incident and draw a clear distinction between people with autism and people with other mental conditions.\n\nThere were statements about how there is no scientific or systematic link between planned violence and autism which completely ignores the inconvenient fact that there isn't really a large association between most mental disorders and planned violence. \u00a0Yes, people who do these horrific things tend to have mental problems (or at least we like to pretend that is the case afterwards) but most (i.e. 99.9%) of people with mental problems don't commit acts like this. \n\nBut instead of working to get rid of the stigma associated with mental disorders in general, the autism community instead tried to separate autism from those other conditions.\n\nThese statements also ignore the inconvenient fact that the first wave of the autism tsunami is just now reaching adulthood and we really don't know what they are going to be like. \u00a0Regardless of why the number of people with autism has grown exponentially over the past twenty years, the fact remains that there are substantially more people with autism today than in the past. \u00a0So the people in the past who were diagnosed with autism may be quite different than those who are today and the research into what they are like might not be quite accurate.\n\nThen there was a lot of pontificating about how autism is a developmental disorder and isn't a mental illness and while technically true, the point is rather moot. \u00a0I don't think it really matters whether a person never developed a certain mental facility or whether they had it and lost it to a disorder later in life, the important point is that the person doesn't have facility or ability you would expect them to. \u00a0So the goal here again was to separate people with autism from people with other mental conditions.\n\nBut perhaps the most disturbing statements were from adults who claimed to have autism themselves. \u00a0Maybe I am a victim of selective reading but I ran across numerous comments from high functioning adults with autism on all the major media outlets and many of them showed a complete lack of respect for people with mental disorders. \n\nAs one kind comment from an aspie on CNN said (I am paraphrasing here), autism is just a difference not some mental illness. \u00a0Those people with mental problems are sick and need drugs to help keep them from hurting other people.\n\nThe hypocrisy of advocating for acceptance for your own differences and problem while at the same time condemning other people for theirs blows my mind.\n\nOr, in short, I was extremely disappointed that the autism community's almost universal response was to try and draw a line between autism and those other conditions. \u00a0The autism community talks a lot about acceptance of differences but, when it was presented a chance to live up to its principals, the community came up short. \u00a0Instead of standing up for people with all sorts of differences and working to build acceptance in general, the response instead was a divisive \"its not us, its them; we're not like them\".\n\nRegardless, the overall point being made by the community is a valid one. \u00a0While there might be an association between autism and spontaneous, unintentional aggression, whether it be towards others or the person themselves, there is no known relationship between autism and sitting down and planning to commit a violent act.\n\nBut then there was the threat of planned violence posted on Wrong Planet and it made me wonder. \u00a0Maybe there isn't a direct link between autism and planned violence but I have to wonder whether there might be a link between social isolation and the willingness to commit horrific acts. \n\nIf that is true then that suggests that society as a whole needs to do a far better job at helping people with all sorts of disabilities feel connected and suggests that ideologies that do nothing but divide people rather than bring them together are far more harmful than I thought.\n\nIt will be, uhm, interesting (for lack of a better word) when and if we ever get a clearer picture of exactly what happened in Newtown and why Adam Lanza decided to do what he did. \u00a0I suspect that we have not heard the last of autism's involvement in the incident and, if little bits and pieces of what I have read are true, well, lets just say that won't be pretty. \n\nAt the very least, this incident should force this country to have a serious discussion on how people with mental health issues are treated and, just as importantly, on better gun control. \u00a0There is absolutely no reason why someone like Lanza should have had access to the arsenal that he took with him and, without a doubt, the death toll would have been much lower if he weren't so heavily armed.\n\nWell, this has been a little too much reality for me, I think I need to go stick my head in the ground again and pretend that none of this ever happened. \u00a0I just hope that if autism gets dragged back into the mess that the community responds better than it did the first time.

Everybody has strengths and weaknesses. \u00a0Everybody has things that they are good at and other things that they struggle with - this is \"normal\" and expected. \u00a0So just because you have problems or struggle in some areas does not mean that you have a mental disorder. \u00a0Mental disorders are defined by their extreme behaviors - behaviors that are so far out of the realm of what is typically seen that they cause problems. \n\nAutism is (currently) defined by profound impairments in three areas - communication, socialization, and repetitive/restricted interests and activities - that must appear in early childhood and that must act together to impair every day life. \n\nFor example, the ability to focus on a subject and become extremely knowledgeable is well within what is considered \"normal\". \u00a0You don't have autism (or a \"trait\" of autism) simply because you find a subject very interesting and can spend a lot of time learning about it. \u00a0It is only when the ability to focus turns into a\u00a0constant fixation or\u00a0obsession that you go from what is \"normal\" to something that isn't.\n\nSo, to be perfectly blunt, just because you are don't relate well to others and have some strong interests does not mean you have autism. \u00a0Along the same lines, just because a person is a \"geek\" or in some other technical profession doesn't mean that they are automatically on the spectrum somewhere. \n\nIt means that you have areas that you need to work on and improve in, just like everybody else.\n\n2. It is hard enough for a \"typical\" person to objectively and accurately analyze and understand their own behaviors. \u00a0If you do actually have a mental disorder then that means that your ability to understand and objectively analyze your own behaviors will likely be impaired. \u00a0This is true not just in autism but most of the other major mental disorders such as ADD, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction, to name just a few.\n\nTo put that another way, if you are relying on your own opinions and observations about your behaviors and you do actually have a disorder then you will most likely be getting it wrong.\n\n3. There are very few \"objective\" measures of autism and all of the reliable ones require a trained professional. \u00a0But there are some rather crappy ones that are promoted online by various that will likely give you the wrong idea.\n\nProbably\u00a0the most well know and most abused of these is the\u00a0Autism Quotient. \u00a0The AQ is a meant to be used as a screening test in an appropriate setting with appropriate supports in place. \u00a0It is not meant as a test to see if you have autism. \u00a0Even if you get an extremely high score that will only raise your chances of having autism to like 1 in 10. \u00a0And the AQ cannot tell the difference between autism and other conditions such as\u00a0schizophrenia.\n\nI cannot count the number of times I have run across people who have decided that they have autism based on their own observations of their behaviors and their score on the AQ. \u00a0Some of these people might well have a form of autism but the numbers suggest that most would not.\n\n4. Even if you do have some profound problems in the three core areas of autism, that does not mean that you have autism. \u00a0There are several other conditions, such as ADD,\u00a0\u00a0schizophrenia\u00a0and\u00a0OCD, that overlap with autism and it can be difficult to tell them apart. \u00a0You have to consider the complete picture of all of the behaviors that a person has, when those behaviors appeared, as well as what behaviors are missing to be able to tell them apart.\n\nThis is why an objective, unbiased professional is critical to the process. \u00a0They should know not only what the different conditions look like and what the signs of each are but also how to tell them apart. \u00a0They will know the little things like an AQ isn't a diagnosis and that a high score could mean schizophrenia or autism.\n\nAccurately determining what (if any) condition you have is absolutely critical for the next point.\n\n5. You have to make sure that any treatments are appropriate for your condition. \u00a0If you taken it upon yourself to decide that you have a condition then you may\u00a0use treatments that are completely inappropriate for your actual condition. \u00a0More importantly, if you have decided on the wrong condition, you could miss out on treatments that could really make a difference in your life.\n\nIf you have decided that you have a form of autism but also decided that you don't need any form of treatment, then I would ask why you think you have a disorder in the first place. \u00a0The point of a medical label is to identify a condition so that you know what you are dealing with and how to treat it. \u00a0A medical label is not an identity.\n\n(And no, \"the rest of the world needs to just accept who I am\" is not a treatment. \u00a0Not that acceptance itself is bad or unneeded, but it will rarely be enough to give you back the ability to function in the world. \u00a0More on this in a bit.)\n\n6. You have to ask yourself what a self-diagnosis of autism will actually do for you. \u00a0While at first glance it might seem like the label can help you make sense of your life, it really can't. \u00a0The autism label might provide a\u00a0plausible sounding rationale for your behaviors but the label alone doesn't necessarily help you deal with or improve those behaviors. \u00a0For that you need an objective person who will be able to consider all aspects of the behaviors and help you arrive at an appropriate strategy.\n\nAnd if you are just looking to use the label of autism as an ongoing justification for your actions and are refusing to change yourself in any way (i.e. you are in the \"autism is just a difference camp\"), then I have two little words for you - grow up. \u00a0You are supposed to change and adapt your behaviors in response to your environment, even when you would rather not and it is uncomfortable to do so. \u00a0Autism is not an excuse for behaving badly.\n\nJust to be perfectly clear here, if you are disabled by a mental disorder then you are entitled to the same rights that everybody else is. \u00a0You are not less of a person simply because you have a disability. \u00a0You have the right to expect that others will still treat you as an equal and you have the right to expect that \u00a0accommodations\u00a0will be made to help you function better. \n\nBut\u00a0if you have the ability to change and improve yourself but choose not to because you think that you are defined by a medical label then you really do have a problem. \u00a0And the problem isn't that you have autism.\n\nWhich leads to the last and very unfortunate problem.\n\n7.\u00a0There are certainly many people in the world who do have autism, who struggle because of it, and who are able to speak about it\u00a0publicly. \u00a0These people provide an\u00a0invaluable service because they enable the rest of us to better understand what it is like to have autism. \u00a0I applaud their courage to speak out about their condition and am extremely grateful for the insight they provide.\n\nBut then there are a number of people who have self-diagnosed with autism and\u00a0then rush to tell the word \"what it is like\" to have autism. \u00a0These people often spread inaccurate information about what autism is and what effects it can have on a person. \u00a0These people cause direct and lasting harm to people who actually do struggle with autism by giving a false impression of what autism is and by drawing attention away from people who are actually disabled by their autism and truly do need the help.\n\nThese people often encourage other people to self-diagnosis or \"look into it\" for themselves. \u00a0They are often the people who use autism as a justification for their actions and claim that it is the rest of the world who have a problem and not them. \u00a0These people certainly do have issues but, in my opinion, that problem is rarely autism.\n\nSo, for these reasons and quite a few others, if you think you have a serious mental disorder such as autism, please don't try and diagnose yourself. \u00a0Instead go get the help you need. \u00a0There is no shame is trying to get help when you need it and you have everything to lose and very little to gain from diagnosing yourself.\n\nP.S. The practice of diagnosis shopping, i.e. going to multiple professionals until you find one that agrees with your self-diagnosis, is almost as bad as diagnosing yourself in the first place. \u00a0There is certainly a time when a second (or third or fourth) opinion is certainly a good idea but there is a clear difference between trying to find a professional who can help and going to multiple professional until you find one that agrees with you.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23084795"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/10/whats-wrong-with-diagnosing-yourself.html", "title": "\nWhat's Wrong With Diagnosing Yourself with Autism?\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 23, 2012", "body": "\nFrom the I-can-see-for-miles-and-miles department comes a wonderful new study on visual processing capacity in autism. \u00a0This study claims to show that people with autism don't have sensory issues, they have processing gifts. \u00a0According to Science Daily -\n\n... people with autism show an increased ability to focus attention on certain tasks. Yet clinical reports backed up by some laboratory research show that these individuals can be more sensitive to the distracting effects of irrelevant stimuli, such as flashing lights or particular sounds, which can be easily ignored by people without the disorder.\n\nProfessor Nilli Lavie, from the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL, hypothesises that this combination of the ability to focus and a susceptibility to distraction might be caused by a higher than normal information processing capacity.\n\n\"Our work on perceptual capacity in the typical adult brain suggests a clear explanation for the unique cognitive profile that people with autism show,\" she says. \"People who have higher perceptual capacity are able to process more information from a scene, but this may also include some irrelevant information which they may find harder to ignore. Our research suggests autism does not involve a distractibility deficit but rather an information processing advantage.\"\nOr in short, people with autism only appear to have sensory issues but in reality their problems are caused because they are too good at processing information....\n\nNever mind the enormous amount of existing research that shows hyper- and hypo- sensory responses across all of the senses in people with autism. \u00a0Never mind first hand descriptions of sensory issues in people with autism. \u00a0Never mind all the parental accounts of the sensory issues that their children have.\n\nNever mind that sensory issues are being included as one of the features of autism in the upcoming revision to the \"official\" definition of autism -\n\nHyper-or hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of environment; (such as apparent indifference to pain/heat/cold, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with lights or spinning objects).\nNever mind that the reason that a human brain can process information and reach conclusions based on that information faster than any computer out there is precisely because the brain is extremely good at filtering out the unimportant details and focusing only on what is important.\n\nLets throw out all of that and pretend that, based on 16 adult volunteers with autism, the whole sensory thing is a red herring and that having autism really gives you a processing advantage.\n\nUhm, yeah, remember when the theory was that people with autism had eagle-eyed vision and that later turned out to be\u00a0completely wrong? \u00a0I would be willing to bet that this is going to be exactly the same thing again.\n\nThere was one paragraph in the Science Daily that was truly hilarious and, I think, demonstrates just how far some people will go to make their theories true -\n\nProfessor Lavie believes that the finding may help explain why people with autism spectrum disorders, such as Asperger's syndrome, may excel in some careers such as IT, which can require intense concentration and the ability to process a great deal of information from a computer screen. \nWhile I guess the ability to \"process a great deal of information from a computer screen\" sounds like it could be related to being good in IT, the reality is that that only helps with the version of IT portrayed in movies. \n\nIn the real world, the visual component of a typical IT person's job is rather small. \u00a0There are some rather boring images and then text, lots and lots of text. \u00a0The trick to being a good IT worker is to be able to understand the abstract concepts and nuances represented by the images and text and to be able to act based on the concepts. \u00a0You have to be able to filter out the noise and focus only on the part you need to.\n\nOr look at it another way, when you look at one window on a computer screen, you have to be able to ignore what is going on in the other windows and focus on the task at hand. \u00a0But if this new little bit of research is correct, that is precisely what people with autism would not be be able to do. \u00a0So instead of autism being an advantage in this\u00a0scenario, it would actually be a\u00a0hindrance.\n\nAlthough, to be honest, I don't find results like this as funny as I used to. \u00a0Back when I was just getting used to the world of autism, I would run across a result like this and have a little chuckle over it. \u00a0But now I just know that a few months from now I am going to be running into aspies who firmly believe that they have super human processing abilities based on this research. \u00a0And that is perhaps the saddest part of all of this.\n\nPeople with autism are people like everybody else, and like every other person out there they are going to have their own gifts, strengths, and weaknesses. \u00a0But there is a large difference between recognizing that and all of the theories that try and attribute all sorts of special abilities to people with autism. \u00a0The former is acknowledging the reality that people with autism are just like everybody else while the later causes quite a bit of harm.\n\nReferences\n\nAnna M.

{"date": "Sunday, March 25, 2012", "body": "\nIf you have one child with autism, what is the chance that you will have a second child with autism? \u00a0It turns out the answer to that question (like everything to do with autism) is it depends.\n\nIt depends on whether the children are identical or fraternal twins. \u00a0It depends on how many of your older children have autism. \u00a0It might depend on whether the older children with autism are boys or girls. \u00a0It might depend on far apart they are in years. \n\nNow, it might depend on whether they are full or half siblings.\n\nAccording to a new paper, the risk of developing autism if you have a half sibling with autism is roughly half that of a full sibling. \u00a0The paper is sparse and light on details because it is a letter to the editor instead of a full-fledged paper, but the results are still interesting nonetheless.\n\nIn this paper, researchers looked at two different groups of children - one from the Interactive Autism Network (IAN) and another from the U.S. Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE). \u00a0The IAN data is based on parental reports but has been shown to be reliable and has been used in quite a few recent papers. \u00a0The ACE data set is (presumably) based on children evaluated at one of the the Autism Centers from around the US and was designed to include more minorities that you would get in a typical group of children with autism (oversampled for minorities).\n\nBoth sets were filtered to include only families that had at least one child with autism and at least one additional sibling. \u00a0The siblings were separated out into full, half-maternal, and half-paternal and at most one sibling of was randomly selected from each family to be included in the paper. \u00a0Although it isn't clear from the paper's text whether a full sibling and half sibling could both be included or whether\u00a0precedence\u00a0was given to half siblings.\n\nThe breakdown of the number and type of each sibling pair types is in the table below. \n\n\n\nAs you can (hopefully) see, the risk for half siblings is less than full siblings.\n\nBut there is another interesting bit that this data shows - the risk is very different depending on whether you have a mother or father in common. \u00a0Having a mother in common means that you have roughly half the risk of a typical sibling while having a father in common gives you roughly the same risk as the general population.\n\nNow, this difference in risk might not be as large as the data suggests because there aren't that many paternal half-siblings in either the IAN or ACE data set compared to maternal half-siblings. \u00a0But the maternal half-siblings in the ACE data set, which is much smaller than the IAN data and comparable to the number of paternal half-siblings in both data sets, still shows the elevated risk for the mother. \u00a0 If the paternal risk were equivalent to or higher than the maternal risk, one or both data sets should have shown an increased risk.\n\nSo I think it is safe to assume from this data that the half sibling risk is different depending on whether you have a mother or father in common and that the risk is less than it would be for a full sibling.\n\nThe authors of this paper are saying that the reduced but elevated maternal risk shows that autism is strongly genetic. \u00a0But I see a different picture in this data. \u00a0To me, this data seems to show that not only the mother and father's genetics contribute to the risk but also that there are other major risk factors that combine to create the greater risk inside of a given family. \n\nIf there were few other risk factor and it was the genetics of the parents was the major risk factor (i.e. strongly genetic) then you would expect the risk to be elevated and roughly equal for both parents. \u00a0And failing that, you would expect the risk for the higher parent to be much closer to the combined risk. \u00a0Yet that is not the case here as both the mother and father have a substantially\u00a0reduced risk but, taking their risks together, you don't get back to the full sibling risk.\n\nSo what could explain these results? \u00a0Well, I'm not really sure but I can think of three possible explanations.\n\nFirst, if you look at the ages of the full and half siblings you would see that the full siblings are closer together in age and younger. \u00a0A shorter interval between pregnancies has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of autism and autism is more common in younger children than older ones.\n\nSecond, the presence of half-siblings suggests a major shift in the family dynamics such as a divorce, marriage, death of spouse, or other event that leads to the parents no longer being together.\n\nSince the original parents are no longer together, it is very likely that at least one of the parents has moved to a different geographic area. \u00a0In my experience, the children are much more likely to stay with the mother and the mother is less likely to move to a new area. \u00a0So perhaps staying in the same area for later children means she is exposed the same geographic risk factors that gave her an increased risk in the first place.\n\nOther possible changes are a reduced level of parental stress (constant stress, as is seen in failing marriages, can lead to all sorts of health problems), a change in social-economic\u00a0status (higher social-economic status has been linked to higher rates of autism), parental diet, or any one of a number of lifestyle changes.\n\nThird, this difference in risk could just be an artifact of the data and might not be real at all. \u00a0After all, the full sibling rate found in this paper is much less than the most recent (and best) estimate to date (10% vs 18% or higher for families with multiple children with autism). \u00a0The current data also doesn't adjust for birth order, an increasing risk of autism with birth years,\u00a0premature birth, parental age, or any one of the other factors that have been linked to an increased risk of autism.\n\nRegardless, assuming the data has some validity, I think that it suggests that something other than parental genetics increases the risk of autism inside of a family.\n\nReferences\n\nConstantino, J N et al. 2012. \u201cAutism recurrence in half siblings: strong support for genetic mechanisms of transmission in ASD.\u201d Molecular psychiatry.\n\nHallmayer, Joachim et al. 2011. \u201cGenetic Heritability and Shared Environmental Factors Among Twin Pairs With Autism.\u201d Archives of general psychiatry 1-8.\n\nOzonoff, Sally et al. 2011. \u201cRecurrence risk for autism spectrum disorders: a baby siblings research consortium study.\u201d Pediatrics 128(3):e488-95.\n\nCheslack-Postava, Keely, Kayuet Liu, and Peter S Bearman. 2011. \u201cClosely spaced pregnancies are associated with increased odds of autism in California sibling births.\u201d Pediatrics 127(2):246-53.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/03/autism-risk-in-half-siblings.html", "title": "\nAutism Risk In Half Siblings\n"},

Offspring behavior was measured with the Child Behavior Checklist at 2, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 17 years of age (n range = 412\u2013652). Receptive language was assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test\u2014Revised at ages 5 (n = 534) and 10 (n = 474) years. Raw scores were converted to standardized scores, incorporating cutoffs for clinically significant levels of difficulty.\n\nRESULTS: X2 analyses revealed no significant associations between maternal 25(OH)-vitamin D serum quartiles and offspring behavioral/emotional problems at any age. In contrast, there were significant linear trends between quartiles of maternal vitamin D levels and language impairment at 5 and 10 years of age. Multivariate regression analyses, incorporating a range of confounding variables, found that the risk of women with vitamin D insufficiency (=46 nmol/L) during pregnancy having a child with clinically significant language difficulties was increased close to twofold compared with women with vitamin D levels > 70 nmol/L.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Maternal vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy is significantly associated with offspring language impairment.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 13, 2011", "body": "\nThe Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) recently held a symposium on \"Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications\" of autism research where they brought together \"self-advocates and researchers\" to discuss research into autism. \n\nI really couldn't care less about what ASAN has to say about \"ethical\" implications of autism research (no genetics/autism research) or what they think about \"appropriate and inappropriate intervention goals\" (no ABA) because most of their positions on those issues are completely\u00a0nonsensical. \n\nYou have only to look at their recent arguments on wandering in autism or Ari Ne'eman basically accusing a\u00a0presenter at the IACC of supporting eugenics or ASAN's opposition to passing the Combating Autism Act and their continued opposition to renewing it to get a feel for what sort of nonsense they endorse.\n\nBut what I did find very interesting was the\u00a0announcement that they put out afterwards -\n\nThe Autistic Self Advocacy Network's Symposium on Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of Autism Research, funded by the Administration on Developmental Disabilities, was a huge success. The symposium video will be made available in the coming weeks with captioning. We'd like to thank our co-sponsors, the Harvard Law Project on Disability, the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics and the UNESCO Bioethics Chair, American Unit for helping to make this event possible.\n\nOur conversation was broad and wide ranging. Perhaps the most interesting characteristic of the Symposium was the people that came to the table. Our participants - split evenly between self-advocates and researchers - identified a wide number of ways to help advance the inclusion of Autistic people ourselves in the research process. From Community Based Participatory Research processes to greater inclusion of Autistic adults on IRBs and Grant Review panels, a number of actionable next steps emerged from our discussion. ASAN will be following up on this through a series of targeted policy briefs and collaboration with our federal partners to make those ideas reality.\n\nOne of the key issues to emerge out of our conversation in Cambridge was the inclusion of Autistic people and other people with disabilities as grant reviewers on federally funded grants. In response to our symposium, several key federal funders have offered to work with ASAN to identify Autistic adults and other people with disabilities interested in serving on forthcoming federal grant review panels.\n\nAs a result, we're issuing a call for resumes from Autistic adults and other people with disabilities who believe in the civil rights/social model approach to disability and want to ensure that self-advocates are represented in grantmaking.

The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased \u00a0risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.\nSince this statement made it into a press release vetted by a law firm you can assume that the truth of the matter is much, much worse.\n\nThe thing that bothers me is that if this study covered any other topic besides autism/vaccines the above admission would trigger the retraction of the study in question and intense scrutiny of every other study that this gentleman was involved in. \u00a0Science is based on trust and here you have someone admitting that they lied.\n\nHowever that wasn't the CDC's response to the issue - the CDC put out a response that basically said that they are standing by the study. \u00a0What makes this worse is that this isn't the first time the CDC has stood by questionable research about vaccines and autism.\n\nAnyone remember the controversy surrounding Poul Thorsen? \u00a0He was involved in quite a few autism studies for the CDC and he stands accused of embezzling almost 1 million dollars from the CDC in connection with those studies. \u00a0He is currently under indictment and awaiting extradition to the US on 22 counts of wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nYou would think that if a lead researcher embezzles money in connection with a study that you might want to question the study's results. \u00a0But no, the CDC didn't pull any of the studies that Thorsen was connected to either.\n\nForget the whole vaccine/autism issue - that isn't the real story here. \u00a0The real story here is how the CDC is handling problems with its research. \u00a0 By sticking its head in the sand and refusing to confront misconduct by its researchers head on it is weakening its own reputation.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/", "http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Autism/cdc2004pediatrics.html", "https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2014/09/research-shenanigans-at-cdc.html", "title": "\nResearch Shenanigans At The CDC\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, February 9, 2012", "body": "\nTwo new studies on the connection between the mother's immune system and autism popped up on Pubmed this morning. \u00a0Both studies use mice to demonstrate that a mother's immune being stimulated during pregnancy is capable of producing lasting the changes in her offspring.\n\nThe first study goes straight to the heart of the matter and demonstrates that mice born to a mother whose immune system was stimulated during pregnancy have problems in the three core areas of autism. \u00a0Or at least the mouse equivalent of the three core ares.\n\nMaternal immune activation yields offspring displaying mouse versions of the\u00a0three core symptoms of autism.\n\n\u00a0The core symptoms of autism are deficits in social interaction and language, and \u00a0the presence of repetitive/stereotyped behaviors. We demonstrate that behaviors related to these symptoms are present in a mouse model of an environmental risk factor for autism, maternal infection. We stimulate the maternal immune system by injecting the viral mimic poly(I:C) during pregnancy, and analyze the social and \u00a0communicative behaviors of the offspring. In one test, young pups respond to a brief separation from the mother with ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). We find that, compared to pups born to saline-injected mothers, pups born to maternal immune activation (MIA) mothers produce a lower rate of USVs in the isolation test starting at day 8. The quality of the vocalizations is also different; analysis of sound spectrograms of 10day-old pups shows that male pups from MIA mothers emit significantly fewer harmonic and more complex and short syllables. These communication differences are also apparent in adult offspring. Compared to controls, adult MIA males emit significantly fewer USVs in response to social encounters with females or males, and display reduced scent marking in response to female urine. Regarding a second autism symptom, MIA males display decreased sociability. In a third test of characteristic autism behaviors, MIA offspring exhibit increased repetitive/stereotyped behavior in both marble burying and self-grooming tests. In sum, these results indicate that MIA yields male offspring with deficient social and communicative behavior, as well as high levels of repetitive behaviors, all of which are hallmarks of autism.\nThe second study, which is far more interesting to me, looks at what exactly the mother's immune does to her offspring. \u00a0The short answer here appears to be that it changes how genes are expressed in her offspring. \u00a0It effectively turns down the volume on many of the genes that are needed for proper neural development.\n\nMaternal immune activation by LPS selectively alters specific gene expression profiles of interneuron migration and oxidative stress in the fetus without triggering a fetal immune response.\u00a0\n\nMaternal immune activation (MIA) is a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia and autism. Infections during pregnancy activate the mother's immune system and alter the fetal environment, with consequential effects on CNS \u00a0function and behavior in the offspring, but the cellular and molecular links between infection-induced altered fetal development and risk for neuropsychiatric disorders are unknown. We investigated the immunological, molecular, and behavioral effects of MIA in the offspring of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats given \u00a0an intraperitoneal (0.25mg/kg) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gestational day 15. LPS significantly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, and fetal brain at 4h, and levels decreased but remained elevated at 24h. Offspring born to LPS-treated dams exhibited reduced social preference and exploration behaviors as juveniles and young adults. Whole genome microarray analysis of the fetal brain at 4h post maternal LPS was performed to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms by which MIA affects the fetal brain. We observed dysregulation of 3285 genes in restricted functional categories, with increased mRNA expression of cellular stress and cell death genes and reduced expression of developmentally-regulated and brain-specific genes, specifically those that regulate neuronal migration of GABAergic interneurons, including the Distal-less (Dlx) family of transcription factors required for tangential migration from progenitor pools within the ganglionic eminences into the cerebral cortex. Our results provide a novel mechanism by which MIA induces the widespread down-regulation of critical neurodevelopmental genes, including those previously associated with autism.\nThe bottom line from both studies is that the mother's immune system, if suffficiently stimulated during pregnancy, is more than capable of producing some of the behavioral and biological symptoms of autism. \u00a0These results add to the existing literature that has found a relationship between maternal infections and mental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.\n\nSo the next questions that needs to be addressed - the crucial ones - are whether the biological changes demonstrated in mice also happen in people and what is the catalyst that changes a routine event - maternal immune system activiation - into something else entirely.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Twenty-four publications met inclusion criteria for synthetic food colors; 10 additional studies informed analysis of dietary restriction. A random-effects meta-analytic model generated summary effect sizes.\n\nResults\nRestriction diets reduced ADHD symptoms at an effect of g = 0.29 (95% CI, 0.07\u20130.53). For food colors, parent reports yielded an effect size of g = 0.18 (95% CI, 0.08\u20130.24; p = .0007), which decreased to 0.12 (95% CI, 0.01\u20130.23; p < .05) after adjustment for possible publication bias. The effect was reliable in studies restricted to food color additives (g = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.06\u20130.36) but did not survive correction for possible publication bias and was not reliable in studies confined to Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved food colors. Teacher/observer reports yielded a nonsignificant effect of 0.07 (95% CI = \u22120.03 to 0.18; p = .14). However, high-quality studies confined to color additives yielded a reliable effect (g = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.10\u20130.41, p = .030) that survived correction. In psychometric tests of attention, the summary effect size was 0.27 (95% CI = 0.07\u20130.47; p = .007) and survived correction. An estimated 8% of children with ADHD may have symptoms related to synthetic food colors.\n\nConclusions\nA restriction diet benefits some children with ADHD.

Well, I say Christmas gift, but really it is the sort of like the bunny suit that Aunt Clara made for Ralphie in the Christmas Story movie. \u00a0After you open the box and look at it you are left wondering what was she thinking.\n\nIf you don't know what all the drama is about when it comes to thimerosal in vaccines and autism, well you must have been hiding under a rock for the past decade. \u00a0You might want to just go back there and skip this post, it will be better for your sanity.\n\nAnyways, I can't talk about the details of the study because it is in Polish and I can't read Polish. \u00a0But two things did jump out at me as I was reading the abstract.\n\nFirst, vaccines that contain thimerosal are still in routine use in Poland.\n\nThat surprised me a little bit since the safety of using thimerosal as a preservative in vaccines was first questioned more than twenty years ago.\u00a0I thought that most of the first and second world countries had moved away from using it by now.\n\nSecond, you can't just a study by its title. \n\nThe title of this study is \"Lack of association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism\" and most of the abstract matches the title. \u00a0They included children with and without autism, determined how much thimerosal each child was exposed to (not sure how), adjusted for other confounding factors, yada yada yada, and concluded \"no significant association was found between TCVs exposure and autism.\" \u00a0Just what you would expect from your run of the mill thimerosal study. \n\nBut then there is this one little sentence -\n\nAfter adjusting to potential confounders, odds ratios of the risk of autism developing for infants vaccinated with TCVs were 1.52 (95% CI: 0.29-11.11) for doses 12.5-87.5 microg, 2.78 (95% CI: 0.29-11.11) for 100-137.5 microg and 1.97 (95% CI: 0.37-18.95) for these exposed > or = 150 microg\nI had to read that twice before it sank it. \u00a0Here the abstract just finished saying there was no significant association and then it says that infants exposed to thimerosal had an increased risk of autism? \u00a0And this risk went up (more or less) as the dose of thimerosal increased?\n\nSay what? \n\nOf course the answer to this\u00a0conundrum\u00a0rests in the word \"significant\", as in statistically significant. \u00a0The researchers could not be confident that the relationship was not due to random chance. \u00a0And the 95% confidence intervals listed reflect that fact. \n\nFor example, if you take look at that first set up numbers, a child was almost one and a half times more likely to develop autism if they were exposed to anywhere between 12.5 to 87.5 micrograms of thimerosal than a child who was not. \u00a0But there is a 95% chance than the odds could have been anywhere from one third less likely all the way to more than 11 times more likely.\n\nOr in other words, you can be mostly confident that you have no clue what the real relationship is.\n\nEven still, I would love to be able to read this study and see what the numbers were. \u00a0Because it looks like there might be something interesting going on with the data. \u00a0Is the data evenly distributed and that is causing the wide intervals or is the data grouped together, possibly highlighting a vulnerable subset?\n\nIf only I could read Polish.\n\nAnyway, even if this study did show an increased risk of autism after exposure to thimerosal and that the risk increased as the exposure to thimerosal increased, it would not be anywhere near enough to overturn the other studies that show the opposite. \u00a0All it could do is put a little doubt in your mind that something was missed in the earlier studies.\n\n\nReferences\n\nMrozek-Budzyn D, Majewska R, Kieltyka A, Augustyniak M.

From there, airways branch off the stems much like tree branches in a random, asymmetrical pattern, said Stewart, a pediatric pulmonologist at Nemours Children's Clinic in Pensacola, Fla.\n\nBut in the autistic children, those branches were instead doubled up and symmetrical. And the branches were smaller -- whereas in a normal lung you might have one large branch jutting off, in the autistic child, she'd see two, smaller branches instead.\nThe abstract of the presentation is below.\n\nCan Bronchoscopic Airway Anatomy Be an Indicator of Autism?\nBarbara Stewart, MD\nNemours Childrens Clinic, Pensacola, FL\n\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate possible correlation between certain airway anamolies and a definitive diagnosis of autism and/or autistic spectrum disorder.\n\nMETHODS: IRB approval was obtained for a restrospective study to evaluate 49 patients with a diagnosis of autism or autistic spectrum disorder. These patients were seen in the pulmonary clinic with a diagnosis of cough that was unresponsive to therapy and who required further pulmonary work-up. Bronchoscopic evaluation of the airway was included as part of that work-up.\n\nRESULTS: Bronchoscopic evaluations revealed the presence of initial normal anatomy followed by double take-offs in the lower airway (or \"doublets\") in 100% of the autistic population studied.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a correlation between autistic spectrum disorder and airway anatomy.

Period.\n\n\nThis time (sad that I have to clarify that) I am talking about Shannon Des Roches Rosa's recent rant entitled \"Vanquish the Force of Autism Evil! Declare Your Autism Pride\" in which she places the blame for an infant's murder on the media and \"autism organizations and websites like Age of Autism, Adventures in Autism, AnneDachel, and SafeMinds\".\n\nHarold Doherty already took Ms. Des Roches Rosa to task for her rant on Facing Autism in New Brunswick but I thought I might add my two cents worth as well. \u00a0You see, while Ms \"Declare Your Autism Pride\" was busy labeling a large segment of the autism community as \"evil\" and praising her own attempts to counter negative autism attitudes, she apparently forget to do some basic fact checking.\n\nThe incident in question involves a mother by the name of\u00a0Stephanie Rochester who stands accused of smothering her 6 month-old son because she believed he had autism. \u00a0The case has received a good amount of media\u00a0coverage, such as here, here, and here, so I won't talk about all of the little details of the case. \u00a0But the relevant facts of the case are as follows.\n\nThis suicidal mother thought that her 6 month old son was showing signs of autism. \u00a0She (presumably) knew what the signs of autism were because she \"worked as a counselor at the Children's Hospital and had worked with autistic children\". \u00a0She thought that a child with autism would \"emotionally and financially ruin her life\" and she didn't want to \"burden her husband with a baby inflicted with autism\". \u00a0So she decided that the rational thing to do would be to murder her own child before she (presumably) killed herself.\n\nNot surprisingly, when this case went to trial, this woman was evaluated to see what her mental state was at the time of the murder. \u00a0She was found to be legally insane by both a psychiatrist hired by the defense and a state psychiatrist appointed by the court. \u00a0Some of the media articles have suggested that she might have been suffering from postpartum depression at the time of the murder as well. \u00a0It is expected that this woman will pled not guilty by reason of insanity and be committed to a mental hospital. \n\nMy heart goes out to the family as they lost not one but two family members to this\u00a0senseless\u00a0and possibly preventable tragedy.\n\nHowever, Ms. Des Roches Rosa apparently has a different take on this tragedy. \u00a0She \"squarely\" blames the media and its \"autism negativity and fear mongering\" as well as \"autism organizations and websites like Age of Autism, Adventures in Autism, AnneDachel, and SafeMinds, which have made unilateral demonization of autism their mission\".\n\nNever mind\u00a0the fact that this woman worked for two years with families who have children with autism, she must have completely ignored her first hand experience and relied instead on what the media said about autism. \u00a0It couldn't be that she witnessed first hand what an autism diagnosis can do to a family, she must be a regular reader of those evil blogs that she mentioned.\n\nNever mind\u00a0the fact that this woman has been found by multiple professionals to be legally insane at the time of the murder, it must have been people trash talking autism that cased this murder. \u00a0I mean\u00a0postpartum depression couldn't have had anything to do with the murder. \u00a0It couldn't have been that her fear was based on her actual experience with autism combined with mental health issues that caused the murder.\n\nI don't know what it worse, taking advantage of a child's murder to push your agenda or taking advantage of a person with clear mental health issues to push your agenda. \u00a0I find both actions to be completely repugnant.\n\nIt is time to stop the nonsense in the autism world. \u00a0If Shannon Des Roches Rosa wants to be a postive force in the autim autism world then she needs to stop saying such utter bullshit like \u00a0-\n\nIt doesn't matter how much you love someone with autism -- if you continuously and publicly declare them damaged goods, you are hurting them. And their peers. And telling everyone else it is acceptable to hurt Autistics.\nIt is perfectly reasonable, rational, and generally OK for a parent to not like autism and say so\u00a0publicly. \u00a0I love my children very much but I strongly dislike their autism because of what it does to them. \u00a0I don't think that autism is a fundamental part of who my children are, rather I think it is something that limits what they can do and puts unneeded\u00a0obstacles\u00a0in their way. \u00a0They would be better off if they did not have autism.\n\nIn\u00a0Ms. Des Roches Rosa's book, saying so makes me a force of evil that needs to be vanquished. \u00a0In my book, it means that I am honest about the reality of my children's disability and my feelings towards it. \u00a0I believe that it is important for you to be honest with yourself if you want to have a good life in spite of the challenges that autism brings. \n\nIf anyone feels the need to \"vanquish\" me because of my \"evil\" views, bring it on. \u00a0Although you might want to look up what a \"jabberwocky\" is and have your Vorpal sword ready as I don't \"fall to my knees\" easily or give up without a fight. \n\nBut seriously, if you want to help new parents that are struggling with autism, the absolute last thing you should do is tell them that their fears of autism are somehow wrong. \u00a0You don't look at a person who is handed the enormity of an autism diagnosis and tell them that they are wrong to be afraid. \n\nInstead you acknowledge that the way they feel is a legitimate way to feel when faced with autism. \u00a0You\u00a0\u00a0then help them to deal with the fear and emotions that come with an autism diagnosis and help them accept the fact that their child isn't going to be what they expect. \u00a0You don't pretend that there is no bad and only talk about the supposed good (still waiting for that to appear). \u00a0That goes double or possibly triple if the parents in question have mental health issues of their own. \n\nMurdering your own child is most certainly wrong, but so is blaming it on a group of people you don't like.\n\nHow do \u00a0advocates such as\u00a0Shannon Des Roches Rosa expect us to take what they say about autism\u00a0seriously\u00a0when they can't show even basic compassion for mentally ill mother?\n\nPractice what you preach or sit down and shut the hell up.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.squidalicious.com/2011/12/vanquish-forces-of-autism-evil-declare.html", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2011/12/we-dont-need-anymore-autism-ideological.html", "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_19474266", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/06/stephanie-rochester-trial_n_1131305.ht", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2070821/Mother-smothered-baby-feared-autistic-insane-postpartum-depression.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/12/vanquish-forces-of-autism-nonsense.html", "title": "\nVanquish the Forces of Autism Nonsense\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 13, 2011", "body": "\nAs I mentioned a few days ago, Michelle Dawson et al published yet another paper on \"the level and nature of autistic intelligence\". \u00a0I didn't go into any details about the paper at that point - even though I had read it and had started writing this post - because it had disappeared from the journal's website and I wasn't sure what it was going to be in when it came back. \u00a0Well, the paper is back and since Ms. Dawson was kind enough to call me a \"renowned blogger\" I thought the least I could do was give the paper a serious look.\n\nI am actually going to be talking about two papers by Dawson et al - \"The Level and Nature of Autistic Intelligence\" and \"The Level and Nature of Autistic Intelligence II\" - because they use some of the same underlying data and they talk about the same idea. \u00a0The text of both papers is freely available, here and here, so if you are really interested in the subject I suggest that you read them for yourself.\n\nWith that said, the basic premise in both papers is to that people with autism are actually more intelligent than is commonly thought. \u00a0Conventional wisdom\u00a0(and science) holds that people with autism are often intellectually disabled and, even when they aren't, have intellectual challenges that places them at a disadvantage to a \"typical\" person. \u00a0These papers try to show that people with autism have a different way of thinking and that it isn't so much that they lack intelligence but rather it is the tests that are used to measure their intelligence that are lacking.\n\nOr, in the words of the of the second paper, \"autistic spectrum intelligence is atypical, but also genuine, general, and underestimated\".\n\nAs I said before, in some ways I completely agree with that statement. \u00a0Conventional intelligence tests rely on certain abilities, such as the ability to understand verbal communication and a ready understanding of the environment, and\u00a0are very challenging\u00a0for people with autism. \u00a0A person with autism might very well score lower than a typical person because they have problems with certain core skills, have problems focusing, or have sensitivities to the immediate environment, not because they lack intelligence. \n\nBut that is the nature of the disorder called autism - it disrupts a person's ability to function in a \"typical\" manner. \u00a0It doesn't necessarily mean that they lack intelligence but it makes the application of that intelligence difficult.\n\nGetting back to the papers, in both papers the authors gave two different intelligence tests (not really, but more on this in a minute) to several groups of children and adults who either were \"typical\", had autism, or had Asperger's. \u00a0The first paper focused on children and adults with autism while the second focused on children and adults with Asperger's. \u00a0In each paper, there were four groups - typical children, typical adults, children with autism/Asperger's, and adults with autism/Asperger's. \n\nSome of the \"typical\" children and adults were in both papers although it is never spelled out exactly how many were in both or whether they were retested for the second paper. \u00a0That last bit is important because the way the IQ tests were administered differed between the papers. \u00a0So if the data from the first paper was just reused in the second then it might have skewed the results of the second.\n\nAll of the groups\u00a0were given\u00a0two different styles of intelligence tests, the Wechsler Intelligence Scales III and Raven's Progressive Matrices. \u00a0The children were given the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) and the adults were given Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III). \u00a0All of the participants were given the standard form of Raven's Progressive Matrices. \u00a0There are two other forms of the Raven's test, including one that is meant for younger children or children with learning disabilities. \n\nThere are two main differences between how the tests were administered between the papers. \n\nIn the first paper, the Raven's test was given to all participants with no time limit whereas in the second paper, the standard time limit (40 minutes, I think) was applied. \u00a0I think the impact on the scores from that difference would be obvious.\n\nThe second difference is that the tests in the first paper were scaled according to North American norms while in the second paper Canadian norms were used. \u00a0This is a little bit obscure, so let me explain.\n\nThe basic idea with modern intelligence tests is to give a bunch of questions and then score the number of correct answers. \u00a0But since this raw score does not really tell you anything meaningful, these scores need to be translated into some more useful form, such as an IQ score or a percentile. \u00a0To do that, the test scores are \"normalized\" by giving the test to a large number of people and then using the resulting scores to establish what the typical score is and what range of scores would be expected to be. \u00a0The typical score is set to be an IQ of 100 (50th percentile) and 1 standard deviation is set equal to 15 IQ points.\n\nThis picture from wikipedia might make the idea clearer -\n\n\n\n\nSo the problem is that the two papers used two different sets of translations from the raw test scores - North American norms and Canadian norms - and that there are differences between the mappings. \u00a0So you cannot directly compare the final results without first recalculating the result using the proper normal ranges.\n\nSo was the \"typical\" data that was reused in the second paper re-normalized with the Canadian norms or was it kept under the North American norms? \u00a0And were the comparison charts from the first paper that were included in the second paper (i.e. Figure 1) adjusted as well? \u00a0After reading both papers several times, I still can't say one way or the other for certain.\n\nBut let's set that aside for now and consider the intelligence tests that were used - Raven's Progressive Matrices and Wechsler Intelligence Scales for children and adults.\n\nThe Raven's test is a an old and somewhat simple test that presents a series of progressively more difficult visual puzzles. \u00a0The visual puzzles take the form of shape that has a piece missing and a set of possible answers. \u00a0This site has an example of what one of the questions might look like. \u00a0The person taking the test has a fixed amount of time to answer as many of these puzzles as possible.\n\nThe Raven's tests were initially based on the idea that intelligence was a single, unified general ability. \u00a0Under this model, you either had \"intelligence\" or you did not. \u00a0But like all primitive models, this idea of a single unified intelligence has been gradually replaced by the idea that there are many different types of intelligence and that a person is going to have a varying level of intelligence depending on the exactly what part of their intelligence you are measuring.\n\nWhich is where the Wechsler tests come into play. \u00a0These tests attempt to measure the different types of intelligence by the use of different sub tests, each with a specific focus. \u00a0Under this this newer model of intelligence, Raven's test is no longer measure thought to measure \"intelligence\" but rather one subtype of intelligence called fluid intelligence. \u00a0Fluid intelligence is the ability to think logically and solve problems in novel situations, independent of acquired knowledge\n\nSo on one hand you have the Raven's test that is measuring the ability to think logically and solve problems and on the other you have the Wechsler tests that are trying to measure actual abilities and the ability to apply what you know to a given situation.\n\nI don't want to go into and more details about the differences between the tests because that would take a long time and I am nowhere close to an expert (or even that knowledgeable) on the subject. \u00a0If you are interested in the differences between the tests or the history and current theories of intelligence, I suggest starting with the Wikipedia entry on the subject and working your way outward from there.\n\nBut let me just say that if you have spent any time with children who have even moderate autism, you would know that the differences between these two tests highlight one of the core challenges of autism. \u00a0That being \u00a0while it can be challenging to teach a child with autism it is equally, if not more, challenging to get the child to apply what they know to a given situation. \u00a0There is a very large gap between being able to learn, actually learning, and being able to generalize that knowledge.\n\nBut getting back to the papers, the core data point from both paper is that, while the Wechsler test shows a fragmented and uneven profile of intelligence in people with autism, the Raven's test often shows a significantly higher level of intelligence than the Wechsler in the same group. \u00a0Furthermore, this significant difference is not present in \"typical\" children and adults.\n\nSo the authors concluded that, since the Raven test is thought to measure a more general form of intelligence, the difference between the two tests represents a problem with how the Wechsler tests measure intelligence with respect to people with autism. \u00a0They concluded that the Raven test is a more accurate measure of true \"atypical\" autistic intelligence.\n\nAs I said, I agree with this idea up to a point. \u00a0But (you knew that was coming), there are quite a few problems not only the idea in general but also with the data in both papers.\n\nAs I alluded to above, this interpretation ignores the fact that people with autism (and children in particular) have a hard time with the generalization of knowledge. \u00a0It is one thing for them to know something when you are teaching it to them and asking highly structured questions, it is quite another for them to be able to take that knowledge or reasoning and apply it in a novel situation.\n\nAnother problem is that this interpretation ignores the widely accepted idea that people (and again children in particular) with autism have what are called splinter skills. \u00a0Splinter skills are what happens when a person has uneven development of skills and are substantially behind in some areas, ahead in others, and at the appropriate level for the rest. \u00a0So instead of a person having a fairly even level of skills, they would be have an extremely uneven level of skills. \u00a0For example, some children with autism will learn to read before they develop receptive or expressive verbal skills.\n\nYou can see evidence of splinter skills in the results from the Wechsler test. \u00a0You can also see it very clearly if you give a child on the spectrum a developmental test such as the Battelle. \u00a0So the data from the Wechsler and Raven's tests could easily be yet another example of splinter skills.\n\nIn my opinion, if you combine these two ideas, you could say that one of the core traits of autism is an uneven level of skill and difficulties in applying those skills. \u00a0The other core traits are an extreme difficulty in teaching skills in the first place (at least in some people) and the behaviors of autism. \n\nBut let's set all of the above aside.  Let's assume that all of the data is in the proper terms and let's assume that the difference between the test values can't be explained by known properties of autism.\n\nThe next question is whether what the two tests measure is an equally valid view of intelligence or whether the tests measure different things. \u00a0Can we really look at one repetitive test of intelligence and assume that it better represents potential intelligence better than another test? \n\nI think the answer is obvious, each test provide a different view of a person's intelligence. \u00a0But to arrive at a true measure of a person's intelligence you have to consider all of the available evidence.\n\nThe next follow up question is whether the end results of the tests are directly comparable. \u00a0Does a final score of the 80th percentile on one of the test mean the same thing as an 80th percentile test on the other? \u00a0For this to be true, both tests would have to be an equivalent measure of a person's intelligence, i.e. they would both have to measure the exact same thing.\n\nI think it should be obvious by now that they don't, so I think that you would have to be careful in directly comparing the results between the two tests, doubly so if you wanted to do any calculations based on the numbers.\n\nBut again, lets set that aside for now and look at the actual data underlying the papers. \u00a0I normally don't like to criticize the presentation of paper directly, but if I had to describe the data in these papers I would call it sloppy and disorganized. \u00a0There are numerous inconsistencies in how the data is presented, a few blatant mistakes, and neither paper gives a clear view of what the data actually is. \n\nJust to give you an idea of what I am talking about. \n\nIn the first paper, there is no table that summarizes the data, you have to piece the individual pieces together from the text. \u00a0There are figures that are presented without any real description of what the data is, such as Figure 1 that says it presents \"mean subtest scores\" but then charts percentiles. \u00a0I have to wonder what the percentiles are of, correct answers or normalized results. \u00a0And the data in figure 1 is presented only for one of the four groups in the paper which begs the question what the other groups look like.\n\nIn the second paper, there is a table (Table 1) that presents some of the data. \u00a0But then that data is contradicted by the first figure in the results section and that figure is central to the results being presented. \u00a0You would think that someone would have checked that. \u00a0Later in the paper you are directed to non-existent figures. \u00a0And again, you never are presented a clear view of the data that is being discussed. \u00a0Some of the data is contained in the table while other parts of it are presented only in the text and then you only get to see one small part of the data. \u00a0And then there is another strange chart, Figure 2, that presents data that is similar to the Figure 1 in the first paper but instead of means or percentiles presents scaled scores. \u00a0And, again, the data for the other groups in the paper are left off.\n\nI could put together a better presentation of the data and that is really saying something. \u00a0But after sending several quality hours going over the papers and trying to put all of the pieces together, I have some concerns about how the data was actually analyzed.\n\nThe main result in both papers was that the percentile difference between the Wechsler and Raven's tests was significantly larger in most of the autism/Asperger's group than it was in the \"typical\" groups. \u00a0Most of the groups (with the exception of the Asperger children) did better on the Raven's test than they did on the Wechsler. \u00a0But the the Asperger adults and both the autism groups showed a significantly larger improvement than the others. \n\nWhich leads me to my main problem with the data - how the difference was calculated. \u00a0To put the problem simply, you cannot accurately compare the difference between two percentiles and get a meaningful result because percentiles themselves are not linear. \u00a0I think I can illustrate this best with an example. \n\nIf I have two numbers - 5 and 1 - that represent the differences between two sets of percentiles (50 and 55, 98 and 99), which one would you assume represents a greater change in intelligence? \u00a0The obvious answer is of course 5 - the change from the 50th percentile to the 55th percentile. \n\nYou would assume that a change of 5 percentiles always represents a greater change in intelligence than a change of 1 percentile. \u00a0But in this case you would be wrong, the increase from the 98th percentile to the 99th percentile represents a greater change in intelligence than the 50th percentile to the 55th percentile does.\n\nYou can see this if you change the percentiles into IQ points (see above). \u00a0The 50th percentile represents an IQ of 100, the 55th an IQ of 102, the 98th an IQ of 131, and the 99th an IQ of 134. \u00a0So the 5 percentile change equates to a change in IQ of 2 while the 1 percentile change represents a change in IQ of 3 IQ.\n\nThe reason for this discrepancy is that percentiles, at least as they are used in this paper, are meant to provide a relative ordering of everyone who takes a particular test. \u00a0So scoring in the 80th percentile means that you did better than 80% of the people who took the test and worse than 20%. \u00a0The percentiles do not tell you anything about the magnitude of the difference between the groups.\n\nSo, even if you had a set of percentages that are all from the same test, you could not subtract them and do anything meaningful with the results. \u00a0You cannot take a set of differences and order them from the smallest to the largest (which is required for the statistics used in the second paper) because you do not know which change in percentile represents a larger change.\n\nThe first paper's main conclusion is in doubt because the statistics not only assume the ability to order the results, but also assume a linear scale and a normal distribution of the data. \u00a0Even a quick look at the statistics shows that the distribution cannot be normal (e.x. range 0 to 100, mean 36, SD 26) and the differences aren't ordinal let alone linear.\n\nThe second paper at least used statistics that did not depend on a normal distribution. \u00a0But even still, the main statistics depends on the data being ordinal. \n\nSo when the second paper says this in the results section -\n\n\"The Asperger adults demonstrated an advantage of RPM over Wechsler FSIQ that was significantly greater than that of the non-Asperger adult controls, Mann-Whitney U=366.5, p<.01\"\n\nThat statement is completely unsupported by the data. \u00a0In pure numerical terms, the difference might seem to be larger, but in terms of actual increased of intelligence that statement is very much in doubt.\n\nAnother quibble with the results is the use of averages (means) to represent the group rather than a median. \u00a0If you have a set of non-linear values such as these percentiles, if really isn't valid to take an average because it is going to misrepresent where the middle of the group is. \u00a0That goes double when the data is badly skewed, as is the case of the Asperger adults' Raven's test in the second paper. \u00a0In that case the \"average\" was 74 but the standard deviation is 50(!). \u00a0For that to happen, the bulk of the data has to be well below the 74th percentile which means the median value would be significantly lower.\n\nAlthough, to be fair, there are some valid secondary results. \u00a0For example, when the paper reports that \"the Asperger adults\u2019 Wechsler VIQ was significantly higher than their PIQ (55th vs. 39th percentile), Z =3.43 p<.01\", that could be valid because the data is in the same terms and the statistics were (apparently) used properly. \u00a0What it means without the main result though is an entirely different question.\n\nWho knows, maybe I am missing something fundamental about the data here or am completely wrong about the percentile thing. \u00a0But from that I can see in the paper and what I know about statistics, it looks like the conclusions are based on a faulty analysis. \u00a0If anyone sees something obvious that I missed, please point it out in the comments.\n\nI really could go on to point out quite a few other problems with the data such as the fact that the differences are percentiles aren't even based on the same test, or that the number of participants in the papers is rather small, or that confounding social/demographic factors weren't adjusted for. \u00a0But since the main result is likely invalid, I don't really see the point in beating a dead horse.\n\nWhew. \u00a0Anyone still reading this?\n\nNow that I have rambled about these two papers far longer than I had wanted, let me just say that while I think these two papers are mostly worthless, the idea that people with autism can be intelligent isn't. \u00a0There is nothing implicit in autism that says that everybody who has autism is automatically intellectually disabled, although there appears to be a large group that is. \n\nWhat I think is obvious is that autism disrupts a person's ability to apply their intelligence. \u00a0Even if you throw out every problem that I pointed out with these papers and took their data at face value, the data would fully support that idea\u00a0that there is a break between what a person can do and what autism allows them to do.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

{"date": "Sunday, October 2, 2011", "body": "\n\n\n\nA little over a month ago I pointed out some curiosities about the Autism Science Foundation. \u00a0Since that time the foundation has launched a new web site and updated their \"2010 Annual Report\" web site, so lets see how they did with their update\n\nComplaint #1 : PDD-NOS is Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified\n\nOver two years ago, I pointed out that the ASF's web site was calling PDD-NOS the wrong thing - \"Pervasive Developmental Delay - Not Otherwise Specified\". \u00a0That inaccurate description is still on their new redesigned website. \n\nI can understand the initial version of the site having wrong information but come on. \u00a0If one of the goals of the foundation is to \"provide information about autism to the general public\" and they can't even get the name of the condition correct, how much trust do you think you should place in other things they say?\n\nComplaint #2 : The GFCF Diet\n\nI also pointed out that their information about the GFCF diet was misleading. \u00a0They claim that children on the GFCF diet have lower bone densities as if it were a proven fact when, in fact, there is only one small study that showed that children on this diet might have lower bone densities. \u00a0And that study was not able to establish cause and effect. \u00a0As in the study could not say whether the diet caused the lower density or whether the density problem was caused by the underlying problem that the diet was treating. \u00a0Given what I have gone through with my children to get their levels of nutrients up to where they need to be, my money would be on the later. \n\nThe ASF also claims that a \"large-scale study of the safety and efficacy of the GFCF diet indicated that children on the diet had similar outcomes to those who were not on the diet\". \u00a0Again, this claim is lacking evidence. \u00a0There are some studies of the effectiveness of the diet but most of them would not qualify as \"large-scale\" and precious few are actually set up in such as way as to test the effectiveness of the diet.\n\nAnd for that matter, would it really hurt the ASF to include footnotes citing the source of their claims? \u00a0Most other places that claim to offer \"scientific\" based advice do that as a matter of course.\n\nComplaint #3 : The Annual Report\n\nBack in May the ASF announced their first annual report and put up this fancy web site that promised more information in June. \u00a0Well, June turned into July and then into August and the ASF still had not make good on that promise. \u00a0Finally, during this latest makeover, the ASF got around to updating their anual report web site.\n\nBut they didn't provide the information that they promised - they simply took down the references to June 2010. \u00a0So if you look under the\u00a0\"Financials\" section of the site you will see \"Financials Coming Soon!\" instead of the something along the lines of Financials Coming in June. \n\nDo you really want to donate to an organization that seems unable to make good on its promises to\u00a0provide a breakdown of exactly how they use their money?\n\nComplaint #4 : Growing Older Makes It Better\n\nUnder their \"Treatment Options\" section they make some rather questionable claims about the prognosis for children on the spectrum -\n\nRemember, autism is pervasive developmental delay, which means children will continue to develop, learn, gain skills and adapt as they age. Sometimes children lose their diagnosis altogether, leading to claims of recovery. Keep in mind that symptoms of autism change as a child develops.\nThe unfortunate truth is that not every child on the spectrum will continue to develop and gain skills as they age. \u00a0Sometimes getting older will help develop skill but that is far from a given and has not been demonstrated in any sort of scientific study. \n\nThis idea touches on what is likely the single hardest thing for parents to accept about autism and what makes autism different from other development disorders. \u00a0You have no clue what the outcome for a particular child will be and no way to predict what will actually improve the outcome.\u00a0 The most frustrating thing is that what works for one child may not work for another - even if that other child is genetically identical. \u00a0And\u00a0there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to why this is the case.\n\nIn other development disorders you have a better idea of what the outcome is going to be from the start and , in some cases, a better set of tools to work with. \u00a0With autism the range spans from completely functional with no trace of autism (i.e. recovered) all the way down to completely unable to function in any way. \u00a0And no one can tell you if your child is going to be functional or non-functional or what specific treatments or therapies will actually be effective at helping them move along.\n\nThe one thing that I can tell you is the worst thing you can do is sit back and assume that they will get better with age. \u00a0That is why this idea that children \"will continue to develop, learn, gain skills and adapt as they age\" is so harmful. \u00a0Some children may grow on their own while others will require constant work to move forward. \u00a0You can't assume that they will get better simply as a function of aging.\n\nComplaint #5 : Recovery\n\nApparently the ASF is against the idea of \"recovery\" from autism -\n\n\u201cRecovery\u201d can be a useful concept, but only if defined as the ability of individuals with ASD to lead fulfilling lives, given the challenges of their condition.\nNo, recovery is a useful concept because it implies that a person has recovered from autism. \u00a0The way that this is phrased presupposes that autism is a life-long condition and is built into a who a person is. \u00a0For a foundation that claims to be science based that is a very far-fetched assumption. \n\nScience has no clue what causes autism or what biological effects it has on the body let alone any clue as to whether the effects are permanent and unalterable. \u00a0There are certainly hints that it is permanent but there are also hints that it is an ongoing biological process. \u00a0Yet the ASF seems to be against looking for a real cure for autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//4.bp.blogspot.com/-Sj8eeXD6bCU/TA76cd_Fp8I/AAAAAAAAAPI/3VQB_xRrln8/s1600/fail.jpg", "http://autismsciencefoundation.org/", "http://autismsciencefoundation.org/what-is-autism", "http://autismsciencefoundation.org/what-is-autism/autism-diagnosis/beware-non-evidence-based-treatments", "http://www.asf2010annualreport.org/financials/", "http://autismsciencefoundation.org/what-is-autism/autism-diagnosis/treatment-options", "http://autismsciencefoundation.org/what-is-autism/autism-diagnosis/treatment-options"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/10/autism-science-foundations-makeover.html", "title": "\nThe Autism Science Foundation's Makeover Failure\n"},

Never could have anticipated this. That's a lot of work effectively wrecked. A lot of the paper is unreadable. Am guessing the abstract with harmful text imposed by PLoS will go up on PubMed too. Unreal. Some person somewhere decides autistics are sick and, what, aren't persons (or whatever the problem is) and wrecks a paper, unilaterally.\n\u00a0I can see that calling someone a \"patient\" is a\u00a0horrific\u00a0crime against nature and completely unethical. \u00a0Yeah, uhm, I wonder if anyone has ever taken the time to explain to Ms. Dawson exactly what the word \"unethical\" means.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/-0wYyeUvosi4/SzquPxY0r7I/AAAAAAAAAJE/PdRaQNOXLr8/s1600/question.png", "http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0025372", "http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-09/plos-tla092711.php", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110928180405.htm", "http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4IwXen_UcYwJ:www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%252F10.1371%252Fjournal.pone.0025372&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us", "http://www.quicktopic.com/27/H/vJvhV4fDnBgw7?m1=12589&mN=12589&bare=1"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/10/level-and-nature-of-autistic.html", "title": "\nThe Level and Nature of Autistic Intelligence II: Where did the study go?\n"},

All individuals were screened for a history of possible seizures by parental/informant questionnaire. An epilepsy interview was undertaken and medical notes reviewed for individuals with a history of possible seizures. The features and correlates of epilepsy were examined using survival and regression analysis.\n\nRESULTS:\nEpilepsy developed in 22% of participants. In the majority, seizures began after 10 years of age. Generalised tonic-clonic seizures predominated (88%). In over a half (19/33), seizures occurred weekly or less frequently and in the majority of individuals (28/31) they were controlled with the prescription of one to two anticonvulsants. Epilepsy was associated with gender (female), intellectual disability and poorer verbal abilities. Although the presence of epilepsy in the probands was not associated with an increased risk of epilepsy in their relatives, it was associated with the presence of the broader autism phenotype in relatives. This indicates that the familial liability to autism was associated with the risk for epilepsy in the proband.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nEpilepsy is an important medical complication that develops in individuals with autism. Seizures may first begin in adolescence or adulthood. Putative risk factors for epilepsy in autism were identified and these will require further investigation in future studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\nBolton PF, Carcani-Rathwell I, Hutton J, Goode S, Howlin P, Rutter M.

{"date": "Thursday, September 22, 2011", "body": "\nThere have been a couple of good studies published in recent weeks that look at the possible connection between disruptions of the immune system and autism. \u00a0But one in particular that was published just last week in PLoS One looks to be the best of the bunch.\n\nI have not read it in depth yet so I might be getting some of the details wrong. \u00a0But in general, it looks like these researchers managed to take the many rare genetic mutations that have been seen in autism and demonstrate that many of these mutations converge on biological paths that control immune system signaling. \u00a0The researchers suggest that these disruptions have the potential to alter typical brain development and lead to the symptoms of autism.\n\nI would normally include the abstract of the study but I think these paragraphs from the conclusion puts the findings into prospective -\n\nInterestingly, there is also mounting evidence at the cellular and tissue levels that more in depth investigation of an immune component is warranted in ASD. For instance, multiple studies have demonstrated altered cytokine profiles in ASD patients, and altered TGF-B concentration in serum and CSF correlates with disease severity. Others have described various autoimmune phenomena including autoantibodies to neural antigens and maternal-fetal cross-reactive neural antibodies. There is also indication of altered innate cellular immunity in ASD, such as differences in gene expression and altered response to immunostimlulatory ligands in both natural killer and monocytic cells from ASD patients. Post-mortem brain tissue from ASD patients shows increased microglial density in grey matter, an activated morphology, and secretion of a cytokine profile consistent with a pro-inflammatory state, most prominent in the cerebellum. Moreover, microglia from MeCP2- null mice\u2014a model of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Rett Syndrome\u2014produce a conditioned media that damages synaptic connectivity via a glutamate-excitotoxicity mechanism. While all of this work provides post-hoc evidence for altered immune response in ASD, our results suggest a direct link between implicated genes in ASD and molecular pathways involved in immune signaling.\n\nThis considerable attention to the immune response in previous ASD research has resulted in two prevailing theories: one suggests exogenous factor(s) stimulate neuro-inflammation during development, while the other postulates autoimmune activation causes ASD pathology. However, it is equally possible\u2014as our results support\u2014that the mutations described in ASD result in aberrant signaling regulation of immune cells during neurodevelopment. This could result in cell-autonomous activation and/or improper response to otherwise nominal stimuli, such as occurs in the autoinflammatory syndromes. Alternatively, as glia are increasingly implicated in normal formation of synaptic connectivity \u2014and we have demonstrated a significant proportion of ASD-implicated genes appear to be glial-specific\u2014it is possible that genomic aberrations ultimately funnel through core signaling pathways of glial cells to disrupt formation of neural networks independent of an inflammatory mechanism. In support of this notion, a number of recent reports have demonstrated that these same cytokine signaling pathways are central to proper brain development. Furthermore, signaling through the NFkB pathway has been shown to be important in synaptic plasticity independent of an inflammatory mechanism.\nThe study is open access so go read it if you are interested in the subject.\n\nReferences\n\nZiats MN, Rennert OM.

{"date": "Thursday, August 18, 2011", "body": "\nIt has been two years since Alison Tepper Singer absconded with Autism Speak's seat on the IACC and co-founded the Autism Science Foundation. \u00a0The ASF is, of course, a (cough) leading nonprofit dedicated to finding answers to the puzzle of autism.\n\nOr at least they are dedicated to finding all of the answers possible when starting from the assumption that vaccines, anything related to vaccines, and GI issues have nothing to do with autism.\n\nIt has been a little bit of a rocky start for the ASF. \n\nOn day one, the ASF climbed into bed with prominent members of the neurodiversity and adult \"don't speak ill of\" autism community. \u00a0I'm guessing they felt the need to do that because they annoyed one large part of the autism community by running away with Autism Speak's seat on the IACC and another large part with their absolute \"asked and answered\" stance on autism \"science\".\n\nThe ND and adult \"self-advocate\" groups might have been the only vocal group left who would give them the time of day. \u00a0But I have to wonder what sort of pact with the devil was required to seal this deal because Ms Singer was definitely not well liked by these people. \u00a0Prior to the formation of the foundation, these people were all but burning her in effigy over comments she made years earlier about autism making her want to drive off a bridge.\n\nBut whatever promises were made, the ASF gained the acceptance of a large part of the ND and self-advocate movements. \u00a0Which is a rather peculiar pairing when you think about it. \u00a0On the one side, you have a foundation dedicating to following science and on the other a group of people who don't seem to think that autism is a disorder or that it needs to be treated/cured. \u00a0On the one side you have a foundation dedicated to finding the genetic \"causes\" of autism and on the other people who object to almost any genetic research into autism.\n\nI think you get the point, the two groups certainly make strange bed fellows.\n\nAnd so, with their bed made, the ASF turned to more mundane matters such as where to hang their hats. \u00a0And speaking of location, the initial location was none other than the basement of Ms. Singer's home. \u00a0Which, all things considered, isn't the worst place to start from. \u00a0I just have to wonder how many of the other non-profit public members of the IACC worked out of someone's basement.\n\nSo, with their bed made and located in Ms. Singer's basement, the foundation turned to creating its website to share its mission and to provide accurate scientific information about autism to the world.\n\nAnd promptly got it wrong. \n\nOn their website, they included information about PDD-NOS, aka Pervasive Developmental Delay - Not Otherwise Specified. \u00a0They also wanted to remind us that \"autism is pervasive developmental delay, which means children will continue to develop, learn, gain skills and adapt as they age\". \n\nWhich while it might be true that some children with autism will continue to grow and learn on their own, you can't really say that for all children. \u00a0And last time I checked, the \"scientific\" definition of autism is that it is a development disorder, not a \"delay\", and PDD-NOS stands for Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified, again not a \"delay\".\n\nI find it highly curious that an organization with the word \"science\" in their name and a gaggle of scientific advisers would get the name and basic concept of the disorder they are targeting wrong. \u00a0Maybe it had something to do with getting into bed with the ND movement?\n\nThe foundation also has some questionable information about the gluten-free, casein-free diet on site, saying that \"children on the GFCF diet have been found to have lower bone density than controls, which could lead to osteoporosis.\" \n\nThere has been no study (that I am aware of) that has provided strong evidence that children with autism on the GFCF diet are more likely that children with autism who aren't on the diet to have lower bone density. \u00a0Or for that matter any study whatsoever that attempts to sort out whether the GFCF diet could cause lower bone density or whether lower bone density could be caused by another condition (such as malabsorption) that the GFCF diet is used to treat.\n\nThe best (and worst) you can say about the GFCF diet is that the available evidence is inconclusive. \u00a0There is some evidence that suggests it can help some children with autism but there certainly isn't any evidence that suggests that it would help all children or that it could magically cure every person with autism.\n\nBut moving along, with the ASF firmly in bed with the advocates in Ms. Singer's basement and their version of science nestled in its crib, the foundation secured funding in the form of proceeds from Dr. Offit's autism book \u00a0started operations. \n\nOr something like that, my memory of the exact sequence and timing of events is a little bit blurry. \u00a0It is about this time that I finally found something better to do with my time and stopped paying attention to what the ASF was doing.\n\nFast forward to the present day and most of the original rough start has been erased. \n\nAutism Speaks managed to get another seat on the IACC so that one of the largest private sources of funding for autism research could once again participate in the discussion of the future of autism research. \n\nThe ASF appears to have moved out of the basement and into New York City.\n\nUnfortunately, the ASF is still calling autism a developmental delay instead of a disorder and they haven't updated their web site to reflect the data from the most recent twin studies or sibling study. \u00a0And the GFCF diet still can lead to osteoporosis.\n\nAt least they got the science part, oh wait. \u00a0Two out of three isn't bad, right? \n\nMoving right along...\n\nAs I think back over the past two years, I can't really put my finger on anything major the ASF has done. \u00a0Perhaps it was because I wasn't paying attention but you would think that anything of any major importance would have appeared in the headlines. \n\nI do seem to remember something about them occasionally passing out sandwiches to scientists, possibly to help them think better (it is hard to think on an empty stomach). \u00a0I also seem to remember something about them paying for ND bloggers, such as Sullivan and DoC, to attend autism conferences and write about it on their blogs. \n\nOh, and I think they did fund some research too.\n\nA few months ago, I noticed that the ASF announced the imminent arrival of the first annual report. \u00a0Since I hadn't really been following the what the foundation was up to, I thought it would be interesting to see what exactly the ASF had done in the first two years.\n\nFor their part, the ASF appeared to be very excited to release their first annual report, calling it \"doing BIG things\" and going so far as to create a special web site to release the report. \u00a0This special site provided little snippets of information from the report and promised that the full report will would available in June. \n\nBut then June came and went and the report was not published. \u00a0And then July passed and still no report. \u00a0Here it is, the middle of August and the special site is still claiming that the report is going to be published in June. \u00a0Maybe they mean June 2012?\n\nI know the ASF wants to be taken seriously but I have to wonder. \u00a0I can't imagine Autism Speaks or any other large autism non-profit making a big to-do about releasing its annual report and then simply failing to do so. \u00a0The ASF says that it survives on donations but who would be willing to donate to an organization that won't even tell you how it uses the money you give it?\n\nVery curious.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/08/curious-autism-science-foundation.html", "title": "\nThe Curious Autism Science Foundation\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, August 13, 2011", "body": "\nAs I have talked about just a few times before, safety is real concern for parents whose children have autism. \u00a0Many of these children lack a basic awareness of their environment and will unknowingly put themselves in situations where there is a very real chance of harm or death.\n\nSo parents like me worry and take extra precautions to keep their children safe. \u00a0We talk about these concerns openly so that other parents - perhaps parents new to autism - will know enough to take appropriate precautions and keep their children safe. \u00a0The penalty for a lack of awareness in this area can be very severe.\n\nBut since this is autism we are talking about, there are always the \"don't speak ill of autism\" crowd how want to deny that these concerns are valid. \u00a0One of their complaints against this idea is that there is no \"evidence\" that safety is a systemic issue in autism.\n\nWell, here is a recent study that takes a look at a relatively simple task that involves safety - crossing the street. \u00a0The developmental disability here is one of the forms of ADHD, but I have no doubt that the findings would apply to autism. \u00a0There are many children with autism who would also lack the ability \"to process perceived information adequately to permit crossing safely.\"\n\n\nMediating factors associated with pedestrian injury in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nUnintentional injury is the leading cause of pediatric mortality. One leading cause of unintentional injury is pedestrian injury. Children with developmental disabilities, particularly those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-combined type (ADHD-C) seem to have increased pedestrian injury risk. This study examined (1) the differences in pedestrian behavior between children with ADHD-C and normally developing comparison children and (2) the mediating factors that might link ADHD-C with pedestrian injury risk.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS:\nA total of 78 children aged 7 to 10 years (39 children with ADHD-C diagnoses and 39 age- and gender-matched typically developing children) participated. The main outcome measure was pedestrian behavior, as measured in a semi-immersive, interactive, virtual pedestrian environment. Key pedestrian variables related to different aspects of the crossing process were identified: (1) before the cross (ie, evaluating aspects of the crossing environment); (2) making the cross (ie, deciding to cross and initiating movement); and (3) safety of the cross (ie, safety within the pedestrian environment after the decision to cross was made).\n\nRESULTS:\nChildren with ADHD-C chose riskier pedestrian environments to cross within (F(1,72) = 4.83; P <; .05). No significant differences emerged in other aspects of the crossing process. Executive function played a mediating role in the relationship between ADHD-C and the safety of the cross.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nChildren with ADHD-C seem to display appropriate curbside pedestrian behavior but fail to process perceived information adequately to permit crossing safely.\n\n\nReferences\n\nStavrinos D, Biasini FJ, Fine PR, Hodgens JB, Khatri S, Mrug S, Schwebel DC.\u00a0Mediating factors associated with pedestrian injury in children with\u00a0attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

{"date": "Sunday, August 14, 2011", "body": "\nI have been reading older autism twin studies in an effort to put the latest autism twin studies and the idea that autism is a genetic disorder into a historical context. \u00a0And the more I read of these old studies, the more the following line keeps coming to mind -\n\nThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. \n\nWe all hang on the latest word in autism research but I have to wonder how much of what we read is really new. \u00a0As I am reading these old studies, I keep bumping into ideas that are being presented now as new and wonderful \"discoveries\". \u00a0So I find myself wondering just how much is new and how much is simply a\u00a0regurgitation of an older ideas that simply fell out of scientific fashion.\n\nLets take a look at some of the new, radical ideas about autism in terms of historical studies.\n\nTo start off with, what about the recent idea that a maternal infection during pregnancy might increase the risk of autism? \u00a0If you read Steffenburgh et al 1989, you would see infections during pregnancy being mentioned as a possible cause of autism \u00a0-\nIn not a single one of the pairs discordant for AD was there a reversed relationship in this respect. There were no cases of diagnosed rubella infection in pregnancy or of other infections currently thought to be of causative importance in autism.How about the idea that autism might be a combination of genetic and environment influences? \u00a0Folsten & Rutter in 1977 -\nIn studying genetic factors, it is necessary to bear in mind that autism is probably a behavioural syndrome with multiple aetiologies (Rutter, 1974). Certainly, it is known that the syndrome can develop in association with medical conditions as pathologically diverse as congenital rubella (Chess et al, 1971) and infantile spasms (Taft and Cohen, 1971). Accordingly, the investigation of possible hereditary factors must take account of aetiological heterogeneity.What about the idea that prenatal/perinatal complications might play a role in autism? \u00a0Steffenburgh et al in 1989 had this to say -\nNevertheless, the association with perinatal problems in discordant autism twin pairs shows that sometimes perinatal problems alone can be a major aetiological contributory factor.How about the idea that identical twins might not both have autism and if they do both have autism the severity might be different? In the granddaddy of all autism twin studies in 1977, Folsten & Rutter found that only 4 out of the 11 pairs of identical twins were concordant for autism and that even if they were concordant they had significant differences -\nTwo of the concordant MZ pairs (i and 3*) were closely similar in all respects. In each case, the twins were severely retarded and the autism was somewhat atypical in terms of the limited evidence of ritualistic features. However, in both the other two pairs, there were important differences between the twins in spite of concordance for autism. In one (2) there was an 18 point difference in non-verbal I.Q_. and a 24 point difference in Peabody language quotient. The twin with a lower non-verbal I.Q,. but higher verbal I.Q,. made much more progress in both social relationships and use of language. In the fourth pair (4) there was a 39 point I.Q,. difference; in this case, the more intelligent twin was less severely autistic, although the type of behaviour was closely similar in both. It is also notable that the more intelligent twin did not develop autism until 3 years of age, although apart from the late onset the clinical picture was typical of autism.\u00a0But you might reply that that was under an old, strange definition of autism that would be quite different than one in use today. \u00a0Nope, here is the definition of autism from that study -\na serious impairment in the development of social relationships of the type characteristic of autism (that is with limited eye to eye gaze, poor social responsiveness, impaired selective bonding, a relative failure to go to parents for comfort, and, when older, a lack of empathy, a lack of personal friendships and little group interaction); together with delayed and deviant language development with some of the specific features associated with autism (namely poor language comprehension, little use of gesture, echolalia, pronominal reversal, limited social usage of language, repetitive utterances, flat or staccato speech and very restricted imaginative play); and also stereotyped, repetitive or ritualistic play and interests (as indicated by an abnormal attachment to objects, marked resistance to change, rituals, repetitive behaviour, unusual preoccupations and restricted interest patterns).That looks almost like a modern definition of autistic disorder to me. \u00a0And as recent results have shown, autistic disorder (i.e. classic autism) makes up somewhere between 30% to 50% of all modern cases.\n\nBut it seems like coming into the \"modern\" era of autism research that we have forgotten some of these ideas. By the time\u00a0Bailey et al in 1995 was published, much of these ideas were put put out to pasture and autism was declared a genetic disorder. \u00a0It is only now, in modern times, that we have rediscovered some of the ideas about autism that were common over 35 years ago.\n\nIn closing, let me leave you with two little fun facts about these old twin studies. \u00a0\nThe following twin studies make up the bulk of historical twin studies that looked at actual co-morbidity in twins -\u00a0Folsten & Rutter 1977, Steffenburgh et al 1989, and Bailey et al 1995 - and all three of these studies have one very important thing in common.\n\nAll three of these studies excluded opposite sex twins, otherwise know as half of the fraternal twin population.\nSecond, even though the numbers of children with a label has increased by a factor of 25 (2400%) over the years, one thing has not changed - the 4 to 1 ratio of boys to girls. \u00a0That ratio is noted all the way back in\u00a0Folsten & Rutter in\u00a01977 and the reference in there is to an older study from 1966. \u00a0\nSo ask yourself just one question, if the definition of autism has changed so radically over the years and we are now calling things \"autism\" that would never have been called autism in the past, why hasn't this ratio of boys to girls changed?\n\nReferences\u00a0\n\nFolstein, S, and M Rutter. 1977. \u201cInfantile autism: a genetic study of 21 twin pairs.\u201d Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines 18(4):297-321. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/562353.\n\nRitvo, E R, B J Freeman, A Mason-Brothers, A Mo, and A M Ritvo. 1985. \u201cConcordance for the syndrome of autism in 40 pairs of afflicted twins.\u201d The American journal of psychiatry 142(1):74-7. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4038442.\n\nSteffenburg, S et al. 1989. \u201cA twin study of autism in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.\u201d Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines 30(3):405-16. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2745591.\n\nBailey, A et al. 1995. \u201cAutism as a strongly genetic disorder: evidence from a British twin study.\u201d Psychological medicine 25(1):63-77. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7792363.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/08/ghosts-of-autism-studies-past.html", "title": "\nGhosts of Autism Studies Past\n"},

This study used prospective methods to obtain an updated estimate of sibling recurrence risk for ASD.\n\nMethods: A prospective longitudinal study of infants at risk for ASD was conducted by a multisite international network, the Baby Siblings Research Consortium. Infants (n = 664) with an older biological sibling with ASD were followed from early in life to 36 months, when they were classified as having or not having ASD. An ASD classification required surpassing the cutoff of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and receiving a clinical diagnosis from an expert clinician.\n\nResults: A total of 18.7% of the infants developed ASD. Infant gender and the presence of >1 older affected sibling were significant predictors of ASD outcome, and there was an almost threefold increase in risk for male subjects and an additional twofold increase in risk if there was >1 older affected sibling. The age of the infant at study enrollment, the gender and functioning level of the infant's older sibling, and other demographic factors did not predict ASD outcome.\n\nConclusions: The sibling recurrence rate of ASD is higher than suggested by previous estimates. The size of the current sample and prospective nature of data collection minimized many limitations of previous studies of sibling recurrence. Clinical implications, including genetic counseling, are discussed.\n\nLink\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/08/11/peds.2010-2825.abstract"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/08/study-recurrence-risk-for-autism.html", "title": "\nStudy: Recurrence Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Baby Siblings Research Consortium Study\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, November 16, 2013", "body": "\nA couple of days ago an article written by Suzanne Wright appeared on the Autism Speaks blog entitled \"Autism Speaks to Washington - A Call for Action\". \u00a0The point of the article was that autism is not only a growing problem but one that needs a national response to solve.\n\nParts of the autism community have been less than amused by the article. \u00a0They are currently in the middle of having a collective conniption and declared that Autism Speaks is the new incarnation of the (insert your particular incarnation of ultimate evil here). \n\nWhile it is possible that Autism Speaks should have been more sensitive to the particular sensitivities of this small yet very vocal group, I don't think what they said was that far off base for most autism families. \n\nSince I might be the only one who thinks so, let me explain exactly what I see as the message in easy to digest points -\n\n\n\nThe number of children diagnosed with autism is growing rapidly.\n\nAutism is hard on families. \u00a0Many families struggle on a day to day basis with autism and are doing little more than treading water.\n\nAutism is extremely expensive in financial terms for everyone and in emotional and health terms for families.\n\nThe outcomes for children with autism are poor and taking care of someone for their entire life is pretty expensive.\n\n\n\n\nSo ...\n\n\nWe need a coordinated, national plan that covers everything from early detection to appropriate/best treatments to dealing with what happens when these children\u00a0become adults.\n\n\n\nNone of those points should be controversial ... and yet for some reason they are. \u00a0In my humble opinion, the part of the autism community that has an issue with these ideas need to get their collective heads out of their asses and start becoming part of the solution rather than being part of the problem.\n\n\n\n\nThe primary argument against these points seems to be that there was not sufficient language in the post indicating that the points don't apply to everyone with autism. \u00a0My response is that that argument would apply to anything that anybody has ever said about autism. \u00a0\n\n\n\nThere is not a single statement that you can make that would apply to everyone that has autism. \u00a0There is not even one single trait that everyone with autism shares. \u00a0So, by this logic, every single thing that anybody has ever said or written would need to be changed to indicate that they are only talking about a subset of autism.\n\n\n\nFor example, in his response to the Autism Speaks post, John Elder Robison says -\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"We do not like hearing that we are defective or diseased. \u00a0We do not like hearing that we are part of an epidemic. \u00a0We are not problems for our parents or society, or genes to be eliminated.\"\n\n\n\nClearly he is committing the exact same sin that Autism Speaks did - he is making blanket statements about people with autism without quantifying that he is only speaking for some people with autism.\n\n\n\nIf there is one thing that drives me nuts it is hypocrisy. \u00a0Another is pretending reality isn't true because you don't like it. \u00a0So no matter how much Mr. Robison's royal \"We\" doesn't like hearing that they are part of an epidemic, the reality is that the number of people diagnosed with autism is growing rapidly for unknown reasons. \u00a0Go look up what the word \"epidemic\" means.\n\n\n\nSomeone asked me on another blog if there is a way to have an honest conversation about autism and my answer was no. \u00a0It is not currently possible to have an honest conversation because to have any honest, open conversation you can't start from the position that one side's view are wrong. \n\nWhen it comes to autism, you have to be able to be free to describe the problems associated with a medical label without someone taking offense because you said something that they don't like or don't want to believe.\n\n\n\nMore importantly, when you are talking about public health issues such as autism you either start your conversations based on reliable, accurate information or you don't. \n\nIf you don't then don't waste anyone's time pretending that you are talking about anything other than your own ignorant opinion. \u00a0If you do then start with the basics about the autism population as a whole. \u00a0Start by answering some simple questions about autism such as -\n\n\nHow many people are receiving a diagnosis of autism and how quickly is the number changing?\n\nWhat are the known, proven causes of autism and the increase? \u00a0Not the \"we think\", \"it looks like\", \"it could be\" but rather causes that can be demonstrated and can be shown in multiple data sets. \u00a0For example you can't say its older parents without demonstrating empirically that the parents of children on the spectrum are in fact older, ruling out other possible related factors (i.e. the association between socioeconomic status and the age that you have children), and showing exactly how older parents lead to biological changes that lead to the behaviors of autism.\n\nWhat are the typical impairments in communication and how severe are they? \u00a0How many people have the ability to use functional communication at all, how many can carry on even simple conversations, how many can have complex conversations?\n\nHow many people are functionally impaired enough by their autism that they have or appear to have intellectual disability? \u00a0How many appear as borderline intellectual disabled?\n\nHow many people go on to develop other, related conditions such as epilepsy that are much more common in autism?\n\nAs the children become adults, what happens to them? \u00a0How many are able to live independently and hold down a job? \u00a0How many are unable to take care of themselves? \u00a0Where do the ones that are unable to take care of themselves live?\n\n\n\nStart answering these questions for yourself from reliable, evidence based sources and ignore the autism talking heads. \u00a0Don't take theories from people who have a stated ideology, whatever that ideology might be, at face value.

This study examined the number and shape of trajectories of symptom onset evident in coded home movies of children with autism and examined their correspondence with parent report of onset.\n\nMETHOD:\nFour social-communicative behaviors were coded from the home video of children with autism (n = 52) or typical development (n = 23). All home videos from 6 through 24 months of age were coded (3199 segments). Latent class modeling was used to characterize trajectories and determine the optimal number needed to describe the coded home video. These trajectories were then compared with parent reports of onset patterns, as defined by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised.\n\nRESULTS:\nA three-trajectory model best fit the data from the participants with autism. One trajectory displayed low levels of social-communication across time. A second trajectory displayed high levels of social-communication early in life, followed by a significant decrease over time. A third trajectory displayed initial levels of behavior that were similar to the typically developing group but little progress in social-communication with age. There was poor correspondence between home video-based trajectories and parent report of onset.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMore than two onset categories may be needed to describe the ways in which symptoms emerge in children with autism. There is low agreement between parent report and home video, suggesting that methods for improving parent report of early development must be developed.\n\nPMID: 21784299\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21784299"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/07/study-onset-patterns-in-autism.html", "title": "\nStudy : Onset patterns in autism: correspondence between home video and parent report.\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, July 27, 2011", "body": "\nIn my last post I talked about the possiblity that Brian Deer might have used deception to collect statements used in his BMJ article. \u00a0Well, that is no longer a possiblity but now an almost certainty. \u00a0Mr Deer did in fact use a fake identity in requesting and conducting an interview and quotes from this interview were later included in the BMJ's article. \n\nHere is Brian Deer explaining the situation in his own words (out of respect for the privacy of the mother, I have removed her actual name and replaced it with Smith) -\nExactly right. In fact, not only do I have no shred of doubt about interviewing Rosemary Smith while using a pseudonymn, I\u2019m immensely proud of the encounter (reported seven years ago in The Washington Post) which, with a similar (telephone) interview with Jackie Fletcher of the Jabs group, gave probable cause for the inquiries which I believe eventually brought about the collapse of the vaccine-autism fraud in both the UK and the USA.Thanks Ms\u00a0Smith.\n\nI discussed the intended use of a pseudonym in advance with editorial and legal staff, and the subterfuge was wholly justified by the public interest in the safety of children by means of vaccination, which Ms\u00a0Smith\u00a0sought to challenge. The challenge was to get a detailed account of her story, unaffected by any assumptions she might have about the person she was speaking to. Indeed, clown that he is, Mr Olmsted evidences in his poisonous tirade against me the need for a pseudonym when he observes that Ms Smith would never have talked to me if she had looked at my website. Ethics case closed.\n\nThe untold circumstances of the interview, in late 2003, were that Ms\u00a0Smith\u00a0and I talked (as Mr Olmsted notes) for some six hours. Your readers might wish to consider whether any encounter, in the interviewee\u2019s own home, could have effectively gone on all day were it not to the best standards of courtesy and interest. I was not exactly shouting allegations through her letter box. If I find the time, I may post audio from that interview on my website.\n\nIn her letter, Ms\u00a0Smith\u00a0also wishes the world to believe that I would use only one audio cassette, which I\u2019m supposed to have kept turning over (hence erasing the previous portions of the interview!). Think about it. Her claim might once have been wishful thinking. Seven years later, and with a crucial passage published in the BMJ, it just looks pitiful.\n\nThe truth of what happened was that we had a long, amicable and wide-ranging discussion (featuring frequent cups of tea and a sandwich), near the end of which I asked her what it was that she thought was the trump card for the claimants in what was then still a possible UK lawsuit over MMR. She told me it was the O\u2019Leary measles tests.\n\nAt that point, I made what I now realize to have been a mistake. I gave her my honest and well-intentioned impression, which I\u2019d gained even within a few days of starting my inquiries, that O\u2019Leary\u2019s work was probably a bust (as it turned out to be). I also said to her that I thought she needed to be wary of lawyers, experts, journalists (yes indeed), politicians and others who I thought had piled into the story, would drain was was useful for them, and then move on, leaving parents looking back wondering what on earth had happened (as it turned out to be). I\u2019ve seen this in a number of pharmaceutical product liability disputes, and in Britain it\u2019s always the patients who get shafted.\n\nThe consequence of what was, in fact, a kindly observation of someone with some experience of these sort of issues \u2013 me \u2013 was that the atmosphere darkened as Ms\u00a0Smith\u00a0realized that I was not a \u201csupporter\u201d, as she had assumed, but had a detached view of the whole thing. I was not part of the Wakefield-journalist collaboration which then dominated British media discussion of MMR.\n\nThe next day, she spewed out a torrent of foul abuse (of the kind with which people who read Mr Olmsted\u2019s blog will be familiar) in a letter to the editor of The Sunday Times (who just nine days ago singled out the MMR story in an article about investigative journalism). She didn\u2019t then know that I had used a pseuonym. Her aim was to keep the material from public view \u2013 and perhaps just to vent her bile.\n\nThis abuse was so horrendous and bizarre that Mr Olmsted feels obliged to edit out of her letter some of the stranger stuff which I think, if read in context, would leave any rational person wondering about her sanity. He tells his reader(s) that he has only omitted \u201ca few irrelevant details\u201d. He lies. He has left out material which would tend to undermine Ms\u00a0Smith\u2019s credibility (incidentally, he is also presently grappling with how to leave out a direct allegation of fraud against Wakefield made in another letter by a Lancet 12 parent).\n\nEven in 2003, my investigation was very time consuming. I hadn\u2019t then looked into Ms\u00a0Smith\u00a0and I didn\u2019t then know that talking to her amounted to talking to Wakefield. The pair of them were in it together. However, I did get from her a detailed account of what she said happened to her son (which broadly squares with her case in litigation), and it was at total variance with what was recorded in the Lancet.\n\nThis anomaly became the question. The answer only came when Wakefield made the biggest mistake of his life and sued me for libel in a \u201cgagging\u201d attempt to shut down further debate over MMR. For, in that action, I obtained a court order which permitted me to read the Lancet children\u2019s medical records, and, armed with the arising insight, I then sat through the GMC hearing where those records entered the public domain.\n\nIn summary, not only are there no ethical irregularities in my work, but my stories on MMR are now widely-regarded as the textbook public interest investigation in the field of medicine. Hence, my second British Press Award, which, as every British journalist will know, are immensely difficult to win.I think my option of Mr Deer actually was lower after reading this, if such a thing is possible. \u00a0The only good things that comes from this passage are that\u00a0Mr. Deer's motives in this whole matter are becoming clearer and that several\u00a0unanswered questions have been answered.\n\nNotice that Deer says that \u00a0he was of the opinion that the whole Wakefield matter was a fraud \"within a few days of starting my inquiries\" back in 2003. \u00a0I always thought the purpose of an investigation like the one he undertook was to find the truth of the matter, not to find the facts that meet your preconceived notions. \u00a0Apparently I was wrong. \n\nI am now quite convinced that Deer's sole motivation was simply to get a story and I think it is clear that he didn't really care about who got in his way.\n\nAs a case in point, consider the privacy of the children in Wakefield's study. \u00a0Last year, I wrote about Mr. Deer's claims that he had the medical records of all twelve children involved in the study. \u00a0I noted at the time that he should not have, use, or publicly discuss the contents of the records without the consent of the parents or the patients themselves. \u00a0I wondered how he could have obtained access to the records.\n\nNow, thanks to Deer's own words, we know that he obtained the records because Wakfield sued him for defamation. \u00a0I think it goes without saying that the parents nor the children consented to the records being turned over to him. \u00a0And notice the apparent glee that Deer feels about violating the medical privacy of children. \u00a0He seems so fixated on attacking Wakefield that he does not seem to care about the children whom he is using as weapons.\n\nAs a parent, I cannot adequately express my outrage at his attitude. \u00a0Children - especially children with disabilities such as autism - should not be used as pawns by a journalist, not matter what the circumstances. \u00a0Does any parent out there feel differently? \n\nMy children have been in two studies so far and I would be absolutely furious if a journalist decided that he or she had some right to my children's medical records because they disagreed with what a researcher said.\n\nUnfortunately, this sort of cavalier attitude fits with other comments that I have seen Deer make. \u00a0For example, over two years ago I wrote about him commenting on some disabled children and saying \"its no wonder that they have problems with their brains\" given what their parents believe. \u00a0Here are his exact words -\nAnd they wonder why their children have problems with their brains.And when he was called on that statement, he elaborated -\nWell, actually Joseph, I didn\u2019t intend that observation as an insult. I made it as a shorthand way of raising an issue that I believe may reasonably be raised.I genuinely think that the three individuals I was criticising \u2013 and I know who all three of them are \u2013 do need to question whether their personal behavioural issues are indicative of a better explanation for their children\u2019s issues. Certainly a lot better explanation than MMR.The festering nastiness, the creepy repetitiveness, the weasly, deceitful, obsessiveness, all signal pathology to me.Deer might have well been describing himself with that last remark. \u00a0Wakefield might well have done many things wrong, but Deer is no better.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/07/another-manufactured-controversy/#comment-187655"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/07/brian-deer-immensely-proud-of-using.html", "title": "\nBrian Deer \"Immensely Proud\" of Using Deception to Collect Data Included in the BMJ Article\n"},

By his way of thinking, we should have kept Twin B at home until we had disciplined her enough so she knew to behave in public. \n\nBut what he doesn't seem to be aware of is the fact that the only way that we were going to stop the behavior was by going into the environment that triggered it. \u00a0You simply can't address a location specific problem without going to the location. \n\nWhat he also doesn't seem to realize is that you can use \"the look\" as much as you want on some children with autism - it just doesn't work. \u00a0Many children with autism simply don't process facial expressions well enough or don't process them well enough in stressful situations\u00a0for that to be an effective method.\n\nAnd\u00a0other forms of traditional discipline can be almost as worthless. \u00a0If you want to have a good time, try putting a child with vocal stims in timeout. \u00a0They won't care because they can amuse themselves for hours with just the sound of their own voice.\n\nMr. Granderson clearly lacks the awareness of what exactly is involved in dealing with autism and I am not sure that he would accept it even if he heard it. But if you think that Mr.\u00a0Granderson's ignorance is bad, try reading the comments on the article. \u00a0I think this one my favorite -\nAUTISTIC CHILDREN THAT ARE NOT CAPABLE OF BEHAVING DO NOT BELONG IN RESTAURANTS! PERIOD! YOU ARE NOT \"ENTITLED\" TO RUIN EVERYONE ELSE'S MEALS WITH YOUR UNRULY CHILD. Sorry about your luck, life hands out tough ones sometimes and you will have to deal with it.Talk about needing some awareness. \u00a0I would love to be able to drop on my children off at this person's house for a weekend and see if he changes his mind about autism by Monday. \u00a0However, I like my children enough to not want to subject them to this idiot.\n\nHowever, people like this are really just an annoyance that parents of children with autism need to deal with. \u00a0I find that, for me, simply standing your ground and glaring back takes care of most of these people.\n\nUnfortunately, there are other times when awareness literally means the difference between life and death. \u00a0Such as this story out of Florida -\nLargo, Florida - Police called out to a domestic disturbance Thursday say they were forced to shoot and kill an 18-year-old man armed with a knife shortly after entering the apartment he shared with his mother.Nicholas Pesare had Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism, and difficulty with social interaction. His mother, Anne Polce, says she called officers hoping they would take him to a mental evaluation center for medication.

{"date": "Monday, July 11, 2011", "body": "\nAs I talked about last time, a new twin study entitled \"Genetic Heritability and Shared Environmental Factors Among Twin Pairs With Autism\" was published earlier this month. \u00a0Since this is probably going to be a memorable study, I thought I would go into exactly that it did and didn't show.\n\nFirst of all, the study and an accompanying editorial are open access so the full text is freely available. \u00a0If you are interested in the subject, I strongly suggest you go read both for yourself (see links at the bottom of this post).\n\nThe purpose of this study was to look at how common it is for identical and fraternal twins to both have autism. \u00a0The conventional wisdom up to this point has been that if one identical twin has autism the other is almost certain to have it while if one fraternal twin has autism the other has roughly the same risk as any other sibling.\n\nTo that end, researchers used the records from California's Department of Developmental Services (DDS) to identity all twins both between the years of 1987 and 2004 where at least one of the twins had a qualifying diagnosis of autism. \u00a0A qualifying diagnosis was either receiving services for autism, a code that indicated suspected autism, an actual diagnosis of autism, a code indicating intellectual disability of an unknown source, or another developmental disability.\n\nA set of twins was eligible to be included in this study if the mother lived in California at the time of birth, at least one of the parents could read and speak either Spanish or English, both twins were currently living in California, both twins had a mental age of at least 18 months, and there was no history in either twin of \"neurogenetic conditions that might account for autism\" (such as fragile x, down syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis).\n\nA total of 1,156 twin pairs met the these criteria. \n\nOf these twins, 384 could not be contacted, 330 declined to participant, and 10 pairs were ineligible (not sure why), leaving 432 pairs of twins. \u00a0Of these twins, 90 additional pairs declined to participate leaving 342 pairs (by my calculations at least, the study text has 333) that could have been evaluated in the study.\n\nIn the end, 202 out of the initial 1,156 twin pairs were evaluated. \u00a0Each twin was evaluated with both the ADOS and ADI-R to establish whether they had either a narrow form of autism (autism), a broad one (asd), or no form of autism. \u00a0These groupings would roughly correspond to classic autism (narrow) and pdd-nos and/or Aspergers (asd). \u00a0The criteria that were used to group the twins into these groups were pretty conservative. \u00a0In order to be included in either autism group both the ADOS and ADI-R had agree.\n\nAfter the evaluation, another 10 twin pairs were excluded because neither twin met the definition of even the broad form of autism. \u00a0This brings the total number down to 192 twins pairs. \n\nAs an aside, if you look in the supplemental material you can see that the majority of the twin pairs excluded (6 out of 10) had received services for \"full spectrum autism\" and another for \"suspected autism\". \u00a0The study doesn't say whether it was one or both twins that had the diagnosis, but the fact that at least some some of this children once had a diagnosis of autism but no longer is yet more confirmation that it is possible to loose the label.\n\nAlthough on the flip side, the researchers did diagnosis some of the twins with autism who did not have a diagnosis before. \u00a0Which shows that it is possible for autism to be missed even when another child in the family is one the spectrum.\n\nBut getting back to the study, each of the remaining 192 pairs of twins were genetically tested to determine whether they were identical (MZ) or fraternal (DZ) twins.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, MZ twins come from one fertilized egg that, for reasons unknown, splits into two organisms sometime in the first two weeks after fertilization. \u00a0Identical twins are, by definition, genetically identical - at least up until the point that they separate from each other. \u00a0DZ twins happen when two eggs are fertilized at the same time and are basically the same as siblings except that they are conceived and born at the same time.\n\nThere are a few other important differences between MZ and DZ twins to be aware of. \u00a0MZ twins normally share more prenatal resources (placenta and amniotic sacs) than DZ twins do. \u00a0MZ twins are basically random and happen in all races around the world in about 1 out of 250 pregnancies. \u00a0DZ twins, on the other hand, are strongly dependent on the mother's age, race, and family history. \u00a0The chance of having DZ twins goes up as the mother gets older and the rate of DZ twinning can vary pretty drastically depending on where you look. \n\nSo, out of the 192 sets of twins, 45 were found to be male-male identical twins, 9 female-female identical twins, 45 male-male fraternal twins, 13 female-female fraternal twins, and the last 80 were male-female fraternal twins.\n\nThe researchers then looked at how many of each twin pair either both had a narrow version of autism or a broad one in common. \u00a0The results were somewhat surprising. \u00a0The following numbers are in terms of how many of the twin pairs both had the condition (pairwise) rather than the more confusing notion of probandwise. \u00a0If you want to see the numbers the other way, look at table 2 in the study text.\n\nIn the male-male identical twins -\n42.5% both met both met the criteria for strict autism\n64.4% both met both met the criteria for broad autism\n\nIn female-female\u00a0identical\u00a0twins -\n42.9% both met both met the criteria for strict autism\n33.3% both met both met the criteria for broad autism\n\nIn male-male fraternal twins -\n12.9% both met both met the criteria for strict autism\n20.0% both met both met the criteria for broad autism\n\nIn female-female fraternal twins -\n20.0% both met both met the criteria for strict autism\n30.8% both met both met the criteria for broad autism\n\nIn male-female fraternal twins -\n3.6% both met both met the criteria for strict autism\n6.3% both met both met the criteria for broad autism\n\nThere are few notable things about these numbers.\n\nFirst, the concordance rate for male and female identical twins is lower than would be expected from other estimates in the past. \n\nSecond, the concordance rate for same sex fraternal twins is much higher than would be expected.\n\nThird, if you look at the difference between identical and fraternal female-female twins and compare that to the number for male-female fraternal twins, you will see something odd. \u00a0It looks like having a female co-twin instead of a male greatly increases your chance of having autism. \u00a0I could understand that happening with identical twins but I don't understand why fraternal twins have the same result. \u00a0This might just be a result of having a small number of female-female twins (22) but I am skeptical.\n\nFinally, the concordance between opposite sex fraternal twins should give us a good baseline of where typical siblings would fall using the same criteria. \u00a0It isn't an exact comparison because there are risk factors associated with twin births (maternal age, prenatal complications, premature birth) that have been shown to increase the risk of autism. \u00a0This range of concordance (3 to 6) agrees with other non-twin sibling results in the past.\n\nThe researchers used a variety of statistical models which took into account a number of different factors in an attempt to explain the results. \u00a0They also cross checked the twins who participated in the study against those who didn't to ensure that they didn't get a biased sample. \u00a0They found no glaring problem that they could see, so their conclusion, in their own words, was -\n\nThe results suggest that environmental factors common to twins explain about 55% of the liability to autism. Although genetic factors also play an important role, they are of substantially lower magnitude than estimates from prior twin studies of autism. \u00a0Nearly identical estimates emerged for ASD, suggesting that ASD presents the same liability spectrum as strict autism.\n\nOn in other words, the researchers think that their data shows that autism is more environmental than genetic. \u00a0This result is obviously at odds with what other twin studies have shown and some consider it to be controversial.\n\nNow, there are a few possible problems with the study. \n\nFirst, a substantial part of the twin population did not participant in this study. \u00a0It is possible that the twins that did participate were not representative of the entire twin population or that there was something different about the twins who did participant.\n\nSecond, the number of identical twins in the sample is rather small. \u00a0If there was any skewing in which twins participated, it could have been amplified by having only 54 identical twin pairs in the study. \u00a0On the other hand, not many other studies in the past have had even 54 confirmed sets of identical twins.\n\nThird, the study excluded known genetic causes of autism. \u00a0Doing so could have artificially lowered the number of identical twins who both had autism because both identical twins would presumably have the same genetic problem and could have raised the number fraternal twins who did so because, again presumably, fraternal twins who would not have been co-morbid for this other defect were excluded.\n\nFinally, it is possible that the results could be explained by some risk factor specific to twins. \u00a0All types of twins are more likely to have prenatal problems, be born premature, or have a lower birth weight. \u00a0All of these factors are thought to increase the risk of autism. \u00a0Fraternal twins are far more likely to be born to older mothers than either identical twins or non-twin siblings. \u00a0Older maternal age is also another risk for autism.\n\nHowever, if this were a major factor, I would have expected the concordance of opposite sex twin pairs to be much higher than it was. \u00a0This is the largest single group of twins included in the study and yet it has the lowest concordance.\n\nThere are a few strengths of the study as well.\n\nFirst, the twins included in this study were a sample drawn from a large population and should be more representative of twins in the general population than other studies in the past. \u00a0California's DDS is thought to serve the majority (greater than 80%) of children with autism in the state, so it is likely the initial sample included the majority of twins with autism born during the relevant period. \n\nSecond, each pair of twins included in the analysis were genetically tested to see whether they were identical or fraternal twins. \u00a0Other recent twin studies have either relied on parental reports or have used estimates to determine which twins were fraternal and which were identical. \u00a0Both of these methods suffer from serious flaws that could easily miscategorize identical twins as fraternal or fraternal twins as identical. \n\nThe only reliable way to tell the difference between the two types of twins is if they are the opposite sex or if they are genetically tested.\n\nFinally, this study used a far more rigorous and conservative way of determining which twins had autism than did past studies. \u00a0This may have caused the concordance numbers to be lower than they would under a broader definition, but if it did that would bump the numbers for the fraternal twins as well as the identical ones.\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty solid study that casts doubt on the idea that autism is primarily a genetic condition.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

{"date": "Friday, June 3, 2011", "body": "\nThe Autistic Self Advocacy Network, otherwise known as ASAN, has announced that they oppose renewing the Combating Autism Act. \u00a0For those of you who don't know, the Combating Autism Act (CAA) was passed in 2006 in response to the growing public health crisis of autism.\n\nThe purpose of the CAA was to -\nDevelop disabilities surveillance and research programs.\nCreate programs for autism education, early detection, and intervention.\nEstablish the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) to co-ordinate all of the efforts within the Department of Health and Human Services relating to autism.\nCreate two more Centers of Excellence on Autism.\nThe act authorized spending roughly 200 hundred million a year in these areas. \u00a0If you want a road map to what exactly the results of this act have been, you should look at the information provided on the IACC's web site. \n\nWhile there is always room for improvement, the Combating Autism Act has been beneficial for people with autism and their families. \u00a0It has brought much needed attention and funding to deal with the ever increasing problem that is autism.\n\nHowever, the CAA is reaching the end of its initial five year life span and needs to reauthorized by Congress for the programs it funds to continue. \u00a0The renewal of the act is currently before Congress and, perhaps surprisingly for some, ASAN has declared that they are against it being renewed. Their position, in the words of ASAN president Ari Ne'eman, is \u00a0-\nWhile we respect the good intentions of the co-sponsors and value their interest in autism legislation, passing a 3-year extension of the current unacceptable status quo would do real harm to Autistic people and our families. \u00a0This legislation would keep in place a status quo without services, without consideration of the needs of adults and without inclusion of self-advocates. We urge Members of Congress to oppose any long term extension without needed program reforms.In what amounts to a big F you to the majority of people on the autism spectrum and their families, ASAN is whining that because they don't get enough of the benefits from the CAA that no one should benefit. \n\nYet they are clearly missing the point that the CAA was not meant to fund adult services. \u00a0The purpose of the CAA was to do much needed basic research and to help set up screening, diagnosis, and intervention programs. \u00a0It was never about providing funding for adult services nor was it about having \"self-advocates\" dictate the direction of autism research. \u00a0I think it is better to leave those decisions to those actually qualified to make them - i.e. scientists and researchers.\n\nAlthough when it comes down to it, the idea that \"self-advocates\" are excluded from the process is absurd on its face. \u00a0Two out of the 11 public members of the IACC are \"self-advocates\" including Ari Ne'man, the head of ASAN. \u00a0They have almost the same representation on the committee that parents whose children have autism do. \n\nNo, their entire point basically boils down to the fact that because they don't control the agenda and that they don't get enough of the money that the whole thing should be scrapped. \u00a0As they did with the\u00a0wandering issue, ASAN has taken an ideological stance that is completely at odds with the needs of the majority of people who have autism.\n\nWhat ASAN should be doing is advocating for additional funding for adult services, not trying to\u00a0sabotage the funding for research and programs that will benefit everyone with autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//4.bp.blogspot.com/-Sj8eeXD6bCU/TA76cd_Fp8I/AAAAAAAAAPI/3VQB_xRrln8/s1600/fail.jpg", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=147", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combating_Autism_Act", "http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s109-843", "http://iacc.hhs.gov/", "http://iacc.hhs.gov/about/member-bios.shtml#public-members"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/06/asan-declares-opposition-to-autism.html", "title": "\nASAN Declares Opposition to Autism Research, Surveillance, Education, Early Detection, and Intervention\n"},

There has been substantial evidence for dysregulation of the immune system in autism.\nMethods:\u00a0We evaluated differences in the number and phenotype of circulating blood cells in young children with autism (n\u200a=\u200a70) compared with age-matched controls (n\u200a=\u200a35). Children with a confirmed diagnosis of autism (4-6 years of age) were further subdivided into low (IQ<68, n\u200a=\u200a35) or high functioning (IQ\u226568, n\u200a=\u200a35) groups. Age- and gender-matched typically developing children constituted the control group. Six hundred and forty four primary and secondary variables, including cell counts and the abundance of cell surface antigens, were assessed using microvolume laser scanning cytometry.\nResults:\u00a0There were multiple differences in immune cell populations between the autism and control groups. The absolute number of B cells per volume of blood was over 20% higher for children with autism and the absolute number of NK cells was about 40% higher. Neither of these variables showed significant difference between the low and high functioning autism groups. While the absolute number of T cells was not different across groups, a number of cellular activation markers, including HLA-DR and CD26 on T cells, and CD38 on B cells, were significantly higher in the autism group compared to controls.\nConclusions:\u00a0These results support previous findings that immune dysfunction may occur in some children with autism.

According to the Ms Wombles, that was an \"interesting choice\", an attempt \"bury it where no one will likely see it\", and wasn't an \"attempt at honest communication\".\n\nReally?\n\nI just had an exchange with two people on an older post from last year. \u00a0Should I say that the commenters were attempting to \"bury\" their comments where only I can see them? \u00a0Should I be hostile to them because they disagreed with with I said? \u00a0Or maybe I should write a big long rant about how they are unfortunate people who have been\u00a0\"misled by the atrocious misinformation\".\n\nOf course the answer to all of these questions is a resounding no. \u00a0These people were simply expressing their views about what I wrote in the place that I wrote it. \u00a0And there is absolutely no need to treat other people badly simply because they don't happen to agree with me. \u00a0Nor is there a need to imply that they are \"wrong\" and I am \"right\" or that they have \"misinformation\" while I have some sort of\u00a0monopoly on the correct information. \n\nIn fact, I actually welcome comments from people who don't agree with me. \u00a0I find that I can sometimes learn more from talking to people who disagree with me than with people who agree with me.\n\nIf I had to guess at Ms Wombles's intentions in writing what she did, I would say that she was attempting to intimidate Minority by pulling out a comment from an older thread and placing it front and center on her blog. \u00a0I'm guessing that she is trying an old teaching trick - public shame.\n\nSo Kim, here is your little bit of shame in return.\n\nMinority called you on your statement - in the appropriate place - and you responded with public ridicule because you didn't care for what they said.\u00a0 It really isn't nice to try to bully people into being quiet. \u00a0Don't you think you should apologize\u00a0for being such a meanie?\n\nOn a slightly more serious note, one of the comments on the shameful piece suggested that the recent attacks on the Ms Wombles have just been personal name-calling attacks that don't address the underlying issues. \u00a0But I'm going to go out on a limb here and disagree.\n\n(Well, I guess I can't disagree with the name-calling part since I did do a little bit of that - lets just call it \"venting\" instead, shall we?)\n\nWhat I disagree with is that my quarrel with Ms Wombles isn't about the issues. \u00a0This debate is certainly about an issue and the issue is character. \u00a0The autism world is chalk full of people like Ms Wombles who spend their time attacking and demeaning anyone who dares disagree with them and I for one have had enough of them.\n\n(Although, to be honest, there are far worse people out there than Ms Wombles. \u00a0One of them actually challenged me to a \"duel\" because of something that I wrote here. \u00a0Unfortunately, I didn't have a sword and they lived in France, so I had to decline.)\n\nBut I digress. \u00a0As I was saying, the issue is character. The issue is whether it is acceptable to stand on the sidelines when one member of the community tries to bully another. \u00a0As Ms Wombles so nicely put it, the issue is accountability after all.\n\nI think it is long past time that the autism community holds its members accountable for their actions.\n\nP.S. Kim, fourteen blogs, really? \u00a0Where do you find the time?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2011/05/when-minority-came-to-countering-anti.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2010/06/basic-information-on-intellectual.html?showComment=1277049326536#c5208241211680330788"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/05/jabberwocky-of-day-dont-comment-where-i.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Don't Comment Where I Said It\n"},

Children and adults with ASDs and other developmental disabilities are at higher risk of wandering off than are children and adults without these disorders or other cognitive disorders.\n\nAt the request of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, a Safety Subcommittee was convened to address wandering and other safety issues for children and adults with ASDs. CDC, as a member of the Subcommittee, submitted a proposal for the wandering code to the ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee for consideration at the March 2011 meeting, which represented the final opportunity for additions/revisions to the ICD-9-CM until 2014. As part of the Coordination and Maintenance Committee\u2019s usual procedures, proposals were open for public comment for 4 weeks, and revisions \u00a0to the ICD-9-CM were announced online on June 10, taking effect October 1.\n\nThis code is intended to capture information about individuals, with any condition classified in the ICD, who wander. Wandering was deleted as a subcode under the Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia code and added as a condition to be noted in association with disorders classified elsewhere [V40.31]. The intention is to provide a way to document, understand, and improve the situation for individuals who are at risk of injury or death due to dangerous wandering. Wandering should be coded if documented in the medical record by the provider (i.e., physician).\n\nThe wandering code is not linked to a specific diagnosis, nor is it part of the diagnostic codes used for autism or intellectual disabilities. The ICD-9-CM classifies behaviors and risk factors in addition to diseases and syndromes; as such, the wandering code is used in conjunction with other diagnostic and symptom or procedure codes.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://liveslosttoautism.blogspot.com/search/label/Wandering", "http://www.awaare.org/", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/code.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-wandering-code-approved.html", "title": "\nNew Wandering Code Approved\n"},

Although neural tube closure occurs within the first trimester, high doses of FA are given throughout pregnancy, the physiological consequences of which are unknown. FA can cause epigenetic modification of the cytosine residues in the CpG dinucleotide, thereby affecting gene expression. Dysregulation of crucial gene expression during gestational development may have lifelong adverse effects or lead to neurodevelopmental defects, such as autism. We have investigated the effect of FA supplementation on gene expression in lymphoblastoid cells by whole-genome expression microarrays. The results showed that high FA caused dysregulation by four-fold up or down to more than 1000 genes, including many imprinted genes. The aberrant expression of three genes (FMR1, GPR37L1, TSSK3) was confirmed by Western blot analyses. The level of altered gene expression changed in an FA concentration-dependent manner. We found significant dysregulation in gene expression at concentrations as low as 15ng/ml, a level that is lower than what has been achieved in the blood through FA fortification guidelines. We found evidence of aberrant promoter methylation in the CpG island of the TSSK3 gene. Excessive FA supplementation may require careful monitoring in women who are planning for, or are in the early stages of pregnancy. Aberrant expression of genes during early brain development may have an impact on behavioural characteristics.\n\nPMID: 21867686\nDOI: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.08.027\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21867686", "//www.blogger.com/dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.08.027"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/08/is-too-much-folic-acid-bad-thing.html", "title": "\nIs Too Much Folic Acid a Bad Thing?\n"},

Two reviewers independently assessed 35 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, meta-analysis was performed on five randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, and the quality of these trials was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist.\n\nResults \u00a0Nine studies measured melatonin or melatonin metabolites in ASD and all reported at least one abnormality, including an abnormal melatonin circadian rhythm in four studies, below average physiological levels of melatonin and/or melatonin derivates in seven studies, and a positive correlation between these levels and autistic behaviors in four studies. Five studies reported gene abnormalities that could contribute to decreased melatonin production or adversely affect melatonin receptor function in a small percentage of children with ASD. Six studies reported improved daytime behavior with melatonin use. Eighteen studies on melatonin treatment in ASD were identified; these studies reported improvements in sleep duration, sleep onset latency, and night-time awakenings. Five of these studies were randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies; two of the studies contained blended samples of children with ASD and other developmental disorders, but only data for children with ASD were used in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis found significant improvements with large effect sizes in sleep duration (73min compared with baseline, Hedge\u2019s g 1.97 [95% confidence interval {CI} CI 1.10\u20132.84], Glass\u2019s ? 1.54 [95% CI 0.64\u20132.44]; 44min compared with placebo, Hedge\u2019s g 1.07 [95% CI 0.49\u20131.65], Glass\u2019s ? 0.93 [95% CI 0.33\u20131.53]) and sleep onset latency (66min compared with baseline, Hedge\u2019s g-2.42 [95% CI -1.67 to -3.17], Glass\u2019s ?-2.18 [95% CI -1.58 to -2.76]; 39min compared with placebo, Hedge\u2019s g-2.46 [95% CI -1.96 to -2.98], Glass\u2019s ?-1.28 [95% CI -0.67 to -1.89]) but not in night-time awakenings. The effect size varied significantly across studies but funnel plots did not indicate publication bias. The reported side effects of melatonin were minimal to none. Some studies were affected by limitations, including small sample sizes and variability in the protocols that measured changes in sleep parameters.\n\nInterpretation \u00a0Melatonin administration in ASD is associated with improved sleep parameters, better daytime behavior, and minimal side effects. Additional studies of melatonin would be helpful to confirm and expand on these findings.\n\n\nReferences\n\nROSSIGNOL, D. A. and FRYE, R. E.

How ageing affects cognition in such individuals as they reach an age no longer consistent with parental care is unknown, lacking any published evidence, and there is a clear need to design cognitive and behavioural assessment tools appropriate to ageing in ASD individuals with disability, as was the case with respect to dementia as a whole. Although there is a growing body of evidence on pathological, imaging, neuropharmacological and other key brain abnormalities in ASD, these are, to date, confined to children and young (only rarely to middle aged) adults.I read this paragraph to mean that there in an increasing number of elderly people with autism and that there is currently a complete lack of understanding of what is going to be needed to deal with the problem.\n\nBut see the first sentence? \u00a0Let me highlight the interesting part \"With escalating numbers of ASD individuals with disability reaching old age\". \u00a0You wouldn't typically see the word \"escalating\" used to a condition that is stable. \u00a0Last time I checked, the word \"escalating\" implies that something is increasing.\n\nBut even if you took a more literal reading of the sentence and assumed that the authors meant that more individuals are \"reaching\" (think surviving) \u00a0to older age that still doesn't tell us that there are a large number of them already there. \u00a0If anything, more people with autism surviving to older age has to mean that the number is increasing.\n\nSo no matter how you read it, if a condition like autism is \"escalating\" that says that there are more cases - not a stable level of them. \u00a0And if there are more cases,\u00a0doesn't that mean that the increase of cases might be approaching an\u00a0epidemic?\n\nBut no, according to LBRB, the word \"escalating\" now means a stable level of adults with autism, \u00a0therefore\u00a0\"vaccines haven\u2019t caused an epidemic of autism because an epidemic of autism does not in fact exist.\"\n\nWait, were did the rate of autism in children and any data on vaccines come from?\n\nLets go back to that other study showing a stable level of autism in adults. \u00a0I haven't had a chance to get the study text yet but it looks like the same data that was put out over a year and a half ago. \u00a0I talked about it quite extensively back then and the long and short of it is that the result is somewhat flawed. \u00a0The data shows 19 adults who might have autism out of 7,461 (0.25 percent) and extrapolates that one percent of the population - a four fold increase. \u00a0Yet when you look carefully at how the extrapolation was done, I am not quite sure that it is valid. \u00a0I am sure that I will be writing about it in the future after I read the \"new\" research.\n\nThe funny part here is that LBRB presents this as some sort of new data. \u00a0I guess if you stare at the same thing over and over again, everything old becomes new again and the old new becomes \"clearer\".\n\nMoving along, LBRB attempts to split hairs in the war against the evil \"anti-vaccine\" fringe. \u00a0Consider the following two statements -\nvaccines can cause encephalopathy that causes autismand\nThe government has never compensated, nor has it ever been ordered to \u00a0compensate, any case based on a determination that autism was actually caused by \u00a0vaccines. We have compensated cases in which children exhibited an \u00a0encephalopathy, or general brain disease. Encephalopathy may be accompanied by a medical progression of an array of symptoms including autistic behavior, autism, or seizures.Some children who have been compensated for vaccine injuries may have shown signs of autism before the decision to compensate, or may ultimately end up with autism or autistic symptoms, but we do not track cases on this basis.To me, these statements are more or less equivalent. \u00a0The second may be much more nuanced and full of\u00a0weasel\u00a0words, but the theme is the same -\n\n1. A vaccine caused encephalopathy (brain damage).\n2. Encephalopathy is \"accompanied by\" autism.\n\nIn this context, \"accompanied\" has a very specific meaning, mainly -\nBe present or occur at the same time as (something else).\n- the illness is often accompanied by nauseaMost rational people would conclude that if brain damage is \"accompanied by\" a neurological condition like autism that there might just be a connection there. \u00a0I mean, after all, how much of a leap is it if there is damage to the brain and a condition that can be caused by abnormalities in the brain that there just might be a connection?\n\nIt isn't like you would say that one condition is \"accompanied by\" a second condition to mean that the second condition just appeared out of the blue and has no relation to the first.\n\nYet LBRB insists that that the \"can cause\" and \"may be accompanied by\" are quite different -\nWell, no, no its not. Lets look closley at the \u2018offending\u2019 paragraph:We have compensated cases in which children exhibited an encephalopathy, or general brain disease. Encephalopathy may be accompanied by a medical progression of an array of symptoms including autistic behavior, autism, or seizures.Quite clearly Bowman is saying that Encephalopathy may be accompanied by etc. A fact he goes on to clarify further in his next paragraph. How much clearer does it need to be?Ginger Taylor and David Kirby really have got to stop misrepresenting people in this way. It does their beliefs no justice.So remember, the next time that you have the flu \"accompanied by\" nausea, there is no relation between the flu and the nausea. \u00a0The flu appeared and then out of the blue the nausea appeared.\n\nYeah, right.\n\nAs for\u00a0misrepresenting\u00a0people,\u00a0I couldn't have said it better. LBRB's continued instance on playing word games does their cause no good. \u00a0It is hard to take anyone seriously who tries to redefine the English language to make their case. \n\nAlthough, former President Clinton would be proud.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2113/2831958539_45f0163628_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/zeke_/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/ageing-in-autism/", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.2711/abstract", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21536975", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/uk-research-places-huge-question-mark-over-the-autism-epidemic/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/ginger-taylor-misrepresents-david-bowman/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word", "//www.google.com/search?q=accompany#hl=en&q=accompany&tbs=dfn:1"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/05/jabberwocky-of-day-fun-with-words.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Fun With Words Edition\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2011", "body": "\nOne of the criticisms that has been leveled at the recent PBS Autism Now program is that it did not include an interview with a person who has autism. \u00a0While I somewhat understand and partially agree with the complaint, I don't think that the absence hurt the show that much.\n\nTo its credit, the show did have 4 children and one young adult with autism on the show. \u00a0The children were of different severities and not the just the extremely high functioning children that are typical on these types of shows. \u00a0The young adult also appeared to be moderate functioning and wasn't extremely disabled or enabled by his autism.\n\nThe children and young adult on the show did get a decent amount of camera time and the show did go to great lengths to demonstrate that people with autism function at all different levels. \u00a0They showed how some of the children can talk, others can kinda talk, and still others have almost no verbal communication and everyone had social issues. \n\nOf course, the third part of the autism - the so-called repetitive and restricted interests - was barely touched. \u00a0Which is a shame because it is this part of autism that causes the majority of the problems. \u00a0Or at least it is in many \"typical\" children with autism.\n\nRegardless, I think the point of the program was to show the middle of the spectrum. \u00a0There have been (many) programs that highlight the extremely high functioning but almost none that have looked at what the middle of the spectrum looks like. \u00a0Although for that matter, I don't think there have been any that give a serious look at what the extremely low end of the spectrum looks like either.\n\nThe show also appeared to focus of the majority of the autism population. \u00a0It seems to be commonly forgotten that the vast majority of all diagnosed autism cases are in children under the age of 21.\n\nSo when you put these ideas together the question is then who the show should have interviewed. \n\nYou would eliminate the extremely high functioning children and adults as they make up less than 10% of the autism population (and they already do more than 90% of the talking for people on the spectrum). \u00a0An added problem is that they are not very representative of the challenges faced by those who are in the middle (or lower) end of the spectrum. \n\nYou would eliminate older moderate adults because they weren't the focus (sorry, Jonathan) and because they are another minority in the overall population.\n\nYou would have to eliminate almost every lower functioning person - young and old - because they would likely not have enough communication skills or social skills to make the interview possible. \u00a0I might be wrong about the older people in this group but again, older people weren't the focus.\n\nAll of this is to say that the show would have likely wanted to interview young adults or children with either moderate autism or moderate pdd-nos. \u00a0They are the middle of the spectrum, the middle of the autism population, and what most people could be expected to be exposed to. \u00a0They would also have issues similar to those faced by many of the families whose children are on the spectrum.\n\nBut that lead me to a question that I don't know the answer to - how many of the children and young adults in this group have the functional communication skills and social skills that would be required for the interview? \u00a0Remember, when you are talking about classic autism or pdd-now, then you are talking about a condition that disrupts the functional use of language in addition to the social use of language.\n\nThat point bears repeating because I think it gets overlooked frequently. \u00a0All children with classical autism start out with a disruption in functional communication. \u00a0I would guess that most children with pdd-nos also have a disruption in functional communication. \u00a0If they didn't, they would more likely have a label of Asperger's rather than pdd-nos. \n\nIt is a assumption (right or wrong) that most children on the spectrum will be able to learn these missing skills as they get older. \u00a0But how old do these children have to be before they could be expected to have the functional use of language and the social skills that would be required for the interview?\n\nI have never been able to find any solid numbers in this area. \u00a0Although, to be honest, since two of my daughters are only partially verbal I haven't really wanted to know what the numbers look like.\n\nA page on the CDC's site suggests that 40% of children with all forms of autism do not talk at all. \u00a0The recent data on wandering in autism suggests that at least 30% of children with autism can't communicate well enough to answer basic questions like \"what is your name\".\n\nSo if an estimated 35% (estimated) of the \"bottom\" of the spectrum can't really speak, how high on the spectrum do you have to go to find a child who can not only talk but also has the social skills required for the interview? \u00a0How high do you have to go before you would be able to find someone who is able to express abstract ideas about how autism effects their life?\n\nOf course, as the saying goes, if you have seen one person with autism then you have seen one person with autism. \u00a0There is a huge variety in the impairments seen in people with autism. \u00a0It is entirely possible that there are plenty of of young adults in the middle of the spectrum that have both the communication skills and social skills for an interview like this. \n\nAlthough it has been my experience that for every area with less impairment there are an equal number of areas with a higher degree of impairment. \u00a0So there might well be many children with the communication and social skills with much more severe behaviors that would prevent the interview.\n\nI don't have any of the answers to these questions but I thought it was interesting to consider. \u00a0So let me ask you. \u00a0Do you think it would be easy to find a child or young adult with moderate autism who would be able to speak for the middle of the spectrum?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=137", "http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/04/speaking-for-autism.html", "title": "\nSpeaking for Autism\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 17, 2011", "body": "\nA new clinical trial was announced was announced earlier this month that is looking at the relationship between low cholesterol levels and autism. \u00a0According to the press release -\nResearchers at The Ohio State University Medical Center are studying whether simple nutritional intervention \u2013 adding cholesterol to the diets of children with autism spectrum disorders after a test to see if they need it \u2013 can improve core autism symptoms.In excess, cholesterol can be harmful, but a certain amount is crucial for the proper development and maintenance of the brain. So it stands to reason that lower levels of cholesterol, particularly during crucial periods of growth, can lead to mental dysfunction, said principal investigator Dr. L. Eugene Arnold, a child psychiatrist at Ohio State\u2019s Nisonger Center who specializes in researching and treating autism.(read the rest at the link above)Full details on the trial are available from the U.S. National Institute of Health's clinic trial website, but the general idea is as follows. \nFind out how many children with autism have extremely low total\u00a0cholesterol. \u00a0Low cholesterol in this context will\u00a0probably\u00a0mean less than 120.\nSee if there are unique characteristics of these individuals that set them apart from with other children with autism who have normal cholesterol.\nTest whether giving dietary cholesterol supplements will improve \"behavioral and other characteristics\" in these individuals.\nThe main part of the study is going to be a 12 week\u00a0randomized and placebo controlled trial of 60 children immediately followed by a 12 week open-label trial in the same children.\n\nThis seems to be a well designed study but I do have one concern - what will be considered an \"improvement\"?\u00a0\u00a0Is successfully raising the child's cholesterol level back into a normal range going to be considered an improvement or do there have to be clinical significant behavioral improvements to go along with it? \u00a0The details provided on the NIH's site don't make that clear.\n\nThis may seem like a small point but it really isn't - dietary supplements aren't the same things as drugs. \u00a0They don't tend to have large, immediate effects nor do they work as quickly as drugs do. \u00a0The supplement may succeed in raising the cholesterol level in these children but will that translate into\u00a0noticeable\u00a0changes in behavior in such a short time period? \n\nRemember, almost all of the tests that look at autism look solely at behaviors. \u00a0Behaviors are - even in autism - things that are learned. So even if you take out the underlying cause of the behaviors it will take time and effort to unlearn the behaviors.\n\nBut more than that, if cholesterol is important for normal development, it might be that the\u00a0absence\u00a0of cholesterol during certain periods that impairs normal development. \u00a0Simply giving cholesterol isn't going to repair or fix the things that didn't develop properly. \u00a0But maintaining a healthy level of cholesterol might prevent other things from going wrong in the future.\n\nRegardless, it is good to see these sorts of trials being done. \u00a0I believe that there are many children with autism who will benefit from taking a more biological approach to treating autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/-2r1CXsJH4Vk/TasJz0pBgfI/AAAAAAAAAVY/O8heeieBnkY/s1600/cholesterol.png", "http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/mediaroom/Pages/release.aspx?newsID=6479", "http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00965068", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-label_trial"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/04/studing-low-cholesterol-in-autism.html", "title": "\nStudying Low Cholesterol in Autism\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 9, 2011", "body": "\nThere is a rumor that I have been hearing about autism almost since the day it entered our lives five years ago. \u00a0I have heard this rumor being whispered in the background whenever rational people gather to discuss autism. \u00a0 I have seen hints of it in every new bit of research and every new strategy for helping children with autism. \u00a0The rumor is this -\n\nRecovery from autism is possible.\n\nThe other day I actually came face to face with the rumor. \u00a0For the first time, I met a child who had been \"recovered\" from autism. \u00a0The exact details of the case are irrelevant but, suffice it to say, there was enough overlap in the path that this child travelled and our own that I am convinced of two things. \n\nFirst, this child really did have a diagnosis of autism and not high functioning autism or Aspergers. \u00a0And second, even after several hours of watching this child in a social setting and knowing that they had a diagnosis, I couldn't see even the smallest hint of their autism. \n\nWhile I don't know what exactly \"recovered\" the child - whether it was biomedical treatments, dietary restrictions, behavioral therapy, or something else completely different - I don't think it really matters. \n\nWhat matters is that this child's parents took the initiative and provided the extra help that the child needed. \u00a0What matters is that the child's hard work payed off. \u00a0I mean, lets be honest, if autism is hard on the parents, it is doubly hard on the child. \u00a0As parents we can only provide extra help, it is up to the child to do the really hard work of actually learning to overcome autism. \n\nIn this case, with this particular child, the combination of treatments and the child's hard work payed off. \u00a0The child overcame the disabling aspects of their autism. \u00a0So I beginning to think the rumor might not just be a rumor after all.\n\nRecovery from autism is possible.\n\nSadly enough, in some parts of the autism world saying those words is like throwing down the gauntlet. \u00a0You even suggest that your child needs to be \"recovered\" and you will be told, in no uncertain terms, that there is no need of recovery because there is nothing wrong with them. \u00a0You will be told that that the problem isn't autism but rather how society responds to autism. \n\nIf you are particularly lucky, you will have the pleasure of having someone tell you that you are the problem. \u00a0You might be told that the problem is that you don't accept and love your child for who they are. \u00a0I wish I were making this last bit up, but unfortunately I'm not. \u00a0I have been on the receiving end of this nonsense on several occasions and I have seen other parents attacked in this fashion many times.\n\nSo, for the record, to everybody who thinks that trying to help your child recover from a debilitating condition like autism is tantamount to rejecting your child (this means you Amy Caraballo), I have one thing to say to you -\n\nGo to hell and take your stupidity with you.\n\nThis idea that recovery from autism is bad is predicated on the idea that autism is a fundamental part of a person and that to \"recover\" a person from autism you would have to make them something other than they are. \u00a0So by wanting to \"change\" a fundamental part of who a person is, you are saying that you don't accept the person for who they are. \u00a0If you don't accept your child then you consider them an inconvenience and you don't love them.\n\nIf you couldn't have guessed by now, I don't agree at all with that idea. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I am completely for having society be more accepting of people with autism. \u00a0Society isn't very accepting of people who are different and there is a lot of work to be done to make it so that people with autism aren't automatically ostracized. \n\nBut I don't think that blaming society for an individual's difficulties is a particularly useful approach. \u00a0Autism can be a debilitating condition and it is one that needs to be addressed at the individual level. \u00a0Society doesn't stop a person from being able to communicate nor does it create the non-functional\u00a0rituals and\u00a0obsessions that are the hallmark's of autism. While it may\u00a0make it harder for a person with autism to socialize, it doesn't create the underlying social\u00a0awkwardness in the first place. \n\nThese issues are caused by autism and are going to exist whether or not anyone \"accepts\" them or not.\u00a0\u00a0So to help a person with autism, you have to attempt to find an individual solution to that person's specific\u00a0difficulties. \u00a0If you do that then you too may be able to help your loved one recover from their autism.\n\nWe have not reached that point yet with our children but I hope that someday we will.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/03/recovery-from-autism.html", "title": "\nRecovery from Autism\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 15, 2011", "body": "\nI don't like conspiracy theories. \u00a0I don't like wasting my time thinking that a group of people are secretly conspiring to pull something over on the rest of us. \u00a0It has been my experience that, most of the time, the conspiracy is nothing more than a figment of someone's imagination.\n\nBut, I do know that people are not always completely forthcoming with the truth. \u00a0I know that backroom deals happen all of the time for the benefit of those involved and the details of these deals are rarely made public.\n\nI am also acutely aware that money corrupts and that if one group gives a good amount of money to a second group that first group has significant power over the second. \u00a0Money buys access, favors, and above all, leverage over the recipient.\n\nWhen it comes to published science, money is very problematic. \u00a0I don't think it is any secret that when research is sponsored by a company, it tends to be more favorable to that company than independent research. \u00a0And then there are the (hopefully rare) cases when a company goes completely over the line and then we get ghost-written studies\u00a0and entire journals that are fake.\n\nBut this is the stuff that conspiracy theories are made of. \u00a0What happens is that you have a company that appears to have bought some research to improve its bottom line. \u00a0The parties involved try and hide the details of the transaction but eventually they get caught and the affair is made public. \n\nHopefully at that point the parties are at least honest and admit to the affair (although I know that doesn't always happen) but the damage is done - our trust in the parties involved has been eroded. \u00a0The conspiracy has been started and we start having to constantly ask ourselves what else \"they\" aren't telling us. \u00a0And the next time that something gets published that involves these parties we have to ask ourselves if they are being completely honest with us.\n\nNow, there are a few ways to deal with this problem. \u00a0The best way is for researchers and scientific publications to not accept any money from companies who could have an interest in the results. \u00a0But we all know that isn't going to happen.\n\nA second way is to always be completely forthright about any financial arrangements between the researchers and publication and companies. \u00a0This doesn't get rid of the conflict but it at least gets it out into the open and defuses the conspiracy aspect. \u00a0But for this process the work, the disclosure has to be there from the start. \u00a0It doesn't work if you only admit to it after the fact.\n\nHaving said all of that, I think that the major journals are well aware of this problem and go to great lengths to even avoid the appearance of impropriety. \u00a0So imagine my shock when the BMJ was called out recently for failing to disclose a financial relationship with Merck in their recent pieces calling the ex-doctor Wakefield a fraud.\n\nThe problem is this. \u00a0A group of, ahem, interested parties combed through the records of the BMJ and found that they had a substantial financial relationship with Merck. \u00a0This group publicly called the BMJ on the lack of disclosure in the Wakefield articles, the journal responded with a resounding \"whoops\" -\nAlthough Vera's claims may seem far fetched on this occasion, she is right that we should have declared the BMJ Group's income from Merck as a competing interest to the editorial (and the two editor's choice articles) that accompanied Brian Deer's series on the Secrets of the MMR scare.[2] [3] [4] We should also, as you say, have declared the group's income from GSK as a competing interest in relation to these articles. We will publish clarifications.We didn't declare these competing interests because it didn't occur to us to do so. We saw this series not as pro-MMR vaccine or pro- vaccination in general, but as against fraud and corruption in medical research.Go read the entire response from the BMJ, it is quite interesting. \u00a0The fact \u00a0that\u00a0an article about\u00a0\"corruption in medical research\" failed to disclose a significant potential conflict of interest is ironic, to say the least.\n\nThere are at least two ways that you could look at this situation. \u00a0The first is that the journal made an honest mistake and came clean when called on it. \u00a0And if this were another situation, that would be exactly the way that I would look at this. \n\nBut in the case, the journal was already on shaky ground. \u00a0Remember, this series of articles was commissioned and paid for by the journal. \u00a0The journal went out and hired a journalist - not a scientist or researcher - and paid him to write these articles. \u00a0And it wasn't just any journalist either - they hired Brian Deer who has made it his mission in life to hound Wakefield. \u00a0More importantly, these articles weren't the typical peer-reviewed articles that a journal would be expected to publish. \u00a0These articles were written with the explicit purpose of attacking a researcher and calling them a fraud.\n\nGiven all of this, I would have expected that the journal would have gone well out of their way to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. \u00a0After all, if you are going to call out someone else's misbehavior, you had best not be guilty of the same.\n\nBut they didn't.\n\nSo then we are left with the facts that the journal commissioned a paid attack on a researcher and that the journal had undisclosed financial ties to companies that have a vested interest in seeing this line of inquiry shut down. \u00a0And when you add in the idea that children are the victims of this potential collusion, what you are left with is a very powerful narrative.\n\nI don't know whether the corporate sponsorship that the BMJ received in any way influenced the decision to commission and publish these articles on Wakefield. \u00a0I want to think that it didn't, \u00a0but the sad truth is that there is no way to know for certain if it did or didn't. \u00a0The potential for bias is there and the journal dropped the ball and made it look like they were trying to pull a fast one.\n\nA new conspiracy is born.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2fOrQSFlK7U/TYAgPr5R98I/AAAAAAAAAVQ/rhXDdU7b0dM/s1600/spy.jpg", "http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ghostwriter-science-industry", "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Drugs/story?id=7577646&page=1", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/02/mercks-medical-media-empire.html", "http://www.ahrp.org/cms/content/view/766/9/", "http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d1335.full/reply#bmj_el_251470"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/03/bmj-opens-door-to-conspiracy-theories.html", "title": "\nBMJ Opens the Door to Conspiracy Theories\n"},

There is a growing body of evidence from epidemiology linking exposure to nutritional deprivation and increased risk of schizophrenia. Based on studies from the Netherlands and China, those exposed to macronutrient deficiencies during famine have an increased risk of schizophrenia. With respect to micronutrients, we focus on 3 candidates where there is biological plausibility for a role in this disorder and at least 1 study of an association with schizophrenia. These nutrients include vitamin D, folic acid, and iron. While the current evidence is incomplete, we discuss the potential implications of these findings for the prevention of schizophrenia. We argue that schizophrenia can draw inspiration from public health interventions related to prenatal nutrition and other outcomes and speculate on relevant factors that bear on the nature, risks, impact, and logistics of various nutritional strategies that may be employed to prevent this disorder.Full TextThe idea that correcting nutriental deficiencies can help a person with a mental disorder is actually common in the bio-medical part the autism community. \u00a0This journal article takes it one step further and suggests that a mental disorder - in this case schizophrenia - might be able to be prevented by correcting these deficiencies.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/37/2/272.full"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/04/dietary-change-to-prevent-schizophrenia.html", "title": "\nDietary Change to Prevent Schizophrenia\n"},

It took up a while to pick up on what was going on, but for several months we thought that they might be deaf.\n\nAs a matter of fact, after they failed two hearing tests, there were several audiologists who also thought that they might be deaf. \u00a0It took a procedure known as an auditory brainstem response (ABR) to establish the fact that they were still physically able to hear. \u00a0I suspect that this abnormal processing of sound is a large part of the reason that their ability to understand speech and to talk is still very limited to this day.\n\nNow, let me be clear, I don't think that this illness or the vaccines \"caused\" their autism - I believe that they would have still developed autism like their younger sister did. \u00a0But I do believe that this illness made their autism worse than it would have been otherwise. \n\nSince this time we have learned a few little facts. \u00a0Like the fact that a flu shot hasn't been shown to be effective in children under the age of two. \u00a0Like the fact that thimerosal - which was in the flu shots - probably isn't the best thing to give to very young children. \u00a0Or like the fact that you really shouldn't give any vaccine to a child who is sick and on antibiotics.\n\nI have also learned more about how the body works and how seemingly unrelated systems can interact. \u00a0Such as how problems with energy metabolism can be made worse by an abnormal immune system reaction. \u00a0Did I ever mention that the twins have documented problems with immune disregulation and suspected problems with processing creatine?\n\nDo you know what can happen to a one year old who, under the best conditions, have problems with an overactive immune system and processing energy, add in the extra stress of rotovirus, a nasty cold/flu, and an ear inflection, and then further stress them out by injecting weakened forms of four major childhood illnesses at once with an adjuvant designed to kick the immune system into high gear? \u00a0For good measure add an undiagnosed food intolerance to milk, deficiencies in basic nutrients such a iron and zinc (most likely caused by the food intolerance), and the\u00a0GI problems caused by an oral antibiotic and you might just get the perfect storm.\n\nIts no wonder that they looked miserable.\n\nI don't know if we could have down anything differently with the twins. \u00a0Perhaps if we had, they might be more like their youngest sister. \u00a0Baby C never had a period of illness like this and never had any sort of regression. \u00a0She still gets her vaccines but we slowed them down and spaced them out more. \u00a0She never gets them when she is sick and we never give her more than two at once\n\nSo now, five years after the twins regressed, we are still trying to figure out what happened and what we can do to help all three girls. \u00a0I know that science has exonerated vaccines from having anything to do with autism but, and this is the important part, science deals with overall trend and large groups of people. \u00a0Large studies are good at detecting overall trends but can't necessarily tell you what happened with an individual child. \n\nSo even though I know, understand, and accept the fact that - for the majority of children - vaccines are perfectly safe and that I know that my children would still have autism without the vaccines, I still have my doubts. \u00a0Maybe there are other children out there who, like my twins, simply couldn't tolerate what they were given at the exact moment it was given.\n\nWho knows, maybe I\u00a0am completely wrong about this entire sequence of events and the regression would have happened regardless of what we did. \u00a0But that is unknowable and all I can go on is what seems to be the sequence of events. \u00a0All I know is that the two\u00a0separate children reacted the same way to the same events at the same time and there appears to be a correlation in spite of all of the science saying that there should be none.\n\nBut,\u00a0as I said at the start, correlation isn't causation.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/01/two-years-of-autism-jabberwocky.html", "title": "\nTwo Years of Autism Jabberwocky\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 11, 2011", "body": "\nIn case you haven't heard, ex-doctor Wakefield now stands acused of being a fraud by the British medical journal BMJ. \u00a0In a scathing article and\u00a0accompanying\u00a0editorial, the journal says, in no uncertain terms, that Wakefield not only acted unethically but also intentionally fabricated data in his now infamous study -\nDeer unearthed clear evidence of falsification. He found that not one of the 12 cases reported in the 1998 Lancet paper was free of misrepresentation or undisclosed alteration, and that in no single case could the medical records be fully reconciled with the descriptions, diagnoses, or histories published in the journal.\u00a0Who perpetrated this fraud? There is no doubt that it was Wakefield. Is it possible that he was wrong, but not dishonest: that he was so incompetent that he was unable to fairly describe the project, or to report even one of the 12 children\u2019s cases accurately? No. A great deal of thought and effort must have gone into drafting the paper to achieve the results he wanted: the discrepancies all led in one direction; misreporting was gross.These are extremely serious charges for the editor of a prestigious medical journal to be making. \u00a0If Wakefield's career wasn't already in the\u00a0toilet, it would certainly be put in jeopardy by this. \u00a0So I would expect that, given the extremely serious nature of the charges, the journal would have rock solid data to back up its allegations. \u00a0You don't accuse someone of intentionally manipulating data without being sure that you are correct. \u00a0And you don't do it using an editorial in a major journal without being very, very sure.\n\nOr at least I thought that was would be the case. \u00a0But after reading the editorial and the article, I have my doubts. \u00a0As far as I can tell, none of the charges are anything new nor is there any new substance behind the allegations. \u00a0So I really have to wonder what the point of the whole thing is.\n\nI am not defending Wakefield here (I repeat - I am not defending Wakefield) but I have to say that that this looks like just yet another attack on Wakefield by Brian Deer. \u00a0Brian Deer has been making these charges for years now and I strongly suspect that if there was enough evidence to make the fraud accusations stick that it would have been brought up at the GMC hearing. \u00a0I am sure the GMC would have loved to say that Wakefield committed fraud in addition to acting dishonestly and irresponsibly.\n\nWhich brings me to my real question - why did the BMJ pay Brian Deer to write yet another attack on Wakefield?\n\nI could see a journal like the BMJ publishing a review written by researchers or doctors but I don't understand bringing in a journalist to write the piece - especially Brian Deer. \u00a0He is not what you would call an unbiased party. \u00a0Published papers are supposed to be unbiased, factual affairs - not the same sort of sensationalism that you would find in the Sunday paper. \u00a0But if you read the article it looks like something you would see in the newspaper, attempts at footnoting notwithstanding. \n\nAs a side note,\u00a0I have to wonder if this is the first time that the BMJ has published a \"peer-reviewed\" article, like this one is supposed to be, that cited newspaper articles as an authority. \u00a0Articles which were also written by Brian Deer, I might add. \u00a0Since the newspaper articles were used to support the claims of the article, were the referenced articles peer reviewed as well? \u00a0And how exactly does citing your own newspaper article work? \u00a0As you can see, I said the exact same thing over there, and my peer, the editor, agreed with me, therefore it must be true....\n\nOne of the other things that really bothers me about this article is that Brian Deer appears to have the medical records of the children from the Wakefield study (he basically said as much last year). \u00a0It is one thing for him to have these records - presumably without the consent of the children's parents - that fact alone is bad enough (and possibly illegal, at least in the US). \u00a0It is something altogether different if those records were used to publish an article in the BMJ without the proper consent. \u00a0That would be a major problem for the journal as well - especially if the journal itself was the one that commissioned and paid for the article.\n\nWhich brings me to the next problem, the matter of payment.\u00a0\u00a0Brian Deer said to CNN that he was paid to write this article -\nOn CNN's \"American Morning\" Thursday, Deer did not deny he was paid by the BMJ. \"I was commissioned by BMJ to write the piece,\" he said. \"That's what journalists do.\"And yet, if you look in the competing interests section from the article it makes no mention of this fact -\nCompeting interests: The author has completed the unified competing interest form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf (available on request from him) and declares no support from any organisation for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organisation that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three yearsHe claims to have not received any support from any organization for the article. \u00a0I would consider being paid for writing the article a form of support. \u00a0The only hint that in either the editorial or the article that Deer might have been paid is under the\u00a0competing interest section of the article where it says -\nProvenance and peer review: Commissioned; externally peer reviewed.But that one word is a poor\u00a0substitute\u00a0for a real disclaimer. \u00a0If Brian Deer was paid to write these articles then he should have disclosed that fact appropriately. \u00a0His failure to do so is especially ironic considering that the failing to disclose relevant financial information was one of Wakefield's sins.\n\nAs I said above, I really have to wonder why these articles were written. \u00a0All of these things about Wakfield have been said before - mostly by Brian Deer - and there is nothing new here except the forum. \u00a0I don't believe in conspiracy theories but I can't that I can think of any reason why this newspaper article was publish in the BMJ. \u00a0It just doesn't make any sense.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full", "http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full", "http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/06/autism.vaccines/index.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/01/bmj-and-brian-deer.html", "title": "\nThe BMJ and Brian Deer\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, May 17, 2011", "body": "\nIn a recent Medscape article, Dr Paul Offit is quoted as putting forth the following idea on autism -\nDr. Offit said the study authors reach erroneous conclusions due to an erroneous definition of autism. A child with measles encephalopathy, he said, may have severe cognitive deficits that fall into the autism spectrum, but such symptoms themselves do not necessarily translate into a diagnosis of autism.\u00a0The good doctor is of course talking about the recent paper that purports to show that\u00a0autism might be more common in\u00a0children\u00a0compensated\u00a0by the the so-called vaccine court than in the general population. \u00a0While I don't yet have much of an opinion on the paper, I do know that Dr. Offit's statement is just plain wrong.\n\nFirst and foremost, a diagnosis of autism is based solely on the presence or absence of behaviors. \u00a0If you have enough of the behaviors of autism then you have autism, if you don't then you don't.\u00a0 There is absolutely nothing in the definition that says anything about the underlying causes of the behaviors. \u00a0It is factually inaccurate to say that \"severe cognitive deficits that fall into the autism spectrum\" aren't autism. \u00a0Autism is autism - regardless of the cause.\n\nSecond, the authors in the paper actually used a validated autism screening test called the\u00a0Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) with twenty-two of the children that they found. \u00a0While the test cannot\u00a0definitively\u00a0show that a person has a diagnosis of autism, it is certainly not an \"erroneous definition of autism\". \u00a0As a matter of fact, there are a quite a few research studies that have used the SCQ to help identify cases of autism\n\nThe problem is that Dr Offit has painted himself into a corner in regards to autism and vaccines. \u00a0He regularly says things such as\u00a0\"This hypothesis has been tested thoroughly. The question has been asked and answered.\", as he did in this story. \u00a0He has written several books on the subject, all of which basically say the same thing - no relation between autism and vaccines. \n\nI don't think he is now able to admit, either to himself or\u00a0publicly, that he might have been wrong. \u00a0Instead he has to come up with non-autistic forms of autism and spends his time \"defending\" his idea against anyone who questions it.\n\nThis is precisely the reason why there is no such thing as an \"asked and answered\" question in science. \u00a0Once you have decided that you already have the answer you stop listening to what everybody else is saying.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/742471", "http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pelr/vol28/iss2/6/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17885574"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/05/dr-offit-on-definition-of-autism.html", "title": "\nDr. Offit on the Definition of Autism\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 16, 2011", "body": "\nI want to talk about the recent study that estimated that the prevalence of autism in South Korea was 2.6 percent because I think that is a very interesting result. \u00a0But to set the state for that discussion, I think I first need to talk about screening tests for autism and the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) that was used in the study.\n\nIn general, the purpose of a screening test is separate out which individuals in a group of people are likely to have a condition from those that are not. \u00a0In a perfect world, a screening test would only select those individuals that have a condition while not selecting those individuals who do not have a condition. \n\nThese concepts are formally called sensitivity and specificity. \u00a0The sensitivity of a test tells you have good of a job the test does at finding the people who have the condition while the specificity tells you how good of a job the the test does at telling you which people don't have the condition.\n\nIn an ideal world, you would want a test to identify every person that has a condition (sensitivity of 100%) and exclude every person who doesn't (specificity\u00a0of 100%). \u00a0But, in the real world, tests are never that accurate and we have to make do with what we can get.\n\nWhat normally happens is that the people who develop the screening test take the time to test it against a real population. \u00a0They will give the screen to a (hopefully) large group of people and see what the scores look like for those that have the condition compared to those that don't. \u00a0They will use that data to come up with what is known as a cut-off score. \u00a0This score is just a magic number were the sensitivity and\u00a0specificity\u00a0of a test have been maximized.\n\nOr in simple terms, the cut-off score is where the test picks up the higher number of people with the condition while excluding the most people without it. \u00a0I think it is worth noting that even below the cut-off score it is still possible to have the condition.\n\nA secondary point, one that is often overlooked, is that a screening test should filter out individuals who have other, similar conditions. \u00a0This concept is tied up in the idea of sensitivity and specificity but is often not tested directly. \n\nFor example, if you look at the literature for the Autism Quotient (AQ), you will find that it has somewhat decent properties. \u00a0However, if you you give the AQ to people with schizophrenia - a population that was not necessarily included in the initial validity studies - you would see that the AQ has a hard time telling whether a person has schizophrenia or autism. \u00a0Hence, while the AQ might be decent at finding people with autism, it is also good at finding people with schizophrenia.\n\nThat might seem like a small point but if you have conditions where one is much more common than the others, it can make all of of the difference in the world in what your screening test picks up.\n\nWith that in mind, lets look at the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). \u00a0I want to cover the properties of this test because it was the screening test used in the South Korea study. \n\nThe ASSQ is a 27 question test meant to detect \"autistic disorders\" in \"high-functioning\" children, particularly Asperger syndrome. \u00a0Eleven of the questions have to do with social interactive, six cover communication problems, while 5 deal with restricted and repetitive behaviors. \u00a0Each question has three possible answers - No, Somewhat, and Yes - and each question has a score from 0 to 2 - 0 indicates \"normality\", 1 is \"some abnormality\", and 2 is \"definite abnormality\". \u00a0So the range of possible total scores is from 0 to 54.\n\nIf you want to see the actual questions on the test you can see them here, starting on page 11 in the document. \u00a0I don't want to comment on the test questions, but really, are the questions \"is old-fashioned or precocious\" and \"is regarded as an eccentric professor by the other children\" indicative of autism? \u00a0Anyways.\n\nThe real question, problems with the questions aside, is how good of a job that this screening test does. \u00a0It is one thing to question the questions (pun intended) but it another to talk about how good the test is. \n\nUnfortunately, the answer is somewhat mixed. \u00a0The ASSQ is designated to be given to both parents and teachers and the results for the different groups are different.\n\nIf you look at the initial study for the screen (total of 109 people in the study), you would see that the a parental cut-off scope of 15 would yield a \"true positive rate\" of 76% and a \"false positive rate\" of 19%. \u00a0A teacher cut-off of 11 would yield a \"true positive rate\" of 90% and a \"false positive rate\" of 42%.\n\nOr, in other words, assuming that you had a group of 1,000 children and 1% of the them had autism (10 out of 1,000), the parent test with a cut-off of 15 would correctly identify 8 of the 10 while misidentifying 188. \u00a0The teacher test would find 9 of the 10 while misidentifying 415.\n\nLater studies in larger groups of children found somewhat different results. \u00a0In one (4,408 children), the authors found that a combined parental and teacher cut-off score of 30 or a teacher score of 22 is best, saying that -\n\u00a0A valid cut-off for parents' single score could not been estimated. The clinicians are reminded that the ASSQ is a screening instrument, not a diagnosing instrument. The importance of using both parents' and teachers' ratings for screening in clinical settings is underlined.While in another study (9,430 children), the authors suggested that a combined parent and teacher score of 17 or greater lead to a sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.86. \u00a0Using the above assumptions, that would mean that the test would find 9 of the ten people with autism while saying that 139 had autism who didn't.\n\nThe take away here is that with the ASSQ, using somewhat typical cut-off scores, a \"positive\" screen on the test translates into roughly a 5% chance of actually having autism and a 10% chance of missing someone who actually does have autism. \u00a0As the cut-off score gets lower, the change of missing someone with autism is decreased (better\u00a0sensitivity) while the chance of including people who don't autism increases (worse\u00a0sensitivity).\n\nHowever, as I mentioned above, you have to watch out for other conditions that are also going to screen as \"positive\" on the test. \u00a0One such condition that the ASSQ has trouble with is ADD/ADHD. \u00a0This condition was included in the initial study plus a few other ones that I found.\n\nIn the initial study, the ADD group had a mean parental score of about 10 and a mean teacher score of about 12. \u00a0The autism group had a mean of about 22 on the parent score and 25 on the teacher report. \u00a0So if the respective cut-offs are placed high enough, the test should be able to distinguish between autism and ADD.\n\nHowever, over results suggest that the difference between the two groups might not be as pronounced. One result suggested that only the social part of the ASSQ was different in autism and ADHD -\nThe ASSQ scores of the PDD group and the ADHD group were significantly higher than the control group. Furthermore, the PDD group scored higher than the ADHD group. Both groups also showed higher scores than the control group in all three domains, that is, restricted and repetitive behavior, social interaction, and communication problem. The PDD and the ADHD group showed no significant difference in the domains of communication problem, and restricted and repetitive behavior. The PDD group had a higher score than the ADHD group only in the social interaction domain.Another result also showed that the mean scores of a modified ASSQ \u00a0for children with ADHD was 24 while the PDD group was 31. \u00a0Scaling\u00a0those values back to the original test ranges would yield a mean of 16 and 21, respectively.\n\nSo an open question for me is how well the ASSQ can tell the difference between ADD/ADHD and autism, especially at lower cut-off scores. \u00a0You will see why this is important next time.\n\nReferences\n\nEhlers, S, C Gillberg, and L Wing. 1999. \u201cA screening questionnaire for Asperger syndrome and other high-functioning autism spectrum disorders in school age children.\u201d Journal of autism and developmental disorders 29:129-41.

{"date": "Sunday, October 10, 2010", "body": "\nLast week I wrote a somewhat critical post about a paper entitled \"Social Demographic Change and Autism\"1.\u00a0\u00a0I suggested that calling a conclusion based on estimated data a \"major discovery\" might not be warranted.\n\nMy primary objection at the time was that if you are basing a conclusion on the differences between identical and fraternal twins that perhaps you should be able to tell which twins are identical and which are fraternal. However, a commenter suggested that perhaps I was being a little too hard on the study, so I spent a little bit of time and gathered some data to see if I had the right or wrong idea. \u00a0After taking a closer look, I think I had the right idea and I am going to explain why below.\n\nThe paper in question used data from the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) to support the following three conclusions -\nFirst, the estimated heritability of autism has been dramatically overstated. Second, heritability estimates can change over remarkably short periods of time because of increases in germ cell mutations. Third, social demographic change can yield genetic changes that, at the population level, combine to contribute to the increased prevalence of autism.These conclusions are based on two primary observations from the data. \n\nThe first observation is that the generally accepted concordance rates of autism in twins are wrong and that there is not a large difference between in concordance between identical and fraternal twins. \u00a0The second observation is that as the average parental age went up that the concordance among all same sex twins went up as the concordance among opposite sex twins went down. \u00a0The authors then use these facts to suggest that there is a relationship between parental age and de novo mutations, specifically copy number variations, that could explain these facts.  They conclude that increasing parental age could be a large factor in the increased prevalence of autism.\n\nAfter reading the paper a few times and spending some time gathering and analyzing data, it is my opinion that the data in the paper do not support the conclusions. \u00a0I am going to start with the idea that copy number variations (CNVs) can lead to an increased risks of autism and work backwards from there.\n\nThe first problem I see is that this paper has no direct measurement of any CNVs in the children with autism nor any data showing that they are more common in the older parents included in this study. \u00a0While in general I would agree that other research has shown that CNVs can vary as a function of parental age, it does not follow that that the specific children included in this study had an unusual amount of CNVs or that these CNVs played a causal role in causing these children's autism.\n\nThere have been a large number of studies in the recent past that have looked for CNVs in children with autism and the overall conclusions are mixed. \u00a0On one hand, you have studies2 that actually looked for CNVs in a sizable group of children with autism and found significant ones in only 7% of the population and on the other3 you have studies that found that CNVs as a whole aren't more common in children with autism, just \"rare\" ones are. \u00a0In both cases, the majority of the child had their own (almost) unique mutations that were specific to them and not shared by other children.\n\nSo this begs the question of how can these CNVs can be responsible for the increased risk of autism? \u00a0Even if we accept the facts that they are more common in children with autism and become more common as the parents get older, how can a large number of almost unique mutations lead to the same condition? \u00a0You can't simply suggest that CNVs are the reason, there has to be an actual process that goes from the CNV to a diagnosis of autism. \u00a0The paper suggests no such mechanism.\n\nAs an aside, CNVs have also been found in other, possibly related, conditions such as schizophrenia4 and ADHD. \u00a0In one recent study5, CNVs were found in 16% of children with ADHD but were also found in 8% of the typical controls. \u00a0Based on results like this, I have to wonder how common CNVs are in the general population and how much autism-specific risk can be assigned to an arbitrary CNV.\n\nThe next problem with CNVs is the presumed relationship between the type of twin and the presence or absence of a CNV -\nRecall that because MZ twins are developed from a single pair of matched egg and sperm cells, any de novo mutations will be found in both twins. In contrast, DZ twins develop from two distinct pairs of egg and sperm cells. Because de novo mutations are rare events, the chance that both DZ twins will share the same de novo mutation is extremely low.The problem with this presumption is that is isn't necessarily true - identical twins do not always share the same CNV. \u00a0While this idea seems counterintuitive, it has been demonstrated by studies6 and I have personally seen this result (my identical twin daughters have different CNVs). \u00a0I don't have any hard facts on the flip side of the relationship, that fraternal twins are unlikely to share CNVs, but I have some doubts that that statement is true. \n\nThe argument here would come down to what is causing the CNV and when these mutations occur. \u00a0The authors assume that CNVs are present in parents' egg or sperm but I am not sure that is always the case. \u00a0If identical twins can have different CNVs then that implies that mutations can happen after fertilization which means that the mutations are not always in the parent's genetic material. \u00a0And if that is the case, then it should be possible for fraternal twins to both have their own CNVs. \u00a0The question would just be how often this happens, but I have not seen any studies that looked specifically at this issue. \n\nWhen you combine the above problems with the fact that there is no direct data on the actual CNVs in the paper, I would suggest that the conclusion that suggests older parents have move CNVs which in turn caused more autism might not be supportable.\n\nNext, \u00a0lets look at the twin specific findings of this paper. \u00a0Before I get into the details, I wanted to talk a little bit about the properties of the different types of twins. \u00a0For the purposes of this discussion, I am going to talk in generalities and gloss over some of the rare types of twins and higher order multiples as these will just confuse the issue. \u00a0Just be aware that the discussion below isn't the entire picture when it comes to multiple births.\n\nIdentical, or monozygotic (MZ), twins are the result of a single fertilized egg splitting into two parts. \u00a0MZ twins are basically a random event and the rate of MZ twinning does not vary by region, race, maternal age, fertility treatments, or time period. \u00a0MZ twins are not hereditary and cannot be \"passed down\" through generations. \u00a0The rate of MZ twinning is basically a constant worldwide and has been for the measurable past7 - about 1 in 250 pregnancies.\n\nFraternal, or dizygotic (DZ), twins are the result of multiple eggs being fertilized at once or, as is more common as of late, fertility treatments. \u00a0The rate of DZ twinning does vary by region, race, maternal age, fertility treatments, and time periods. \u00a0Natural DZ twinning is hereditary and can be passed down to children (although it is the mother's family history that matters, not the father's). \u00a0The rate of DZ twinning is not a constant and changes over time and the number of DZ twins have been growing rather rapidly since the 1980s\n\nAll types of twins have a substantially greater risk for having prenatal complications or for being born premature than do non-twins8. \u00a0MZ twins are more likely than DZ twins to have complications because they are more likely to share resources, such as the placenta, in the womb. \u00a0Also, there are certain prenatal complications that are only happen to MZ twins, such as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that prematurity and other prenatal complications come with an increased risk of autism, so while I don't have any exact figures I think it safe to say that twins of all types would run a greater chance of having autism than non-twins. \u00a0I would also suggest that MZ twins could have a greater risk of autism than DZ twins if only because of their increased prenatal risks. \u00a0(Although as a side note, I would also ague for an increased risk based on the fact that they would be more likely to share the same genetic and environmental vulnerabilities that might lead to autism).\n\nSo, back to the paper. \u00a0As I talked about last week, the data in this paper does not distinguish between identical and fraternal twins, so to arrive at the breakdown between the different types of twins the authors had to estimate. \u00a0The estimate that they used was based on the facts that all opposite sex twins are DZ twins and that the chance of a set of DZ twins being the opposite sex are the same as them being the same sex. \u00a0Based on those assumptions and data about the total number of twin births in California, \u00a0they arrived at the result that 55% of all of the same sex twins in the paper's data were MZ twins.\n\nThere are a few problems with this method of estimating.\n\nLets start with the fact that the proportion of same sex twins that are MZ twins is not a constant and changes significantly even over the study period (1992 to 2000). \u00a0To show this, I used national birth data from a few different sources as well as birth data from California from the CDC9, 10, 11. \u00a0The following are estimates based on the total number of twins born, the number of births per year, and the fact that MZ twins occur at a constant rate of about 1 in 250.\n\nFirst, lets look at the breakdown of twin births in the US from 1980 to 2000. \u00a0As you can see from the chart below, the overall number of sets of twins has been growing rapidly but most of this growth comes from an increased number of DZ and not MZ twins.\n\n\nSecond, consider the following California specific twin data. \u00a0While I could only find complete birth data from 1995 onwards, I believe this data is sufficient to show the skewing in the proportion of twins. \u00a0For the following chart, I used the authors' figure for identical twinning in California (4.4 per 1,000) which is slightly higher than the accepted figure (1 in 250). \u00a0As you can see, the number of DZ twins increased every year while the number of MZ twins decrease slightly as the general birth date decreased.\n\nI also replicated the calculation for the percentage of same sex twins that are identical and that is labeled R in the chart below. \u00a0As you an see, from 1995 to 2000 the value for R changed from 55.4% to 49.5%. \u00a0As a side note, if you take the rate of MZ twins to be slightly lower (1 in 250), the value for R changes from \u00a051.7% in 1995 to 46% in 2000. \u00a0Or in other words, this proportion is very highly sensitive to the actual breakdown of twins and is quite volatile.\n\n\nThe third problem is that the distribution of twins by parental age is also changing over the study period. \u00a0In general, the total number of births in California from 1995 to 2000 fell but the average age of the mother was going up. \u00a0This increase in the maternal age was mostly caused by younger women having less children and older women having more. \u00a0For example, in 1995 there were 478,125 children born to mothers under 35 while 73,920 were born to mothers 35 and older but by 2000, the under 35 crowd had decreased to 446,594 while the older mothers increased to 85,365.\n\n\nNow, the authors acknowledged this general shift in maternal age in the paper and talked about it. \u00a0 However, what they left out was that the average age for mothers of twins was also going up at the same time and that it was rising faster.\n\n\nThe difference between these two lines are all DZ twins. \u00a0Remember, the chance of having MZ twins does not vary by age but the chance of DZ twins does (older age leads to a higher risk of DZ twins). \u00a0As a result, the age of the mothers of MZ twins can only increase the same amount as all mothers, not more as is shown in the chart above.\n\nAs a result, not only does the relationship between the number of MZ and DZ twins change with time, it also changes with the mother's age. \u00a0When you look at mothers older than 35, they will have more DZ twins and\u00a0proportionately\u00a0less MZ twins (lower R) than do mothers that are younger.\n\nThere are other potential biases other than the ones above, such as race. \u00a0I did not take the time to chart these as I think the general idea is clear - the relationship between the number of DZ and MZ twins is not simple and cannot be represented as a single number over any significant length of time.\n\nWhen you combine the above problems you can see that getting the breakdown between MZ and DZ twins is not a simple thing and is related to several factors. \u00a0None of these factors were controlled for in the study.\n\nNow ignore all of that for the moment and consider the twins that were included in the study. \u00a0Out of the 56,631 sets of twins born in California between 1992 and 2000, only 503 were included - less than 1% of all of the twins. \u00a0The authors make the assumption that relationships that hold for the entire population will also hold for this specific subset. \u00a0If this selection of twins were random, I would agree that the relationships should hold.\n\nBut, we are not talking about a random selection, we are talking about a very specific selection - twins were at least one twin had a diagnosis of autism - and that is not a random process. \u00a0If all types of twin were at the same risk and had the same relation to the other risk factors for autism then the relationship might hold. \u00a0But we know that the prevalence of autism varies by race, parental age, and with prenatal complications and we know that the breakdown of twins vary by these factors as well. \u00a0As a result, I think that even if the R value that the authors calculated from the entire population was a valid number, it would not necessarily apply to the group of twins included in the study. \n\nThe only way to get at the actual breakdown of twins would have been to do an actual count of the different types of twins. \u00a0Without this breakdown, one of the major points of the paper - the idea that the heritability of autism is overstated - is completely unsupported by the data.\n\nAs a further blow to this conclusion, consider that the authors only included data for twins that both had a diagnosis of autism - not Asperger's, CDD, Retts, or even PDD-NOS. \u00a0So if one twin had a diagnosis of autism and the other had PDD-NOS, they would have been counted as non-concordant. \u00a0But as has been shown elsewhere12, twins - even identical ones - are not always concordant for severity. \u00a0There are many twins were one has diagnosis of autism and the other with PDD-NOS, or one is autism and the other is Asperger's. \u00a0As a result, the current paper would likely underestimate the concordance for all types of twins.\n\nBut lets assume that none of the above applies and that all twins have the identical risk of having at least one twin with autism, that the relationship between MZ and DZ twins is a constant for the study period, and that said relationship could be used for the study population without an issue. \u00a0There would still be a problem with the breakdown because the concordance of the different types of twins was determined using a \"simple linear transformation\". \u00a0That can't work unless you are already assuming that MZ and DZ twins should have a similar breakdown.\n\nLet me give an example. \u00a0Assume that you have 10 sets of male-male twins of and that you know that 6 of them both have autism. \u00a0Further assume that you know that 5 of the twins are MZ and 5 are DZ. \u00a0If you use a simple linear breakdown based on the fact that 50% of the twins are MZ, you could conclude that 3 of the 5 are MZ twins that both have autism and 3 of the 5 are DZ twins that both have autism. \u00a0 But given the same data, \u00a0you could just as easily concluded that 4 of 5 MZ twins have autism while only 1 of 5 DZ twins do, or anything in between. \u00a0The difference in the concordance rates would be significant - 60% for both MZ and DZ in the first and 80% for MZ and 20% for DZ in the second. \u00a0I am not saying that the paper used this exact simple split, but it wasn't much more complex than that.\n\nThe point is that a linear transformation is going to skew the results if there is a grouping with low concordance combined with a group of high concordance. \u00a0The lower group would appear to be much higher that it should be while the higher group would appear to be much lower. \n\nThat last point is probably the most important because that is exactly what this paper showed - that DZ have a higher concordance than previously thought and MZ have a much lower concordance. \u00a0The authors are claiming this result even though almost every other paper on this subject has found something different - that DZ twins have a much lower concordance than do MZ twins. \u00a0So, I would have to conclude that the breakdown of the data in this study is flawed. \u00a0Especially considering the fact that the other studies on the subject12 were able to properly split out MZ and DZ twins.\n\nAs for the last idea about parental age being associated with a greater risk of autism in same sex twins, that could be explained by other factors. \u00a0And when it comes down to the numbers, the increase in the average age is rather small (1.5 years, from 30.6 to 32) and only slightly larger than the general increase in maternal age across all children.\n\nAs I mentioned above, older mothers in California were becoming more common among all children and especially for DZ twins. \u00a0In the general population in California, the average maternal age from 1995 to 2000 went from approximately 27.2 to 27.8 while in mothers of twins it went from 29 to 30. \u00a0So is an increase in parental age of 1.5 years significant when the population as a whole is showing about the same increase?\n\nThe other thing I would point out, and this may just be me nitpicking, is that the authors knew that the specific data set they used had already been used to establish a relationship between parental age and risk of autism. \u00a0One the first page of the paper, the authors talk about how another study found a relationship between parental age and autism and acknowledge that the other study used the same data set as they did. \u00a0I don't think it can be considered a surprise (or major discovery) if you find a relationship that others have already shown in the same data set.\n\nWhew. \u00a0If you have managed to read all the way down to here, I have to commend you. \u00a0You will be receiving a gold jabberwocky sticker as a reward. \u00a0Now, to wrap this all up.\n\nIt is my opinion that the conclusions of the paper aren't supported by the data that is in the study. \u00a0The breakdown between identical and non-identical twins is likely flawed, the association with parental age could be an artifact of a general trend in the data, the specific type of mutations (CNVs) are relatively rare and unique even when seen in people with autism, and there is no known mechanism for these disparate CNVs to all lead to autism.\n\nAll this is not to say that the entire paper is worthless. \u00a0I actually found this paper to be very interesting. \u00a0I believe it is likely that a social demographic change could account for some of the increase in autism prevalence and I would agree that the wrong conclusion has been drawn from earlier twin studies. \u00a0Also, the raw data that is published in the paper actually fits in quite nicely with the data from other recent studies and helps fill out the overall picture (that is a subject for another time).\n\nBut, my beliefs about the ideas in the paper notwithstanding, I don't think that the conclusions of this paper are supported by the data included.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

{"date": "Saturday, October 23, 2010", "body": "\nWhen talking about practically any subject, we use certain words or phrases to represent another, more complex topic.\u00a0If you had to fully articulate a complex subject each and every time that you wanted to talk about it, you would be unable to express any complex idea in a reasonable amount of time, which would be a bad thing (unless you are an Ent). \u00a0So these shortcut are necessary to have any sort of real conversation.\n\nWhen you take this idea of shoving a series of ideas behind a single work or phrase and apply it to medicine or child development, what you get is called a label.  The purpose of the label is to describe a complex condition and wrap it up in a single word that fits nicely into a sentence.  That way you don't have to say a child has \"impaired social interaction and communication skill, restricted and repetitive behaviors, and potential sensory issues\" all of the time, you can simplify that and say that the child has autism.\n\nBut there is the problem with the labels. \u00a0They only work as long as everyone has the same idea of what they mean.  If you have a group of people who start using the label to mean something else or attach their own custom meanings to the word then the entire idea breaks down and all you are left with is confusion.\n\nTake for example the the label of \"gifted\" as it is applied to a child.  This label is relatively straight forward and means that the child is very intelligent or talented or, as the National Association for Gifted Children puts it -\nStudents, children, or youth who give evidence of high achievement capability in areas such as intellectual, creative, artistic, or leadership capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who need services and activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop those capabilitiesThe \"gifted\" label is not that complex idea.  Yet there are those who take a relatively simple label and seem to feel the need to make it into something that it is not.  A perfect example of this is an article published in the New Scientist called Prodigy psychologist: The gifted child's curse.  From the first paragraph -\nWhen children are labelled as \"gifted\" we like to think the world will be their oyster when they grow up. Be very careful, warns British psychologist Joan Freeman. As she explains to Alison George, her 35 years of studying children with extraordinary abilities has revealed that the label has as many negatives as positivesThe rest of the article continues in the same vein, but what is missing from it is what is negative about the label \"gifted\".  The psychologist being quoted describes many problems with how parents react to the label or how gifted children don't always go onto to be successful as an adult.  All of these \"negatives\" describe how people's reaction to the label might be less than ideal or how having a certain high level of intelligence doesn't guarantee success. \u00a0But none of these negatives have to do with what the label represents - being \"gifted\" is not a negative.\n\nI think the problem comes about because people are unable to separate the characteristics of a label from the person themselves.  A label just describes one part of who a person is and is not meant to describe every facet \u00a0of a person. \n\nJust because you are \"gifted\" does not mean that you are a hard worker or that everything is going to be easy for you.  Nor does it mean that you will have the perfect parents who will provide the optimal learning experience to bring out your exact talents. These\u00a0are larger issues that need to be dealt with in the context of being a person and are\u00a0not explicitly\u00a0tied\u00a0to the idea of being gifted - you can still have these issues without being gifted and being gifted does not mean you will have these issues.\n\nOn the flip side, you have a label like autism where people try and take what are mostly negative attributes and make it into a positive. When you look at what goes into the label of autism, you will find a set of characteristics that everyone can have little bits and pieces of but, in autism, are taken to unhealthy extremes. \u00a0That is what the label autism means - there are issues with communication, social, and restricted interests that are severe enough to cause major problems. \u00a0None of the attributes that go along with the label \"autism\" are a good thing.\n\nBut just because you have a label of autism does not mean that you are just a set of negative characteristics- there is much more to a person that just a label of autism. \u00a0A person with autism can be smart, funny, loving, caring, or any of the other traits that can apply to any other person. \u00a0The autism label just describes one small part of who a person is.\n\nHowever, there are a small number of people who are attempting to hijack the autism label and make it mean something completely different. \u00a0Perhaps the best known of this group are the \"aspies\" who are trying to turn the label Asperger's into something that it is not. Lets be clear here, the Asperger's label is part of what is know as the autism spectrum and, as such, is a form of autism. \u00a0But if you listen to what these aspies have to say, they will tell you that Asperger's is not autism. \u00a0They will tell you that Asperger's is about being highly intelligent, dispassionate, and being\u00a0neurodiverse.\n\nBut that is not what the label of Asperger's means.\u00a0\u00a0Having Asperger's does not means you are automatically intelligent or\u00a0dispassionate\u00a0and not everyone who is technologically proficient and social awkward has Asperger's.  You can still be intelligent and have Asperger's but one does not means the other.\n\nYou may think this entire discussion is moot and pointless but I think it matters a great deal.  As I have talked about in the past, many of those seeking to turn the label of autism into something that it is not are doing so on the backs of those who are more disabled.  \n\nThe end result of this hijacking of the autism label is you have people like Ari Ne'eman talking about how \"autistic people\" don't want to be cured, or Michael John Carley saying that they find the idea of being lumped in with lower functioning people with autism \"hard to shallow\"\u00a0because they sometimes have to wear adult diapers, or Hannah Fjeldsted saying it would be \"an\u00a0insult and a mockery\"\u00a0to be lumped in with the lower functioning because aspies have their pride to think about.\n\nAnd this insanity is not only limited to fringe people like this, it is slowly spreading to more reputable places like WebMD\u00a0-\nSome traits that are typical of Asperger's syndrome, such as attention to detail and focused interests, can increase chances of university and career success. Many people with Asperger's seem to be fascinated with technology, and a common career choice is engineering. But scientific careers are by no means the only areas where people with Asperger's excel. Indeed, many respected historical figures have had symptoms of Asperger's, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and Thomas Jefferson.There are so many things wrong with the paragraph it isn't even funny.  People with Asperger's aren't focused on details, they are obsessed with certain specific ones and not in a good way (Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities\u00a0anyone?). Nor is there an automatic relationship between technology and Asperger's - that is a myth.  And don't even get me started on the absurdity of saying that historical figures could have had Asperger's because of certain characteristics that appear in writings about them. \u00a0All of the labels are based on a set of characteristics that appear to a greater or lesser extent in all people but having some similar characteristics does not mean you have \"symptoms of Asperger's\".\n\nI have no idea when this nonsense starting appearing on WebMD but it certainly is evidence that the attempted re-branding of Asperger's and, by\u00a0correlation, autism is taking hold. Unfortunately, these ideas create an image of autism that those who are more severely affected will never be able to live up to. \u00a0Maybe the solution is to remove the Asperger's label from the rest of the spectrum and let the aspies redefine it to mean what ever they think it means this week.\n\nBut regardless, the point is that when using a label you have to use it correctly. \u00a0You have to be\u00a0able to separate out the characteristics that it implies from the person as a whole.  Each and every person is much more than the sum of their labels and just because a person has a specific label does not mean that they are limited to being just the label.  A person is a person, not a label.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TMLT3wspigI/AAAAAAAAAT0/SxKq8UGYpLM/s1600/hello_i_am.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent", "http://www.nagc.org/index2.aspx?id=548", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827811.300-prodigy-psychologist-the-gifted-childs-curse.htm", "http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/tc/aspergers-syndrome-symptoms?page=2", "http://www.agre.org/program/criteria.cfm?do=program#aspergers"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/10/misuse-of-labels.html", "title": "\nThe Misuse of Labels\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, October 17, 2010", "body": "\nToday was a good day. \n\nThe day started off well, with the children sleeping through the night until their typical wake up time of about 6 AM. Twin B came in first this morning, which is a bit unusual, and asked for the TV to be turned on. \u00a0We managed to put her off for about a half hour before we gave in and turned it on for her. \n\nYou see, Twin B has this thing were she has to have constant noise (preferably electronic) in the background and she has this other thing with the word \"no\". \u00a0For the past few months, whenever you tell her \"no\" she immediately goes into full meltdown mode and tantrums for the next twenty to thirty minutes. \u00a0When you combine denying her one of her \"stims\" plus the word \"no\" you get a somewhat volatile situation. \n\nFortunately, we managed to avoid the meltdown this morning after using the dreaded \"no\" word and only had some minor crying off and on for the next 25 minutes before she finally calmed down enough that we could give her want she wanted. \u00a0In our world, this is called progress.\n\nYou might ask yourself why we would risk a meltdown at 5:30 in the morning (when we were still sleeping), and the answer is simple. \u00a0My daughter has autism and we have to do everything possible to help her get past it. \u00a0We don't have the choice of trying to help her get past the problems some of the time and not others - consistency is one of the keys to overcoming the obsessions of autism. \u00a0And before you say that it doesn't matter, it does. \u00a0She has to be able to accept the someone telling her \"no\" and she can't assume that every if there is a TV in the same room as her that it will be on. \u00a0She has to be able to function in the world even if it isn't exactly to her liking. \n\nThe rest of the morning was fairly uneventful, with only a few hiccups. \u00a0The twins did their typical trick of only grazing on \u00a0breakfast while Baby C showed some (cough, cough) \"spirit\" in an attempt to get my cup of coffee. \u00a0For some reason, she really likes coffee but, while that isn't too bad, dealing with a three year old strung out of coffee isn't my idea of a fun morning. \u00a0I let her have a few sips before cutting her off and being treated to her trademark \"try again\". \n\nThat last bit takes a little explaining. \u00a0While my youngest is higher functioning than her older sisters, she is still somewhat limited in her ability to communicate and much of her speech is scripted. \u00a0She tends to reuse phrases that she has heard other people use, although she does use them in an appropriate manner. \u00a0Since she has heard the \"try again\" many times from her therapists when she gives an incorrect response, she has decided that that is the appropriate way to answer us when we give her an answer that she doesn't like. \n\nSo when I say \"no more coffee\", she replies with \"try again\". \n\nIt might not be the typical parent/child interaction, but hey, its communication.\n\nA little later on in the morning, Twin A started getting upset for some reason. \u00a0It took about\u00a0fifteen minutes and\u00a0a small tantrum before my wife's mind reading abilities kicked in and she was able to figure out what was wrong -\u00a0\u00a0the child was bored and wanted something to do. \u00a0So we got out the paints and some other art supplies and let her go to town. \u00a0Problem solved (except I am going to have to clean the paint off the walls later on tonight).\n\nYou might ask why Twin A didn't just ask to paint, and the reason is again simple. \u00a0While the twins definitely have the basic communication skills to ask for something when they know what they want, they aren't to the point yet were they are able to express an abstract though or idea such as \"I want to do something but I don't know what\". \u00a0Hence the agitation and the small tantrum. \u00a0Irresistible desire to express, meet (almost) immovable communication block known as my daughter's form of autism. \n\nAfter lunch came the highlight of the day. \u00a0We took an outing as a family to not one but two novel places. \n\nFirst we\u00a0went to a fish store to buy some supplies for the fish tank and to let the kids look at the fish - they all love fish (no idea why). \u00a0That part of the trip went relatively smoothly with only a few bumps transitioning into the store. \u00a0The twins were a little stressed by the new environment - we\u00a0could tell because they were walking around with their hands over their ears - but soon enough they were jumping and waving their arms in front of the fish tanks. \n\nAs an aside, if you have never seen two children jumping and hopping through a store while holding their hands over their ears and flapping their elbows, you have to see it. \u00a0While most of the people in the store glared and seemed to want to say \"what is wrong with those children\", we have to laugh because of how much fun they are having and how cute they look. \u00a0Besides, it wasn't all that long ago that they refused to even walk on their own while out in public, so hopping is progress.\n\nAnyway, we stayed in the store for a good fifteen minutes before we noticed the tell-tale signs of increasing agitation and took that as our cue that it was time to go. \u00a0It got a bit touchy as Twin A wasn't quite ready to leave but her sisters were more than ready. \u00a0As we headed to the door, she did her typical bit of dropping to the ground and shouting and I had to resort to\u00a0picking her up and carrying her out of the store.\n\nThe second trip was to a restaurant that we had never been to before. \u00a0It is very hard to find any restaurant that not only has food that the twins can have - they have food intolerances - but that also has food that they are willing to eat. \u00a0They are picky eaters and are adverse to trying anything new (yet another thing that we are working on).\n\nBaby C is easier because she does not have any food intolerances and she is typically happy to try new food. \u00a0However, today she decided that she wanted nothing to do with new food or with a new\u00a0restaurant and felt the need to share her displeasure with the entire\u00a0restaurant. \u00a0She started crying the minute that we were seated and finally\u00a0managed to calm down shortly after we placed our orders. \u00a0After that, the rest of the meal went well and, much to our surprise, the\u00a0twins actually ate what we ordered for them.\n\nAfter the restaurant we even managed to take a short walk around town before returning to the car and returning home. \u00a0I guess that actually make three novel environments for the kids today - a new family record.\n\nAs I said, today was a good day. \u00a0Today we helped our daughters deal with their obsessions, communicate a little better, and cope with the stress of the unknown. \u00a0Or, in short, today we helped them overcome just a little bit more of their autism. \n\nToday we all had a good day and enjoyed ourselves in the process. \n\nBut today was not a day without autism. \u00a0I don't know if we will ever again have a day without autism. \u00a0Almost every single thing that we did today was carefully laid out and planned with autism firmly in mind. \u00a0With three children on the spectrum, we do not have the luxury of ever forgetting for a moment that our children have special needs because if we do, the day will not go so well. \n\nBut such is the life of an autism parent. \u00a0As much as I wish that my children did not have to struggle with autism they do, and there is nothing that I can do to change that fact. \u00a0 \u00a0My children have autism and I, like many other autism parents, will do whatever it takes to help our children get past the difficulties that autism can cause. \u00a0We will give up our ambitions and goals and completely\u00a0change our lives in the hope of making a better future for our children. \u00a0We do this not\u00a0because we are trying to make our children into something that they are not but rather because we want them to have the best chance possible of overcoming their autism.\n\nBy now, you must be wondering what the point of this entire post is,\u00a0so here it is. \n\nBeing an autism parent can be a tough - and sometimes thankless - job, far more so than being a parent to a \"typical\" child. \u00a0If you are lucky, your efforts will be rewarded when your child is able to function on their own in spite of having a disability like autism. \u00a0If you aren't, then you worry about who will take care of your children once you are no longer able.\n\nAs I said, it is what it is. \u00a0But, given all of that, there are people out there\u00a0who seem hell bent on making our job harder. \u00a0I am talking about people like Suvi-Tuuli Allan who don't seem to know what they are talking about and say things like\u00a0this\u00a0-\n@TannersDad: We can save more children if we cure the parents. #autismand this\u00a0-\n@TannersDad: I was being sarcastic. WTF is a profound autism anyways?and this -\nFinding a cure for #autism is all about parents trying to make their kids \"normal\" so they can be proud of their productive little NT kids.The first time I ran across people like this, \u00a0I was\u00a0flabbergasted. \u00a0Lately, I have just been getting annoyed with their ignorance. \u00a0So let me just make this simple for all of the children like Ms. Allan who seem to think that they understand exactly what being an autism parent is like.\nShut up until you manage to grow up and learn what the hell you are talking about.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://twitter.com/tuuli1#", "http://twitter.com/tuuli1/status/27639029962", "http://twitter.com/tuuli1/status/27639724930#", "http://twitter.com/tuuli1/status/27640667642#"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/10/respect.html", "title": "\nRespect\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 5, 2010", "body": "\n\nFlickr Photo by dbkingA week from today, the US Supreme Court is going to hear arguments in Bruesewitz v. Wyeth, a case about vaccine injury.  At issue in this case is whether vaccine manufacturers can be directly sued in a normal court for injuries that are caused by their products.  \n\nIn you are interested in the details of the case or actual filing in the case, I recommend this excellent resource\u00a0which is maintained by SCOTUS blog.\n\nAs matters stand now, almost all claims of vaccine injuries must be filed with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, more commonly known as vaccine court.   This is a special venue that was created by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 and was meant to be a no-fault, swift, flexible, and less adversarial alternative to the traditional court system.  But this venue is not a the traditional court system and the rules it operates under can be quite different.\n\nWhen you submit a claim with this program, the vaccine manufacturer is not the defendant (or respondent) but rather the federal government.  And if you win your claim, it is not the vaccine manufacturers that pays for the damages but rather other people like you.  Let me explain that last part as it can be a little confusing. \u00a0Every time a vaccine is administered, a surcharge is added to the cost of the vaccine and is paid by whoever is paying the medical bill (such as an insurance company).  These surcharges are then collected by the government and any awards made by the vaccine compensation program are paid using these funds.\n\nOr to put this in simple terms, a vaccine manufacturer cannot be sued for harm caused by their product nor are they financially liable for damages.  Regardless of where you stand on the possible link between autism and vaccines, I think we can all agree that absolving an entire industry of liability is not the best of ideas and is just asking for problems.\n\nThere might have been valid reasons for setting up this situation back in 1986 when the supply of vaccines were very much in doubt.  Back then, vaccine manufacturers were facing a large number of law suits (although very few of them successful) and were threatening to pull out of the market entirely.  Fast forward to today and the vaccine market is considered a growth market, with billions in dollars of revenue (e.g. Merck alone booked almost 1.4 billion dollars in revenue from the sale of vaccines in 2009).\n\nWhen you file a claim with the so-called vaccine court, your claim is handled in several different ways, depending on the exact nature of the injury.  If the injury is a commonly accepted one (i.e table injury) then your claim will be awarded quickly.  If it is not, your case is heard by a special master and you have to prove that the vaccine caused the injury.\n\nAfter following the the doings of the vaccine court for several years, I think I can safely say that the program is not living up to what it was supposed to be.  Rather than the program being a swift alternative to the traditional courts, claims filed with this program can take many years to resolve - even for simple claims.  And, as anyone who followed the autism omnibus proceedings can tell you, the process in the court is anything but \"less adversarial\".\n\nThis so-called court also seems to have a major aversion to using the word \"autism\" and vaccine together. \u00a0If you claim that your child has a vaccine injury as well as autism, the chance of you winning your claim is almost non-existent. \n\nEven worse, in the few cases were the court has awarded damages when autism is involved, they have gone well out of their way to avoid making it seems like there could be any possible relation.  For example, in the Hannah Polling case, the documents make reference to \"features of autism\" rather than autism directly.  And even more telling, in the case of Bailey Banks, the special master actually created a new condition - \"non-autistic\" PDD-NOS.\n\n\u00a0For anyone who has half a brain and understands the terminology involved, that phrase is like saying \"non-wet\" water or a non-automobile car. \u00a0PDD-NOS is, by definition, a form of autism and you cannot simply say that it isn't autism because we happen to know what caused it.\n\nJust as a side note, while I don't think that vaccines leading to autism is all that common, if you don't think it is possible at all, go look at the Hannah Poling case. \u00a0Done? \u00a0Ok, save the \"yes, buts\" and just accept the fact that it can happen. \u00a0Even if we are only talking about this happening to 0.1 % of all children with autism, that would still be 40 children per year in this country alone.\n\nThe vaccine compensation program is operating without much oversight from the traditional court system and is basically being run by the same governmental organizations that are responsible for promoting vaccine use. \u00a0This\u00a0arrangement\u00a0gives the phrase \"conflict of interest\" a whole new meaning. \u00a0And, if\u00a0you thing that the Special Master made\u00a0any\u00a0factual errors in the case or didn't consider the evidence properly, you are pretty much out of luck.  As the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in their recent ruling in the Cedillo case (starting on page 10)-\nWe review the Special Master\u2019s factual findings using an \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard. We \u201cdo not sit to reweigh the evidence. [If] the Special Master\u2019s conclusion [is] based on evidence in the record that [is] not wholly implausible, we are compelled to uphold that finding as not being arbitrary or capricious.\u201d  Our role is not to \u201csecond guess the Special Master[\u2019]s fact-intensive conclusions\u201d particularly in cases \u201cin which the medical evidence of causation is in dispute.\u201dIt will be interesting to see where this case goes.  I suspect that the Supreme Court is going to uphold how the law is currently being interpreted, which means that it would be up to Congress to make any needed changes in how the program operates. \n\nTime will tell.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm1.static.flickr.com/23/37621686_0dcd0e12e5_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootbearwdc/", "http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bruesewitz-v-wyeth/", "http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/images/stories/opinions-orders/10-5004.pdf"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/10/bruesewitz-v-wyeth-coming-next-week.html", "title": "\nBruesewitz v.

{"date": "Friday, November 12, 2010", "body": "\n\n\nPicture from Wikimedia Commons\nAccording to a new paper, published in the Nov 12 issue of Cell, it may be possible to grow a model of what neurons look like in people with Rett Syndrome. \u00a0I have to say, if this is a real result - and can be reproduced by other groups - then this is potentially a huge leap forward for people with Rett Syndrome.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Rett Syndrome\u00a0is a form of autism that is\u00a0somewhat different from other types of autism. \u00a0Rett Syndrome is very rare and is seen primarily in girls instead of boys. \u00a0It tends to involve more motor issues and be more severe than \"typical\" autism. \u00a0Also, children who are affected might not respond as well to standard autism treatments such as ABA.\n\nHowever, unlike other types of autism, a possible mechanism for the problems of Rett Syndrome has been identified - a mutation in the methl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene. \u00a0And, more importantly, recent research\u00a0has shown that it might be possible to reverse the effects of this mutation and effectively \"cure\" people of Rett's.\n\nWith that in mind, forget about all of the media reports that are talking about replicating\u00a0autism in a dish\u00a0and instead focus on what the researchers actually accomplished.\n\nAt the risk of over simplifying, the researchers took some cells from girls with and without Rett Syndrome, turned them into a type of stem cell, and then had them grow into neurons. \u00a0The neurons from the girls with Rett's had\u00a0significant\u00a0differences from the neurons grown from the \"typical\" girls. \u00a0The differences seen in these cells were similar to what has been seen in mouse models of Rett's and in human autopsies of people who had Rett's.\n\nSo basically, researchers grew neurons that closely mimic what real neurons would be like in people with Rett's. \u00a0Given that it might be possible to reverse the damage cause by Rett's, this ability to grow neurons and test how they react to different treatments is invaluable. \u00a0The researchers already presented some data in the paper showing that certain treatments that were thought to be helpful with Rett's actually do help.\n\nI can't really do the subject justice, so if you are interested in the topic I suggest that you read the paper. \u00a0The paper, along with a good introduction, is freely available from the journal's web site.\n\nThe downside here, if there really is one, is that results don't apply to other forms of autism. \u00a0 In Rett's, we have a known mutation, some idea of what the model should look like, and a way to judge the results. \u00a0In other forms of autism, we have no real clue what causes the problems and no idea of whether a specific type of cell would be a good model of anything. \u00a0Having some sort of biological mechanism to target can make all the difference in the world.\n\n\nReferences\n\nMarchetto, Maria C N et al. 2010. \u201cA Model for Neural Development and Treatment of Rett Syndrome Using Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.\u201d Cell 143:527-539. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.10.016.\n\nWalsh, Ryan M, and Konrad Hochedlinger. 2010. \u201cPreviews Modeling Rett Syndrome with Stem Cells.\u201d Cell 143:499-500. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.10.037.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TN33lGsIvWI/AAAAAAAAAUM/PgLR57yAEQg/s1600/256px-Hersenen.png", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hersenen.png", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001536.htm", "http://www.cbsatlanta.com/news/25769628/detail.html", "http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(10)01241-9", "http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(10)01241-9"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/11/modeling-rett-syndrome.html", "title": "\nModeling Rett Syndrome\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 6, 2010", "body": "\nEarlier this year, a paper was released entitled \"Social Demographic Change And Autism\" that attempted to explain the part of the rise in the rate of autism. \u00a0The authors arrived at three \"major discoveries\" that were supposed to change our thinking about autism. \n\nWhile the ideas in the paper have some merit, I can't resist pointing out one of the flaws in one of the \"major discoveries\". \u00a0The discovery that I am talking about is this one -\nFirst, the estimated heritability of autism has been dramatically overstated.In very rough terms, this statement is basically saying that autism is not something that your parent's pass down to you but rather something that is caused by something else. \u00a0The paper goes into some specific about what this could be, but I am going to focus on this one point for now.\n\nTo prove this point, the researchers analyzed some data \u00a0-\nTo anticipate the main results of this article, we first demonstrate that autism heritability \u2014 defined in the narrow sense as the difference in concordance for autism between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins is not as significant as typically believed.Of course, it always comes back to twins. \u00a0Most other studies have shown that identical twins are more than twice as likely as fraternal twins to both have a form of autism. \u00a0 But here, the researchers are basically saying that this is not true - that identical twins are not much more likely to both have autism than fraternal twins. \n\nIf this result were true, it would signal a a major change in how we think about autism. \u00a0But, as\u00a0I was looking through the paper to see what numbers that the authors arrived at, I ran across this statement -\nThe administrative data we work with do not have a direct measure of zygosity, so we do not know from these data whether twins are MZ or DZ, which is central to the estimation of genetic influence.Wait, what? \n\nOne of the major findings of the paper is based on the difference between identical and fraternal twins but the data in the study does not have the ability to tell you which twins are identical and which aren't? \u00a0So, how can any conclusion be reached about the differences between the two groups when you don't know what the groups are?\nA simple and well-established rule that has been shown to give robust zygosity estimates has been developed for this purpose and has been widely used in research on twinning rates and a range of other research questions.So one of the \"major discoveries\" of the paper - one that disagrees with most other twin studies out there - is not based on actual data but a guess of what the data might look like?\n\nIt is a good thing that the proportion of twins that are identical is a constant (oh wait, it isn't) and that factors influencing twin births weren't changing drastically during the study period (oops, they were) and that we know that identical twins aren't more likely than fraternal twins to have autism in the first place (no clue). \n\nThere are so many unknowns and possible other factors involved that without this one little, tiny yet fundamental piece of information - whether a set of twins were identical or fraternal - the conclusion based on that data becomes nothing more than a educated guess.\n\nConclusions should be based on data, not guesses.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.understandingautism.columbia.edu/papers/social-demographic-change-and-autism-(2010).pdf"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/10/jabberwocky-of-day-estimates-are-not.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky Of The Day : Estimates Are Not Major Discoveries\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 10, 2011", "body": "\nEarlier this month a paper1 was published that took (yet) another look at autism in twins and found that autism might not be as \"genetic\" as once thought. \n\nIn a nutshell, this paper found that the number of identical twins who both have autism is lower and the number of fraternal twins who both have autism is significantly higher than once thought. \u00a0When you consider the findings separately or together, it all points to the fact that environmental factors play a far larger role in autism than was previously thought.\n\nI think the most surprising thing about this study for me is how many people seem to be taken off guard by this finding. \u00a0This isn't the first recent twin study to show at least some of these results. \u00a0In fact, I wrote about one that suggested that autism was far more common in fraternal twins than was thought almost two years ago.\n\nBut even ignoring recent twin studies, the purely genetic model has, even after decades of searching, failed to find any mutations that could account for more than an minority of cases of autism. \u00a0As each passing study not only failed to find any single mutation that could account for more than a small handful of case but also (mostly) failed to confirm the small mutations from the last study, it became clear (at least to me) that genetics alone could not determine whether someone developed autism.\n\nSure, you can take all of the prior studies together, put on your optimistic glasses, and say that you might be able to point to the genetic \"cause\" for up to 30% of all cases2 of autism. \u00a0But that presumes that each of the individual \"causes\" that have been identified are in fact causes and not simply random chance. \u00a0It also assumes that a given person would only have one of these \"causes\". \u00a0Since most of these \"causes\" have been identified in only an extremely small group of people, I think it is far more likely that most of these mutations are simply chance and have nothing to do causing autism.\n\nBut, for the sake of argument, lets say that you could take a random group of 100 people with autism and find the genetic \"cause\" in 30 of them. \u00a0That would still leave the overwhelming majority of cases without a known cause. \u00a0What does it say when about the correctness of a theory when it fails to account for the majority of cases?\n\nIn most of science, if you had a hypothesis that has failed to be confirmed by hundreds of studies over several decades, that would be called a failed hypothesis. \u00a0But when it comes to autism, that is called the prevailing theory. \u00a0And the reason that this theory has survived is the results of past twin studies that found that autism seemed to be mostly genetic.\n\nEnter the current study that very meticulously shows that identical twins often don't share their autism and that fraternal twins do so more than other siblings. \u00a0These findings have effectively taken out the foundation that the\u00a0genetic only theory of autism was based on. \u00a0So when you consider that not only has the genetic theory failed to find any major results but also that it might rest on a flawed foundation, I think it is very clear that the theory is dead in the water.\n\nNow, before anyone takes this the wrong way, it is still obvious that there are genetic causes of autism and that genetics does still play a large role in developing autism. \u00a0However, we can now say (with an almost certainty) that environmental factors also play a large role.\n\nThe world of autism is no longer flat.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

{"date": "Saturday, September 25, 2010", "body": "\nSharron Angle, the Republican candidate for United States Senate in Nevada, was caught on video trash talking insurance coverage for autism treatments.  You can see listen to her remarks on YouTube yourself but what she said was -\n\"Take off the mandates for coverage in the state of Nevada and all over the United States.  But here you know what I\u2019m talking about. You\u2019re paying for things you don\u2019t even need.  They just passed the latest one, is everything that they want to throw at us now is covered under 'autism'\"If you watch at the video, you can see her make air quotes around the word autism.\n\nWow.\n\nI don't like to talk about politics because subject is typically a\u00a0land mine\u00a0in this country. If you think people in the autism community are touchy, try and have a rational political discussion with someone. \u00a0But,\u00a0I didn't think I could let these statements without comment.\n\nWhile most the of the\u00a0criticisms about her remarks have centered on the use of air quotes around the word autism, I think that misses the larger issue. \u00a0Sure,\u00a0if you think the term autism belongs in air quotes and parents are just lining up to get their kids an autism diagnosis because of the perks, then you are just ignorant of what autism is.  But parents whose children have autism have to deal with that type of ignorance all the time, so it isn't a surprise that a politician would say it.\n\nNo, what I find more troublesome is the opposition to insurance coverage of autism treatments.  The law that this women is opposing is not some radical plan that covers off the wall treatments for the autism, it is a law that forces insurance companies to pay for the basics\u00a0-\nRequires private health insurance companies to provide coverage for the screening, diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorder.\u00b7 Coverage of treatments will be provided when prescribed for an individual diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder by a licensed physician or a licensed psychologist who determines the care to be medically necessary.\u00b7 Coverage will be provided to individuals under the age of 18, or through the age of 21 if the individual is enrolled in high school. Coverage under this bill is subject to a maximum benefit of $36,000 annually for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy.\u00b7The bill includes coverage of the following treatments when written into a treatment plan: Habilitative or rehabilitative care, Prescription drugs, Psychiatric care, Psychological care, Therapeutic care (Speech and Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy), and Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), and behavioral therapies.\u00b7 The bill defines \"behavioral therapy\" as \"any interactive therapy derived from evidence-based research, including, without limitation, discrete trial training, early intensive behavioral intervention, intensive intervention programs, pivotal response training and verbal behavior\"I find Sharron Angle's opposition to this law very troubling because by opposing insurance companies paying for medically necessary autism treatments she is effectively opposing using these treatments for autism.\n\nLet me explain.  \n\nAll of the services covered by this law are provided by trained professionals and the services of these professionals do not come cheap.  For example, assume that you have a child receiving speech therapy one time a week from a trained speech therapist, that would run you about $5,000 a year.  Add in OT and you have another $5,000 a year.  When you add in behavioral therapy such as ABA those costs go up substantially, at least another $15,000.\n\nPut that all together and you are talking at least $25,000 a year per child and most of the time much more.\u00a0 \n\nNow consider that there are many families, like mine, where there is more than one child with autism.  If I had to pay for all of the core treatments out of pocket, I would be paying at a minimum $60,000 a year. \u00a0\u00a0If I could\u00a0pay for these services out of pocket I would, but that is just not feasible. \u00a0My family relies on my private health insurance as well as the programs from the state to pay for these services.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I am not looking for a handout nor do I feel that I am somehow\u00a0entitled\u00a0to these services. But\u00a0services like these are the best chance that my children have at being able to live productive,\u00a0independent\u00a0lives. \u00a0It is in society's best interesting to have as many of the children like mine as possible learn to live independently. \u00a0The alternative is even more expensive.\n\nSo when Sharron Angle is advocating against insurance paying for the basic autism treatments, she is basically saying that she is against treated autism because very few families cannot afford these services on their own.  And that means that Sharron Angle is against giving your child who happens to struggle with autism the help that they are going to need if they are going to overcome their autism. \u00a0So, let me but this bluntly. \u00a0If you have a child with autism and vote for\u00a0Sharron Angle you are voting against your child's future. \n\nThe country doesn't need any more elected officials who are badly ignorant of the realities of \"autism\".\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TGa0nRp9wzI/AAAAAAAAASw/q5MNrt_y-1w/s1600/stop.jpg", "//www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqxCCLr3Fa4", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quotes", "http://www.aconv.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=55&Itemid=69"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/09/politics-of-ignorance.html", "title": "\nThe Politics of Ignorance\n"},

Samsom had \"violent movements of the body\" at various times which might have been seizures. \u00a0Seizures are common in some people with autism.\n\n2. Samson is said to have eaten a swarm of bees and honey that he found in the carcass of a lion. \u00a0Abnormal eating habits have been seen in children with autism.\n\n3. Samson showed a \"failure to understand deception\" because he believed his strength lay in his hair and that he would lose his strength if his hair was ever cut. \u00a0I think it would have been more plausible if they went with resistance to change instead of the deception angle, but that's just me.\n\n4. Samson performed many physical feats throughout his life, feats he may have only been able to perform because he was insensitive to pain. \u00a0Some people with autism have been found to be insensitive to pain.\n\nSo there you have it, Samson joins the ranks of those with a post-humorous diagnosis.\n\nSheez.\n\nReferences\n\nMathew SK, Pandian JD.

{"date": "Tuesday, December 7, 2010", "body": "\nOver on the blog formerly known as Countering Age of Autism there was a post a few weeks back that claimed to be a guide to help parents avoid \"woo\". \u00a0The premise of the post was that there are a lot of sites on the internet that try and sell treatments for autism and it can be difficult to separate the good ones from the bad ones -\nHow do we evaluate the claims of these products and prevent ourselves from (1) wasting precious financial resources, and (2) putting our precious children in harm's way? There are some key things that one can look for that indicate woo and pseudoscience. We don't have to be experts in a field; we just have to know how to evaluate claims and evidence.The post continues with six tips on how to avoid bad treatments, aka \"woo\". \u00a0The tips start out with phrases to look out for such as \"Natural\", \"Organic\", and \"Doctor recommended\", continue on with an admonition about discounting testimonials, anecdotes, guided questionnaires, and illegitimate published articles, before finally ending with the suggestion that only people with an appropriate pedigrees can make a good product.\n\nWhile I do agree with the overall theme of the post - that it is hard to determine whether a particular treatment is worth it - I have to disagree with the idea that all you need is a cheat sheet of things to avoid. \n\nAs anyone who has seriously looked into treating autism can tell you, it can be difficult to determine whether any treatment - mainstream or alternative - will be able to deliver on its promises. \u00a0And, even when you can establish that a treatment can work, it is still very difficult to know whether a specific treatment will work for a specific person with autism. \u00a0Take a well-supported, mainstream treatment like ABA - for some children it can do wonders and give them back their ability to function while others won't respond to it at all.\n\nThe problem is that, because so little is known about what autism is or what causes it, it is hard to know what exactly what will help in general let alone what will help a specific person.\n\nIn general, science understands very little about autism and, specifically, has no clue why some things will work for one person but not another. \u00a0\"Woo\" or \"pseudoscience\" has nothing to do with it. \n\nAlthough, I have to say, I strongly dislike the idea of \"woo\". \u00a0Science is about the open exchange of ideas and is a methodology for trying to understand the world. \u00a0There is absolutely nothing about science that proclaims that the current understanding is \"The Truth\" and everything else is wrong. \u00a0If anything, the idea of \"we know that isn't true\" is almost the opposite of what science is about. \u00a0Science is more \"we think this might be the case\" but is willing to quickly change its mind if some new bit of evidence comes along.\n\nSure you will find people who cling onto an idea long past the point that there is any evidence supporting it, but that problem applies equally to those who think that they know what \"Science Says\". \u00a0As soon as you get too attached to the idea that you know something and consider the \"other side\" to be the great unwashed who worships woo, you have missed the entire point. \u00a0You have become the problem rather than the solution.\n\nArrogance is the antithesis of science.\n\nSo, rather than labeling something as \"woo\" simply on the basis of required legal disclaimers and marketing terms, I would suggest putting down the woo detector and using your head instead. \u00a0It is possible to develop a general understanding of a subject area without having to spend years and years becoming an expert. \n\nIt is important to develop this general understanding because, most of the time, the responsibility for treating a child's autism is left up to the parents. \u00a0Sure,\u00a0in a perfect world you would have an expert medical team on your side that can evaluate your child's specific situation and come up with an appropriate care plan. \u00a0But the chances of that happening are remote. \n\nThe majority of time, parents are left on their own and have to sort through a\u00a0large set of possible treatments and decide what is appropriate with very little guidance from medical \"experts\".\n\nSo, if you are a parent and want to treat your child's autism, you are going to have to develop at least a basic understanding of what it is that you are doing. \u00a0You will have to have a way to determine what is an appropriate thing to try and what is not. \n\nI personally find it helpful to find out the answers to the following questions whenever I run across some new treatment option -\n\n1. What exactly is the treatment?\n2. What is it supposed to do?\n3. How is it supposed to work?\n4. Do other independent and reputable sources agree?\n\nAnd then look at the specific reasons for trying this treatment with this child -\n\n5. What specific problem am I trying to address?\n6. Why do I think that this treatment will help with this problem?\n\nBefore finally getting to the problem of reputation -\n\n7. Do I trust this specific company or entity to provide this treatment?\n\nIf I don't know or am\u00a0uncomfortable with any of the answers to the questions then I would not try the treatment. \n\nThis list of questions doesn't just apply to those \"woo\" treatment like vitamins and probiotics but rather to any treatment that you are thinking of trying. \u00a0You need to take the time to understand what it is any why you would want to do it because it is unlikely that anyone is going to do it for you.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2010/11/before-you-buy-woo-primer-for-parents.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/12/woo-of-woo.html", "title": "\nThe Woo of Woo\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 24, 2010", "body": "\nWhenever you read anything about autism you will quickly run into the belief that autism is mostly \"genetic\". \u00a0The idea is that something, somewhere is not quite right with a person's genetic code and it is this difference that leads to the symptoms that make up what we call autism. \u00a0This belief is largely based on\u00a0twin studies that show that identical twins are more likely to both have autism than non-identical twins and based on findings that children whose siblings or parents have autism are more likely to have autism themselves.\n\nBased on this theory, millions upon millions of dollars have been spent looking for the genetic \"causes\" of autism. \u00a0But even though a large amount of time and money has been spent looking, there has been very little success. \u00a0Many studies have found genetic mutations that appear in a very small number of cases - typically much less than 1 percent. But whenever other researchers look for the these mutations in other groups, they almost always come up empty.\n\nWhat this leaves us with is a large number of genes that might be involved in some way shape or form with a very small number of cases. \u00a0If we add up all of these cases - and make the rather large assumption that they don't overlap - we might reach a total of 10 to 20 percent of all autism cases. \u00a0That means we would have 10 to 20 percent of cases made that might be caused by twenty to thirty distinct mutations. \u00a0And that is just talking about the mutations that involve a sizable population (even if it is under 1 percent of the whole). \u00a0Under this sort of model, the other cases would also have mutations but they could almost be unique to the individual case. \n\nAt the end of the day, we would be likely talking about a hundred or so unique mutations that could play a role in causing autism.\n\nTo make matters worse,\u00a0even when we can find these mutations, rarely do we have any real understanding of how these mutations could lead to something like autism. \u00a0And then even in the extremely rare cases when we do understand what these mutations might be doing, we have no clue of what can be done to fix the problem.\n\nWhen you consider the failure of science to identify the genetic underpinnings of autism - or even to find any underlying mechanism that could cause autism - you have to ask yourself whether the mostly genetic model of autism is right. \u00a0Is autism really caused by a huge number of almost individualized mutations or is something else going on?\n\nI have a idea that I have been thinking about for a while now. \u00a0What if all of these rare genetic mutations that are found in autism are not the cause of autism but rather a side effect of autism or collateral damage from whatever process caused the autism?\n\nI know that this is pure conjecture on my part, so take it for what it is worth. \u00a0But consider the following.\n\nFirst, a large number of the genetic mutations that have been found to be associated with autism are de novo, meaning that the mutations are seen in the children but not in their parents. \u00a0While this does not mean that autism isn't genetic, it does put a rather large dent in the idea that autism runs in families. It also makes you wonder what is going on with twin studies, but I will get to that point in a minute.\n\nSecond, when you look at current estimates on how often identical twins both have autism, you will see that some of the earlier studies were overly optimistic. \u00a0More recent research is showing that identical twins will only both have autism 80 to 90 percent of the time and, even when they do both have autism, one can be more severe than the other. \u00a0While it is true that identical twins will start to differ over time on a genetic level, before the age of three there should not be any major genetic differences. \u00a0As a result, if autism were solely based on genetics this number would be a lot close to \u00a0100 percent and the severity would almost always be the same.\n\nThird, when you look at fraternal twins, they are much more likely than typical siblings to both have autism. \u00a0Recent research has shown that male male fraternal twins have up to a 40 percent chance of both having autism while other types of siblings have only an 2 to 8 percent chance.\n\nFor those of you who don't understand the details of the different types of twinning, the simple way of thinking about it is as follows. \u00a0Identical twins alway start out as one fertilized egg - one organism - that splits into two separate organisms sometimes in the first nine days after fertilization. \u00a0Depending on how late the identical twins split they will share either a placenta, amniotic sac, or both. \u00a0If they split early enough then they will share nothing. \u00a0Fraternal twins are two fertilized eggs and are no more alike than other siblings would be. \n\nThe thing that all twins have in common is that they share, to some degree, the prenatal environment and tend to have very similar post-natal environments as well (just take my word for it). \u00a0Identical twins tend to share more of the prenatal environment while fraternal twins share less. \u00a0Normal siblings, of course, do not share any of the prenatal environment.\n\nThis leads me to my last, and mostly anecdotal, set of reasons why I think that the small mutations are an effect of autism rather than a cause. \u00a0For those of you who haven't been reading here for a while, two of my daughters with autism are identical twins. \u00a0While they are both about the same severity and share the same core deficiencies (primarily communications), it is striking how different their autism looks. \u00a0For example, Twin A has great imaginative play skills which Twin B lacks but Twin B is much more in tune socially with other children and adults than Twin A. \n\nIt is easy to tell when something about them is being driven by genetics because they are almost identical. \u00a0Even when you have something that you wouldn't think is genetic, they still stay very close to each other. \u00a0For example, they have had different eating habits for several years now but have stayed the same height and almost the same weight as each other for five years now. \u00a0This year is the first time that they differed by more than an ounce or two but they are still the same height.\n\nWhat I find\u00a0striking\u00a0is how different their autism looks and the different areas that they have problems with. For example, Twin A does not like noise and gets upset when there is too much background noise. \u00a0But Twin B wants to have constant background noise and gets upset when there isn't enough. \u00a0It is almost like their autistic behaviors are more like personality traits rather than something predetermined by genetics.\n\nMore important, however, is the genetics of these two young girls. \u00a0Earlier this year we have a microarray test done on both of them to look for genetic mutations that could cause their autism. \u00a0We know that they are in fact identical twins because we had genetic testing done that confirmed this. \u00a0So imagine our surprise when the tests came back with different, non-overlapping mutations.\n\nTwin A has two smaller copy number mutations (copy loss) located on two chromosomes while Twin B has one larger copy number mutation (copy loss) on a different chromosome. \u00a0All three mutations have appeared in various studies that looked for rare mutations in autism, although none of them was a major finding.\n\nLet me say that again - identical twins who have different genetic mutations. \u00a0Clearly these mutations cannot have been\u00a0inherited.\n\nJust a few other, more technical points. \u00a0The twins were dichorionic-diamniotic twins which is just a fancy way of saying that they split relatively early (1 to 3 days) and had separate placentas and separate amniotic sacs. \u00a0In other words, they shared about the same amount of their prenatal environment as fraternal twins do.\n\nFurthermore, their mutations do not show any evidence of being in only some of their cells not more others because the test we used would have picked up on that (ok, not strictly true, but true enough for this discussion). \u00a0This means that the mutations had to have happened very near to conception when there were very few cells so that the mutation would effect all of their cells.\n\nSo when you put these facts together you are left with the conclusion that these mutations happened at some point after they split off from each other (1 to 3 days) but early enough that whatever caused the mutations hit them both and could change most of their cells \u00a0(first 9 or so days). \u00a0I have no idea what that event was but I would guess that something strong enough to cause permanent genetic damage would also be able to cause autism.\n\nSo what do you think, do these mutations cause autism or does whatever causes autism also cause these mutations as a side effect?\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/09/genetic-mutations-in-autism-cause-or.html", "title": "\nGenetic Mutations in Autism - Cause or Effect?\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, November 4, 2010", "body": "\nOne of the top questions about autism today is whether autism is becoming more common or whether we are simply getting better at recognizing it. \u00a0But while there have been many attempts in recent memory to answer this question, no one has been able to definitely say one way or the other what is going on.\n\nRecently, a paper entitled \"Trends in the Prevalence of Autism on the Basis of Special Education Data\"1 was published in Pediatrics that took a slightly different approach to the subject. \u00a0In this paper, researchers looked at special education data from Wisconsin and concluded that it looked like the prevalence of autism in school districts seemed to be leveling off.\n\nTo reach these conclusions, the researchers took publicly available educational statistics2 for public elementary schools in Wisconsin and used it to calculate a special education autism prevalence by year (2002 to 2008) for each of the 415 school districts. \u00a0They then grouped the schools into eight groups based on the \u00a0autism prevalence in 2002 - these groups are called octiles. \u00a0The first octile contained all of the districts with the highest prevalence while the eighth contained the districts with the lowest prevalence.\n\nWhen they analyzed the resulting data, the researchers found that the autism prevalence in the highest octile did not increase nearly as much as the other seven. \u00a0Their results looked approximately like the chart I produced below.\n\n\n\nAs you can see on the chart, the line representing the top octile is increasing slowly while the lines for the seven other octiles are increasing faster and seem to be converging on the top line. \u00a0The researchers took this as evidence that the grown of autism prevalence in Wisconsin seems to to be \"leveling off\" as it approaches the level of the highest octile.\n\nThe crux of the paper's argument is that to properly see this leveling off you have to consider changes in smaller areas that are \"not necessarily influenced by special eduction practices in surrounding areas\". \u00a0The idea is to try and separate out the effect of changing special education policies from an actual increase in autism prevalence. \n\nWhile this argument sounds good in theory, I don't think it is realistic in practice. \u00a0The reasons get a little involved and I am going to talk about them in some depth below. \u00a0But, for those of you who don't want all of the details, the short version is that it isn't that the prevalence is leveling off but rather it is becoming more uniform. \u00a0Instead of having a large variation in autism prevalence by area, we are instead seeing a more consistent range across all of the areas. \u00a0But still, the overall trend shown by the data is up and autism is still becoming more common in Wisconsin, at least by special education measures.\n\nBefore I start, let me say that all of the data in those post came from the same publicly available source that the paper used. \u00a0I tried to match what the paper did as closely as possible but there are some differences between my numbers and the ones used in the paper.\n\nThe major difference was that I included data from 2009 while the paper only included up to 2008. \u00a0I don't know why the paper stopped at 2008 - I suppose it is possible that the data was not available when they pulled their data. \u00a0I don't think that is too likely since the paper said the data was downloaded only six weeks ago (Sept 13, 2010), but who knows. \u00a0Other than that, there are a few places were I arrived at a slightly different number than the paper had but I don't think any of these differences are significant.\n\nOk, first of all, you have to keep in mind what these numbers represent and what they don't represent. \u00a0These numbers represent the number of children in Wisconsin public schools that have a primary special education label of autism. \u00a0These numbers do not represent all of the children in Wisconsin who have a diagnosis of autism (a medical diagnosis is a different than a special education label). \u00a0There are going to be other children in the same age group who do not go to public school, who have a diagnosis of autism but not a primary special eduction label of autism, or who don't have a diagnosis of autism but have a special education label of one so that they are eligible for services. \u00a0Or any permutation of the above.\n\nSo you can't look at these numbers by themselves and say that autism is becoming more common. \u00a0You can, however, compare the trends seen in these numbers to the trends seem in other data sets - such as national surveys or HMO medical records - and see that the general trend shown by all of the data is up. \u00a0But that is a topic for another time.\n\nThe first problem with the analysis done in the paper is that there are a lot of very small school districts in Wisconsin and the prevalence per 1,000 in this districts can move violently with the addition of even a single child. \u00a0Take or example the district \"Dover #1\" which had a total of 92 elementary students in 2002. \u00a0This district had 1 child with a label of autism, \u00a0giving it a prevalence of 10.9 per 1,000 children, and placing it in the highest octile in 2002. \n\nIf you added a second child to the district, that would basically double the prevalence and take it to 21.5 per 1,000. \u00a0If you took one child away, the district would have dropped from the highest octile all the way down to the lowest octile. \u00a0Quite a big swing.\n\nThe point is that even a change of a single child is enough to skew the results when the total numbers are small. \u00a0While there is no hard and fast rule about how many children you would need to get a reliable estimate, you can safely say that you need more than 100. \n\nSince the \"accepted\" rate of autism in 2002 was something like 6.6 per 1,000, I think you would need to have at least 500 children in your group to overcome this bias. \u00a0With 500 children, changing the number of children with autism by 1 will move the resulting figure by 2 per 1,000 while with 100 children a change of 1 child will result in a change of 10 per 1,000. \n\nUnfortunately, less than half of the school districts in this paper had more than 500 students. \u00a0When you look at the octiles in the paper, almost 60% of the highest octile and 80% of the bottom octile had less than 500 students. \u00a0That means that those two octiles are going to be heavily influenced by districts that can be moved by the addition or\u00a0subtraction\u00a0of a single child with the label of autism.\n\nWhich brings me to the second problem - availability of services. \u00a0The paper makes the assumption that the smaller geographic areas - especially ones with higher prevalence - are not going to be as heavily influenced by overall policy changes as larger ones would be. \u00a0It argues that the highest octile represents the vanguard of the shift towards a higher acceptance of autism. \u00a0These districts would be the early adopters if you will, and the rest of the districts are simply playing catch up.\n\nThe problem is, if this is true, that these districts would attract students from the surrounding areas because of the better services offered. \u00a0I can tell you from experience that parents who children have autism compare notes about how good the services offered by a certain school district are. \u00a0If there is a district in an area that has better services available than the others, parents can either ask their local district to send their children to the other district or move into the other district to access the services. \u00a0This exporting of children with autism would be especially common in districts with poor or no services.\n\nOn the flip side, districts with poor services are going to attract fewer children. \u00a0Parents will seek out and move into districts with better services or, failing that, will pull their children out of the public school system altogether and send them to private school or home school them.\n\nBut over time, as the lagging districts start catching up with the early adopters, parents will have less incentive to move to other districts and will be more likely to send their children to their current district.\u00a0\u00a0This would result in the districts with better services losing students (or not growing as fast) and the lagging districts gaining students more rapidly.\n\nThe net effect would be that the prevalence would become more even across the districts over time,\u00a0independent\u00a0of any real increase or decrease in prevalence. \u00a0I think that is what the Wisconsin special education figures \u00a0actually show.\n\nTo\u00a0give a theoretical example, assume that you have two adjacent school districts (A and B) that both have 1,000 students, 5 of whom have a special education label of autism. \u00a0The one district (A) has better services than the other (B), so 3 of the students with autism from B switch to A. \u00a0So District A starts off with 8 students with autism (8 per 1,000) while district B only has 2 (2 per 1,000).\n\nNow assume over the next few years that two things happen. First, the rate of autism doubles so that both districts would have 10 children with autism. \u00a0Second, the services between the two districts even out and, as a result, the children who switched to A go back to B. \u00a0The net effect would be that district A goes from 8 students to 10 while B goes from 2 to 10. \u00a0If you then compared their relative growths, you could conclude that B is simply catching up to the higher rate in A and that A isn't growing as fast as B. \u00a0This is what the paper concluded \u00a0- but that isn't the complete picture.\n\nIf that example is a bit too theoretical for you, how about a real one from the Wisconsin data. \u00a0Consider two adjacent districts in northwest Wisconsin - Amery and Clayton - and their seven surrounding school districts. \u00a0In 2002, these districts were both included the top octile with Amery having a total of 7 children with autism out of 835 students and Clayton having 6 out of 205. \u00a0These two districts had a total of 13 children and 1,050 students for a combined rate of 12.5 per 1,000. \u00a0In 2002, the other seven surrounding districts had a total of 16 children with autism out of a total of 3,545 students, or 4.5 per 1,000. \n\nIn 2009 Amery and Clayton decreased to a combined 10 students with autism out of 983 students (10.2 per 1,000) while the surrounding seven districts increased increased to 30 out of 4,247 or 7.1 per 1,000. \u00a0Now, does that mean that that the surrounding districts are simply coming up to the level of Amery and Clayton or are the students with autism simply being more evenly distributed?\n\nIf you look at the chart below, I think the answer is clear. \n\n\n\nThe prevalence of autism in these nine districts are getting closer together but, as you can see from the red trend line, the overall trend of the data is going up.\n\nNow consider the fact that Amery and Clayton were in the top octile group while none of the other surrounding districts were and I think you can see what is going on with the data. \u00a0If you look at the change in prevalence data for all of the districts state wide, you can see a similar pattern.\n\n\n\nIt is a little hard to see, but the overall trend is that the prevalences are becoming less varied and grouped closer together - meaning that the prevalence is becoming more uniform. \u00a0And, the overall trend across all of the data, as shown by the trend line, is heading up.\n\nTo address the problems of sample size and availability of services, you have to consider a wider area. \u00a0I know the idea of the paper was to look for localized trends in the data but, as I have shown, areas this small are going to be effected by the services offered by their neighboring regions and have few enough children that even a small change in the number of children with autism can greatly change the result. \n\nTo that end, I grouped the data based on Wisconsin's 12 CESA areas and charted the result. \u00a0While these regions are not equal in size - the smallest had 8,000 elementary students in 2009 while the largest had 138,746 - they do have the advantages of not being so easily skewed because of small numbers and getting rid of some of the noise created by services. \u00a0As you can see below, the result is quite different when you look at it like this.\n\n\n\nAll of the CESA showed a similar gain over the seven year period and the overall trend is unmistakable - the prevalence is going up. \u00a0It would be tempting to look at a chart like this and assume that autism did become much more common over this time period, but you have to remember what this data is and what it isn't. \u00a0You can't look at special education numbers alone and conclude that autism is increasing.\n\nHowever, I do think it is clear that the special education prevalence of autism in Wisconsin is not showing any signs of leveling off.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

{"date": "Wednesday, August 11, 2010", "body": "\nAs I talked about a few weeks back, California has been experiencing an outbreak of whooping cough (pertussis) over the past two or three months. \u00a0For a while there were a lot of articles and blog posts about how this outbreak was the fault of the \"anti-vaxers\" but fortunately these articles have mostly died down. \n\nHowever, these articles and posts were replaced by ones calling this the\u00a0\"worst outbreak in 50 years\".\n\nAs I have pointed out a few times, there are likely many reasons why we are seeing increases in the number of cases.  The reasons range from \u00a0problems with the vaccine not working as well as it could to the fact that the vaccine only lasts for about a decade before it no longer provides protection to the fact that the outbreak in California might be occurring in groups that don't have good access to health care.\n\nRegardless of the reasons, an epidemic of whooping cough has been declared in California.  But we are really in the midst of the \"worst outbreak in 50 years\" or is something else going on?\n\nTo answer that question, I looked at the numbers published by the CDC in the past several years to see how the current year compares to previous years.  I took the total number of provisional pertussis cases reported week by week for the first 7 months of the year for 2004, 2005, 2009, and 2010.  I selected 2005 because that was the year of the last whooping cough outbreak and 2004 and 2009 are included as comparison points.\n\nI think it is worth noting that the numbers that the CDC publishes can be different that the numbers that you here from other sources.  For example, one source\u00a0from several weeks back says that as of June 30th there were 1,337 cases reported in California yet the CDC's most recent published data only shows 809.  The differences between the numbers could be caused by a number of factors such as how a case is confirmed (some tests are more accurate than others) or any delay in reporting cases to the CDC. \u00a0But I don't think the differences are significant here because it is the trends that I am looking at, not the absolute numbers.\n\nSo, without further ado, first up we have California.\n\n\nAs you can see on the chart above, there are clearly more cases at this point in the year than in any of the prior years included.  There is no doubt that California is having a epidemic of whooping cough.  However, the total number of cases have basically been flat for the past 3 weeks, so perhaps the outbreak is already winding down.  Only time will tell for certain.\n\nBut that is California, what about the country as a whole?\n\n\nThis chart tell a different story.  For the country as a whole, we are experiencing a milder year this year than the other years included.  The year to date numbers are slightly below the numbers from 2004 and well below the numbers for 2005 and 2009.  So when you look at the entire country, we are clearly not having the worst year in 50 years.\n\nSo what does the state by state picture look like?  The following chart is showing the total number of cases for 2009 and 2010 on a state level as of July 31st. \n\n\nIt may be a little hard to see on the chart (click on it to see a larger version) but more than half of the states are showing less cases than last year while only a few are showing more.  This tells me that while there are areas of the country that are having outbreaks the rest of the country is doing better than it did last year.\n\nOverall, the picture is mixed. \u00a0There are a few states that are having outbreaks but the rest of the country is doing pretty good. \u00a0Only time will tell what the final numbers of this year are but it isn't shaping up to be the worst in 50 years.\n\nP.S. If you live in an area that is having an outbreak, come into close contact with young children, and it has been over ten years since your last shot, you may want to talk to your doctor about getting one.\n\nUPDATE\nIf figures. \u00a0The data stays basically flat for three weeks so I think it is safe to write about this topic and then the CDC goes and\u00a0publishes a new data point that changes what I just got done saying. \n\nThe new figures for the week ending Aug 7th show a massive increase in the total number of cases in California. \u00a0The prior weeks total for California was 809 but the new total number is 1,964, a staggering increase. \u00a0However, the number of new cases for the current week was only 17. \n\nI guess that most of these cases were for past weeks and just now percolated into the CDC's numbers but I have to admit I am a little confused. \u00a0The\u00a0definitive\u00a0test for whooping cough takes about a week to get results back and the data for\u00a0California\u00a0has been flat for the past three weeks. \u00a0So either there is a backlog in testing, a significant delay in reporting to the CDC, or something else going on with the numbers.\n\nThe new total number for the US also jumped from 7,781 to 9,412, - a change of 1,631 - with a weekly change of 210. \u00a0Most of this total change was driven by the California change (1,155) and by a jump in North Caroline from 0 to 123 cases. \n\nThe new number means that the total number of cases in the US are now above 2004 and 2009 but still below 2005.\n\nOn the state by state level, the picture does not change too much. \u00a0Well over half of states are still showing a decrease from last year and only two more states switched from basically unchanged to showing a\u00a0noticeable\u00a0increase.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh3.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SrmRHcqkJ-I/AAAAAAAAADM/0cAcTUk5WG8/s1600/vac.png", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38447752/ns/health-infectious_diseases/", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5926a5.htm?s_cid=mm5926a5_x", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/health/22whoop.html", "//4.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TGM3i6a3SBI/AAAAAAAAASA/eXlh0VRWNLc/s1600/pertussis_july_2010_CA.gif", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TGM3oGLfwMI/AAAAAAAAASI/XivR812S4c0/s1600/pertussis_july_2010_US.gif", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TGM3z_TQ7tI/AAAAAAAAASQ/5krCq7YkHl0/s1600/pertussis_july_2010_states.gif", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5931md.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/pertussis-outbreak-in-california.html", "title": "\nThe Pertussis Outbreak in California (Updated)\n"},

And my family has, like every other autism family out there, encountered some degree of hostility from the public at large when we take our children out in public.  I fully expect to have to keep explaining my children's disability to strangers for decades to come.\n\nI get all that and it is par for the course for an autism parent. \u00a0What I have a hard time understanding are people who are\u00a0utterly\u00a0ignorant of what autism is and yet seem to feel the need to share their ignorance with the world. \n\nTake for example a comment that I saw earlier today on a story about Sharron Angle.  Some person calling themselves \"behyndblueeyes\" took the time to write something so absurd that I can't even begin to describe it, you have to read it for yourself.\n\nI can't seem to find a way to get a direct link to the comment, but the time on the comment is 9/27/2010 2:04:17 PM so if you scroll through the comments, you should be able to find it. \n\nHere is the text of the comment -\nIt is my understanding that some parents of autistic children are exploiting the system. They coach their children to behave as mentally challenged when they visit a doctor. Many of whose children have no such handicap, however these parents will seek out a doctor that will make a claim of such a handicap. As a result, parents of these so called \"autistic children\" receive an extra $500 monthly payment given to them by the taxpayer to assist in their child's needs. Of course, that isn't how it works. The parents simply have another $500 a month coming from the taxpayers to squander on their own pleasures.So yes, there are grounds to question the legitimacy of autism claims.Anyone with an adolescent child can make these claims, coach them to appear abnormal and silent in the presence of their doctor to steal from the taxpayers. I would suggest that all claims of autism requires an MRI scan to help determine whether a child truly has this condition.I can only marvel at the sheer ignorance of this person and the lack of facts in their comment. \n\nI don't know if you could teach a teenager to \"act autistic\" or not, but I can't believe for a second that any qualified doctor would be so easily fooled. \u00a0I am not saying that it could never happen, but the kid would have to be a\u00a0tremendous actor to pull it off and, even then, there are many involuntary tells that would give them away (hint - watch the kids eyes to see what they look at). \u00a0Plus that ignores the fact that there are psychological tests like the ADOS that are designed to help diagnosis autism. \u00a0It isn't just a matter of having your kid not talk and flap their arms in the doctor's office, there would be so much more to it than that.\n\nI don't know of any government program that gives parents $500 a month for having a child with autism. \u00a0Maybe there are such programs in other states, but I have never heard of one. \n\nAnd then, to suggest that an MRI be\u00a0performed\u00a0to somehow validate the claim of autism. \u00a0I have to wonder what they think an MRI will show. \u00a0Apparently they have not taken the time to even look up basic facts about autism. \u00a0If they had, they would have know that there are no\u00a0quantitative\u00a0tests for\u00a0diagnosing\u00a0autism - you can't tell from an MRI, blood, or other physical test that someone has autism.\n\nI would like to think that this sort of ignorance is rare, but\u00a0unfortunately\u00a0it is not. \u00a0If you look at some of the other comments on this story, you will be treated to other opinions that are just as bad as this.\n\nI think it is important to remember\u00a0that addressing this sort of ignorance needs to be one of the main goals of the autism community. \u00a0It is too easy to look inward and argue amongst ourselves about vaccines, causation, \u00a0difference vs disability, functioning level, or other such minutia and forget that the rest of the world is rather ignorant about autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.rgj.com/article/20100927/NEWS/100927030/1321/news/Federal-official-in-Reno-says-Angle-s-comments-on-autism-%E2%80%98a-real-blow-to-kids--", "http://www.rgj.com/comments/article/20100927/NEWS/100927030/Federal-official-in-Reno-says-Angle-s-comments-on-autism-a-real-blow-to-kids-?s=d"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/09/jabberwocky-of-day-faking-autism.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Faking Autism\n"},

After all, the parents often just imagine effects or are mistaken about what they say.  Or perhaps you have heard the line that correlation and causation are not the same thing and just because there is a correlation does not mean one thing caused another.  \n\nNow, while both of the above statements are true - anecdotal reports are not strong of evidence and just because one event follows another doesn't mean that they are related - the ND movement likes to beat people over the head with these lines to the point of absurdity.  In my experience, they will disbelieve every anecdotal report and will simply refuse to consider that a temporal relation can have any sort of significance whatsoever.\n\nYou think that your child regressed into autism immediately after getting a shot, you just missed the earlier signs.\n\nYou think that a diet helped your child, you are imagining things.\n\nYou think that a specific intervention really helped - you don't know what they would have done without the intervention, maybe they would have progressed naturally.\n\nYou really can't read anything that the movement writes for any length of time without running head first into some form of these statements.  I think these are almost slogans for the movement, right after their autism isn't a disorder and acceptance rhetoric.\n\nSo, imagine my surprise when over at the neurodiversity blog, we have statements by Kathleen Seidel using anecdotal parent reports from message boards as some sort of \"proof\" that OSR #1 has side effects -\nContrary to Prof. Haley\u2019s suggestion that there have been no \u201csevere\u201d side effects associated with OSR, and contrary to Dr. Kartzinel\u2019s assertion that adverse events have been \u201crare,\u201d as soon as OSR went on the market, numerous anecdotal reports of side effects began to appear on online discussion groups frequented by parents of autistic children \u2014 most notably the 6,465-member ChelatingKids2 Yahoo! group. The volume of these reports slowed after the establishment of several new restricted-membership groups for discussion of OSR were established in the Spring of 2009, and since ChelatingKids2 was suspended the following August. Notwithstanding the slowing of open public discussion about OSR by its purchasers, the informal reports that have accumulated since its introduction into commerce provide compelling indications of OSR\u2019s potential to significantly, unpredictably alter human fluid balance, disrupt mineral metabolism, and negatively affect gastrointestinal, respiratory and immune function, and should give pause to anyone tempted to trust the safety assurances of those who stand to profit from its continued sale.You have got to be kidding me, parental reports are now a compelling indication?  What the hell, have these people never heard of intellectual honesty?  If you are going to take an approach, then at have the integrity to stick to your beliefs and not flip flop at a moments notice.  Parental reports can't be a valid source of information on one hand and completely disregarded on the other.\n\nHypocrites.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//4.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SuZliAO_XGI/AAAAAAAAAFc/slKqD7F3ZGc/s1600-h/jabberwocky.jpg", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/207/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/07/neurodiversitys-hypocrisy.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity's Hypocrisy\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, April 17, 2010", "body": "\nOver at the Natural Variation blog, Joseph has a post up where he is trying to say that the \"anti-vax\" movement is losing steam.  Ignoring for a moment the pejorative label \"anti-vax\", the idea behind the post is that media is losing interest in stories about a possible connection between vaccines and autism and the number of submissions to VAERS claiming autism is falling.\n\nI think both measures are of questionable value, to say the least.  Google news archive only includes selected sources while ignoring others, such as blogs or sites behind paywalls, so it can hardly be though of as an accurate measure of interest.  As for VAERS, it wasn't meant to do this sort of tracking nor is it an accurate measure of all children who had a reaction to a vaccine - especially for controversial relationships like autism.\n\nOr in other words, Joseph's charts don't show anything meaningful.\n\nBut, what is good for the goose is good for the gander.  I decided to do my own version of Joseph's analysis, this time on the media's interest in the neurodiversity movement.  So without further ado, here are two pretty charts for you to look at.\n\nIn the following charts, the \"Neurodiversity\" label refers to the number of stories returned by Google News Archive per year for the search term \"neurodiversity and autism\".  The \"Vaccine\" labels refers to stores per year for the term \"autism and vaccine\".  Finally, the \"autism\" label refers to stories per year for the term \"autism\". \u00a0Obviously, the data for 2010 is incomplete as it is only April.\n\nThe first chart is absolute number of stories per year in each of the three categories.  See if you can find the \"neurodiversity\" point (hint, it hit its high point in 2008 with 35 stories).\n\n\nThis second chart is the number of stories for neurodiversity and vacancies, represented as the number of stories per 100 (or basically percent of stories per topic).  To make it easier to find the neurodiversity line I made it extra bold in this chart.\n\n\nI think the conclusion is clear. \u00a0While it is possible that the \"anti-vax\" movement is losing steam, the neurodiversity movement isn't even on the radar.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2010/04/medias-interest-in-anti-vaccine.html", "http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/index.php", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S8nNa5k8m7I/AAAAAAAAAOI/lJupJoulOEI/s1600/TotalStories.gif", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S8nNhVF2JfI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/caiumu8sCC8/s1600/StoriesPer100.gif"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/04/medias-interest-in-neurodiversity.html", "title": "\nThe Media's Interest in the Neurodiversity Movement\n"},

I know I run across those statements quite often when I read stories about autism in the media and even in scientific studies. But the more I read, the more I have to wonder if statements like these are correct. \u00a0Is autism somehow a part of who a person is or is it rather a condition that\u00a0develops\u00a0in response to\u00a0the interaction between a person's genes and the environment?\n\nWhy is it that, after years and years of searching for the genetic culprits behind autism, we still have no clear picture as to what genetic changes could be responsible for the majority of cases of autism. \u00a0Sure, we have found some changes that are in some tiny group (1% - 2%) that might play some role in autism. \u00a0If you add up all of these small groups, you might make it to 10% or 20% of all cases but that is a big if built on the back of an even larger maybe. \n\nOverall, the idea that autism is predominately genetic has not gotten us very far in our pursuit to understand what autism is and how it can be treated or cured. The good news is that some scientists are (finally) seeing the problem and research is slowly shifting from genetic based studies toward ones that look more at the biology and possible environmental triggers\u00a0of autism.\n\nConsider this opinion article that was just published in the online journal Autism Insights that talks about the preconceived notion that autism is psychiatric condition, present from birth, and how this idea has held back research into the cause, prevention, or cure of autism.  I think the conclusion of the article summarizes the problem better than I could ever hope to and, since the article is licensed under a\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution license, I am including the text below.  Enjoy.\n\n~~~\n\nReconceptualizing Autism: Moving Beyond the Behavioral to Address Cause, Cure and Prevention\nKerrie Shandley and David W. Austin\nAutism Insights 2010:2 25-30\n\nConclusion -\n\nSome 70 years have passed since autism was first identified, yet we are no closer to understanding what it is caused by, nor how the condition may be cured or prevented. We argue that this lack of progress is at least partially attributable to Kanner and the manner in which he conceptualized autism as a parentally-mediated psychopathology. Why do we need to be concerned about this? Simply put, autism is a devastating condition, lifelong in duration, with the majority of afflicted individuals requiring supported living arrangements. The majority of sufferers will never engage in meaningful employment, marry nor have children, and cannot engage in meaningful conversation. Autism affects not only the individual, but the family unit and community as a whole.\n\nTo avoid simply treading the same unfruitful path of the previous 70 years, we would suggest an urgent revision of autism as a disease state such that its operationalization in major diagnostic systems such as the DSM and International Classification of Diseases recognizes biological variables known to be associated with autism. The affect of this would be to facilitate a more multi-disciplinary and inclusive range of health disciplines to research the biological bases of autism. Improving our understanding of these bases is a fundamental way of addressing the touchstones of medical research into autism; cause, cure, prevention and treatment.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://la-press.com/reconceptualizing-autism-moving-beyond-the-behavioral-to-address-cause-a1996", "http://la-press.com/journal.php?journal_id=155&pa=about_this_journal", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/04/rethinking-autism.html", "title": "\nRethinking Autism\n"},

{"date": "Monday, April 5, 2010", "body": "\nAri Ne'eman does not talk about autism.\n\nOr at least he doesn't talk about what I understand the word \"autism\" to mean. \u00a0If you look on the web or ask any medical expert, you will get a fairly consistent definition of what the word means. \u00a0To pick one of the first sources that appears when you search for \"autism\" on Google\u00a0(The Mayo Clinic), autism is -\n\nAutism is one of a group of serious developmental problems called autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that appear in early childhood \u2014 usually before age 3. Though symptoms and severity vary, all autism disorders affect a child's ability to communicate and interact with others.\n\n\nIt's estimated that three to six out of every 1,000 children in the\u00a0United States have autism \u2014 and the number of diagnosed cases is rising. It's not clear whether this is due to better detection and reporting of autism, a real increase in the number of cases, or both.\n\n\nWhat is clear is that though there is no cure for autism, intensive, early treatment can make an enormous difference in the lives of many children with the disorder.\n\n\nI think that most people would agree the above definition is what we mean when we talk about autism. \u00a0Unfortunately, Mr. Ne'eman does not seem to be among those who would agree. \u00a0I am not sure of exactly how he defines the word but as you will see below, he isn't talking about what you and I call autism.\n\nAs the picture at the top of the post says, autism is not a\u00a0tragedy\u00a0but ignorance is. \u00a0I would agree completely with that statement. \u00a0A person who has autism is not a tragedy but rather needs help to overcome their disability. \u00a0But ignorance of autism means - especially in one who should know better - is tragic.\n\nMr. Ne'eman, as a young adult with autism, should have a better understanding of what exactly autism is and what challenges it brings to children. \u00a0Yet he talks almost exclusively about his own needs and the needs of other similar people who have taken refuge in the idea that autism is some sort of culture rather than a developmental disorder. \u00a0He should know better but either fails to grasp the problems that autism that causes for children or chooses to ignore them.\n\nI think have already made my opinion on Mr. Ne'eman clear, so this time I will let his words stand for themselves. \u00a0The following are a collection of quotes from articles about Mr. Ne'eman or ones that he has written himself. \u00a0As you read the quotes below, keep in mind the definition of autism above, and then you be the judge of whether he is talking about autism.\n\nWho is Ari Ne'eman\nNe'eman is a master networker, a guy you'd think was born in a campaign office and bred in the halls of the Capitol. He's fluent in policy-speak and interacts seamlessly with high-level officials (he's just had lunch with the acting vice chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) and inquisitive reporters alike. He's formal but sociable and has a well-timed sense of humor.\n\nAutism is not a disabilityThe day will come when Asperger's will be recognized for what it truly is: a difference, not a disability, and in many ways an advantage.\nDisabled by society, not autismNe'em describes Asperger's and autism as disabilities \u2014 but with a twist. \"We're disabled by society,\" he says. \"What disables us is, for instance, an education system that's only designed to meet the needs of one kind of student, or societal prejudices which say that autistic people will never be able to live in a community.\"\nAutism is who a person is\u00a0\"Autism disorders exist along a spectrum, with great variance from one person to another. Ne'em argues that his condition is part of his identity, the same way gender or ethnic background might be. \"We are proud of who we are,\" he says\"\nAutism is a culture, not a disability\"Too often, he says, the voices of those with autism are supplanted or diminished by those who do not have it. Ne'eman is especially troubled by those who argue that autism is a disorder to be eradicated \u2013 and not a culture to be embraced.\"\nAutism as a culture needs tolerance, not a cureThe object of autism advocacy should not be a world without autistic people \u2014 it should be a world in which autistic people can enjoy the same rights, opportunities and quality of life as any of our neurotypical peers.\nAutism is a civil rights movementAs with previous civil rights movements regarding race religion, gender, and sexual orientation, we need an autism and disability advocacy that aims to change our society's institutions \u2014 from our educational system and places of public accommodation to more specialized infrastructures such as those for long-term care.\nResearch is the battlefield of the Autism civil rights momentIn many instances, the answers are not yet apparent for us, particularly in realms like communication, which poses one of the most pressing and important areas of challenge for our community. However, our existing autism advocacy and research agendas have not placed finding solutions to these issues high on their agendas, preferring to focus on environmental or genetic research aimed at providing for \"cure\" or \"recovery,\" If we make the effort, we are likely to find ourselves surprised by what a true civil rights struggle will yield for us.\nAutism doesn't need a cureAutism is not a medical mystery that needs solving, he argues. It's a disability, yes, but it's also a different way of being, and \"neurodiversity\" should be accepted by society. Autistic people (he prefers this wording to \"people with autism,\" a term many parents use, because he considers the condition intrinsic to a person's makeup) must be accommodated in the classroom and workplace and helped to live independently as adults\u2014and he is pushing to make this happen for everyone on the spectrum.\nMainstream Autism cures are junkEven a cursory glance at the magazine of the Autism Society of America reveals many such examples, with advertisements for vaccine recovery and Applied Behavioral Analysis, whose initial aversive-heavy experiments claimed to bring half of all children subjected to its methods to \"indistinguishability from peers.\" These programs lack the research foundation they claim. For example, Ivar Lovaas' promise of recovery through ABA was based on the theory and methods used with \"feminine boys\" at-risk for homosexuality (Rekers & Lovaas 1974). That fact alone should give anyone pause.\nRecovery from autism would be \"ridiculous\"The oft-cited concept of \"recovery\" from autism is not only scientifically unsupported but also dangerous in that it removes the very supports that made progress possible for many people with autism. Moreover, by equating developmental progress with a change in the fundamental character of our brains, the recovery concept denies the natural growth and skill acquisition that occurs for all individuals, regardless of disability. It is unreasonable to assume that autistics will be the same at age 30 as at age 3. The claim that addressing the challenges and behavioral difficulties associated with the autism spectrum can result in a fundamental re-wiring of a person's brain, to the point that he or she is no longer autistic, is ridiculous.\n~~~\n\nI could go on but I think the point is clear. \u00a0Mr. Ne'eman is not talking about autism and\u00a0definitely\u00a0should not be representing people with autism on the National Council on Disability.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S7pqNh3KirI/AAAAAAAAAN4/-nKXIuwI4JQ/s1600/ariignorance.jpg", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/autism/DS00348/DSECTION%3Dsymptoms", "http://www.newsweek.com/id/197813", "http://www.parentdish.com/2005/09/26/aspergers-syndrome-how-do-you-tell-your-child-he-has/#comment", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91054523", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91054523", "http://www.umbc.edu/magazine/winter09/feature_ari.html", "http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1059/1244", "http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1059/1244", "http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1059/1244", "http://www.newsweek.com/id/197813", "http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1059/1244", "http://www.dsq-sds.org/article/view/1059/1244"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/04/ari-neeman-does-not-talk-about-autism.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman Does Not Talk About Autism\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 13, 2010", "body": "\nWhen you talk about autism on the internet you need to be prepared to deal with some unpleasantness. \u00a0As anyone who has participated in the debates surrounding autism would tell you, you have to be prepared to be called names and have your mother's integrity and your father's identity called into question. \u00a0That is par for the course and you have to expect some degree of unpleasantness if you want to participant.\n\nBut what I don't understand are those who feel it is acceptable to question a parent's motives or love for their child. \u00a0Especially when it comes from those people who claim to be all about acceptance of differences.\n\nTake for example what Harold Doherty \u00a0wrote\u00a0recently\u00a0about how he does care for his child. \u00a0I don't know the circumstances of why he wrote what he did, but if you follow what he writes on his site, you would have no doubt that he is very committed to his child and cares deeply for him. \u00a0He should not have to defend himself against attacks that suggest that he doesn't care for his child. \u00a0And yet some person felt that they had the right to question that.\n\nOr take the recent incident involving a post at Age of Autism that was written by Kim Stagliano. \u00a0Ms. Stagliano put up a picture of one of her daughters and suggested that it would be a more appropriate image of autism for Autism Speaks to use. \u00a0In this picture, her 15 year old daughter is standing in the infant toy aisle at Target and is transfixed by the toys. \u00a0It shows, in the words of Ms. Stagliano, \"the pain of a stopped clock\".\n\nI think every parent out there whose child struggles with autism understands exactly what Ms. Stagliano meant by her statement. \u00a0We understand all to well the pain, the struggles, and the battles we have to fight in order to help our children overcome their disorder. \u00a0We have to push our children to work twice as hard as other children in the hopes that they will be able get a tenth as far. \n\nThe reason that we do is that we love our children very much and want the best for them. \u00a0We take joy in who they are and what they have managed to accomplish in spite of being limited by autism. \u00a0But sometimes, in spite of it all, our children do not manage to overcome autism and are, as Ms Stagliano said, stuck in time.\n\nI firmly believe that almost every parent out there understands this idea and felt that way on at least several occasions. \u00a0If they say that they haven't then they are deceiving\u00a0either\u00a0you or themselves.\n\nBut then there are those who argue for \"acceptance\", such as Alan Griswold, who take exception to what Ms. Stagliano had to say. \u00a0I would not have had a problem if Mr. Griswold respectfully disagreed with Ms. Stagliano. \u00a0 And actually, I wouldn't have had a problem if Mr. Griswold less than respectfully disagreed. \u00a0But he went much further than that when he not only disagreed but also insulted Ms. Stagliano and her daughter in his response. \u00a0Below are the main points of his post -\n... would make an excellent choice for an Autism Speaks advertisement. All the essential ingredients are there:A picture of a beautiful autistic child engaged in an interesting, meaningful and no doubt productive activity for her\u2014clearly delighted to no end.A hovering, disapproving parent describing the entire tableau as \u201cpain,\u201d bemoaning the family's autism fate to the entire world, and wishing for someone\u2014anyone\u2014to do something\u2014anything\u2014to bring this horrible ordeal to an end.He finished by saying -\nNow if we could only get Autism Speaks to sponsor some form of cure against the Ms. Staglianos of the world ... I might find myself supporting that organization's eradicating mission.I had prepared some clever retorts to Mr. Griswold's statements, many of them involving profanity, but after thinking about it, I believe a more direct approach is appropriate.\n\nFirst, perseverating on infant toys is not a productive or meaningful activity for a 15 year old. \u00a0To suggest that this is the case is both demeaning to her abilities and an insult to the person that she is. \u00a0Mr. Griswold looked at the picture and made a judgement that obsessing over toys that most of the world's population outgrows by the time that they are two is a meaningful activity for her. \u00a0I can't believe that someone who talks of acceptance and diversity and tolerance would degrade a young adult like that.\n\nSecond, if Mr. Griswold actually took his head out of his ass and took the time to understand what it is like to see your child have to struggle so much and how much we wish we could spare them their suffering, then he would not be able to say such things. \u00a0We don't attempt to treat our children's autism because we feel that they are defective or a burden but rather because we care for them and want the best possible life for them.\n\nLastly, as for the suggestion that Ms. Stagliano needs some sort of \"cure\" or to be \"eradicated\", well, if you think a mother's compassion and caring needs to be eradicated, then you really do have a problem. \n\nIn the end, I think we need less acceptance and more compassion. \u00a0Autism is hard to deal with for everybody involved, regardless of whether you are a parent or the person living with autism.\n\nBut most of all, I think we need a cure for the \"acceptance\"\u00a0of people like Alan Griswold.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TDvG_HIdy7I/AAAAAAAAAQI/TgPY3RcXeJs/s1600/Dunce.jpg", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2010/07/autism-disorders-and-family-conor-has.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/07/this-should-be-autism-speakss-new-ad.html", "http://autisticaphorisms.blogspot.com/2010/07/ugly-face-of-autism.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/07/ugly-face-of-acceptance.html", "title": "\nThe Ugly Face of Acceptance\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 10, 2010", "body": "\nUnless you were not paying attention last month (or possibly in a comma), you were sure to notice the new study involving oxytocin and autism.  In this small study, researchers demonstrated that an inhaled form of oxytocin could improve social behaviors in adults with high functioning autism.  The result is very tentative but, assuming that the results can be replicated in future studies, oxytocin has the potential to be a powerful treatment for people with autism.\n\nThis is not the first study to show a link between autism in oxytocin.  Prior research has shown oxytocin also can help improve other aspects of social behavior, such as emotion recognition, in young adults with autism.  People with autism are known to have genetic defects on genes associated with oxytocin while others have epigentic disregulation of said genes.  It has also been shown that children and adults with autism have lower levels of oxytocin in their blood.\n\nOr in simpler terms, we have a known genetic and environmental issue, a method of detecting the problem, and a potential way to address it.  And, if the current study is any indication, addressing the deficiency has the potential to improve functioning in one of the core deficits of autism, at least in some people with autism.\n\nIf you remember what I wrote a few weeks back, there is some evidence that the first deficits of autism to emerge in infants are social ones and that some of delay in acquiring other skills, such as speech, might be due to problems with social learning.  What would happen if we were able to detect these problems in very young children when they are first developing and correct them?  I am thinking that it would be possible to prevent other problems from developing and help the infant progress at a normal pace.  \n\nThe above is complete speculation on my part and a substantial amount of work still needs to be done before any treatments involving oxytocin are even possible.  But the potential is there for this to become of the first treatments to target the core problems with autism.\n\nWho could possibly be against that?  \n\nWell, Michelle Dawson for one.  As I have written about before, Ms Dawson is one of the people who feel that it is somehow unethical to try to treat autism.  Try as I might, I simply cannot understand why she opposes helping children or adults with autism.  But I can easily point out the absurdity of her arguments against the current study.\n\nAs I said above, the current study demonstrated that oxytocin can improve social functioning and it is the way that it demonstrated this improvement that is the core of what Ms Dawson is objecting to.\n\nThis study was not an extended study of the effectiveness of oxytocin but rather a relatively simple test of whether there was any significant effect.  The researchers were giving a nasal form of oxytocin and the effects of the dose were very short lived.  As a result, the test used had to be a simple yet an effective measure of social functioning.  \n\nThe researchers chose a simulated ball game that was played on a computer with three other players - A, B, and C.  The study participants were under the impression that the other players were real people but, in reality, they were simulated by a computer program.  The way the game was played was that once a player received the ball, they had to chose another player to pass it to.  That player would then in turn pick one of the other players and pass the ball to them.  And so on and so forth.  Each game lasted a good number of rounds (passes).\n\nThe games always started off \"fairly\" and the three computer players (A, B, and C) would pick another participant at random to pass the ball to.  But after a few rounds, the three computer players changed how they decided who to pass the ball to.  \n\nPlayer A (the \"good\" player) would choose to pass the ball more often to the study participant while Player C (the \"bad\" player) would choose not to pass the ball to the study participant very often.  Player B would remain neutral.\n\nTo further stack the deck, the researchers told the participants that each time a player received the ball, they would earn 2 euro.  So when the participant received the ball and earned money, they then had the option of returning the favor to person who passed them the ball or of passing the ball to another player.  Thus, the game was a really a test of reciprocity.  As most knowledgeable people would tell you, reciprocity is one of those social skills that can be disrupted in people with autism.\n\nThe study participants were divided into three groups - a \"normal\" group, a treatment group, and a placebo group.  The treatment group and placebo groups both contained people with autism but the treatment group received a dose of oxytocin while the placebo group received a placebo.\n\nAs would be expected, once the bias of the other players became clear, the \"normal\" participants strongly favored passing the ball to player A (the \"good\" player), presumably because A was much more likely to pass it back to them, and much less likely to pass the ball to player C (the \"bad\" player), presumably because C was not as likely to return the favor.\n\nThe participants in the placebo group, unlike the \"normal\" participants, did not show a preference for passing the ball to any other player but seemed to pass it to the other players almost equally.\n\nHowever, the participants in the oxytocin group more closely resembled the \"normal\" group and showed a preference for passing the ball to player A (the \"good\" player) while excluding player C (the \"bad\" player).\n\nTo confirm these findings, the researchers staged a second trial with a modified game using another group of adults with autism.  The participants were once again divided into placebo and treatment groups but the game was modified to remove all mention of monetary rewards.  The results were again the same, with the placebo group not showing any preference while the treatment group showed a preference for player A while excluding player C.\n\nBased mostly on this finding (and several other secondary findings), the researchers concluded that oxytocin might help restore \"normal\" social functioning in people with autism.  \n\nTo perfectly honest, this test is somewhat simplistic and not very indicative of what oxytocin would do for social skills in general.  Based on the results of this one study, we cannot generalize the finding and say that oxytocin would be a good treatment for autism. \u00a0But for what it is, this study was well done and the results are pretty solid.\n\nNow that I have explained the game, lets return to Michelle Dawson and her opinions of the study.  Ms Dawson apparently feels that the reason the placebo group passed the ball randomly in the face of biased behavior is that -\nThe autistic [placebo group] in contrast displayed no such selfish and discriminatory behaviour. They continued to throw the ball to the other players in equal proportion, ignoring their self-interest in favour of keeping all players equally included.Further, subjective ratings of the other players revealed that the autistic [placebo group] did not have the kinds of biases that are routinely called hypocrisy. They did not judge C, who shared the most with B, as worse or less trustworthy than A, who shared the most with themselves.According to Andari et al. (in press), autistics \"cannot understand or engage in social situations,\" as evidenced by autistics' outstandingly altruistic performance in this game. It is this profound social deficit, this altruistic autistic behaviour, that was targeted for treatment.Basically, Ms Dawson feels that the placebo group was able to understand the social situation and made a conscious choice not to \"judge\" or engage in \"hypocrisy\".  These \"austicis\" took the feelings of the other players into account and decided to act in an altruistic manner so that no other player felt left out.  Taking this argument to the logic conclusion, the treatment group had to have lost the ability to act in an altruistic manner and decided to be hypocritical and purposely exclude the other players from the game.\n\nSince these statements are contrary to everything that we know about autism as well as the very definition of what the medical condition of autism is, I would respectfully suggest a simpler explanation to fit the facts.  The reason that the placebo group acted the way they did because was because they simply failed to react to the social situation.\n\nIf you look at the results of the game in the initial rounds before the other players started showing their biases, the \"normal\" group was sending the ball to the other players equally.  It is only once the bias become obvious that the \"normal\" and treatment groups started changing their actions.  This is a typical - and desirable - social trait.  We are more likely to respond favorably to people who respond favorably to us and less likely to act favorably to those who discriminate against us.\n\nBut Ms. Dawson would have you believe that people with autism someone have a superior grasp of social situations and consciously chose to be altruistic.  \n\nWhich of these sounds like autism to you?\n\n\nReferences\n\nWermter AK, Kamp-Becker I, Hesse P, Schulte-K\u00f6rne G, Strauch K, Remschmidt H.

These observations are reminiscent of cancer, a disease where genomic rearrangements also play a role. We undertook a correlative epidemiological study to explore the possibility that shared risk factors might exist for autism and specific types of cancer.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings\nTo determine if significant correlations exist between the prevalence of autism and the incidence of cancer, we obtained and analyzed state-wide data reported by age and gender throughout the United States. Autism data were obtained from the U.S. Department of Education via the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (2000\u20132007, reported annually by age group) and cancer incidence data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1999\u20132005). IDEA data were further subdivided depending on the method used to diagnose autism (DSM IV or the Code of Federal Regulations, using strict or expanded criteria). Spearman rank correlations were calculated for all possible pairwise combinations of annual autism rates and the incidence of specific cancers. Following this, Bonferroni's correction was applied to significance values. Two independent methods for determining an overall combined p-value based on dependent correlations were obtained for each set of calculations. High correlations were found between autism rates and the incidence of in situ breast cancer (p\u226410\u221210, modified inverse chi square, n = 16) using data from states that adhere strictly to the Code of Federal Regulations for diagnosing autism. By contrast, few significant correlations were observed between autism prevalence and the incidence of 23 other female and 22 male cancers.\n\nConclusions\nThese findings suggest that there may be an association between autism and specific forms of cancer.\n\nThe text of the study is freely available, so I suggest you read it if you are interested\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009372"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/relationship-between-autism-and-cancer.html", "title": "\nRelationship between autism and cancer?\n"},

According to a \"study\" reviewed on Science Daily in \"Health Stories by Experts More Credible Than Blogs\" -\nHealth information written by a doctor is rated as more credible when it appears on a website than in a blog or a homepage, according to a study of college students.Makes sense to me.  \n\nThere is definitely something to be said for information that is written by a knowledgeable professional when compared to what is written by someone like me.  Professionals, such as doctors, should have a more in depth understanding of a topic area and be able to provide more accurate information.\n\nBut, if you notice the the exact wording of the story, they don't say \"accurate\", they say \"credible\".

{"date": "Thursday, July 23, 2009", "body": "\nPhoto by BEN+_+ (flickr)Earlier this year there was a study published in NeuroToxicology that looked at whether there was a relationship between the distance from Superfund sites and autism rates in Minnesota.Ockham\u2019s Razor and autism: The case for developmental neurotoxins contributing to a disease of neurodevelopmentThis study was authored by Catherine Desoto, PhD who is somewhat famous (or infamous) in certain circles for finding a mistake in a published study about the relationship between mercury and autism.  As a result of the mistake, the study in question went from showing no relation between mercury exposure and autism to showing a modest, but not statistically significant, relationship.  See here for more details if you are interested.This study has two major parts.  In the first part the author attempts to make the case for a relationship between toxins in the environment and autism by combining recent research into a coherent theory.  While this part is interesting and worth reading on its own there is no new data to back up the theories.  As a result I am going to skip this part.The main part of the study then looks for a relation between the rate of autism in a school district and the number of Superfund sites within a certain distance.  For each of the 336 school districts in Minnesota that had over 104 students the rate of autism was calculated.  Some of the districts with fewer students and higher number of autism cases were averaged in with the surrounding districts to prevent them from skewing the analysis.The author hypothesized that school districts that had one or more Superfund site within a ten mile radius would have a higher rate of autism than those that did not.The geographic center of each district was computed and the number of Superfund sites within a 10 mile radius of this center was calculated using specialized software.There were 46 school districts that had one or more Superfund sides within a ten mile radius.  For these districts the mean rate of autism was 1 in 92 students.  For the rest of the districts the mean autism rate was 1 in 132.  It is worth noting that both figures are higher than the CDC's recent estimate of 1 in 150.To double check the results the author redid the comparison and looked at school districts that had a Superfund site within 20 miles - the 97 school districts the fell in range had a higher rate of autism as well.So the data support the idea that there is a correlation between the rate of autism and the number of Superfund sites nearby.Unfortunately, the correlation in this case does not mean that the Superfund sites cause autism (correlation vs causation) and the author acknowledges as much.  Some other potential problems are that there is no information about where the families lived during the pregnancy or whether the families moved into particular school districts because of the services offered by the district.  The first fact would be important because it is thought that prenatal toxic exposures are more harmful and more likely to result in autism while the second could potentially skew the rate of autism in each district (i.e. better services attract more children with autism).I think there is something to this idea and that there is a relationship between the toxic chemicals in the environment and autism but this study falls short of showing anything more than a superficial relationship. This study was also written about earlier this year here and here.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3641/3634483641_660b33e094_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/red_gloww/3634483641/", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/0161813X", "http://www.epa.gov/superfund/about.htm", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2009.03.003", "http://www.uni.edu/desoto/desoto_hitlan_autism.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/04/autism-rising-autism-rates-higher-near.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2009/04/children-living-near-toxic-waste-more.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/07/study-watch-case-for-developmental.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : The case for developmental neurotoxins contributing to a disease of neurodevelopment\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 2, 2009", "body": "\nAs reported at the Age of Autism site, there has been some small action in the matter of Brian Deer's reporting in Times.  It was five months ago that Brian Deer's articles appeared in the Times online and four months ago that Dr Wakefield filed a complaint with the UK's Press Complaints Commission (PCC).  The commission has not yet ruled on the complaint but it just recently asked the Times to remove the articles in question from their web site, which they did.As I said before, I did not expect the PCC to take any real action on the case and while the asking the Times to take down the articles for now is a good first step, it is a far cry from actually issuing a ruling in the case.  The PCC's charter promises to \"respond swiftly to your enquiries\" and \"deal with your complaint as quickly as possible ... in an average of 35 working days\".  So are only taking three times longer than they say they would.   OK, in all fairness,  it seems like the majority of the time has been spent waiting for the Times to respond to the complaint - according to the Age of Autism, it took the Times over three months to respond I cannot understand why this is moving so slowing.  I would assume that Brian Deer would have all the facts needed to support his stories and that the fact checking department of the newspaper would have verified the story before it was printed.  If this had happened then then the newspaper should have been able to submit them to the PCC and the complaint should be swiftly resolved.But judging from the delay and the fact that the PCC has asked the Times to take down the stories I am guessing that he does not have the facts to back up his stories.  Maybe it is time for the Times to retract the story and Mr Deer to apologize?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/07/press-complaints-commission-orders-sunday-times-to-remove-deers-stories-on-dr-wakefield.html", "http://www.pcc.org.uk/", "http://www.pcc.org.uk/complaint/charter.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/07/wakefield-and-times.html", "title": "\nWakefield and the Times\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 27, 2009", "body": "\nIn this month's Pediatrics is a study about parent's refusing vaccinations and an increased risk of whooping cough (pertussis) -Parental Refusal of Pertussis Vaccination Is Associated With an Increased Risk of Pertussis Infection in ChildrenThis isn't the type of study I would normally write about because to me it falls into the \"duh\" category.  If you refuse a vaccination for a condition that is in circulation and that vaccine is even  decently effective then it is obvious that you are running a greater risk of contracting the illness.  However, there seems to be misinformation being reported so I thought I should address what is actually contained in the study.The study examined records from the Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO) health plan from 1996 to 2007 looking for cases of whooping cough in children of ages 2 months to 18 years.  Over the 12 year period they found 439 patients with a diagnosis  of pertussis and further narrowed this set down to 165 cases by limiting the group to the appropriate age age and cases that were confirmed using laboratory tests.The vaccination status of each member of the cohort was determined by looking their medical charts and the cohort was broken up into two groups.  The first group is the \"vaccine refusers\" which contains children whose parents refused vaccinations for \"personal, non-medical\" reasons.  The second group contained everyone else - potentially including those who are unvaccinated for medical reasons - the study does not present any information on the composition of this group.I think it is important to note that the study presents no data for the reason that vaccination was refused nor does it make any representations that any of these parents refused vaccinations because of fears of autism.Returning to the 165 cases - a further 9 were excluded because the patients were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated and the reason for the lack of vaccination was not documented.So the final 156 case subjects were randomly matched with 624 control subject by a variety of factors.  The authors excluded 29 of the control subject because the reason for lack of vaccination was not clear leaving 595 in the control group.In the final analysis there were a total of 21 subjects in the case and control group who belonged to the \"vaccine refusers\" group - 18 of the subject were in the group that had whooping cough and 3 were in the group that did not.The authors also performed a similar analysis of on a cohort of 27,748 children who were continuously enrolled in this health plan from 2 months to 20 months.  In this set they matched 31 confirmed cases against 308 controls and found that there were 4 refusers in the case group and 2 who were not.Based on the above data the authors assert that the vaccine refusers are 23 times more likely to develop whooping cough than the control group.  In the secondary data set the figure was more like 19 times more likely.The study seems to be pretty solid but there are a few potential weaknesses -According the the CDC cases of whooping cough are primarily increasing in older children whose vaccinations are beginning to wear off - the vaccine is only effective for 6-10 years.  While the study did provide information about the age brackets of the children in the case and control groups they did not provide information about how the vaccine refuser group was distributed across the age groups.The other problem is that the size of the vaccine refusers group is very small when compared to the total number of subjects ( under 1%)But overall the conclusions of this study are not that surprising.  If you skip vaccinations you are more likely to catch what the vaccination is attempting to prevent.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/6/1446", "http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-05-26-whooping-cough_N.htm", "http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN22371634", "http://autism.about.com/b/2009/05/26/fear-of-autism-raises-rate-of-whooping-cough.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5450a3.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/05/study-watch-parental-refusal-of.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : Parental Refusal of Pertussis Vaccination Is Associated With an Increased Risk of Pertussis Infection in Children\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, March 28, 2010", "body": "\nPresident Obama, with all due respect, you made a mistake when you nominated Ari Ne'eman to serve on the National Council on Disability.  While Mr. Ne'eman has accomplished much in spite of his disability, his views on autism will prevent him from being able to fairly represent the needs of most people with autism.\n\nAutism is a very complex disorder and people with autism have an enormous range of functioning. That is the heart of the problem.  Mr. Ne'eman, and others like him, represent the very pinnacle of what a person with a diagnosis of autism will be capable of.  Mr. Ne'eman appears to be able to function as well as any other non-disabled person would be able to - in spite of his autism.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of people with autism are not so fortunate.\n\nThe least fortunate of this group are locked in their own world and are completely unable to communicate with the outside world.  The majority of people with autism fall somewhere between these two extremes.  As you look at people who suffer from autism, one thing is clear.  Most will have life long struggle to accomplish the things that \"normal\" people take for granted.  They will have a hard time holding down a job, going to college, starting a family, being able to live on their own, or even, in some cases, being able to talk.\n\nThe problem with Mr. Ne'eman is that he feels that the disabling aspects of autism are not caused by the disorder but rather by the prejudices of society.  He seems to think that if society were different that people with autism would not have such a hard time.  And he is partially right, for people like him, the attitudes of society can make a large difference. \n\nBut most people with autism are not like him.  If you were to spend any time watching children with autism, you would know that the disabling aspects of autism are caused by the disorder itself and not by the attitude of a neighbor down the the street.\n\nMr. Ne'eman also feels that evidence based medicine is somehow mistaken in thinking that therapies like Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) can help children with autism learn.  Fortunately, he is mostly alone in these opinions.  There are countless children from around the country that have been helped by therapies such as ABA and almost all major health and autism advocacy organizations support the use of such therapies.\n\nTreatments like ABA can make a large difference in the life of a child.  Just ask any expert in the field whether such treatments can be effective and you will get a responding yes.\n\nBut most importantly, Mr. Ne'eman advocates against looking for the cause of autism and strongly opposes the idea of curing autism.  He is quite happy the way he is and does not want to change.  \n\nHow selfish of him to seek to deny others the chance to be able to do as much with their lives as he has with his.\n\nAutism is a growing health problem that changes the lives of 1 in 110 children in this county today.  At the rate it is growing, it is likely within the next ten years this number will stand at 1 in 50 children. \u00a0There need to be effective treatments for autism.  We, as a country, need to find the answers to want causes this condition and to prevent it, if at all possible.\n\nWe need a cure for autism.\n\nMr. Ne'eman opposes these goals and thus ignores the needs of those most challenged by autism.  He is not qualified to speak for their needs, he is only speaking for the needs of other extremely high functioning individuals like him.\n\nPresident Obama, you might have had good intentions in nominating Ari Ne'eman, but you made a mistake.  Let me put this in simple terms.  If we were talking about people who were unable to walk and were confined to a wheel chair, Mr. Ne'eman would be up walking around with just have a minor limp and advocating against the use of wheel chairs. \n\nThere are other people with autism who you could nominate that would do a better job of representing the needs of all people with autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncd.gov/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/03/ari-neeman-should-not-serve-on-national.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman should not serve on the National Council on Disability\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 16, 2010", "body": "\nLet me first start off by saying that I know I have been talking about the following subject too much for the past week. \u00a0I promise that this will be my last post on the subject for a while. \u00a0I have several other topics that I want to write about but I seem to keep getting stuck on this one particular subject. \u00a0I hope with this one last post I will get this it out of my system...\nAs I said a few days ago, the neurodiversity movements seems to have reached a turning point. \u00a0Up until now they have claimed to speak for all people with autism and have presented a (mostly) unified front against those who dare question their views about autism.\u00a0\u00a0 If you are unfamiliar with their views, I suggest you look at some of the other things I have written on the subject as well as look as what other people have have written. \u00a0As always, do not take what I write at face value and go evaluate the information that is out there for yourself.\nThe fundamental idea of neurodiversity is not a bad one. \u00a0It basically says that everyone is different and rather than forcing people to comply with some idealized concept of\u00a0normalcy we should learn to accept people for who they are. \u00a0A person with a condition like autism is not necessarily \"damaged\" or defective but rather different and, with the correct supports, they will be able to function in society as well as anyone else. \u00a0\nBut, like other\u00a0ideological\u00a0movements, the devil is in the details. \u00a0In the case of the ND movement, what started out as acceptance has turned into a rigid belief that autism is not a disorder and that it is society, not the medical condition of autism, that makes people with autism disabled.\nThis rigidity should not have survived past the first time one of the ND members met a child who suffers from autism. \u00a0They should have seen that it is not some sort of society norm that disrupts the ability of a young child to engage their parent and to communicate their basic needs but rather something that disrupts the biology of a rapidly growing and developing body. \u00a0This disruption continues from a young age and cascades into the condition that we call autism. \u00a0Some few people have learned to live with the condition and do well in spite of it, while others have not.\nUnfortunately, this rigidity has not only survived, it has flourished. \u00a0It has turned into the idea that not only is autism not a disorder or disability but that it is a separate way of being that is, in some ways, superior to being \"normal\". \u00a0People with autism,\u00a0usually\u00a0the ones who call themselves \"aspies\", view their autism not as a problem but rather as a condition that gives them superior intelligence, an\u00a0ability\u00a0to focus, and frees them from having to worry about those \"societal norms\" that the rest of us have to worry about. \u00a0After all, it is job of the rest of society to accept them for their differences and it is immoral to suggest that they should have to adapt their behaviors to societal norms.\nThe problem is that this sort of thinking leads to feelings that one is somehow better than\u00a0\"normal\" people or at the very least, apart from them. \u00a0These people view themselves as separate from the rest of us. \u00a0And if that is as far as it went, I would not have a problem with it. \u00a0 If these people want to consider themselves different, it is no big deal to me.\nThe problem arises because these same people, the ones who claim that they have\u00a0autism, turn around and say that they do not wish to be changed or \"cured\". \u00a0They view attempts to treat or cure autism as a repudiation of who they view themselves to be - it strikes at their very identity.\nSo they go out in force and protest against a cure, protest against \"treatments\" that \"force\" them to be something other than they are or \"cures\" that would rob them of their identity. \u00a0I do not have a problem with this. \u00a0If you do not wish to change who think you are, you certainly have the right.\nBut, it doesn't stop there. \u00a0These people claim to speak for all people who have autism in rejecting treatments and cures for their condition and there we hit the problem.\nThese people, ones who are mostly able to function in society and live on their own, are asserting, on behalf of everyone with autism, that no treatments or cures are needed. \u00a0They are saying that there should be no ABA or research into the biological\u00a0underpinnings\u00a0of autism as that is denying them the right to be who they are. \u00a0Genocide, some would say.\nAnd yet, when they make these statements, they always seem to forget that there are those, like my children, who are more severely impacted by autism. \u00a0There are those who will not be able to have a life of their choosing, live independently, or even, in some cases,\u00a0communicate at all with the world around them without extensive help. \u00a0This help takes the form of treatments like ABA and attempting to correct the underlying problems. \u00a0It also takes the form of researching the causes of autism so that, one day, it may be possible to cure the problems that autism causes so that it will no longer be necessary for people to struggle through life with hardships like these.\nAnd then we come to the statement by people like Michael John Carley, and others like him, who take it one step further and suggest that they take offense at being lumped into the same category with \"lower functioning\" people with autism. \u00a0These people have no problems putting words in the mouths of my children, who are as of yet unable to speak fully for themselves, and yet turn around and dismiss them as unimportant and unworthy of consideration.\nAnd that just really pisses me off. \u00a0\nJust to be clear, this view is not held by every member of the ND movement and not every person who holds this view is a member of ND. \u00a0However, I think if you go back and look at the history of the movement, the ND movement is the source of this idea.\nIt is time for these ideas about autism to change.\u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/neurodiversity-you-do-not-speak-for-my.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity : You DO NOT speak for my children\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 21, 2009", "body": "\nThe CDC needs to do learn to do their job better, at least according to story that appeared on salon.com earlier this month entitled \"Health agency covered up lead harm\".  The controversy this time has to do with how the CDC investigated and reported on the high lead levels that were found in the water supply of Washington D.C.In March of 2003 the DC Water and Sewer Authority expanded some of the required lead-in-water testing to homes with lead service pipes that had not been tested before.  What they found was that the majority of these tests turned up lead levels that exceeded the EPA's limit of 15 parts per billion (ppb) and in some small number (~3%) of cases the lead concentrations were greater than 300 ppb.  So the Water Authority turned to the CDC for assistance.The CDC studies the problem and releases a report that basically says that there is no problem.  The lead in the water might have contributed to a small increase of blood lead levels but the levels seen wouldn't be a problem.The CDC publishes the results of the report and closes the case.  The results of this study are used by other municipalities to justify not responding aggressively to high lead levels in their water.But of course, there wouldn't be a problem here if that was all there was to the story.  Anyone familiar with the autism world should be able to see what comes next.It appears that the report that the CDC issued had some problems.First, a large chunk of data from the final study year (2003) was silently dropped from the report.  And while the CDC acknowledges that the data is missing they still stand by the conclusions of the study because the large amount of missing data would not have changed the results.Second, and more importantly, it seems to be that the conclusions of the study were wrong.  Outside researchers kept looking at the problem after the initial report and found evidence that contradicted the CDC's finding.This scrutiny  prompted the CDC to take another look at the issue and by 2007 the CDC had completed another study.  This new study looked specifically at the blood level of children in Washington D.C. who were exposed to lead from lead service pipes.  What was found was a strong relationship between children with lead poisoning ( blood lead level > 10 ug/dL) and living in homes that had lead service pipes.Or in other words the first report was wrong and the level of lead in the water supply was giving children lead poisonBeing a responsible government agency you would think that they would make a big deal about the new findings and get the word out that there was a problem with the earlier results.  You would think that they would take aggressive steps to address the problem.You would be wrong.  The CDC basically buried the results of the second study -CDC scientists and press representatives did not respond to requests for an explanation about why the results were not widely publicized. George Hawkins, director of the District Department of the Environment, in Washington, says he became aware of the 2007 study only on April 2 this year, when Salon showed him an abstract of the study. Scientists from other agencies, including EPA and HUD, also say they were never told about the results. \"CDC never told us,\" says an EPA scientist, \"and they never asked our help or any other water expert's help when they did their studies...\"This is the same government agency that plays a leading role in the the autism world.  I can only hope that they do a better job in that field.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cdc.gov/", "http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/10/cdc_lead_report/", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5312a6.htm", "http://apha.confex.com/apha/135am/techprogram/paper_166176.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/cdc-needs-to-get-lead-out.html", "title": "\nThe CDC needs to get the lead out\n"},

The headline for the stories sums up the allegation quite nicely -Vioxx maker Merck and Co drew up a doctor 'hit list'According to the articles staff of Merck compiled a 'hist list' of doctors who had to be \"neutralized\" or \"discredited\" because they had been openly critical of Vioxx or Merck.The articles also include an allegation that \"the company used intimidation tactics against critical researchers, including dropping hints it would stop funding to institutions and claims it interfered with academic appointments.\"The source of the information is a Merck internal e-mail which came out in the Federal Court in Melbourne as part\u00a0of a class action suit against the company.The e-mail included this passage that was apparently written by a Merck employee -\"We may need to seek them out and destroy them where they live\"Its good that this employee responds well to constructive criticism. \u00a0So you may be wondering what this has to do with autism. \u00a0It has to do with the motive of companies whose products have been implicated as having a relationship with autism.I think this is a good example of what a company will do to protect its products.

However, the lack of evidence should not be equated with a conclusion that a therapy is ineffective. In the absence of scientific evidence, there is an equal chance that any therapy will be beneficial or harmful.I couldn't have said it better.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.springerlink.com/content/06278hk7j5v47548/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-label_trial", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_report"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/study-watch-omega-3-fatty-acids-for.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch: Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Autistic Spectrum Disorder\n"},

She does have a point that it can be overwhelming, especially at first, when you find countless opinions across a huge range of topics.  After the diagnosis you are left to deal with the enormity of the change in your (and your child's) life not to mention where to turn for assistance for how best to approach the problem.  What do you try?To digress for a moment, this is where I have a huge problem with neurodiversity.  As I have written about before, if a parent of a newly diagnosed child runs across one of their sites soon after a diagnosis, they run the risk of deciding to do nothing to help their child.  This is what neurodiversity preaches as part of its \"acceptance\" mantra.  If you have been around the block a few times and decide that this approach works better for your child then so be it.  But if you are new to the autism world and don't really understand it yet and fall into believing this without first fully understanding the ramifications and other options available, then this is a problem. Anyway, back to the post at hand.  Lisa Jo Rudy continues by pointing out that it is hard to understand and make sense of the science and it is equally hard to separate the \"good\" from the \"bad\" studies.  She finishes up by recommending the book \"Understanding Autism for Dummies\".  Now, for full disclosure, I have not read autism for dummies, I am sure it is a good book.  However, I think I have to disagree with what what is being said here.It is true that it is difficult to get started understanding what autism is all about.  But that does not mean you should not make the effort.  Just because it is a daunting task does not make it not worthwhile to undertake.  Because like it or not once autism comes into your life in the form of a child or other family member diagnosed with autism it is going to be a major part of your life from that day forward.It is definitely worth the time and effort that you put into it and, in reality, even though the subject area is large it isn't that complex.  You start with the basics and work your way up from there - you literally have the rest of your life so take your time and work up slowly.  So if you have a child that is depending on you for support and to help them on their path to dealing with their condition, don't think of it in terms of hard or being \"tough\".  Think of it in terms of something that is needed for you to help your child.  Because honestly, if you aren't going to put the time in to help your child then no one is.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.about.com/b/2009/02/23/why-doing-your-own-autism-research-is-tougher-than-it-sounds.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/02/do-your-homework.html", "title": "\nDo your homework\n"},

This seems like a simple enough question to answer via science.  After all, this is the sort of thing that science is supposed to be good at.But, to date there has been no conclusive study that disproves the relationship between mercury and autism.  There have been a decent number of half baked ones that make a token attempt to answer the question.  These are the ones that are normally referenced by people like Dr Paul Offit to prove their point.  So, with that in mind, there is yet another study that was published in Pediatrics recently entitled Neuropsychological Performance 10 Years After Immunization in Infancy With Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines.  This was a follow up study done for 1,403 children in Italy who participated in an earlier study of the efficacy trial of pertussis vaccines.  The study looked at the two different groups of children who received different amounts mercury from the vaccines and looked to see if there was any difference in outcomes.  They basically found that there was no real difference between the groups.Now, where to start with what is wrong with the study.  First, the two groups are based on different amounts of mercury exposure.  Most of the time when you are looking for side effects you would want to compare how a group that was exposured to the substance did compared to a group that wasn't exposed.  Second, the study group contained only one child with autism - so out of 1,403 there was only one child.  Since the current estimation of autism is 1 in about 150 I would have thought that there would have been more children with autism found.Third, this study is just looking at exposure to one vaccine.  It does not appear that they attempted to control for other sources of mercury that the children were exposed to.Last, this study was funded in part by the CDC but done on a group in Italy.  Now I have nothing against Italy but why can't the CDC fund a study that looks at the thimerosal/autism issue in the US for US based children? I will be happy when the research is finally properly done to put this issue to bed once and for all so everyone can stop arguing about it and move on to something else.  But for now it is yet another study that doesn't show what it is says it does.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/2/475"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/01/shooting-fish-in-barrel-or-another-new.html", "title": "\nShooting fish in a barrel or another new thimerosal study\n"},

I think that increased transparency will only be a good thing.  I can understand that some doctors will feel uncomfortable with that level of information becoming public knowledge but the solution would be not to accept the money. A good model might be the financial disclosure requirements that the talking heads on the cable news channels have.  If they are recommending a stock for you to buy they have to disclose if they own it.  So in the same token, if a doctor is recommending a drug they should have to disclose if they have a financial relationship with the drug manufacturer.

The court firmly rejected the theory that vaccines had anything to do with autism - or more specifically they said that the petitioners failed to prove their case.There have been statements released from autism organizations such as Autism Speaks,  TACA, and Safe Minds.There has been coverage from blogs such as Age of Autism, WSJ Health blog, neurodiversity, a double dose from Left Brain Right Brain, and many others.There has been coverage from the mainstream media at CNN, The Wall Street Journal,  The Associated Press, Reuters, The New York Times, and many more.I actually read through the 183 page ruling the in Cedillo case by Special Master Hastings.  It is an interesting read and he takes you step by step through his decision process.  One thing that stood out to me was the fact that seemingly at every turn he rejected the petitioners' theories and accepted the government's.  In the entire document the only witness for the petitioners that he seemed to give any credibility to was the mother of the child.   I am left with the impression that the special master believes that the petitioners did a horrible job and failed to prove a single point.  He makes his opinion of the medical evidence abundantly clear in his conclusion:After studying the extensive evidence in this case for many months, I am convinced that the reports and advice given to the Cedillos by Dr. Krigsman and some other physicians, advising the Cedillos that there is a causal connection between Michelle\u2019s MMR vaccination and her chronic conditions, have been very wrong. Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgmentI did not read the other opinions but I would suspect that they have a similar tone.I would have been very surprised if the cases had been decided in the favor of the petitioners.  The cost of such a decision would have made President Obama's stimulus package look small and the damage that would instantly be done to the vaccine program in this country would have been catastrophic.  If there were a ruling that autism was linked to vaccines would you vaccinate your child? So in that regard the rulings are not a surprise.  I just did not expect the complete rejection of every single argument.  Especially since we are talking about a condition that we don't know why is happens or what causes it or even if the rate of it is increasing (my money is on it increasing).I think the special masters wanted to ensure that this theory does not have any legs left to stand on so as to restore confidence in the vaccine program.

Perhaps we were hasty in concluding that the preservative was the cause of all cases of autism - I mean after examining the latest evidence it caused 10%, tops\".

Typically, hospitals and treatment centers that offer HBOT follow specific safety protocols, though clearly even such protocols aren't foolproof.Of even greater concern, though, are home HBOT systems. Recent blogs and online discussions suggest that families are purchasing such systems and using them without a full understanding of the possible dangers. Parents, for example, join their autistic children in the chambers while using electronic devices such as ipods and laptops.I don't believe that pressurized oxygen is an explosion hazard - pure oxygen can't explode but it can accelerate the combustion of other materials. \u00a0I am even less sure that home HBOT systems have enough extra oxygen to cause a problem - I think that a typical gas stove or gas fire place \u00a0would pose more of a fire hazard than a typical home HBOT. \u00a0But my grasp of physics isn't what it used to be so I could easily be wrong here. \u00a0But lay that aside for a moment and consider the risks involved and the safety record of the technology involved. \u00a0I can't find another reference to an explosion like this in an HBOT center in this country nor any references to a commercial HBOT system causing fires at home. \u00a0So while it is clear that fire or explosion is a potential risk it is also clear that in practice the real risk here is very, very, very, very small.\u00a0It is far more likely that your child would be injured in a swimming pool at someone's house than it is that they would be hurt by an explosion of an HBOT tank.But simple facts can't get in the way of a good ideological on a rant. \u00a0Take for example the comments\u00a0by Kev -We have one study from Dan Rossignol et al which has some fairly serious issues with it as regards autism. There is also no indication it does a damn thing for cerebral palsy either. People being told it will help and who are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars as this family were are victims of quackery.and this one -Bottom line: there\u2019s no good evidence, despite looking that HBOT does a darn thing for CP or autism. Despite that, this boy was in a chamber when it caught on fire. If he hadn\u2019t been in the chamber nothing would\u2019ve happened to him. Now he\u2019s got 90% first degree burns - and all it cost his family was hundreds of thousands of dollars! Cool!So the kid was hurt because his parents believe in \"quackery\". \u00a0By this logic if you are driving your child to any experimental therapy and you are in a car accident then clearly it is the fault of the experimental therapy because you clearly would not have been in the car at that point without it. \u00a0 \u00a0And then we have another post back at Left Brain Right Brain by\u00a0DoC -\u00a0Fire, Fatal Injury, and Claims of Certification in an Independent HBOT ClinicWith a title like that I would be running for the hills - you have fire, death, and hints of fraud. \u00a0All the good things that FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) are made of. \u00a0However if you \u00a0look at the actual post though there is little in the way of fire and death - just a quick mention at the top of the post about the known facts of the case. \u00a0The meat of the post, what little there is, is that the director of a medical center\u00a0is not really \"certified\". \u00a0This claim is \"proven\" by doing web searches based on assumptions of how an organization works that are gleamed from its web pages. \u00a0I know this is may be a radical concept, but, if I had questions about a doctors certifications, instead of guessing I would ask the doctor directly about their certifications and what entity \u00a0provided said certifications. \u00a0I would definately do this before publishing something a potentially slanderous article.The conclusion of the post is lightly hung on the certification issue by a thread -\u00a0...this may contribute to an explanation of why this facility appears to treat conditions like cerebral palsy and autism in the first place \u2013 conditions for which there appears to be very little legitimate scientific support behind the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (some have even called the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for such conditions, \u201cquackery\u201d).I really like the \"some have even called it quackery at the end\". \u00a0It makes it sound so legitimate. \u00a0Too bad for DoC that the \"some\" that are calling it quackery are his co authors on the site.The insinuation is that \"little scientific support\" plus \"is he really certified\" with a dash of fire and death makes this \u00a0potential treatment \"quackery\". \u00a0Most rational people would call it experimental or if they were feeling generous \"promising\" but that's\u00a0ideologues for you, always grinding that axe.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.about.com/b/2009/05/04/hyperbaric-oxygen-chamber-explosion-raises-questions-for-families-with-autism.htm", "http://autism.about.com/b/2009/05/04/hyperbaric-oxygen-chamber-explosion-raises-questions-for-families-with-autism.htm#comment-9", "http://autism.about.com/b/2009/05/04/hyperbaric-oxygen-chamber-explosion-raises-questions-for-families-with-autism.htm#comment-29", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2265"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/05/hbot-and-fud.html", "title": "\nHBOT and FUD\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2009", "body": "\nThe commercialization of scientific research is getting out of hand.  Take for instance this recent bit of research highlighted in Science Daily -Anxious Parents Misdiagnose Milk Formula IntoleranceThis article is about a recent study that shows that \"many parents misinterpret common baby behaviors as milk intolerance and needlessly switch formulas without consulting a health professional\".  The study compared two different types of formula, one with intact cow milk protein  and another with partially hydrolyzed cow milk protein and found that there was no difference in infant intolerance between the two and hence there is no need to switch.Doesn't sound to bad, right?  Well, something seemed a little strange to me so I found the actual study here and looked at who the authors are.  Three of the authors in of the study list their associated organization as Mead Johnson Nutrition.  That name was also mentioned in the Science Daily article but I was not familiar with it, so I googled it and found -Mead Johnson Nutrition helps moms make sure those babies grow up healthy. The company specializes in making nutritional products for infants and children. The company distributes its offerings in the Americas, the Asia/Pacific region, and Europe. Mead Johnson's most visible consumer brand is the Enfamil line of infant formulas. So this company makes an infant formula, this is starting to make sense.  I wonder what formulas they compared?  Looking at page 6 of the study and I see that the full protein formula was Enfamil LIPIL and the other one was Good Start Supreme made by Nestl\u00e9.  So what we really have here is a \"study\" showing that a competitor's specialty product is not any better than one made by the company performing the research.  While this fact does not necessarily invalidate the results of the study is it a huge source of potential bias and as such should be disclosed as a conflict of interest.  If you look at the article on Science Daily the only hint of the bias is the company name and if you look at the abstract for the study there is no hint of the bias.

Physically that are as close to being the same as you can get.  They look very much alike, although it is possible to tell them apart if you know them.  Their height and weight have stayed remarkably in line with there being at most a quarter inch difference in weight and few ounces in weight.  Their teeth all came in at the same time and in the same order.  Mentally the story is the same - they have basically the same skill sets and abilities.  While one twin might do something slightly before the other it is almost a sure bet that the other will be soon to follow.However, their personalities are very different.  Twin A is a free spirit while twin B is more refined and lady-like (and bloody stubborn too).  They have different likes and dislikes as well as different ways of interacting with other people.Unfortunately they are among the 80 to 90 percent of identical twins that share their autism.  Interestingly enough, while the core communication deficits are the same, the outwards symptoms of autism and how they are expressed is very different.  But this is a topic for another day.They also had the beginnings of the bond that identical twins share, at least until they were a year old.  Then autism came for a visit and disrupted the normal course of their development and the budding twin bond seemed to disappear.  To be honest we haven't been  sure if it isn't still there in some form or another.  They don't acknowledge or actively seek out each other as they did once upon a time but there have been little hints here and there that the bond might still exist.Well, now we know that the bond still exists.  How do we know?  Simple, they are engaging in what can best be described as synchronized stimming.Synchronized stimming, like synchronized swimming, is when they both do the same stim at the same time in perfect unison.  So far we have seen spinning in a circle and intricate hand movements, all in perfect lock step.  It isn't like they are able to talk about what they are going to do first or that one starts the stim and the other picks it up - they both start the same motion at the same time and do the same set of movements.  The only explanation that we have been able to come up with is that this is their twin bond trying to reassert itself in spite of their autism.  While this isn't what we expected their bond to be like, we will take it.  It is nice to know that the bonds between twins can be stronger than autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/07/synchronized-stimming.html", "title": "\nSynchronized Stimming\n"},

This study compared gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism to typical children and found that, for the most part, there were no differences.  Of course the results have been publicized far and wide as proof that the GFCF diet isn't needed and doesn't do anything. There are stories such as the one on Pediatric Supersite entitled \"Dietary restrictions may do more harm than good for children with autism\" all over the place.  (In fairness, if you read the actual story it is a more balanced report than the title indicates; but then again, I think most people just read titles and skim the stories)Then you have what is, so far, my favorite bastardization of the facts in \"Doctor rejects gluten casein free diet for autism\" -Experts at the Mayo Clinic found no potential in the gluten or casein free repertoire to heal the symptoms of autism.The study says no such thing or even anything close for that matter.  There was no data in the study at all about usage of the GFCF diet or symptom relief from the diet so how could it say that the diet doesn't work?  The study looked at one set of potential symptoms that can lead to trying the diet, not at whether the diet itself actually did anything.Of course there are also reports from the agenda driven sites such as Left-Brain Right-Brain which ran this one.  In it Sullivan has cherry-picked two studies, the Mayo Clinic study and this one, and concludes that \"there is no evidence that children with autism have GI problems at a greater rate than the general public\", ignoring the numerous studies that have found the opposite.  But what do you expect, if autism is just a \"difference\" instead of a disorder, as LBRB advocates, it would hardly do to define part of the difference to be perpetual diarrhea.  But I digress. One thing is certain, there is clearly a need for more research into GI issues with autism and how elimination diets might help the symptoms of autism.   As it stands today there is a insufficient evidence to say that the diet is effective from a scientific or evidence based medicine point of view.For me though, the question of whether the GFCF diet can work has already been answered.It can.It won't work for every child and it doesn't seem to be a \"cure\" for autism.

I think that most people hear this and assume this means that there is some gene or mutation that runs in families that \"causes\" autism.Unfortunately,  autism is not so simple.  Researchers have spent a lot of time and effort searching for genetic causes for autism, and with the exception of Rett's Syndrome, have come up empty handed.  Sure, there have been some small successes here and there but most of the promising leads don't pan out.  A study will find a small group with a possible genetic commonality only to have the next study will come along and fail to reproduce the finding.This leads to the question of why do we think that autism is genetic?  If numerous large studies have failed to find anything that people with autism have in common at the genetic level, why exactly do we think that autism is genetic?The answer is twin studies. There have been several studies done in the past that show that identical twins almost always both have autism while fraternal twins don't.  This is taken to mean that autism must be genetic because, if identical twins both have autism and fraternal don't, it must be the shared genetics that makes the difference. With that in mind I would like to point out the most recent study of autism in twins that was just published in Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine -Characteristics and Concordance of Autism Spectrum Disorders Among 277 Twin PairsIn this study, researchers from the  Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins looked at 227 twin pairs from The Interactive Autism Network (IAN) where at least one of the twins had a form of autism.  IAN is an Internet based resource where parents can contribute information about their children with autism which can then be used by researchers.  As a result of utilizing IAN, the researchers were able to look at more twins than any study has done before (previous studies had less than 50 sets of twins). A total of 227 sets of twins took part in this study - 67 pairs of identical twins (58 male, 9 female) and 210 pairs of fraternal twins (97 male-male, 23 female-female, 90 female-male).  For those of you who are not familiar with twins, the simple rule here is that fraternal twins are basically the same as siblings that happen to be born at the same time while identical twins share the same genes.The results show that identical twins were about 88% likely to both have autism as well as (~ 90%) to have the same form and severity.  However, what was not expected was that in all in male identical twins this rate was 86% while in female twins the rate was 100% and none had aspergers.  Unfortunately, there were not enough female identicals for this finding to reach statistical significance but it was still interesting nonetheless.Prior studies have shown that identical twins will both have autism somewhere between 60% and 95% percent of the time, so this finding was in line with prior results.For fraternal twins the overall concordance was 31% which, while higher than was though in the past, is not too badly out of line.  The interesting part here is that male-male fraternal twins had a 40% chance of both having autism, which is significantly higher than other types of fraternal twins.Most other studies  studies have placed the rate for fraternal twins to be the same as non-twin siblings, although a recent study out of Japan also showed a higher rate for fraternal twins.For reference, in non-twin siblings, the rate is thought to be somewhere from 5% up to as high as 20%.So what does this all mean for autism being genetic?  Well, because the majority of identical twins will both have the same type and severity of autism there clearly is something going on at the genetic level that can cause or predispose someone to autism.  But, in at least 10% of cases, identical twins do not share their autism and in another 10% beyond that the severity level can differ.This tells me that while genetics does play a strong role, it is not the entire story.  There is something other than genetics that can determine whether someone will develop autism.If you look at fraternal twins, they are more likely to both have autism than normal siblings.  In the case of male-male fraternal twins that risk can be almost double.  Remember, the only difference between fraternal twins and regular siblings is that they share the same prenatal environment and grow up in the same environment at the same time.  If autism was solely genetic there would not be a difference between normal siblings and fraternal twins, and yet there is.  And in the case of male-male fraternal twins the risk is much higher than in normal siblings, and that shouldn't be the case either.If you put these two parts together it becomes clear that there is likely something other than genetics that can cause autism.  Or in other words, it is likely that there is a genetic predisposition that is triggered by some sort of environmental influence.Obviously, I am simplifying things things a bit here and there could very well be other factors at work here.  This is one study and, interesting though it is, it does not prove that there are environmental influences.  But at the same time it does strongly point in that direction.Maybe it is time to stop spending so much time looking for the autism's smoking gene and start spending more time looking at what environmental influences could be triggering it?  Or here is  crazy thought, how about if we devote some time to looking for the physical changes that autism causes in a person.  Perhaps if we know what autism is and how it effects the body we might have a better shot at treating it?Just food for thought.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rett_syndrome", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study", "http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/", "http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/163/10/907?lookupType=volpage&vol=163&fp=907&view=short", "http://www.ianproject.org/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/10/autism-in-twins.html", "title": "\nAutism in Twins\n"},

Participants were 8 to 15 years of age (N = 2588). Prenatal tobacco exposure was measured by report of maternal cigarette use during pregnancy. Lead exposure was assessed by using current blood lead levels. The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children was used to ascertain the presence of ADHD in the past year, on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria.\nRESULTS A total of 8.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.3%\u201310.1%) of children met criteria for ADHD. Prenatal tobacco exposure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.4 [95% CI: 1.5\u20133.7]) and higher current blood lead concentrations (aOR for third versus first tertile: 2.3 [95% CI: 1.5\u20133.8]) were independently associated with ADHD. Compared with children with neither exposure, children with both exposures (prenatal tobacco exposure and third-tertile lead levels) had an even greater risk of ADHD (aOR: 8.1 [95% CI: 3.5\u201318.7]) than would be expected if the independent risks were multiplied (tobacco-lead exposure interaction term, P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS Prenatal tobacco and childhood lead exposures are associated with ADHD in US children, especially among those with both exposures.

{"date": "Sunday, June 6, 2010", "body": "\nLast month there was a presentation at IMFAR 2010 that talked about a study of the gluten-free casein-free diet for autism.  While I normally do not like to  write about studies that I have not read, this particular one has received a fair about of media attention and is being held up as \"proof\" that the GFCF diet cannot help children with autism.  I have run across many reports like this one that starts off with - \n\n\"A popular diet intended to curb the effects of autism received yet another blow today in the form of a new study that found that autistic children who adhered to a gluten-free, casein-free diet showed no improvement in their symptoms\"\n\nThe problem that reports like this is that they overstate what the study shows.  Or perhaps I should say what it appears to show as all I have to go by is media reports, the abstract, and the clinical trial registration.  I would feel much more comfortable if the study had underwent the normal peer-review process and had been published in a journal, that way there would be something more concrete to talk about.  Regardless, the study was presented and discussed widely in the media, so here we are.  \n\nBefore I talk about the study, let me first ask a question.  Do you think a gluten-free casein-free diet can rapidly \"cure\" the symptoms of autism in every child?  \n\nI think the answer is an obvious no.  If the diet were an instant cure or made a huge difference for every child, there wouldn't be any question of whether the diet worked and demonstrating the effectiveness in a study would be trivial.\n\nI think that people forget that this is a dietary change and not some sort of drug.  People are used to taking a pill and seeing quick results.  If you approach a treatment like the GFCF diet with that expectation, you are going to be disappointed.  Think of it this way, if you alter your diet to lose weight or because you need to lower your cholesterol or because you need to manage a chronic condition like diabetes, would you expect to see changes overnight?  Of course not, you would understand that\u00a0these things take time. \u00a0So while I am sure that there are some children who will respond very quickly and very strongly to the diet, I am equally sure that majority of children will not will do so.\n\nThe question then becomes whether there is a subset of children with autism who can benefit from the diet, what exactly the diet can do for them, and how quickly they can be expected to respond.\n\nWith this in mind, lets look at what what question the researchers were attempting to answer in this study.  According to the abstract, the goal was \"to evaluate the nutritional adequacy, physiological effects, and efficacy of the GFCF diet on symptoms of ASD using randomized double blind placebo controlled challenges in preschool children with ASD\".\n\nThe researchers recruited 21 children who were determined to have autism using the ADI-R and/or ADOS and were receiving at least 10 hours a week of EIBI (ABA) therapy.  I believe the researchers included the EIBI therapy because they wanted to attempt to control for improvements due to other treatments.  These children were screened for milk/wheat allergies, celiac disease, and nutritional (iron) deficiencies.  They found that 3 children had at least one of these problems (2 potential celiac, 1 iron deficiency) and these children were excluded from the study.\n\nThese 18 children were then placed on a strict GFCF diet for 4 weeks before being randomly challenged weekly with either wheat, dairy, or a placebo in some manner.  I say in some manner because there seems to be some disagreement between the abstract and media reports as to how many of these challenges there were and how often they\u00a0occurred.  I think the challenges happened only once per week, but it isn't clear if there were challenges every week or only some weeks.  Then there is the line that challenges only occurred if \"measures were at baseline levels\" - I have no idea what that meant in practical terms.\n\nDuring the course of the study, 4 participants dropped out either because they couldn't adhere to the diet or because they withdrew from EIBI therapy, which left only 14 participants in the study.\n\nData was collected at the start of the study, 6 weeks, 18 weeks, 30 weeks, and before and after each challenge.  I am not sure what was being happening at 18 weeks or 30 weeks as the study only seems to have lasted 16 weeks.  It isn't clear what exact data was collected at each point but the following measures were used at some point during the study - Bristol Stool Scale, Sleep Diaries, Actigraphy, Conners Abbreviated Rating Scale, Target Symptoms Scale, Ritvo Freeman Real Life Rating Scales (RFRLRS), as well as some form of nutritional monitoring. \u00a0Most of these measures have to do with behavioral or sleep issues. \n\nGiven the above, the results of the study aren't too surprising.  The researchers found \"no favorable effects of the GFCF diet on attention, sleep and stool patterns\" but \"such effects may occur for individuals or for subgroups of children   (e.g. with significant GI disease), providing the basis for positive anecdotal reports.\"\n\nThis study was well designed and well executed, but there are a few problems.\n\nThe first problem is that the number of children in the study is very small AND the children who showed a potential intolerance to wheat/dairy or showed iron deficiency were excluded.  As I talked about above and as the researchers acknowledged in their abstract, only some children seem to benefit from the diet.  And yet the researchers not only failed to find the children who would benefit from the diet, they also kicked out the children who were most likely to benefit. \u00a0This coupled with the fact that there are only a handful of children in the study means that the diet would have had to have a very large effect to be seen.\n\nThe second problem is the length of time of the strict portion of the diet before the challenges.  While there is no established length of time to try a diet, I think it needs to be longer than 4 weeks.  If you look at other conditions where a restricted diet is used as a treatment (such as celiac disease), you will see that while some people respond quickly while others take a good while longer. \u00a0The only children I would expect to see major changes in four weeks are the children who would most need the diet - and they were excluded from the study.\n\nThe last problem is the tests used to detect changes.  From what I can see, the tests were all having to do with behavior, sleep , or stool.  None of these tests (except the last one) have to do with the biological changes that happen when a child responds to a diet.  When we tried the diet with our older daughters, we did so because there were several abnormal results in their blood work and one of the ways that we could tell that the diet was working was that these measures improved.  We also saw behavioral changes over time from the diet but I don't know whether any of the measures used in this study would have been sensitive enough to detect the changes - especially in only 4 weeks.\n\nAs for the challenges, if the tests aren't sensitive enough to see subtle changes over a 4 week period, how are they going to see the subtle changes from a single dietary infraction?  We have had accidental \"challenges\" over the years and while we can (almost) always tell from short lived behavior changes although I don't know whether someone who didn't know them a well would see the change.  But when these \"challenges\" happen close to the time when they have blood tests done, the result of tests show the \"challenge\".\n\nThe bottom line is that when testing whether the GFCF diet works, you need to find the children that would benefit from the diet, allow a long enough time to see the changes, and have a better way of seeing these changes. \u00a0As a result, this study does not add anything new to our understanding of the diet.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh6.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/Sn9MzK7G9HI/AAAAAAAAAAU/7bsdsOKrWLE/s1600/GFCF.jpg", "http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Autism/gluten-free-casein-free-diet-remedy-autism-study/story?id=10690766", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100519143401.htm", "http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2010/webprogram/Paper6183.html", "http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-pervasive-developmental-disorders/nih-initiatives/staart/staart-network-centers-university-of-rochester.shtml"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/06/dietary-intolerance.html", "title": "\nDietary Intolerance\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, November 17, 2010", "body": "\nI feel as if I have said this before, but science is all about data. \u00a0First you come up with an idea, then you go collect data, and finally you analyze the data to see if it supports your idea. \n\nThis process is formally known as the scientific method and, for the most part, it works well. \u00a0Sure, you will occasionally run across something where the researcher seems to have started out with the conclusion and, working backwards, selected only the data that fit the conclusion, but that doesn't happen all that often. \n\nBut, every once in a while, you will run across a paper where the researchers seemed to feel that the whole collecting data thing is overrated and went straight to the conclusion without bothering with any data. \u00a0I ran across an example of this last type recently and couldn't help but point it out. \n\nThe paper in question is \"Prevalence of Pervasive Developmental Disorders Among Children at the English Montreal School Board\" (open access, go read it) and it dealt primarily with measuring autism prevalence in a group of schools in Canada. \u00a0Overall, the paper wasn't bad and it showed what almost every recent study of autism prevalence has shown - the prevalence of autism increasing every year because of reasons unknown. \u00a0This part of the paper had real data behind in in the form of school records. \n\nBut then, there is this second part to the paper and that is where things get a little, well, strange. \u00a0Lets go through it from the top.\n\nIn the abstract of the study, you will find this objective listed -\nOur objectives were to determine prevalence rates of PDDs among school-aged children, and to evaluate the impact of discontinuation of thimerosal use in 1996 in routine childhood vaccines on PDD rates.Pay attention to that second part (yes, sorry, vaccines again), and what it implies. \u00a0The goal is to measure what impact - if any - the removal of thimerosal had on autism prevalence. To do determine that, you need some measure of exposure to thimerosal.\n\nWith that in mind, look at the \"Conclusion\" section of the abstract -\nOur study provides additional evidence that the PDD rate is close to 1%. We estimate that at least 11 500 Canadian children aged 2 to 5 years suffer from a PDD. The reasons for the upward trend in prevalence could not be determined with our methods. Discontinuation of thimerosal use in vaccines did not modify the risk of PDD.And, in the main body of the study, look at the \"Interpretation\" section -\nAs in other studies where the effect of the discontinuation of thimerosal in childhood vaccines was examined, no change in the underlying population trends for PDD rates could be observed in relation to thimerosal discontinuation.I think it is obvious that the authors feel that their data shows that removing thimerosal didn't impact the rate of autism. \u00a0So, clearly, the paper should have measure of thimerosal exposure, right?\n\nWrong. \u00a0Look in the section of the paper entitled \"Exposure to TCVs\" -\nIndividual immunization data were not available for study subjects.Wait, data about the actual exposure to vaccines and thus the exposure to thimerosal wasn't used? \u00a0Then how did the authors support their conclusion?\nIn Quebec, thimerosal was removed from vaccines used as part of the recommended childhood vaccine schedule in 1996. In previous years, exposure to thimerosal varied from 125 to 200 micrograms for birth cohorts included in our study.Oh. So every child born before 1996 was assumed to have exposure to thimerosal but every child after that was assumed to have no exposure?\nThe prevalence in each individual birth cohort born in or after 1996 was consistently higher than that in cohorts born prior to 1996 (Table 1). ... Further, the inclusion of a dummy predictor variable indicating exposure or not to thimerosal (before or after 1996) to the model predicting prevalence with birth cohort did not improve the model and was not significant.OK, no thimerosal data, just a \"dummy predictor variable\". \u00a0Hmm. \u00a0If thimerosal was completely removed from all vaccines in\u00a0Quebec, then what should we make of\u00a0this \"Statement on Thimerosal\" from the \"National Advisory Committee on Immunization\" in 2003 -\nIn Canada, the vaccines currently used in routine infant immunization do not contain thimerosal (see Table 1). Some hepatitis B vaccines licensed in Canada do, but one formulation with no thimerosal and another with only trace amounts are now available in Canada, and NACI recommends their use in infants preferentially. The two hepatitis B vaccines in which thimerosal is added as a preservative are gradually being phased out. Influenza vaccine also contains thimerosal but is only recommended for use in Canada for those infants > 6 months of age. The other vaccines licensed in Canada that contain thimerosal are primarily used for people travelling to developing countries and are not routinely administered to infants.So, thimerosal was completely gone in 1996 - except that in 2003 it was still in some hepatitis B vaccines, the flu vaccines, and \"other vaccines\"? \u00a0I guess it is possible that Quebec did remove it completely from all vaccines in 1996 and it is only the rest of Canada that didn't. \n\nBut, even if that were the case, you would still have people moving from other parts of Canada or from other countries that would still have had exposure to thimerosal, so the \"dummy\" variable with the arbitrary cut-off date has no real relation to actual exposure. \u00a0And if there is no measure of exposure, how can the researchers conclude that removing that exposure had no effect?\n\nNote to the researchers - next time actually have data to support your conclusion.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "http://publications.cpa-apc.org/media.php?mid=1063", "http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/03vol29/acs-dcc-1/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/11/jabberwocky-of-day-imaginary-data.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Imaginary Data\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, April 18, 2010", "body": "\nYesterday I wrote a rebuttal to something that Joseph posted\u00a0at Natural Variations. \u00a0Joseph was trying to show that the media was loosing interest in the so-called \"antivax\" movement and used a chart he made up to prove his point. \u00a0I thought his analysis was \u00a0flawed and pointed it out to him but he obviously felt his analysis was valid. \n\nSo I did what every\u00a0sarcastic\u00a0person would do and wrote a rebuttal \u00a0here that tried to point out how silly his analysis was. \u00a0I did this by doing a similar analysis on the topic of neurodiversity. \u00a0What I wrote\u00a0was what meant to be a tongue in cheek analysis of how disinterested the media was in the neurodiversity movement (fortunately for most people with autism, the media seems to have very little interest in playing up autism as some sort of gift).\n\nJoseph saw what I wrote and responded with a\u00a0misinterpretation\u00a0of what I said. \u00a0He seemed to think that I reproduced his initial result, even though I thought I was quite clear that I felt the entire analysis was bogus. I did not initially go into any great detail at the time about what was wrong with what he was saying, but since he has chosen to continue the error, I though it might be a good idea to show exactly where his analysis is flawed.\n\nSo, lets me start at the\u00a0beginning at the root of the problem, the raw data that Joseph used in his analysis. \u00a0The data was obtained by doing simple searches on Google news archive for specific search terms. \u00a0Each term was searched for a specific year (1997 to present), and the number of articles per year was collected. \u00a0Using Google news archive as a source of data is the first major problem and, in my\u00a0opinion, makes his entire analysis almost meaningless.\n\nThe problem, simply put, is consistency. \u00a0If you are looking at how a specific value changes over time, you had best be measuring the same thing for each data point. \u00a0The problem with Google news archive is that the media sources that go into it change quite frequently. \u00a0If you search for articles in 1997 it might use 100 sources (as an example), but the same search for 2007 could be looking in 500 sources. \u00a0These source might have some overlap between the two periods or they could be completely different.\n\nThe other problem with Google news archive is that it might not be representative of the media as a whole. \u00a0Some major publishers have decided to exclude their\u00a0materials\u00a0from the archive while others, such as the Associate Press, might be included multiple times due to\u00a0syndication. Yet another problem would be that a source such as the New York Times would have as much weight as some random small town paper in the article count, or possibly more. \u00a0Quality doesn't count, just quantity.\n\nThe end result is a lack of a consistent data set. \u00a0Each year worth of data is likely coming from a different set of publishers and no two years would be measuring the same thing. \u00a0If you are trying to look at a trend, you want to be measuring the same thing for each data point. \n\nA much better approach would have been to pick several large media organizations that have been in business since at least 1997 and look at the number of articles that each of these published on the subjects over the years. \u00a0This approach would have a consistent set of sources, eliminate duplications, and would allow less\u00a0credible\u00a0outlets to be excluded.\n\nSo the problem is that Joseph\u00a0is not comparing apples to apples and his yearly numbers don't even represent the same thing each year. \u00a0Garbage in, garbage out.\n\nBut lets set that problem aside for a moment and look at the actual raw numbers. \u00a0The numbers below represent the number of articles per year from Google News Archive that come up for the search terms \"autism\" and \"autism and vaccine\". Please note that value from 2010 is an estimate that I created using the values to date from 2010.  I used a relatively simple way of estimating but it should be accurate enough for these purposes.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n YearVaccineAutism\n 1997521,840\n 19981262,970\n 19991913,580\n 20004084,720\n 20017646,010\n 20021,3807,830\n 20031,0508,980\n 20041,39011,700\n 200578314,100\n 200662313,500\n 200780721,000\n 20081,87025,200\n 20091,54025,500\n 2010*1,66723,560\n\nThe question before us is whether the media is become more or less interested in the vaccine/autism connection, and to do that we need to assess whether the interest is growing, declining, or staying the same.\n\nJust looking at the raw numbers above, a few things are clear.\n\nFirst, the number of articles about autism has exploded , increasing more than tenfold since 1997. \u00a0But do you notice the increases in 1998 and 2007? \u00a0Each of those is about a 60 percent increase (61%, 56%) and I have to wonder if they are caused by changes of data sources in Google news archive.\n\nSecond, the number of vaccine/autism articles has grown as well. \u00a0The values start out relatively small and grow rather rapidly until they reach their first peak in 2002-2004. \u00a0The value then drops\u00a0drastically the next year and stays low for two years before bouncing back beyond its former peak in 2008. \u00a0The following two years go down slightly, but still are higher than the last peak in 2002-2004. \u00a0Again, I have to wonder if the sharp drop in 2005 and the equally sharp rise in 2008 aren't results of changes in Google news archive.\n\nIf you look at the chart below, the trend in vaccine/autism articles is clear. \u00a0The number of vaccine/autism articles is going up with time. \u00a0I added a simple three period moving average to the chart to show the general trend of the numbers (a moving average smooths out the irregularities in the data and helps to show the general direction).\n\n\nIf we were just measuring interest by number of articles, there is clearly an increase in interest over time. \u00a0But Joseph went beyond this, so lets keep going. \n\nIf you remember what the two sets of numbers represent, you will see that the vaccine/autism set is a subset of the total autism set. \u00a0Or in other words, the vaccine/autism articles are only a part of the total interest in autism. \u00a0So lets look at the total number of vaccine/autism articles compared to the autism articles to see if there is a relationship.\n\n\n\nAs you can see, these two number tend to move together.  When there are more articles about autism there are more about vaccine/autism and, when there are less about autism, there tend to be less about vaccines/autism.  One of the ways you can measure this relationship is with a correlation, and these two data sets are highly correlated (~ 0.76).\n\nSo we know the topics tend to move together, so the next question is what is the overall trend for both sets? \n\nThere are clearly more articles for both sets as time goes on, but is there consistent pattern of growth in the number of articles, showing an increasing interest, or is there a slowdown, showing a decrease? \u00a0One way to measure this is to look at the year over year change of each value, expressed as a percentage. \u00a0If interest in a topic is growing, you expect to\u00a0positive\u00a0growths each each.\n\n\nAs you can see from the above chart, both topics seem to increase most years.  The vaccines/autism shows growth in 9 of the 13 years while the autism topic in general has growth 11 of the past 13 years.  The average yearly growth for vaccines/autism is 44% and the average growth for autism is 23%. \u00a0It would have been nice to see a more consistent patter of growths (percents all trending \u00a0up or down), but the real world isn't as clean as that.\n\nSo we have an overall increasing number of articles and most years are showing a positive growth, so why does Joseph think that interest in vaccine/autism is shrinking? \u00a0The answer is that he didn't directly answer that question, he answered a different one.\u00a0\n\nIf you remember, the question is whether the media is becoming less interested in writing about the possible vaccine/autism connection, and Joseph used a chart similar to the one below to show that it was.\n\n\nBut look closely at what the chart actually shows, and you will see the trick. \n\nThe chart\u00a0isn't showing you the trend in the vaccine/autism articles.\n\nWhat the chart shows is the relationship between the number of vaccine/autism articles and the total number of autism articles. \u00a0So, the question that Joseph is answering is whether the number of vaccine/autism articles is growing as fast as (or faster than) then total number of articles about autism. \u00a0And the answer to that question is that the vaccine/autism articles - as a percentage of all articles - is going down.\n\nBut that wasn't the question. \u00a0If the number of autism articles were constant, or changing slightly, then this analysis might make sense. \u00a0But, if you look at the raw numbers above, you can see that the autism numbers are growing rapidly.\n\nLets me make this simple. \u00a0On the chart above for 2002, you can see the value is almost 18 (17.6 to be exact), that value is a percentage. \u00a0Look at the value for 2009, the value is about 6 percent. \u00a0This is the trick, which value is larger? \u00a0Did the number of articles (interest) increase or decrease between these two time periods? \u00a0If you just consider the percent values on the chart, you would think that you have less interest in 2009 and 2002. \u00a0But, in reality, the number of articles in 2009 was 10% higher than 2002, not lower - yet Joseph would have you believe that there was a drop in interest between those two years.\n\nPercentages can only be compared if they have the same denominator. \u00a0In this case, the denominators aren't even close and the result is the analysis is skewed.\n\nLet me make this even simpler, which is more - 20% of 100 or 10% of 400? \u00a0(Hint, the 10% is more)\n\nSo what is the answer to the real question? \u00a0Is the media's interest in the vaccine/autism story growing, shrinking, or staying the same? \u00a0The chart below should tell you the answer.\n\n\nThe number of autism articles \u00a0has been growing quickly, but the overall interest in the vaccine/autism articles has not been shrinking. \u00a0As a matter of fact, if you look a the numbers above, you can see that the interest in the vaccine/autism topic has also been growing slightly, just not as fast as the autism topic as a whole.\n\nJoseph's analysis is simply wrong.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2010/04/medias-interest-in-anti-vaccine.html", "http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2010/04/mj-reproduces-result-of-mine.html", "//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S8uhQnsKSCI/AAAAAAAAAOY/NOORVdgnJPk/s1600/trend_chart1.gif", "//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S8uhX4IpJEI/AAAAAAAAAOg/9x4WHNwKvZQ/s1600/trend_chart2.gif", "//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S8uhgN6kgBI/AAAAAAAAAOo/koOXhIUpenk/s1600/trend_chart3.gif", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S8uhnPwVhdI/AAAAAAAAAOw/qwCfark7Uco/s1600/trend_chart4.gif", "//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S8uhsuyuBqI/AAAAAAAAAO4/nfVPk5PdBDs/s1600/trend_chart5.gif"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/04/analyzing-medias-interest-aka-josephs.html", "title": "\nAnalyzing the Media's Interest (aka Joseph's Folly)\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, July 2, 2011", "body": "\n\n\nFlickr photo by beautifulcataya\nIf you really want to piss off a parent whose child has autism, just tell them that they are in some way responsible for their child's condition. \u00a0That accusation takes us back to the bad old days of autism when the prevailing theory was that autism was caused by cold and uncaring parents.\n\nFortunately, that sort of thinking has disappeared from the medical world and only survives in ignorance of the general public. \u00a0Or has it? \n\nAs Harold Doherty pointed out on Facing Autism in New Brunswick, a \"science\" blogger by the name of Harriet Hall, MD (aka SkepDoc) seems to have just suggested that parents, mothers specifically, are responsible for their children's autism.\n\nThe statements that I am talking about come in the context of a recent study that found that prenatal vitamins may decrease the risk of autism when taken during the 3 months before or the first month of the pregnancy. \u00a0The results of the study are somewhat confusing, to say the least. \u00a0On the one hand, the study seems to say that the simple act of taking prenatal vitamins before pregnancy might help to prevent autism.\n\nBut then you have to consider that another study suggested that prenatal vitamin use during pregnancy was associated with a greater risk of autism. \u00a0And then there is the fact that, over the past several decades, prenatal vitamin use has become much more common (at least in the U.S.). \u00a0So if prenatal vitamin use played a large role in autism, I would expect that the rate of autism would have dropped as prenatal vitamin use increased, which certainly hasn't happened.\n\nI also have to wonder if the study controlled for whether the pregnancy was planned or unplanned. \u00a0It is much more likely that the mother would be taking prenatal vitamins if the pregnancy were planned than if it weren't. \u00a0I haven't read the full text of the study and the abstract doesn't specify whether that was taken into account. \u00a0If it wasn't taken into account then I suspect that could account for the results of the study.\n\nBut back to the point. \u00a0In the context of talking about this study, Dr. Hall had this to say -\nHow will the anti-vaccine contingent react to this new study? It was convenient and satisfying for parents to be able to blame vaccines and accuse the evil medical establishment of causing their children\u2019s autism. Now will those parents accept that at least part of the responsibility lies with their own genetic contributions and the mother\u2019s actions prior to pregnancy? That\u2019s not as palatable a thought, but it\u2019s more realistic.In this context, the word \"responsibility\" says that parent's are responsible for their child's autism. \u00a0Responsible, according to dictionary.com, means -\nanswerable or accountable, as for something within one's power, control, or management (often followed by to \u00a0or for ): He is responsible to the president for his decisions.\ninvolving accountability or responsibility: a responsible position.\nchargeable with being the author, cause, or occasion of something (usually followed by for ): Termites were responsible for the damage.\nhaving a capacity for moral decisions and therefore accountable; capable of rational thought or action: The defendant is not responsible for his actions.\nThe core idea behind the word in this context is that the parent had the ability to control a situation and so the result of the situation is because of what the parent did or didn't do.\n\nSo back to Dr. Hall's statements. \n\nThe idea that a parent is \"responsible\" for their \"genetic contributions\" just doesn't make sense. \u00a0A person has no ability to control their genetic code nor can they make any impact on which parts of it are passed onto their children. \u00a0The only decision that you can make in regards to your genetic code is whether to have children or not. \u00a0So the only \"responsibility\" here is the decision to have a child in the first place.\n\nPerhaps more to the point, if a parent has some unknown genetic mutation that interacts with some unknown\u00a0environmental\u00a0influence, are they \"responsible\" for the outcome of that interaction even if they have no knowledge (or way of knowing) about either factor? \u00a0I don't think so.\n\nThe second part of the idea is that the mother is \"responsible\" for their actions prior to the pregnancy and this is true, to a point. \u00a0If you do something during (or before) the pregnancy knowing that it will harm the child, then you are responsible for the outcome. \n\nBut if you have no idea that a specific action or inaction can lead to an outcome like autism, can you really be \"responsible\" for the outcome? \u00a0The word \"responsible\" implies a choice as well as the ability to control. \u00a0If you have no knowledge that there even is a choice to be made or that you can control the outcome, can you be \"responsible\" for the outcome? \n\nIn general, that question is hard to answer. \u00a0However, when you are talking about evidence based medicine, the answer is simple. \n\nIn evidence based medicine, the only things that you should be doing (medically) are those things that are supported by the evidence. \u00a0If there is no evidence to support the action, then you shouldn't be doing it. \u00a0So, under evidence based medicine, can you really say that someone is \"responsible\" for failing to take an action that is not supported by evidence?\n\nI think the answer is an obvious no. \n\nSo how can a science (aka evidence-based medicine) blogger such as Dr. Hall cast \"responsibly\" onto a parent for listening to what evidence based medicine has to say? \u00a0And do we really want to let medical doctors get back into the habit of blaming the parents for their child's autism?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3471/3306838537_f1e449dcce_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/beautifulcataya/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator_mother", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2011/06/blaming-autism-parents-self-described.html", "http://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/2011/07000/Prenatal_Vitamins,_One_carbon_Metabolism_Gene.8.aspx", "http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/13303/", "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/responsible"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/07/prenatal-vitamins-and-parental.html", "title": "\nPrenatal Vitamins and Parental Responsibility\n"},

We hypothesized that perturbations of early thyroid profiles may contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Thyroid pathways could provide a mechanism by which environmental factors that affect the thyroid system may impact autism occurrence or phenotypic expression. We investigated whether thyroxine (T4) levels at birth are associated with subsequent ASD, using two existing California study groups in multivariate analysis. One study group included children born in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1994, with cases identified through the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) and/or the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California (244 cases, 266 controls); the other included children born in California in 1995, with cases identified through DDS (310 cases, 518 controls). \u00a0Matched controls were selected from birth certificate records. This exploratory analysis suggested that infants with very low T4 (<3rd percentile) may have higher ASD risk, although results reached statistical significance only for the 1995 study group (1995: OR = 2.74 (95% CI 1.30-5.75; 1994: OR = 1.71 (95% CI 0.57-5.19). A variety of alternate analyses were conducted with available data, without further resolution of the difference between the two study groups.

{"date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2012", "body": "\nSo, if you were a writer for Businessweek and wanted to piss off as many parts of the autism community as you could in one article, how would you do it? \u00a0Apparently, one way to do it is to write\u00a0an article about a new software testing company, Square One, that is creating software testing jobs for people with autism.\n\nYes, I know that software testing might be a good job for some people with autism and that it is good that some companies are looking to create opportunities for people with autism.\n\nBut, there is a right way to go about it and then there is the wrong way.\n\nThe right way is to present an accurate view of what autism is (and isn't) and to present the opportunity as a win-win for both the people with autism and the companies that employee them. \u00a0The right way is to treat people with autism with the dignity and respect.\n\nThe wrong way, well, the article, \"Outsourcing to the Autistic Rather Than to India\", should be a case study in what the wrong way looks like. \u00a0Even though the article is fairly short, there is something in there that is sure to piss off almost anyone in the autism community.\n\nIt start out with the autism as superpower myth -\n\nPart of the reason autism has captivated Hollywood moviemakers more than other developmental disabilities is that, for all the difficulties it brings those who have it, it also gives some of them the ability to perform uncanny feats of brainpower: effortlessly memorizing train schedules or song lyrics, identifying the day of the week of any date in the past. Even among those who aren\u2019t full-blown savants, many display an impressive ability, even a desire, to immerse themselves in what the rest of us would see as mind-numbingly boring, detail-oriented tasks.\nI really do love the phrases \"it also gives some of them the ability to perform uncanny feats of brainpower\" and \"even among those who aren't full-blown savants\". \u00a0If you thought that all talk about the \"benefits\" of autism was harmless, well, there is your harm. \n\nThe idea that autism grants you \"the ability to perform uncanny feats of brainpower\" is getting embedded in the general public's view of autism and creating an expectation that most people with autism are not going to be able to live up to.\n\nAnd the implication that savants are somehow common among people with autism? \u00a0Classic.\n\nAnyway, after you establish that people as autism have super-human brains and say they like \"mind-numbingly boring\" things, you move right into how those brains could be exploited -\n\nA lot of software testing is done overseas by workers in India. The case Hahn makes is that his software testers will work for $15 to $20 an hour\u2014pay comparable to, or even lower than, that of software testers in India, but right here in the U.S. After all, he points out, people with autism don\u2019t have a lot of alternatives\u2014when they do find work, it\u2019s usually bagging groceries or sweeping hospital floors at the minimum wage.\n\nHahn, in other words, is proposing outsourcing to the developmentally disabled rather than the developing world. Asked whether it might be exploitative to pay people with a disability less than those without one for doing the same work, he says he doesn\u2019t see it that way. For one thing, he says, Indian software testers aren\u2019t exactly sweatshop labor; they make about $25 an hour. And if paying less makes the company able to hire the developmentally disabled in the first place, he doesn\u2019t see a problem with it.\nBecause, you know, it is OK to pay people with autism less because they \"don't have a lot of alternatives\". \n\n\n\n\nIn a way, I can understand the point - people with autism don't really have many opinions and if we can create higher paying jobs that they can do, that is a good thing. \u00a0But if the person with autism is essentially doing the same job as another person, you can't really justify paying them less simply because they have autism. \u00a0I believe that would be called discrimination.\n\nThe autism community certainly needs help to create a better future for our loved ones who struggle with autism, but we don't need help from anyone who wants to exploit then.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-27/outsourcing-to-the-autistic-rather-than-to-india", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/-0uVOMgdUOMo/TNNPN8CmB8I/AAAAAAAAAUI/3X7qnq7TaTA/s1600/facepalm.jpg"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/03/jabberwocky-of-day-businessweek-on.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Businessweek on Outsourcing to the Autistic\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 14, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nImage from ComputerClipArt.com\n\nThe extreme male brain theory of autism is the idea that many of the traits of autism can be looked at as extreme versions of traits that are common in men. \u00a0Autism could then be \"caused\" by something that takes an ordinary brain and then turns up the male features of the brain and turning down the female features.\n\nOr something like that. \n\nTo be honest,\u00a0I have never really liked the theory. \u00a0Maybe that is because I have daughters with autism or maybe it is because I don't buy into the\u00a0stereotypes\u00a0of what men are supposed to be like.\n\nOr, just maybe, it is because there is very little data to support the theory. \u00a0It is one thing to look at some high-function people with autism and come up with a theory of how they think but it quite another to actually have real data that supports the theory. \u00a0And no, 2D:4D finger ratios and\u00a0preferred\u00a0hip-waist ratios don't count as real data.\n\nRegardless, I found this study that was just published to be rather informative and funny at the same time. \u00a0The abstract is below.\n\nBACKGROUND: The 'extreme male brain' theory suggests that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an extreme variant of male intelligence. However, somewhat paradoxically, many individuals with ASD display androgynous physical features regardless of gender.\n\nAIMS: To assess physical measures, supposedly related to androgen influence, in adults with and without ASD.\n\nMETHOD: Serum hormone levels, anthropometry, the ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length (2D:4D) and psychiatric symptomatology were measured in 50 adults with high-functioning ASD and age- and gender-matched neurotypical controls. Photographs of face and body, as well as voice recordings, were obtained and assessed with respect to gender coherence, blindly and independently, by eight assessors.\u00a0\n\nRESULTS: Women with ASD had higher total and bioactive testosterone levels, less feminine facial features and a larger head circumference than female controls. Men in the ASD group were assessed as having less masculine body characteristics and voice quality, and displayed higher (i.e. less masculine) 2D:4D ratios, but similar testosterone levels to controls. Androgynous facial features correlated strongly and positively with autistic traits measured with the Autism-Spectrum Quotient in the total sample. In males and females with ASD dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate did not decrease with age, in contrast to the control group.\u00a0\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Women with ASD had elevated testosterone levels and several masculinised characteristics compared with controls, whereas men with ASD displayed several feminised characteristics. Our findings suggest that ASD, rather than being characterised by masculinisation in both genders, may constitute a gender defiant disorder.\n\nSo now, instead of autism being \"characterised by masculinisation in both genders\", it is now suggested that it\u00a0\"may constitute a gender defiant disorder\"...\n\nReally? \u00a0 It was bad enough to suggest that autism was just being too masculine. \u00a0Do we really want to another theory that suggests that autism is all about\u00a0gender\u00a0ambiguity? \u00a0I'm sure that will go over well.\n\nAnd what about the non-\"high functioning\" people with autism, otherwise known as the majority of people with autism, why are they excluded - yet once again - from a study like this? \u00a0If you are trying to test the validity of a theory of autism spectrum disorders perhaps it would be beneficial to test it against the majority of people with autism.\n\nBut, on a more serious note, there are two bits in the abstract that are interesting and both speak to an ongoing biological process. \n\nFirst, why would the women with autism have a higher level of testosterone and what exact process would cause a women's testosterone level to remain elevated throughout her life?\n\nSecond, why would older males and females with autism have a higher level of\u00a0dehydroepiandrosterone\u00a0sulfate than the controls? \u00a0My knowledge is more than a little lacking in this area, but from what I understand the body uses steroid hormones like this to help control metabolism, inflammation, immune function, as well as other things. \u00a0This particular steriod hormone can be converted into testosterone and estrogens and also might be able to control neuronal excitability and gene expression.\n\nOr in other words, having an\u00a0unusual\u00a0level of this substance suggests that there is something going on that the body is trying to control. \u00a0Since most of the things on the list above are impacted in autism, might not this be something to focus on?\n\nIt is all well and good to have yet another study (34 and counting) that looks at what is basically idle speculation, \u00a0but wouldn't it be better to spend the research dollars investigating actual biological differences in people with autism and trying to find their source?\n\nReferences\n\nBejerot S, Eriksson JM, Bonde S, Carlstr\u00f6m K, Humble MB, Eriksson E.

A secondary aim was to consider the possible impact of geographic, cultural/ethnic, and socioeconomic factors on prevalence estimates and on clinical presentation of PDD. Based on the evidence reviewed, the median of prevalence estimates of autism spectrum disorders was 62/10,000. While existing estimates are variable, the evidence reviewed does not support differences in PDD prevalence by geographic region nor of a strong impact of ethnic/cultural or socioeconomic factors. However, power to detect such effects is seriously limited in existing data sets, particularly in low-income countries. While it is clear that prevalence estimates have increased over time and these vary in different neighboring and distant regions, these findings most likely represent broadening of the diagnostic concets, diagnostic switching from other developmental disabilities to PDD, service availability, and awareness of autistic spectrum disorders in both the lay and professional public. The lack of evidence from the majority of the world's population suggests a critical need for further research and capacity building in low- and middle-income countries.

{"date": "Saturday, May 19, 2012", "body": "\nAccording to an abstract published for IMFAR 2012, it looks like Simon Baron-Cohen has finally gotten around to actually testing the core idea of his extreme male brain theory of autism. \u00a0The core idea being that children who go on to develop autism are exposed to a higher than normal level of prenatal testosterone.\n\nTo do so, the good doctor actually measured the level of four sex hormones (progesterone, 17a-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone) and cortisol in the amniotic fluid of 62 males with autism and 231 males without autism that had been preserved as part of the Danish Historic Birth Cohort.\n\nThe results of this analysis, although preliminary, are quite surprising. \u00a0The autism group did show an increased level of testosterone, that much was predicted by the theory. \u00a0But what was not expected was that the autism group also showed an increased level of the other three sex hormones as well. \u00a0The levels of cortisol were the same between the autism and control groups.\n\nOn a trivial level, this result calls into question the core idea of extreme male brain theory of autism because it isn't just testosterone that is out of balance, it is other sex hormones as well (i.e. testosterone and estrogen would likely both be out of balance). \n\nOn a non-trivial level, this result shows that far more than just sex hormones are out of balance. \u00a0These four \u00a0hormones are involved in other biological processes as well. \u00a0Wikipedia has a nice picture of how these hormones fit together -\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biology is a little beyond me, but notice cortisol hanging out on the right side of the picture? \u00a0I have to wonder how you can push several parts of the process without impacting one of the end results of the pathway.\n\nRegardless, from what I understand, these four hormones are tied to the CYP17A1 pathway and this pathway is involved in a whole lot of other things. \u00a0These things include the oxidation of organic substances, metabolism of drugs and other toxic chemicals, and the synthesis of cholesterol, steroids, and other lipids. \n\nNotice anything familiar on that list? \u00a0Here a hint, all of these things have been tied to autism or found to be out of balance in some people with autism.\n\nSo, what do you think happens to a developing fetus when an important biological pathway like this is pushed out of balance? \u00a0I don't understand the biology well enough to fully grasp the consequences but I don't think it can be anything good.\n\nMany of the body's systems are are cross linked and when you push one of them out of balance you are going to unbalance other parts as well. \u00a0And if there is one common theme that ties together all of the many abnormal biological findings in autism, it is a\u00a0tendency\u00a0to\u00a0be out of balance and at one extreme or the other.\n\nOf course, these results are preliminary and need to be replicated by other groups. \u00a0The findings also need to be replicated in the general autism population. \u00a0The current paper, like so many of Simon Baron-Cohen's papers, focuses exclusively on the high functioning males with autism. \u00a0It excluded anyone with autism who had intellectual disability and anyone who was female.\n\nThese result also beg the question of why all of these hormones are out balance in the first place. \u00a0Something has to be pushing these hormones out of balance in either the mother or fetus (and please don't say \"it's genetic\"). \u00a0It is a good thing that endocrine disruptors such as Bisphenol A aren't becoming more widespread and aren't being found in high levels in pregnant women or I might be worried.\n\nAnd, almost without a doubt, the \"autistic rights\" movement is going to have a conniption about these results. \u00a0Instead of focusing on the fact that results like this help us to better understand the biology of autism and to come up with better ways of helping people with autism, I can almost guarantee that they are going to focus on the idea that this result might lead to a prenatal test for autism. \n\nThe summary of the paper is available from the IMFAR 2012 site and I am including it below.\n\nS. Baron-Cohen, B. Auyeung1, B. N\u00f8rgaard-Pedersen2, D. M. Hougaard2, M. W. Abdallah2,3, L. Melgard2, A. Cohen2, L. Ruta1 and M. V. Lombardo1, (1)Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom, (2)Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Immunology, Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark, (3)Department of Epidemiology, Aarhus University Faculty of Health Sciences, Aarhus C, Denmark\n\nBackground: Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are much more common in males. One hypothesized biological mechanism that could potentially influence this male bias is fetal testosterone (FT) or more generally the broader steroidogenic pathway leading to the synthesis of testosterone (Baron-Cohen et al 2011, PLOS-Biology; Baron-Cohen et al, 2005, Science). Sex steroids are well established as an epigenetic fetal mechanism for modifying gene expression and a host of other molecular/cellular factors in early brain development and may be helpful as predictive markers for those who may be at increased risk for later diagnosis.\n\nObjectives: To test for the first time the hypothesis that fetal steroidogenic activity is elevated in individuals who later receive a diagnosis of ASC.\n\nMethods: 62 male cases of classic autism (without a comorbid diagnosis of \u2019mental retardation\u2019) or Asperger Syndrome and 231 typical male controls were selected from the Historic Birth Cohort, a biobank of amniocentesis samples taken from the Danish population since 1993. Using mass spectrometry we assessed the concentration of 4 hormones in the ?4 steroidogenic pathway tied explicitly to CYP17 enzymatic pathway (i.e. progesterone, 17a-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone) in amniotic fluid sampled during weeks 10-20 of gestation. Cortisol was also measured as a control hormone that is not within the main ?4 sex steroid biosynthesis pathway. Analysis of the main hypothesis (that ?4 pathway hormones are elevated in ASC) consisted of computing the multivariate Wilk\u2019s lambda statistic within a permutation test (re-computed over 1,000,001 iterations). Further classification analyses were implemented using logistic regression and classification performance measures were compared to null distributions estimated under chance conditions via permutation tests.\n\nResults: A permutation test (1,000,001 iterations) on the multivariate Wilk\u2019s lambda statistic showed that when testing all hormones there was an overall group difference in the direction of ASC>Control (p=0.01). Following up this multivariate result with tests on each hormone individually, we found that concentration of all 4 steroidogenic hormones in the ?4 pathway were elevated in the ASC group, but there was no between-group difference in cortisol concentration. Logistic regression was then used to classify diagnostic status using all hormones. Classification accuracy, specificity, PPV, and NPV were all significantly higher than chance values estimated by permutation tests (all p<0.02). Sensitivity approached statistical significance (p=0.06).\n\nConclusions: This work represents the first direct verification that fetal exposure to sex steroids is elevated in those who later receive a diagnosis of autism. Given the role of sex steroids in a host of interactions at the genetic and molecular/cellular level, this finding represents an important breakthrough in understanding early factors that contribute to the pathophysiology of ASC. Classification analyses show that while these markers are statistically significant in predicting later diagnosis status, such markers should not be used as a fetal test. Future work comparing autism to other neurodevelopmental conditions will be important in clarifying the specificity of such markers to autism, and how such fetal hormones impact the neurodevelopment of autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2012/webprogram/start.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17-Hydroxyprogesterone", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androstenedione", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Steroidogenesis.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Steroidogenesis.svg/541px-Steroidogenesis.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP17A1", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_disruptor", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110511151337.htm", "http://imfar.confex.com/imfar/2012/webprogram/Paper10452.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/05/validating-extreme-male-brain-theory-of.html", "title": "\nValidating the Extreme Male Brain Theory of Autism\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 5, 2011", "body": "\nA CNN story is making the rounds about how Bill Gates called the autism-vaccine link an \"absolute lie\". \u00a0Bill Gates made the following statement in response to a softball question from Sanjay Gupta -\nWell, Dr. Wakefield has been shown to have used absolutely fraudulent data. He had a financial interest in some lawsuits, he created a fake paper, the journal allowed it to run. All the other studies were done, showed no connection whatsoever again and again and again. So it\u2019s an absolute lie that has killed thousands of kids. Because the mothers who heard that lie, many of them didn\u2019t have their kids take either pertussis or measles vaccine, and their children are dead today. And so the people who go and engage in those anti-vaccine efforts \u2014 you know, they, they kill children. It\u2019s a very sad thing, because these vaccines are important.Of course, the usual sources are all up in arms about these statements. \u00a0On the outraged side you have have Age of Autism and Adventures in Autism with the typical lines about lack of studies and buying attacks. \u00a0On the flip side, you have Left Brain Right Brain with a \"telling it like it is\" and the Autism Vaccine Science Foundation plugging the interview.\n\nI think both of groups are getting overly excited about nothing. \u00a0Who really cares about a throw away line from Bill Gates? \u00a0While his foundation does do good work around the world in helping prevent disease I don't think what he said was anything more than a typical PR fluff statement. \u00a0It is a good thing that his foundation is pledging 10 billion dollars to help save lives. \u00a0But what does Bill Gates really know about the subject?\n\nIf look at what Bill Gates said, you can easily see that he isn't that\u00a0knowledgeable\u00a0on the subject. \u00a0Lets ignore the use of the phrase \"absolute lie\" in a sentence that makes a completely unsubstantiated claim - \"killed thousands of kids\" - and instead focus on the two specific examples he gives - the pertussis and measles vaccines.\n\nThe first, the pertussis vaccine, is easy to dispense with - Wakefield has nothing to do with the pertussis vaccine. \u00a0He has not, to the best of my knowledge, ever published on the subject nor have I ever read about him discussing that vaccine specifically. \u00a0But more importantly, if you actually take the time to look into the recent pertussis outbreaks, you would quickly see that they are happening for complex reasons\u00a0not just because some small group of people are declining vaccinations.\n\nSo moving onto the second, the measles vaccine. \u00a0Did Wakefield really have an effect on the use of the vaccine around the world for the past decade? \u00a0While I am sure that he had localized effects in the US and UK, worldwide the picture is quite different. \u00a0Vaccinations around the world have been rising and deaths falling for the past decade -\nAs the result of a vigorous vaccination campaign in which more than 700 million children have been immunized against the measles, the number of deaths worldwide fell 78% from 2000 to 2008, the consortium of organizations known as the Measles Initiative announced today. About 733,000 children died in 2000, compared with 164,000 in 2008, the group said.I am not sure how you look at a 78% drop worldwide and come up with the figure that Wakefield and his ilk are responsible for \"thousands\" of deaths. \n\nThe problem is that people hear names like \"Bill Gates\" and assume that just because they are successful, rich, and (presumably) intelligent that they automatically know what they are talking about. \u00a0Nothing could be further from the truth. \u00a0Just because a person has done well in one area doesn't mean that they are automatically knowledgeable in another.\n\nBill Gates made his statements while acting as a spokesperson for his foundation and was pushing the agenda of his foundation. \u00a0Since his foundation is doing good work that isn't necessarily a bad thing. \u00a0But we really shouldn't read too much into what he said.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://edition.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/02/03/gupta.gates.vaccines.world.health/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/02/on-vaccines-and-autism-gates-and-gupta-are-an-odd-pair.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2011/02/bill-gates-attacks-andrew-wakefield-and.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/02/bill-gates-on-the-anti-vaccine-movement-and-its-connection-to-autism/", "http://autismsciencefoundation.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/bill-gates-on-cnn-vaccine-autism-link-an-absolute-lie/", "http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/booster_shots/2009/12/measles-deaths-have-dropped-78-since-2000.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/02/bill-gates-on-wakefield.html", "title": "\nBill Gates on Wakefield\n"},

ideology and, just for once, communicate clearly and accurately about important issues.\n\nTake for example the latest craze gripping the blogosphere - an autism \"treatment\" that goes by the name of \"Miracle Mineral Solution\", or MMS, that has been around for years but recently had a presentation at Autism One. \n\nThere were many presentations at Autism One that covered a wide range of subjects. \u00a0But which presentation does the remnant of the old neurodiversity movement focus on and hold up as the poster child of the conference? \u00a0MMS, of course, and how it is so dreadful that immediate action is needed to stop the horror. \n\nThe current coverage of MMS sounds awfully like the rhetoric about HBOT that was being spread by almost the same group of people several years back, so I spent some time looking at all of the current claims about MMS. \u00a0If you want to spare yourself some time and effort reading what follows, the best word to summarize the current claims is overblown. \u00a0Using MMS is, more likely than not, a bad idea but listening to all of the nonsense being said about it is also a bad idea.\n\nStill here? \u00a0Well, don't say I didn't warn you that this was going to be a bit long.\n\nIf you haven't heard of MMS until now you are not alone. \u00a0I didn't know what it was until the stories about it started popping up all over the place. \u00a0According to the little bit of research I did, MMS is supposed to do many wondrous things by killing everything that it comes into contact with, except the things that it shouldn't, by summoning the magical scrubbing bubbles of ClO2. \n\nOk, that wasn't very clear or accurate, but I got as far as the word \"Miracle\" in the name and was immediately skeptical. \u00a0Miracle cures don't work unless you are Miracle Max. \u00a0But, if you seriously want to know the details of what this stuff is supposed to do, I suggest looking at here or at the presentation given at Autism One.\n\nNow, let me be perfectly clear here. \u00a0I see absolutely no reason to think that using this stuff will do anything to help my children's autism and I see a lot of potential for harm. \n\nThe FDA said as much when they put out a warning about using it. \u00a0But, then again the FDA takes a dim view of anything claiming to have medicinal properties that has not gone through its review process, so harsh words from the FDA is not an automatic sign that a product doesn't work.\n\nBut I don't want to talk about the fact that MMS likely doesn't do anything helpful, that topic has been covered ad nauseam by many others. \u00a0No, what I wanted to talk about are the misleading statements such as \u00a0MMS is bleach, MMS is \"industrial bleach (which means it's stronger)\", and that using it is, as the (cough, cough) Thinking Person's Guide To Autism so nicely put it, \"child abuse and tantamount to torture of autistic children\".\n\nThe core of these claims is that giving MMS to your children is the same as giving them bleach and we all know that giving your child bleach is morally wrong. \u00a0And that line is both right, wrong, and completely irrelevant at the same time. \n\nJust to set the ground rules, the standard that ANY treatment should be measured against is how well it works and how much damage it causes while working. \u00a0In a perfect world, all treatments would be both perfectly effective as well as perfectly safe.\n\nWe do not live in a perfect world. \n\nIn our imperfect world world, there are no perfectly effective treatments that have no side effects. \u00a0Almost every treatment to have some level of undesirable side effects to go along with any possible benefits. \u00a0So the goal of any treatment is to make sure the good that comes from a treatment outweighs the bad.\n\nSo for MMS, lets cut to the chase and assume that the stuff doesn't do anything good for you and look at the bad side to see if the harm rises to the level of torture.\n\nThe first claim on the harm side is that MMS is bleach. \u00a0Now, I don't know about you, but when I think of bleach, this is the stuff that comes to mind -\n\n(Picture of bleach bottle removed)\u00a0\n\n\n\nMMS is not the same as this stuff. \n\nThis stuff is (typically) a mixture of (roughly) 5% sodium hypochlorite while MMS is 28%\u00a0sodium chlorite. \u00a0While the names sound quite similar, they are not the same thing nor do they have the same properties. \u00a0The\u00a0best thing you can say is that they are similar chemicals that do similar things. \n\nBut most people aren't going to care (or understand) about the chemical differences between the two. \u00a0Most people are going to hear \"MMS is bleach\", make the automatic association to the stuff in the picture above, and react emotionally based on that. \u00a0\u00a0As Wikipedia\u00a0puts it\u00a0\"the solution of sodium hypochlorite [...] is so ubiquitous that many people just call it 'bleach'\".\n\nThat is the first problem with the claims, the choice and usage of the word \"bleach\"\u00a0almost seems designed to create confusion. \u00a0The structure of many of the references I have seen makes it seem like it is a reference to the stuff in the bottle above because the reference reads like \"bleach\" is a proper noun. \n\nThe say \"MMS is bleach\" the same way that a person would say \"this bottle is bleach\".\n\nA better and less confusing way to rewrite the sentence is that MMS is a bleach to indicate that it is a bleach in the technical and more generic sense of the word. \u00a0As in (again, Wikipedia), a bleach is\u00a0\"a number of chemicals that remove color, whiten, or disinfect, often via oxidation.\"\n\nSo no, MMS is not bleach in the common use of the word, but you might be able to say that MMS is a bleach.\n\nBut then again, if you wanted to get\u00a0really\u00a0technical, the claim that MMS is a bleach is still partially wrong. \u00a0My chemistry is a little weak but, from what I understand, the sodium chlorite in MMS isn't a bleach by itself but needs to be combined with something else to form the actual bleach. \u00a0\u00a0The same holds true for the stuff in the bottle; it isn't much of a bleach until the chlorine is separated from the sodium by some chemical reaction.\n\nIn the case of MMS, the real bleach is\u00a0chlorine dioxide. \u00a0And, as I have learned over the past year of balancing the level of chlorine in a swimming pool and hot tub,\u00a0not all forms of even chlorine are the same let alone bleaches that are different types. \u00a0For example, lithium forms of chlorine are about half as effective as sodium forms, even at the same concentration.\n\nThat last bit is kinda important, so it bears repeating. \u00a0The strength of a bleaching chemical is determined by the amount and type of bleach that is present in the final mixture, not by the initial concentration. \u00a0You can't assume that\u00a0one form of a bleach (chlorine) is going to be equivalent to another, chemically different form of bleach (chlorine dioxide). \u00a0If you do even a little bit of research into the differences between chlorine and chlorine dioxide you would know that they aren't the same thing.\n\nIf all of that gets too technical, just go with what the FDA\u00a0had to say about the process -\n\nThe product, when used as directed, produces an industrial bleach that can cause serious harm to health. The product instructs consumers to mix the 28 percent sodium chlorite solution with an acid such as citrus juice. This mixture produces chlorine dioxide, a potent bleach used for stripping textiles and industrial water treatment\nOr basically, when used as directed, the end result is that MMS forms a chemical that can remove color, whiten, or disinfect, i.e. a bleach.\n\nThe FDA adds in additional \"industrial\" phrase, and that is true, chlorine dioxide is used in the textile as well as other industries. \u00a0But that also ignores the fact that chlorine dioxide is also used in making processed foods, in sanitizing water for human consumption, and (as sodium chlorite) in some personal care products.\n\nCertain people also seem to be misreading the\u00a0\"industrial\" word as meaning extremely strong instead of meaning the more literal meaning of used in industry. \u00a0Another example of the \"industrial\" uses of this product is making white flour - in some cases, flour is literally sprayed into the air in a room full of chlorine dioxide to remove the color (and all of the nutrients) from the flour. \u00a0If you ever wondered how flour turns white or why it has to be enriched after the fact it is because it was bleached.\u00a0 So, if you eat white flour, you are possibly eating a food that has been bleached by the same bleach in MMS.\n\nBut lets forget about the \"industrial\" scare and the different types of bleach for a minute and talk about some of the other common uses of bleach.\u00a0 Have you ever gone in a swimming pool or hot tub? \u00a0Then, chances are, you have gone swimming in bleach. \u00a0There is no difference between the chlorine in a swimming pool an the chlorine generated by a standard household bottle of bleach. \u00a0If you children have ever swallowed any pool water (I know mine do all of the time), they you have basically given your children bleach.\n\nOther common household uses include\u00a0personal care products such as toothpaste or mouthwash, sanitizing reverse\u00a0osmosis water filters, and your everyday cleaners. \u00a0Do you let you kids eat off of a table after you just used a cleanser on it? \u00a0Congratulations, you probably just gave them some bleach.\n\nAnd then there is the fact that many municipal water supplies (in the US at least) are sanitized using some level type of bleach. \u00a0There are detectable levels of bleach or bleach by-products (yes, those sometimes count as bleaches) in normal everyday tap water.\n\nThe point is that expose to or ingestion of bleaching chemicals is not some rare or horrific event. \u00a0It literally happens every day. \u00a0And, if you are really worried about chemical exposures, then you really should be more concerned about antibacterial soap, Bisphenol A, household cleaners, VOCs, and a host of other chemicals that children are being exposure to everyday. \n\nOf course the counter argument here is that MMS is a \"purer\" form of bleach, and that is partially true. \u00a0You may be\u00a0will be exposed to more of a bleaching chemical when you drink an MMS cocktail than when you shallow some water from an average residential swimming pool. \u00a0How much more (or less) depends on exactly how much MMS is used, what exactly it is mixed with, and how fluid much it is diluted in afterwards.\n\nThe target number that you are supposed to get to with MMS is 1 ppm (part per million) of chlorine dioxide. \u00a0Although since there are so many variables that determine the final amount of the bleaching chemical in the final mixture it would be pretty easy to make a mistake and make it far stronger than it should be.\n\nFor reference,\u00a0residential tap water\u00a0can contain up to 0.8 ppm of chlorine dioxide and a residential swimming pool typically has about 5 ppm of chlorine.\n\nHowever, the variable strength of the mixture is one of the two large drawbacks to using MMS. \u00a0You should not need a degree in chemistry to be able to safely use an over the counter supplement. \u00a0The other drawback is, of course, that it is likely that drinking even a properly mixed MMS cocktail doesn't do anything good for you.\n\nRegardless,\u00a0assuming that you use the product \"correctly\", you would be exposed to not much more chlorine dioxide than is allowed in tap water and, on a ppm basis, less than what is in a typical swimming pool. \u00a0Again, my chemistry is a little weak, but I don't think that 1 ppm of chlorine dioxide is going to do much harm when tap water contains almost that much and a typical swimming pool contains 5 times that amount of a different type.\n\nSo, the\u00a0idea that giving this mixture to a child is some sort of child abuse or torture is just plain silly. \u00a0If that level of exposure is torture, I would hate to see what these people would say about me letting my children spend hours in the pool everyday.\n\nEDITED TO ADD : Ignore the crossed out text above, it is wrong. The bottom line is that even using a single drop of MMS is a standard sized glass is a little over six times stronger than pool water - roughly 32ppm. \u00a0And it gets worse the more drops that you use at a time or if you take it multiple times per day. \u00a0See this discussion for more details.\n\nBut lets side aside the whole \"bleach\" idea and look at what harm this stuff can do if you take it. \u00a0Remember, any treatment should be judged on the benefits it gives and the harm that it does. \u00a0Even if we agree that MMS doesn't do anything at beneficial, we can still look at the harm side to see whether it is just another pointless treatment or whether it is truly harmful. \n\nIf this idea seems contrived then just think of all of the mainstream treatments that\u00a0are used every day that can have harmful side effects and yet give no real benefit.\n\n\u00a0If you read the lists of potential side effects that are being published everywhere, this stuff sounds almost like straight poison. \u00a0But there is a difference between all of the theoretically possible side effects that are included in these lists and the ones that will happen on a regular basis.\n\nSo lets put these side effects into perspective. \u00a0The following items are \"common\"\u00a0side effects from MMS, two drugs, and a supplement. \u00a0All of these things are commonly used yet have times that they are used when they might have few, if any, benefits.\n\nSee if you can figure out which one is which without peeking at the answers below.\n\n1. Headache, nervousness, drowsiness, dizziness, heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, stomach pain, increased salivation, pain, especially in the arms, legs, or joints.\n\n2. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, symptoms of severe dehydration,\n\n3. Fever,  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste, kidney and stomach damage.\n\n4. Upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea.\n\nFigure it out? \n\nThe item in question are\n\n1. Aripiprazole - a drug to treat irritability in autism\n2. MMS\n3. Zinc supplements\n4. Amoxicillin, a commonly used antibiotic.\n\nSo, the side effects of MMS are very similar to those that can happen when using other common treatments. \u00a0Does that mean giving Aripiprazole to your child when it isn't clear that there will be benefits \"child abuse\"? \u00a0Does the medical\u00a0profession's\u00a0constant overuse of antibiotics qualify as torture?\n\nOf course you can say that MMS doesn't have any potential benefits to offset the negatives. \u00a0You can say that all it does do is rid you of those couple of extra dollars that were floating around in your wallet. \u00a0But, in reality, you can't even say that. \n\nThere is a tiny little distinction in evidence based medicine that is commonly forgotten but is really important to the whole thing. \n\nThere are treatments that have evidence that show that they are effective. \u00a0These are the treatments you should, more likely than not, be using.\n\nThere are treatments that have evidence that shows that the treatment are not effective. \u00a0These are the treatments that, more likely than not, you should not be using.\n\nAnd then there are the treatments that have no real evidence one way or the other. \u00a0You can say that these treatments don't have evidence that they work but you can't say that they have evidence that they don't work. \u00a0A lack of data is a lack of data - not evidence against the treatment.\n\nI think it goes without saying but if you want to attempt to use a treatment from that last category,\u00a0you should \u00a0do your homework and exercise extreme caution in doing so. \u00a0But, having said that, if you shy away from a possible autism treatment just because it is not completely supported by the evidence, then you don't have many treatment options to work with.\n\nMMS clearly falls into that last category - there is nothing that says it works but there is nothing that says that is doesn't either. \u00a0So, if you are going to be one of the, uhm, brave souls to try it, you had best be very careful and be sure you understand exactly what it might do and the harm it could cause before even thinking about it. \u00a0And if you can't do the calculations to figure out what amount of sodium chlorite is needed with what type of acid to produce the required ppm of chlorine dioxide in your head then you shouldn't be using it.\n\nIn all seriousness, it is pretty likely that MMS doesn't do anything beneficial but it still has some very real side effects. \u00a0But, it is not as bad as everybody is making it seem. \u00a0MMS may be a type of bleach but it is a far cry from pouring pure, concentrated laundry bleach down a kids throat - which is what everybody seems to be implying. \u00a0And using it is certainly not a form of torture or child abuse.\n\nAnd that is really the point of all of this. \n\nA calm, non-emotional, and objective look at MMS shows that it likely does nothing that we want to do and it has some potentially problematic side-effects. \u00a0And that is the standard that should be used to judge ANY treatment for a child with autism - evidence based or not. \n\nThe standard should not be who can make the most absurd claims or who can get a nonsensical claim repeated the most. \u00a0It is in everybody's best interest to go for clear, accurate information and to forgo the polarizing rhetoric that seems to be far to common in the autism world. \u00a0These sorts of claims might be good for getting the troops all lines up and ready to go, but it does very little to actually help anybody.\n\nSo, how about we all turn down the rhetoric a little?\n\n\nEDITED TO ADD: And in case you didn't get the point about MMS from what I already said above, here it is very simply put - don't use it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismone.org/content/schedule-autismonegeneration-rescue-conference", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(film)", "http://www.miraclemineral.org/", "http://www.mmsautism.com/?page_id=68", "http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm220756.htm", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2012/06/rambling-cognitive-dissonance-or-why.html", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2012/06/dangerous-interventions-mms-and-autism.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_dioxide", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan#Health_concerns", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A", "http://www.epa.gov/iaq/voc.html", "http://water.epa.gov/drink/contaminants/index.cfm#List", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000221/", "http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm220756.htm", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/982.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000837/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/06/omg-its-bleach.html", "title": "\nOMG, Its Bleach!

{"date": "Friday, June 15, 2012", "body": "\nIf you have been exposed to almost any discussion about why the number of children with a diagnosis of autism has risen sharply over the past several decades, I am sure you have run across the idea that a large part of the increase is in the high-functioning group. \u00a0And, to an extent, this idea is true - there are more children being\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0today than in the past that fit into the high-functioning bucket.\n\nBut what is often not mentioned is that there has been an equally large (if not larger) increase in the number of middle and lower functioning children as well. \u00a0This pattern is plainly visible in many of the recent estimates of autism\u00a0prevalence (I hope to have a post up about that soon, time permitting).\n\nOf course the reason or reasons for the sharp increase are still unknown; whether it be more awareness, better services,\u00a0an expanding definition of autism, an actual increase in the number of cases, or some other reason entirely.\n\nSo, in light of all of this, I found this recent re-examination of a historical data set from 1980 to be of interest. I haven't had a chance to look at the full text of the paper yet, but it does raise some questions. \u00a0The immediate thing that jumps out at me is that the \"missed\" group is comprised of children who would likely be very low functioning, having an average IQ of 35 (!) . \n\nThe original group was solidly in the intellectually disabled range (i.e. low functioning) and yet the group\u00a0identified\u00a0in this re-examination had an even lower average IQ than that. \u00a0For reference, an \"average\" person's IQ is about 100 and intellectual disability starts at about 70.\n\nThe abstract is below.\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder Reclassified: A Second Look at the 1980s Utah/UCLA Autism Epidemiologic Study.\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to re-examine diagnostic data from a state-wide autism prevalence study (n = 489) conducted in the 1980s to investigate the impact of broader diagnostic criteria on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) case status. Sixty-four (59 %) of the 108 originally \"Diagnosed Not Autistic\" met the current ASD case definition. The average IQ estimate in the newly identified group (IQ = 35.58; SD = 23.01) was significantly lower than in the original group (IQ = 56.19 SD = 21.21; t = 5.75; p < .0001). Today's diagnostic criteria applied to participants ascertained in the 1980s identified more cases of autism with intellectual disability. The current analysis puts this historic work into context and highlights differences in ascertainment between epidemiological studies performed decades ago and those of today\u00a0\nOf course, the real question about this result is what exactly is the \"current ASD case definition\" that was used and how it was determined whether an original participant met this definition. \u00a0As we saw with other recent studies, it is not always easy (or possible) to map the data collected years ago into what the criteria for autism look like today.\n\n\nReferences\n\nMiller JS, Bilder D, Farley M, Coon H, Pinborough-Zimmerman J, Jenson W, Rice \u00a0CE, Fombonne E, Pingree CB, Ritvo E, Ritvo RA, McMahon WM.

{"date": "Friday, June 22, 2012", "body": "\nToday must be my lucky day, my last post was the subject of a smear post written by the lord high smear blogger himself, Orac.  Or, since he decided to get personal from the start, I think I should just call him by his real name, David Gorski.  Gorski apparently didn't like the subject of my last post and decided to write one of his typical rambling rants about it, or as I like to call them, smear posts.\n\nI call them smear posts because the good doctor doesn't like to confine himself to facts and talking about ideas.  No, he seems to feel the need to editorialize about and impugn the character of everyone he writes about while impressing us with his brilliance.  For example, I apparently don't understand science based medicine.\n\nI was going to respond to his post with one of my own but after reading the comments on the his post I changed my mind. \u00a0I actually had to laugh at how inane some of these people are. \n\nOne particularly sad person took me to task for not thanking Gorski for plugging my blog and giving me a forum to correct my errors before telling me my \"tone\" was offensive. \u00a0According to this person, I defend child abusers.\n\nAnother explained to me that because I was having saying inappropriate things about MMS that I am one of its defenders. \u00a0And another one counted the number of words I wrote and decided that I spent too many words saying the wrong about MMS thing therefore I had to be defending it. \u00a0That was right before he said that I was \"sampling the wares\".\n\nYou really can't make stuff like this up. \u00a0I didn't think that my thoughts on MMS were unclear, but in case anyone didn't get the point, here it is from the top of the other post -\n\nNow, let me be perfectly clear here.  I see absolutely no reason to think that using this stuff will do anything to help my children's autism and I see a lot of potential for harm. \nI can see why there is all of the confusion, that statement (and others like it) were totally\u00a0ambiguous. \u00a0Or maybe, if you believe the post and the people making comments, I am really secretly an MMS sympathizer and my entire post was just a ruse. \u00a0Drat, they figured me out.\n\nLike I said, I was going to respond to Gorski's points but, after reading some of the comments, I realized that it is completely pointless. \u00a0There is absolutely no point in engaging with these people because many of them are just fanatics. \u00a0Internet blowhards like Gorski exist because they can collect followers who feed into their desire to be important and because people will actually engage them. \u00a0If you can't see the huge ego staring out from behind Gorski's writing then you aren't paying attention.\n\nI don't have any need or desire to prove to the world that mine's bigger than everyone else's. \u00a0You can take what I say and agree with it, disagree with it, or tell me I am an idiot, it is entirely up to you. \u00a0Gorski apparently thinks I'm an idiot and I really couldn't care less.\n\nSo, yea, good job David, you really showed me. Although, just between you and me, you really sound like an idiot when you say stuff like paying attention to differences in chemical composition is\u00a0pedantry and it is the class of chemical that is more important. \u00a0Because I can totally see how that option fits into science based medicine. \u00a0 After all,\u00a0acetaminophen and\u00a0ibuprofen are both pain relievers so they are exactly the same thing too, right?\n\nBut since I do care about accuracy, I will correct one potential mistake that I made in the last post. \u00a0The dose of chlorine dioxide in a single, uhm, serving of MMS might be higher than I thought it was. \u00a0I said that I though it was around 1 ppm and I based that on comments that I read around the internet. \u00a0According to Gorki, that dose is like 80 ppm and while I think that figure is probably wrong (anyone with a good knowledge of chemistry want to chime in?), I also think my figure is an under estimation.\n\nHowever, even if you remove that one point, the rest of the post still holds true. \u00a0The hyperbolic rhetoric employed by people like Gorski and his ilk might be good for firing up the minions but it does nothing productive for the larger autism community.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2012/06/21/mms-a-k-a-bleach-for-autism-just-when-i-think-im-out/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/06/smear-blogging.html", "title": "\nSmear Blogging\n"},

Or, as an article on Nature puts it -\n\nOne of the more remarkable findings described in the consortium's 'entr\u00e9e' paper is that 80% of the genome contains elements linked to biochemical functions, dispatching the widely held view that the human genome is mostly 'junk DNA'. The authors report that the space between genes is filled with enhancers (regulatory DNA elements), promoters (the sites at which DNA's transcription into RNA is initiated) and numerous previously overlooked regions that encode RNA transcripts that are not translated into proteins but might have regulatory roles.\nOr, as I would put it, the 2% of our DNA that was thought to be significant is only a small part of the picture. \u00a0What matters more is whether that small part is turned on or off and when these transitions happen. \u00a0There doesn't have to be a known mutation in a known gene for a part of the biological processes in a person's body to be messed up. \u00a0There are many things that can control how genes are turned on or off and today we learned of yet another major one.\n\nThere are news articles in all of the major outlets such as the NY Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and Business Week\u00a0just to name a few. \u00a0And there is an excellent resource on the Nature site as well.\n\nTime will tell what this means for people with autism but I predict a renewed interest in \"junk\" genetic mutations associated with autism. \u00a0 Which will be a little bit of a shame, really, since the idea that autism is \"genetic\" has almost been put out to pasture. \u00a0First it was mutations are strongly associated with autism, that came up largely empty, then it was copy number variations are strongly associated which was another bust, now it is going to be junk dna causes autism. \u00a0I think this avenue of investigation is going to be a bust as well but at least it might get people looking at genetic regulatory mechanisms which is where I suspect the problem actually is.\n\nI guess we will have to wait and see what happens.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/489045a.html", "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/489052a.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/science/far-from-junk-dna-dark-matter-proves-crucial-to-health.html?pagewanted=all", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/junk-dna-concept-debunked-by-new-analysis-of-human-genome/2012/09/05/cf296720-f772-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_story.html", "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443589304577633560336453228.html", "http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-05/genetic-circuitry-found-that-may-help-target-complex-diseases", "http://www.nature.com/encode/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-end-of-junk-dna.html", "title": "\nThe End of Junk DNA\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, September 8, 2012", "body": "\nA group of researchers has identified a possible biological mechanism that might be responsible for a rare form of autism. In these cases, mutations of the BCKDK gene inactivates an enzyme that is necessary for breaking down certain types of amino acids. \u00a0These essential amino acids cannot be created by the body and can only be absorbed from food. \n\nIt isn't clear exactly how the\u00a0absence\u00a0of these essential amino acids leads to autism however there is some limited data from mice and\u00a0anecdotal data from parents that providing appropriate supplements can restore the normal level of these amino acids and lead to improvements in the symptoms of autism.\n\nIf all of that sounds a little confusing, think of it this way. \u00a0A small genetic mutation prevents you from absorbing critical substances from your food and the long term lack of these substances causes autism. \n\nIf you are interested in more information about the subject, there is a good write up over on Questioning Answers, there is an article in Nature describing the finding, as well as the actual paper. \u00a0There is also some details about what the the BCKDK gene does and prior links to autism here and here.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a broken record, I think it is going to become increasingly clear over time that many, if not most, cases of autism are going to caused by a process like this. \u00a0We are going to find that there are disruptions to critical biological processes that lead to the symptoms of autism and that by correcting these biological disruptions we will be able to help people recover from autism. \n\nWe are going to find that the behaviors of autism are a side effect (co-morbid, if you will) and that the real problem is the biological disruption and the damage that causes. \u00a0So instead of the brain being wired \"differently\" because that it is written into the person's genes, it wired differently because some process is preventing it from developing normally.\n\nHowever, as I said before, a critical part of a model like this is that recovery will be a two step process. \u00a0Simply correcting the underlying disruption will not instantly remove the symptoms of autism. \u00a0It will take time for the body to recover from the damaged caused and it will take time for old behaviors to be unlearned and new skills to be learned.\n\nBut the important part is that autism can be successfully treated. \u00a0The key is going to be finding what the disruptions are in a specific person and finding a way of correcting those disruptions.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BCKDK", "http://questioning-answers.blogspot.com/2012/09/bckdk-mutations-treatable-form-of-autism.html", "http://www.nature.com/news/amino-acid-deficiency-underlies-rare-form-of-autism-1.11375", "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/09/05/science.1224631", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene&cmd=retrieve&dopt=default&rn=1&list_uids=10295", "http://omim.org/entry/611913#reference7"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/09/rare-and-potentially-treatable-form-of.html", "title": "\nRare and Potentially Treatable Form of Autism\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, July 21, 2012", "body": "\nA very interesting study was just released that showed that disruptions of the immune system can lead to the behaviors of autism, at least in mice. \u00a0There are quite a few write ups of the actual results, such as here,\u00a0here, here,\u00a0or here, so I won't try to add anything to these already good reviews.\n\nInstead I want to go for gross oversimplification of the findings because the pattern it suggests is, in my humble opinion, a good guide to what autism actually is for many people. \u00a0Ready?\n\n1. Mother's immune system is given a swift kick.\n2. Child's immune system is thrown out of balance.\n3. Child develops behaviors of autism later in life.\n\nand, most importantly -\n\n4. Correcting the child's immune system reduces the autistic behaviors.\n\nOf course this is all in mice and doesn't automatically translate into humans. \u00a0But given all of the evidence of immune disruptions in autism I strongly suspect that we will see some effective evidence based therapies for autism that target these disruptions within the next ten years.\n\nYou can call this pattern anything you want but the key elements are that something is biologically out of balance in people with autism and that correcting the imbalance can lead to \"recovery\" from autism. \n\nRead that last sentence again because I feel that it is the key to putting together all of the things we know about autism.  Instead of the current idea that autism is a fundamental part of who a person is (i.e. it is written into their genetic code), this model suggests that autism is a state that a person's body is in.  There is still room for genetic mutations in this model but these mutations are important insofar as they make it easier for a person to get into a disrupted state.\n\nI could write pages and pages about how this model fits into what we know about autism but since I don't have that much time nor I am not under the delusion that anyone would actually want to read that, I will just quickly hit the highlights.\n\n1. The \"genetic\" model of autism is a bust. \u00a0There is no single mutation or group of mutations that occur in any sizable part of the autism population. \u00a0The mutations that have been found can be significant for the people who have them but I think they are really just background noise in the larger discussion of what causes autism.\n\n2. The number of people with autism is increasing rapidly. \u00a0There are a number of reasons for this increase but it isn't really possible to deny that there has a real and substantial increase in the number of people who have autism.\n\n3. There are many, many, many biological disruptions that are seen in substantial subsets of people with autism. \u00a0I always have to laugh when people dismiss these disruptions as unimportant (or \"co-morbid\") because they only appear in like 30% of people with autism and then turn around and trumpet the latest genetic finding as significant when it appears in maybe 1% of people with autism.\n\n4. There is substantial evidence from other related conditions, such as Retts, Fragile X, SLOS, Wilsons disease, and the group of conditions called inborn errors of creatine metabolism\u00a0(just to name a few), that correcting the biology corrects the condition even when there are genetic mutations present.\n\nAll of these ideas fit nicely into the model of autism as a biological disruption. \n\nYou don't have to have some genetic mutation that is \"causing\" autism, all you need something strong enough to push a person out of\u00a0equilibrium. \u00a0And something that is strong enough to do that could likely cause the random but almost unique mutations that are seen in autism.\n\nThe number of people with a specific genetic disorder isn't likely to change rapidly but biologically induced disorders certainly can and do. \u00a0If you want a model of that consider Pink's disease. \u00a0It came, it rapidly rose, and then, once the cause was found, it disappeared just as quickly as it appeared.\n\nThe same can be true for the autism epidemic if get our collective heads out of our asses and stop thinking of autism as some permanent thing and instead consider it as an imbalance that can and should be corrected.\n\n(Before anyone decides to leave a less than polite comment suggesting that I am calling people with autism defective, calling them less than typical people, or wants to suggest that I don't like my children, don't waste your time. \u00a0I am not saying, implying, or suggesting anything of the sort. \u00a0If you want to interpret my words to mean that then you are certainly entitled to your opinion, but I will ask you to take your stupidity elsewhere. \u00a0Serious comments - even if you want to tell me I am completely wrong - are always welcome. )\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120717141010.htm", "http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/247992.php", "http://questioning-answers.blogspot.com/2012/07/autism-mouse-immune-bonemarrow.html", "http://infectiousbehavior.wordpress.com/2012/07/17/bone-marrow-transplants-in-autism-models/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rett_syndrome", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002633/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith-Lemli-Opitz_syndrome", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_disease", "http://questioning-answers.blogspot.com/2012/07/inborn-errors-of-creatine-metabolism.html", "http://shm.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/2/291.abstract"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/07/read-between-lines.html", "title": "\nRead Between The Lines\n"},

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chronic oxidative changes in membrane lipids and proteins found in many chronic diseases are not the result of accidental damage. Instead, these changes are the result of a highly evolved, stereotyped, and protein-catalyzed \"oxidative shielding\" response that all eukaryotes adopt when placed in a chemically or microbially hostile environment. The machinery of oxidative shielding evolved from pathways of innate immunity designed to protect the cell from attack and to limit the spread of infection. Both oxidative and reductive stress trigger oxidative shielding. In the cases in which it has been studied explicitly, functional and metabolic defects occur in the cell before the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative changes. ROS are the response to disease, not the cause. Therefore, it is not the oxidative changes that should be targeted for therapy, but rather the metabolic conditions that create them. This fresh perspective is relevant to diseases that range from autism, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer disease. Research efforts need to be redirected. Oxidative shielding is protective and is a misguided target for therapy. Identification of the causal chemistry and environmental factors that trigger innate immunity and metabolic memory that initiate and sustain oxidative shielding is paramount for human health.\n\nPMID: 22700427\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22700427.1"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/06/study-oxidative-stress-of-oxidative.html", "title": "\nStudy : Oxidative Stress of Oxidative Shielding?\n"},

{"date": "Monday, April 16, 2012", "body": "\nIf you remember, a few months back there was a big to-do about an article\u00a0 in the New York Times on the upcoming DSM 5 autism criteria. \u00a0This article, which was based on unpublished data, breathlessly suggested that many people with a current definition of autism could lose the diagnosis under the new criteria.\n\nThe main claim from the article was basically this -\n\nIn the new analysis, Dr. Volkmar, along with Brian Reichow and James McPartland, both at Yale, used data from a large 1993 study that served as the basis for the current criteria. They focused on 372 children and adults who were among the highest functioning and found that overall, only 45 percent of them would qualify for the proposed autism spectrum diagnosis now under review.\nWell, the study was finally published a few weeks back and, I have to say, the article in the NY Times was a flaming piece of horseshit. \u00a0Or perhaps a better way of putting that is the title of the article should have been \"what happens when you map an ancient data set onto a new set of questions when the data for the new questions wasn't collected in the first place\". \u00a0The subtitle should have been \"What? \u00a0That one question was important?\"\n\nOK, that might be a little bit harsh, but there is just a little difference between \"new definition of autism will exclude many\" and what the study actually says.\n\nTo give you an example, see the line above that says \"they focused on 372 children and adults who were among the highest functioning\"? \u00a0Well, what that should have said was that they focused on the 237 \"highest functioning\" children and adults with autism but also included 96 children and adults who had developmental disabilities other than autism. \u00a0The \"only 45 percent\"\u00a0referred to the 237 - not the 372.\n\nOK, so they inflated the number a measly 56%, that doesn't change the result, right? \u00a0Well, other than make the higher functioning group appear to be much larger than it was no, it doesn't really. \u00a0Oh, but wait, there was this second group, a group of 420 \"low-functioning\" people with autism. \u00a0Does making the first group seem roughly the same size as this second group matter?\n\nIt doesn't really matter, no, not until you consider that the majority (about 70%) in this second group kept their diagnosis under the DSM 5. \u00a0In other words, the study found that the largest group mostly kept their diagnosis while this other, smaller group lost it about half of the time. \u00a0And, as I will show below, most of the .\npeople who \"lost\" their diagnosis in both groups did so because of just 1 criteria from the DSM 5 and the reason they didn't meet the criteria is likely because the original trial didn't collect enough data.\n\nSo, even though each little fact doesn't matter that much, when you put it all together it makes a great deal of difference. \u00a0But I guess calling the article \"the majority of the majority keeps their diagnosis under the new autism criteria and those who lost it were probably just missing data\"\u00a0wouldn't have made such a good headline.\n\nSigh. Journalists never seem to let the facts get in the way of a good story.\n\nThe good news is that, now that the full study has been published, we have the opportunity to look at the data and see exactly what the claims in the NY Times article were based on. \n\nAs I suspected, the study is based on data that was originally collected for a 1994 field trial of the DSM IV. This earlier field trial was done to test how well the then new DSM IV criteria for autism compared to earlier criteria such as the DSM-III-R. \u00a0That last bit is quite important - this trial wasn't a general test of the proposed DSM IV criteria but rather a comparison of how well the criteria did compared to earlier ones in a group of people that were already \"known\" to have or not have autism.\n\nThe current study took the data collected in the earlier field trial for all of the criteria that were tested (DSM IV, DSM-III-R, ICD-10) and mapped them onto the proposed DSM 5 criteria to evaluate how well the DSM 5 worked. \u00a0This is the single largest problem with this study and why the results are pretty much meaningless.\n\nThe current study says its objective is to test the \"potential impact of the proposed DSM 5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder\" but that is not what it really did.\u00a0 In reality, the current study, like the earlier field trial, is a comparison of the proposed criteria to the current ones. \u00a0It is not a study about how well the new DSM 5 criteria identifies people with autism in the general population but rather a comparison of how much the old criteria and new criteria agree.\n\nBut the current study fails at even that task. \u00a0In the earlier field trial, data was collected for all of the criteria being tested and then the criteria were compared. \u00a0But since the original field trial didn't include the DSM 5 criteria, it didn't collect the data needed to see if someone met the DSM 5 criteria. \u00a0So the researchers came up with a system of mapping the items from the earlier criteria to the criteria in the DSM 5.\n\nThe problem is that the questions in the original field trial did not directly address the new criteria in the DSM \u00a05. \u00a0There were areas that had a lot of coverage, areas that had extremely little coverage, and areas that had almost no coverage. \u00a0And, as I will show below, it is these areas of little to almost no coverage that are mostly responsible for \"excluding\" people under the DSM 5 criteria.\n\n\nIf the authors had actually wanted to\u00a0test the \"potential impact\" of the DSM 5 criteria and how they stacked up to the current DSM IV, they should have done the same thing that the original field trial did. \u00a0They should have picked a large group of people and collected data for the DSM IV and the DSM 5 criteria and directly compared the two.\n\nThere are a few other problems with the study such as how the number of people with autism has grown in the time since the field trial was done and the\u00a0possibility\u00a0that the sort of person who would have gotten a autism diagnosis twenty years ago is\u00a0likely\u00a0to be different from the sort of person who would get a\u00a0diagnosis\u00a0today. \u00a0Also, since the world of autism has changed so much in the\u00a0intervening\u00a0years, it would really have helped to use more recent data.\n\nTo give you an example of how much the world of autism has changed, the original field trial used people who had \"professional backgrounds and experience in the diagnosis of autism\" to help rate the data. \u00a0About half of these people had \"extensive experience\" in diagnosing autism where \"extensive experience\" meant \"had evaluated more than 25 cases of autism\". \u00a0In other words,\u00a0half of the people making the determinations in the earlier trial had made less than 25 autism diagnoses.\n\nCompare that to today were even someone new to the field might will make that many diagnoses in their first year. \u00a0The current \"experts\" in the field have probably made hundreds of\u00a0diagnoses and been involved in far more cases than that.\n\nBut, without further ado or commentary from me, here are the actual numbers from the study.\n\nFirst, the paper took most of the original participants, broke them down by their specific diagnosis, and determined whether they met the DSM 5 criteria. \u00a0They also included the \"Related Disorders\" category from the initial study to test whether the new criteria would exclude them.\n\nThe table below shows the numbers from the original 1994 study, the number included in the current study, and the part of the group in the current study that met the DSM 5 criteria.\n\n\n\nWhen you look at it this way, you can see that the majority of people with an \"autism\" label retained their diagnosis while the PDD-NOS and Asperger groups mainly lost them. \u00a0I will get into why this happened in a little bit.\n\nNext, the study broke up the participants by \"functioning level\" and looked at how well the criteria fit the different groups. \u00a0\"High Functioning\" was defined to be children and adults with an IQ above 70. \u00a0Some of the participants were missing IQ data and were excluded from the \"high functioning\" group. \u00a0The numbers for the \"low functioning & missing data\" group are my own calculations from the data included in the study (Total - High Functioning).\n\nThe meaning of the columns in the table below are the same as the table above. \n\n\n\nIf you notice, more of the \"high functioning\" were excluded under then DSM 5 than the \"lower functioning\". \u00a0The authors felt that the DSM 5 fit the \"lower functioning\" side of the spectrum better than the higher functioning. \u00a0This finding was the basis of the NY Times article.\n\nBut, that isn't the complete story of what this data shows and there are some substantial weaknesses in this data.\n\nAs you can see, most of the participants from the original study fell into the low function group. \u00a0The \"high functioning\" group that was talked about in the NY Times made up only about 35% of the people with autism.\u00a0 So, like normal, the NY Times article was focusing on the high functioning minority and ignoring the majority of people with autism.\n\nHowever, the more important question is why some of the participants did not meet the new DSM 5 criteria. \u00a0In my opinion, the answer to this question is that the original study did not cover enough of the new DSM 5 criteria. \u00a0The study included some information about why participants might have been excluded so I was able to create the following summary. \n\nThere was not enough data in the study to break the groups down into high and low functioning, so I am using the groups from the paper.\n\n\n\nThe table above refers to the categories in the proposed DSM 5 criteria. \u00a0If you remember, the DSM 5 criteria combines DSM IV communication and social criteria and expands the repetitive and restrictive behavior criteria to include sensory issues.\n\nThe % Total Group column refers to the percent of the total group (all participant, n = 657 and High Functioning, n = 240) that could have been excluded because they failed to meet the criteria in this category. \u00a0So the first number, 27%, means that 27% of all participants could have been excluded for failing to meet the DSM 5 social communication criteria.\n\nThe Total Number column gives the number of participants that could have been excluded under this category while the % of Excluded puts the Total Number into terms of the excluded group. \u00a0Or in other words, 68% of the group that might lose their diagnosis under the DSM 5 could do so because they don't meet the social/communication criteria.\n\nThe important thing to keep in mind is that a given person could have been excluded for failing to meet more than one set of criteria. \u00a0So a person could been excluded for failing to meet the social communication criteria as well as the age of onset.\n\nOne thing that stands out for me here is that almost 10% of the excluded group could have been excluded because the symptoms didn't appear early enough (age of onset). \u00a0This is in spite of the fact that the DSM 5 doesn't have an age cut-off and actually is less restrictive when it comes to age than the DSM IV is. \u00a0This is in spite of the fact that the DSM IV PDD-NOS diagnosis does not have a strict age criteria. \u00a0Even though both systems were flexible with respect to age of onset and the DSM 5 is less restrictive than the DSM IV, almost 10% could have been excluded because of age of onset. \n\nIn other words, if a person met the onset requirements for the DSM IV, they\u00a0almost certainly would meet the age requirements for the DSM 5 and should not have been excluded. \u00a0I don't know how many of this group were excluded for only missing the age requirement but this does serve as a good example of the disconnect between the original data and the DSM 5 criteria.\n\nMoving along, when you dig down into the data further, it quickly becomes apparent that the vast majority of the exclusions came from three of the DSM 5 criteria. \u00a0All three of these criteria share the fact that they are mapped to only 1 of the items from the original field trial. \u00a0All of the other DSM 5 criteria are mapped to more than 1 items from the original study.\n\nThat simple fact speaks volumes about the final result - the DSM 5 checklist items with the least coverage in the original data are responsible for most of the exclusions.\n\nThe table below shows these three criteria and the part of each group that did not meet the criteria. \u00a0The columns are again the same as the last table.\n\n\n\nAll three of the criteria are interesting but I want to focus on just the one social communication criteria. \u00a0In the DSM 5, you have to meet all 3 of the criteria under the social/communication domain so failing to meet this one criteria could exclude you from getting an autism diagnosis. \n\nAs you can see from the table above, the majority of both groups (high functioning - 70%, all participants - 61%) could have been excluded because they failed just this one criteria. \u00a0The criteria isn't anything surprising or strange either, it is really one of the defining characteristics of any form of autism -\n\nDeficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction; ranging from poorly integrated- verbal and nonverbal communication, through abnormalities in eye contact and body-language, or deficits in understanding and use of nonverbal communication, to total lack of facial expression or gestures.\nIt doesn't get any more basic than that and I can't really imagine anyone who would merit a DSM IV diagnosis of autism who didn't have problems in this area. \u00a0I think the problem here is that this criteria was poorly mapped and this one criteria alone could explain a large part of the results.\n\nI can't say how much of the result is based on this one criteria for certain because there wasn't enough data included in the study. \u00a0But I can say that it was certainly a major contributor to the end result\n\nThe other two items had a lesser impact because the repetitive and restricted domains have 4 criteria so missing two of them doesn't automatically exclude you. \u00a0But it certainly would make it much harder to qualify unless you had the remaining two criteria.\n\nWhew. \u00a0If you are still reading all the way down here then you certainly deserve a gold star.\n\nThe overall point here is that this paper doesn't really tell us anything. \u00a0It certainly doesn't tell us how many people with a current diagnosis of autism will be excluded under the proposed DSM 5 criteria nor does it tell us how the DSM 5 criteria compare to the DSM IV criteria. \u00a0And most of the result can be explained as just missing data.\n\nAll it really says to me is that the researchers had a bone to pick with the group of people who are writing the new DSM 5 autism criteria and decided to use an old data set to make a point. \u00a0I only wish they had kept their disagreement in the scientific world and not tried to take it to the court of public opinion.\n\nThe bottom line is that we are going to have to wait to see what impact the DSM 5 is going to have on people with an existing autism diagnosis.\n\n", "outgoing_links":

Little is known about human A-to-I editing, but it is thought to constitute one of many molecular mechanisms connecting environmental stimuli and behavioral outputs. Thus, comprehensive exploration of A-to-I RNA editing in human brains may shed light on gene-environment interactions underlying complex behavior in health and disease. Synaptic function is a main target of A-to-I editing, which can selectively recode key amino acids in synaptic genes, directly altering synaptic strength and duration in response to environmental signals. Here, we performed a high-resolution survey of synaptic A-to-I RNA editing in a human population, and examined how it varies in autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder in which synaptic abnormalities are a common finding. Using ultra-deep (>1000 \u00d7 ) sequencing, we quantified the levels of A-to-I editing of 10 synaptic genes in postmortem cerebella from 14 neurotypical and 11 autistic individuals. A high dynamic range of editing levels was detected across individuals and editing sites, from 99.6% to below detection limits. In most sites, the extreme ends of the population editing distributions were individuals with autism. Editing was correlated with isoform usage, clusters of correlated sites were identified, and differential editing patterns examined. Finally, a dysfunctional form of the editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA B1 was found more commonly in postmortem cerebella from individuals with autism. These results provide a population-level, high-resolution view of A-to-I RNA editing in human cerebella and suggest that A-to-I editing of synaptic genes may be informative for assessing the epigenetic risk for autism.\n\n\nReferences\n\nEran A, Li JB, Vatalaro K, McCarthy J, Rahimov F, Collins C, Markianos K, Margulies DM, Brown EN, Calvo SE, Kohane IS, Kunkel LM.

TMLHE maps to the X chromosome and encodes the first enzyme in carnitine biosynthesis, 6-N-trimethyllysine dioxygenase. Deletion of exon 2 of TMLHE causes enzyme deficiency, resulting in increased substrate concentration (6-N-trimethyllysine) and decreased product levels (3-hydroxy-6-N-trimethyllysine and ?-butyrobetaine) in plasma and urine. TMLHE deficiency is common in control males (24 in 8,787 or 1 in 366) and was not significantly increased in frequency in probands from simplex autism families (9 \u00a0in 2,904 or 1 in 323). However, it was 2.82-fold more frequent in probands from male-male multiplex autism families compared with controls (7 in 909 or 1 in 130; P = 0.023). Additionally, six of seven autistic male siblings of probands in male-male multiplex families had the deletion, suggesting that TMLHE deficiency is a risk factor for autism (metaanalysis Z-score = 2.90 and P = 0.0037), although with low penetrance (2-4%). These data suggest that dysregulation of carnitine metabolism may be important in nondysmorphic autism; that abnormalities of carnitine intake, loss, transport, or synthesis may be important in a larger fraction of nondysmorphic autism cases; and that the carnitine pathway may provide a novel target for therapy or prevention of autism.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCelestino-Soper PB, Violante S, Crawford EL, Luo R, Lionel AC, Delaby E, Cai G, Sadikovic B, Lee K, Lo C, Gao K, Person RE, Moss TJ, German JR, Huang N, Shinawi M, Treadwell-Deering D, Szatmari P, Roberts W, Fernandez B, Schroer RJ, Stevenson RE, Buxbaum JD, Betancur C, Scherer SW, Sanders SJ, Geschwind DH, Sutcliffe JS, Hurles ME, Wanders RJ, Shaw CA, Leal SM, Cook EH Jr, Goin-Kochel RP, Vaz FM, Beaudet AL.

{"date": "Sunday, September 30, 2012", "body": "\nFamilies who have children with autism and live in the state of Pennsylvania have had a pretty good deal for a while now. \u00a0That's because Pennsylvania is one of the few states that has provided free medical coverage called Medical Assistance (MA) to children with severe disabilities, such as autism, regardless of parental income. \u00a0The really nice thing about MA is that it not only covered normal medical expenses but also paid for evidence-based autism specific treatments such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and (most importantly) ABA.\n\nThe MA program isn't perfect by any means. \u00a0It involves a lot of paper work, a lot of red tape, and the only real way to navigate the system is by talking to families that have been in the system longer. \u00a0And when it comes to the autism specific therapies, another related group gets involved in managing your child's treatment down to having to approve each goal and method on your child's treatment plan. \u00a0So it isn't like MA is some sort of all you can eat buffet - each and every autism specific treatment has to be medically necessary, completely supported by the available evidence, and you have to be a strong advocate for your child's needs.\n\nThen, each and every year, you have to reapply for \u00a0the benefits and most years you have to provide a new medical evaluation proving that your child still has autism. \u00a0Even though managed care side requires periodic evaluations and treatment plans and is almost involved in the day to day treatment of your child. \u00a0So once a year you have to spend several weeks trying to get a hold of the person assigned to your case (who changes constantly and is virtually impossible to get a hold of) and making sure that they have all of the paper work they need, haven't misplaced anything, and will process it all before the date when the services will be cut. \n\nOr, in other words, the MA program is exactly like most other bureaucratic government run programs. But by and large the system generally works. \u00a0It can be a little bit of a pain to navigate, but once you learn what you need to do it works decently well. \u00a0After dotting each i and crossing each t, jumping through multiple hoops, and standing on your head while rubbing your stomach, you can access some rather decent services for your child and the only cost is your sanity.\n\nSeriously, I don't have any major complaints with the system besides the bureaucracy and I am extremely grateful that it exists. \u00a0We would not have been able to afford even a fraction of the life-changing therapy that my children have received over the years without this system. \u00a0And just to be perfectly clear here, we have good private health insurance that covers a lot of my children's medical needs and I make a decent living. \u00a0So it isn't like we simply lack the means to provide these therapies but rather that these therapies are so expensive (40k+ per year per child) that even fairly well off families have no chance. \n\nBut now, in an effort to save a couple of bucks, the State of Pennsylvania has decided to impose a copayment on certain services provided by MA to families that earn more than 200% of the federal poverty level. \u00a0This copayment will be up to 20% of the cost of the services and capped at 5% of a families gross monthly income. \u00a0Since the base price of autism specific services is so expensive, all but the wealthiest families are going to hit that 5% cap. \n\nAt first glance this copayment might seem perfectly fair. \u00a0After all, no one really has the right to expect certain services from the government and most families whose children have autism receive far more benefits from the state than they pay in taxes. \u00a0But in reality what this copayment is going to do is mean that many children with autism are going to lose services because many families are not going to be able to afford the copayments.\n\nLets consider a few examples. \n\nA single mother who has one child with autism will be hit with the copayment if she makes more than 30,260 per year. \u00a0At that level of income, she would be expected to pay about 1,500 per year in copayments or about 120 per month. \u00a0A family of five that earns more than 54,020 would be expected to pay 2,700 per year or about 225 per month. \n\nI don't think I need to explain to other autism families about the financial burden that having a child with autism can cause. \u00a0Even if basic medical costs and the core autism specific treatments are covered (as is currently the case in PA), there are still very substantial out of pocket expenses that directly relate to autism each and every month. \n\nAnd that doesn't even begin to take into account the financial opportunities that are lost to autism. \u00a0There are many families where one of the parents has to forgo working to take care of the children and there are many parents who are unable to take advantage of professional opportunities because of the limits that autism imposes.\n\nI don't want to sound like I am complaining but this is reality of having children with autism. \u00a0I wouldn't trade my children for anything (except maybe versions of them that could talk and slept at night) but providing appropriate treatments and supports is very expensive to begin with.\n\nSo when the State of Pennsylvania comes in and tells me that they want 5% of my annual gross income because that's my \"fair share\", I just have to laugh. \u00a0My family, like most other autism families that I know, is already spending more than we can afford in an effort to give our children the best possible future. \n\nNo, what this new copayment is is basically a new income tax on families that can't really afford it. \u00a0To put this new tax into perspective, the existing state income tax stands at 3.07%. \u00a0This new income tax is going to more than double the effective state income tax, raising it to 8.07%.\n\nIf this new charge was really meant to be a copayment rather than a new tax then, it should work like other copayments work. \u00a0If any other insurance company came in and charged a premium for the plan and then, when asked about copayments, said \u00a0\"it depends, \u00a0how much do you make\"\u00a0then they would likely loose most of their customers.\n\nLets not forget that the purpose of health insurance is to spread the cost around to everyone that participates in the insurance pool. \u00a0Everybody pays a premium, everybody has the same copayments, and the pooled premiums are used to pay for the health expenses. \u00a0Some people will have very few expenses and will pay in premiums than they get back in coverage and some people will have extreme expenses and will get far more back than they put in. \n\nAs a tax payer, I already pay my premiums on both the state and federal level (the MA program receives money from the federal government) in the form of income tax. \u00a0I am not against copayments as long as the amounts are reasonable and applied fairly. \u00a0But the way that this copayment is being implemented (more on that in a bit) makes it clear that it is a targeted charge on a very narrow group of people.\n\nOf course the counter argument here is that I always have a choice and don't have to pay the copayment. \u00a0I could choose to not have the services for my children, I could choose to go with less expensive services, or I could choose to go with a different type of health insurance. \n\nBut all of these options are just illusionary and there is no real choice. \n\nAs a parent, I would be\u00a0negligent\u00a0if I did not do everything in my power to provide medically necessary services for my children. \u00a0As a consumer, I have extremely little ability to change the cost of services or to pick less costly services. \u00a0When you have to spend your time fighting to get any services let alone appropriate services, you have no ability to haggle over the price. \u00a0And as for a choice of health insurance, there is no choice. \u00a0The choice is between no services or Medical Assistance.\n\nSo basically the \"choice\" comes down to not having medically appropriate services for my children or paying an extra 5% of my gross income to the state every year.\n\nThe end result here is going to be one of two things. \u00a0Either a family will be able to afford this extra tax and continue services for their children or they will be forced to cut services for their children. \u00a0My family may be able to cut enough other things that we will be able afford this new tax and continue services but I suspect that many other families won't be able to do so.\n\nI am sure that the State would disagree with me\u00a0characterizing\u00a0this copayment as a new tax. \u00a0In fact, they say that \"targeting co-payments based on ability to pay will ultimately protect the safety net and allow us to continue to effectively serve Pennsylvanians now and well into the future.\"\n\nThe problem is that the State's own numbers belie their own assertion. \n\nAccording to the numbers that they provide, providing these disability specific services costs taxpayers \"approximately $700 million a year\". \u00a0But the potential savings from this copayment are approximately $4.3 million per year or about 0.6% of the total spent. \n\nWhen you put these numbers in terms of the entire yearly MA budget, the result is even more absurd. \u00a0The MA program cost $16 billion for fiscal year 2012-13, of which roughly $8 billion was spend on people with disabilities (all disabilities, not just autism). \u00a0So terms of the amount spent on all disabled people we are talking about 0.05% of the budget. \u00a0In terms of the entire budget we are talking about 0.03%.\n\nI don't see how pushing 0.03% of the total\u00a0expenditures\u00a0back onto families will \"ultimately\" protect the system. \u00a0If the goal is to protect the system you might need to start were you actually are spending a\u00a0noticeable\u00a0amount of your budget.\n\nBut I can see how pushing that amount back onto families who are already financially struggling will result in a loss of services to disabled children.\n\nAnd then there is the matter of how this copayment was announced\u00a0(see if you can find it in there), how public comments on the copayment were basically ignored, the extremely short time period between announcing the copayments and them taking effect (about a month), and the fact that other ways that the State could better offset the costs that are already active. \u00a0For example, PA Act 62 requires certain private insurance to pay up to 36,000 per child per year for ABA services. \u00a0If that act were actually implemented and fully enforced that could save the State over $30 million a year.\n\nThere is also the little matter of\u00a0implementation. \u00a0This copayment is supposed to become active on Monday, October 1st (yes, tomorrow) \u00a0for new families and a month later on Nov 1st for existing families\u00a0but there is almost no information a family can use to figure out how much of a copayment that they will be hit with. \u00a0Under the new system, each provider will be responsible for\u00a0independently\u00a0collecting the copayment for their services and there is some magical and yet to be determined method for coordinating charges across providers to make sure that a family isn't overcharged.\n\nMy children have services spread out across three or four providers and I have absolutely no information about how they bill for services, how much of a copayment will be charged for each service, nor is there any system in place for me to question the charges. \u00a0So when (not if, when) I receive bills that total more than the 5% of our monthly income, do I pay the bills and try and get the money returned in the future or do I try to dispute the charge and constantly risk\u00a0service disruptions and\u00a0my credit rating?\n\nIn theory I could contact the state department that is responsible for the program but since they can't even get their phone system working well enough for me to be able to reach them via phone and the chance of an email or regular letter\u00a0being answered \u00a0is about a million to one,\u00a0I am not going to hold my breath. \n\nAnd even when you do get a hold them their idea of customer service is somewhat lacking. \u00a0I once had the person assigned to my children's case tell me that she gives\u00a0priority to children who have \"real problems\"\u00a0and since my children just have autism they would just have to wait for her to get around to their case.\n\nIn other words, the actual\u00a0implementation of this new copayment is likely to be a complete and utter mess and it is going to take a substantial amount to keep track of it all. \u00a0And that's just want families whose children have autism need, one more large problem to deal with.\n\n\n\n", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "Thursday, January 26, 2012", "body": "\nA new show involving a child with autism called Touch\u00a0had its premiere on FOX this week. \n\nThe premise of the show is that Jake, an 11 year old boy who \"never speaks, shows little emotion, and never allows himself to be touched by anyone\" but just happens to \"obsessed with numbers\u2014writing long strings of them in his ever-present notebooks\u2014and with discarded cell phones\", has the special ability to \"perceive the seemingly hidden patterns that connect every life on the planet\". \n\nThe child's father, Martin, who \"has tried everything to reach his son\" and is \"haunted by an inability to connect to his emotionally challenged ... son\" almost loses his son to foster care until Jake's extraordinary gift is discovered by \"a professor and an expert on children who possess special gifts when it comes to numbers\".\n\nThis discovery, of course, changes everything and Martin realizes that his son is actually talking to him through his long strings of numbers and that it is his new job to \"decipher these numbers and recognize their meaning\" which will allow him to \"help people across the world connect as their lives intersect according to the patterns Jake has foreseen\".\n\nOr at least that is what the show's website says the premise of the show is supposed to be. \n\nI did not watch the premiere nor do I have any intention of watching the show when it starts airing regularly in another month or two. \u00a0Why you ask? \u00a0Well, the reason is quite simple.\n\nEven if the show is the best written show out there and even if it gets right the details of what life is like with a non-verbal child on the spectrum, I am so very sick and tired of the autism myths that the show perpetuates.\n\nI am so very tired of constantly running into the theory that autism somehow grants a person special gifts. \u00a0In the overwhelming, vast majority of people with autism that is simply not the case. \n\nHaving autism does not give you super human abilities in math nor does it give you exceptional eye sight nor does it make you an expert musician nor does it allow you to \"perceive the seemingly hidden patterns that connect every life on the planet\". \u00a0Nor is it necessarily a good thing when a person with autism does manage to achieve a higher level of knowledge or functioning in an area because they are fixated on the subject. \n\nThere is a big difference between a person obtaining knowledge or expertise in a subject because they want to and a person obtaining the same level of knowledge because they have a compulsion to do so. \u00a0Yes, the end result might be similar, but the person who decides to pick up a subject on their own initiative also has the freedom to put it aside if they want to. \u00a0A person with autism who gains knowledge from because they perseverate on the topic will rarely have the same freedom. \n\nAnd then there is the automatic assumption that if a person with autism happens to be good at something that it must be their autism that gives them the ability to do so. \u00a0But that completely ignores the fact that autism is just one facet of a person and that there is far more to the person than their autism.\n\nI used to think that this entire idea of autism always granting special gifts was a joke and could be safely ignored. \u00a0That is until I kept running into well-meaning people who, upon learning that my children had autism, would ask me what their \"gift\" was. \u00a0I kid you not, this has happened to me more times than I can count.\n\nSo the last thing that the autism world needs is yet another show suggesting that autism brings special gifts. \u00a0Because for a lot of people, the only exposure they have had to autism is what they have seen on TV or read in the media.\n\nThere is also another less common but equally damaging myth here. \u00a0It is the idea that every non-verbal child with autism has some special way that they are trying to communicate if only their parents could figure it out. \u00a0I can tell you that, after many years of trying to trying to communicate with my own children who were at first non-verbal and are now semi-verbal, this idea is mostly garbage.\n\nThere may be a few children out there who are trying to communicate through alternative channels and just not being understood, but I highly doubt that this is any more common than special gifts are. \u00a0As a parent you certainly do learn to read a non-verbal child's subtle body language and other tells and to infer what they are thinking from those signs, but that is a long, long, long way from meaningful communication.\n\nAnd again, I wouldn't really care about this myth either except that I have run into other people - some of them in the autism community - who assume it is true. \u00a0I have had people tell me that my children must be communicating with me and I just have to try harder to understand what they are saying.\n\nBut the reality here is that it takes a great deal of time and effort to build channels of communication with children who are non-verbal. \u00a0Sometimes you get lucky and the child and reach out and start talking on their own and other times you are left with trying every possible alternative form of communication out there in an effort to build those channels. \u00a0There is no magical shortcut that, if discovered, will lead to an instant ability to communicate.\n\nMaybe I am being too harsh on the show from the little I have heard about it, maybe I'm not. \u00a0But the bottom line is that these myths about autism are as harmful as the old refrigerator mom theory of autism. \u00a0What the TV viewing world needs is a healthy dose of what life is really like for children who are cut off from the world by their autism and not yet another Rain Man.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.fox.com/touch/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/01/untouched.html", "title": "\nUntouched\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 27, 2012", "body": "\nIn light of the bit of nonsense I talked about a few days back, I thought I would point out this new study on sensory input in people with autism. \u00a0This new study demonstrates yet again that people with autism can have actual physical differences in how they respond to sensory stimuli. \n\nSo far from a \"they experience everything\" model, this paper takes us back to accepted - and somewhat proven - idea that people with autism experience sensory stimuli differently than a \"typical\" person does and these differences might account for some of the disabling symptoms of autism.\n\nThe abstract is below ( I added line breaks to make it more readable) -\n\nPerceptual and Neural Response to Affective Tactile Texture Stimulation in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders.\n\nAutism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with differences in sensory sensitivity and affective response to sensory stimuli, the neural basis of which is still largely unknown. We used psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate responses to somatosensory stimulation with three textured surfaces that spanned a range of roughness and pleasantness in a sample of adults with ASD and a control group.\u00a0\n\nWhile psychophysical ratings of roughness and pleasantness were largely similar across the two groups, the ASD group gave pleasant and unpleasant textures more extreme average ratings than did controls. In addition, their ratings for a neutral texture were more variable than controls, indicating they are less consistent in evaluating a stimulus that is affectively ambiguous.\u00a0\n\nChanges in brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in response to stimulation with these textures differed substantially between the groups, with the ASD group exhibiting diminished responses compared to the control group, particularly for pleasant and neutral textures. For the most unpleasant texture, the ASD group exhibited greater BOLD response than controls in affective somatosensory processing areas such as the posterior cingulate cortex and the insula. The amplitude of response in the insula in response to the unpleasant texture was positively correlated with social impairment as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R).\u00a0\n\nThese results suggest that people with ASD tend to show diminished response to pleasant and neutral stimuli, and exaggerated limbic responses to unpleasant stimuli, which may contribute to diminished social reward associated with touch, perpetuating social withdrawal, and aberrant social development.\n\nReference :\n\nCascio CJ, Moana-Filho EJ, Guest S, Nebel MB, Weisner J, Baranek GT, Essick GK.

{"date": "Monday, January 23, 2012", "body": "\nThe New York Times apparently thinks that life is too calm for people in the autism community. \u00a0The paper has decided to shake things up a little by publishing a story suggesting that many people who have a diagnosis of autism now will lose their diagnosis under the proposed\u00a0DSM 5 autism criteria. \u00a0The story was published on Thursday night and was quickly picked up by news outlets around the web.\n\nThe story, which is supposedly based on a \"new study\", is filled with hyperbolic statements like -\n\nProposed changes in the definition of autism would sharply reduce the skyrocketing rate at which the disorder is diagnosed and might make it harder for many people who would no longer meet the criteria to get health, educational and social services\"\u00a0\nand\n\nThe changes would narrow the diagnosis so much that it could effectively end the autism surge, said Dr. Fred R. Volkmar, director of the Child Study Center at the Yale School of Medicine and an author of the new analysis of the proposal. \u201cWe would nip it in the bud.\u201d\nBut after you get past the chicken little routine and start looking for the real data behind these provocative statements what you will find is ... nothing. \u00a0The story isn't based on a newly published study but rather is based on a presentation given at a meeting of the\u00a0Icelandic Medical Association by one Dr. Fred Volkmar just the day before the story was published. \n\nThe actual study won't be published for another month or two.\n\nTo make matters worse, the members of the public aren't the only ones that are being kept in the dark about the contents of this study. \u00a0It seems that the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the group that is responsible for the DSM 5 autism criteria, was also taken by surprise by this story. \u00a0Members of this organization read about how their new criteria are going to end the autism epidemic in the NY Times just like the rest of us, I guess it was news to them too.\n\nOne of the DSM 5 autism committee members, Dr. Catherine Lord, had this to say about the release -\n\nWe\u2019re really just hearing about this today,\u201d says Cathy Lord, the director of the new Institute for Brain Development and a member of the DSM committee working on the diagnostic changes (Volkmar at one point was a member of the committee, but resigned). \u201cIt was not sent to the committee, it was not brought up to the committee, and it\u2019s embargoed, so technically they\u2019re not even supposed to be talking about it. You\u2019re supposed to not even release the information until it comes out in the journal.\nThe APA also issued a press release\u00a0defending the new autism criteria\u00a0the same day that he story was originally published.\n\nIf I were in a cynical mood, I might have to wonder why Dr. Volkmar decided to present embargoed data to the Icelandic Medical Association and why he participated in the NY Times article. \u00a0Because it looks suspiciously like Dr. Volkmar decided to take his issues with the DSM 5 autism criteria to the court of public opinion rather than to the scientific literature were they belong.\n\nIt is one thing for non-scientific people (like me) to talk about these things on blogs and to theorize about what the new DSM 5 criteria might mean. \u00a0It is quite another when a scientific expert does the same in an apparent end run around the other members of his field.\n\nRegardless, even though the study has not been published and the real data is not available, I think enough information was published that we can get an idea of what the final study will look like. \u00a0The following is based on what I read and my own speculation about what the data is, take it for whatever it is (or isn't) worth.\n\nFrom the NY Times article, we know that the original data came from a 1993 (some sources say 1994) field trial of the DSM IV and included data on 372 children and adults who were \"among the highest functioning\". \u00a0The press release on Yale's web site tells us that these children and adults were selected because they did not have intellectual disabilities. \u00a0From other versions of the story (sorry, can't find the link), we know that the original trial had roughly 1,000 participants.\n\nBased on above, I think that the original data came from\u00a0here. \u00a0This was a field trial of the DSM IV criteria in 1994 that involved Dr. Volkmar and had 977 participants.\n\nThe breakdown of the participants from this paper is follows -\n\n\n\n\n  Disorder\n  Number\n  IQ\u00a0>\u00a070\n  Mute\n \n\n  Autistic Disorder\n  454\n  118\n  245\n \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  Other PDD\n  240\n  122\n  84\n \n\n  PDD-NOS/Atypical\n  163\n  \n  \n \n\n  Asperger\n  48\n  \n  \n \n\n  Rett\n  13\n  \n  \n \n\n  CDD\n  16\n  \n  \n \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  Related Disorders\n  83\n  130\n  93\n \n\n  Mental Retardation\n  132\n  \n  \n \n\n  Language Disorders\n  88\n  \n  \n \n\n  Childhood Schizophrenia\n  9\n  \n  \n \n\n  Other Disorders\n  54\n  \n  \n \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n  Total\n  977\n  370\n  422\n \n\n\nThe 370 number with an IQ > 70 (no ID) very closely matches the 372 cited in the NY Times but I have to wonder if this new result includes the \"Related Disorders\" group. \u00a0It doesn't seem like it would make sense to do that but without adding in that group you can't get to the 372 number. \u00a0Maybe the related disorders group was excluded and the the cutoff wasn't strictly at an IQ of 70.\n\nGoing back to the current result, the researchers applied the new DSM 5 criteria to the group of 372 and found that about 45% - roughly 167 - would no longer qualify for an autism label. \u00a0The breakdown that is given is about 25% of those with \"classic autism\" (autistic disorder), 75% of those with Asperger, and 85% of those with PDD-NOS.\n\n\nPlease remember when you consider these figures that they are based exclusively on the \"high-functioning\" group. \u00a0So before you can get excited about 85% of children and adults with PDD-NOS not qualifying for an autism label, you have to ask yourself what part of the entire PDD-NOS group are they talking about.\n\nThere are many potential problems with this result.\n\nFirst, as mentioned in the NY Times article, the study from 1994 might not have the proper data to even apply the DSM 5 criteria. \u00a0For example, the 1994 study makes no mention of any data concerning sensory issues but sensory issues are one of the criteria under the DSM 5. \u00a0Since higher functioning individuals are, in my experience at least, more likely to have sensory issues than other forms of restricted or restricted behaviors, the absence of this data could make a big difference.\n\nSecond, this data set is twenty years old and was collected at a time when autism was thought to be extremely rare. \u00a0 Since that time the rate of autism has exploded from about 5 in 10,000 to 91 per 10,000. \u00a0Clearly something about how autism is diagnosed and who gets an autism label has changed in the past 20 years and those changes - whatever they are - would definitely\u00a0have an impact on the current results.\n\nIf nothing else, if you wanted to do an analysis of what the changing criteria meant for people currently on the spectrum, it would have made more sense to look at the bulk of the people who are currently on the spectrum. \u00a0Even a back of the envelop calculation suggests that the number of children with autism who are currently eight years old (born in 2005) is far larger than the number of people with autism born during the entire decade of the 1980s (the population in the 1994 study).\n\nIf you wanted to do a real analysis of the impact of the criteria, you should look at the people who just received a DSM IV diagnosis and see what impact the DSM 5 would had. \u00a0Going back to the dark ages of autism and looking at an ancient, incomplete data set doesn't really tell you anything.\n\nBut the biggest problem with the story is what is doesn't cover. \u00a0It doesn't tell us anything at all about the \"lower functioning\" side of the spectrum. \u00a0Well, I say lower, but what I really mean is the majority of people with autism. \u00a0For all this talk about what the new DSM 5 will mean for the highest functioning, very little is being said about what the changes mean for the rest of the spectrum.\n\nConsider again the numbers in the table above from the 1994 study. \u00a0In this study, the majority - over 60% - \u00a0had an IQ that would place them in the intellectually disabled group. \u00a0Over 40% were considered to be mute, meaning that they either had extremely limited or no verbal skills. \n\nThese numbers have not changed that much over the years. \n\nThere is still a large group\u00a0of children and adults, perhaps as high a 50%,\u00a0who would test as intellectually disabled. \u00a0And there is still a significant group, again as much as 50%, that have substantial problems with function speech.\n\nThe exact source and breakdown of these numbers will have to wait for another day but lets take a highly conservative estimate and assume that 40% of all people with autism have issues with either intellectual disability or functional speech. \u00a0The actual number is likely quite a bit higher because these aren't necessarily the same groups - you can have ID and have functional speech and not having functional speech doesn't mean that you will test as having ID.\n\nNow here is the problem. \n\nThe DSM 5 has removed all of the criteria deal with lack of functional speech and other types of functional communication and replaced them with criteria that deal with social communication. \u00a0So the new criteria take \u00a0something that was a substantial problem for more than 40% of people with autism - in 1994 as well as today - and throws it out the window. \n\nAnd when it comes to the intellectually disabled group it gets even worse. \u00a0While the new criteria don't come out and say it explicitly, there is language in the criteria that seems to imply that anyone who would qualify as intellectually disabled will no longer qualify for a diagnosis of autism. \u00a0So the new criteria was the potential to exclude what was originally the majority of people with autism and is still today a substantial group.\n\nOr in short, the DSM 5 is\u00a0minimizing\u00a0what is an extremely disabling aspect of some people's autism and has the potential to kick out a large segment because the also are intellectually disabled. \u00a0Remember that 40% I mentioned a short while ago? \u00a0That is a conservative estimate of how many \"lower functioning\" people the DSM 5 has the potential to impact. \n\nNow lets put the scary 45% percent number from the NY Times in context. \u00a0That number refers to a subset of the spectrum, somewhere between 35% to 50%, depending on the exact data from the original study that was used. \u00a0So lets split the difference and say that it refers to 42% of the spectrum. \u00a0That means that the scary 45% number really would be about 20% of the entire spectrum.\n\nSo, once again, the media is dwelling on the needs of the higher functioning minority (20%) while completely ignoring what is happening with the lower functioning majority (40%). \u00a0I would say that I am surprised but I really am not. \u00a0The media is in the business of selling stories and no one really wants to hear about children on the lower functioning side of autism. \u00a0The bottom line is that both groups have serious issues and both groups deserve attention. \n\nAs for what this new result means in the end, my guess is not much. \u00a0We will have to wait and see what the actual study says instead of relying on media accounts but so far I am not impressed.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/health/research/new-autism-definition-would-exclude-many-study-suggests.html", "http://www.dsm5.org/proposedrevision/pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=94", "http://www.lis.is/lis/vidburdir/nanar/5085/laeknadagar-2012", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/20/a-new-definition-of-autism-could-exclude-many-now-diagnosed-expert-says.html", "http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2012-News-Releases/DSM-5-Proposed-Criteria-for-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Designed.aspx?FT=.pdf", "http://news.yale.edu/2012/01/20/autism-redefined-yale-researchers-study-impact-proposed-diagnostic-criteria", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8067493"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-york-times-dsm-5-autism-coverage.html", "title": "\nThe New York Times' DSM 5 Autism Coverage\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 17, 2012", "body": "\n\n\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, helping a child recover from autism can be quite the journey. \u00a0It sometimes seems that for every one step you take forward you have to first take two steps back, one to the left, one to the right, jump on one foot while spinning in a circle, and then take that the one step forward. \u00a0The whole process can be quite maddening.\n\nI think the reason the process is so frustrating is that we don't understand what autism is and what biological form it takes in the body. \u00a0We don't really know why a given therapy works when it works nor do we know why it doesn't work when it doesn't. \u00a0There all sorts of theories about why something might or might not work, but when it comes down to it, there is little, if any, hard data about any autism treatment that can be used to pick the appropriate therapies for a specific child.\n\nOr in other words, treating autism is a lot like playing pin the tail on the donkey, except you can't be sure that you are actually holding the tail and the donkey might be located on a different continent.\n\nI have been constantly reminded of this simple, yet maddening facet of autism over the past couple of weeks. \u00a0You see, twin A has been having something of a developmental spurt over the past several weeks. \u00a0She has started spontaneously doing things that neither her nor her twin have ever done before. \u00a0We have seen protodeclarative pointing, spontaneous sharing of interests, and spontaneous comments about the surroundings (i.e. a TACT). \n\nBut perhaps best of all, she spontaneously used those three little words that every parent is dying to hear from their child. \u00a0She walked up to my wife, gave her a hug, and said \"I love you\".\n\nSo while I don't want to appear unmoved or ungrateful for the progress, the question remains. \u00a0Why is twin A making this progress now when she hasn't been able to do any of these things in the past? \u00a0And why hasn't her identical twin started doing the same things yet? \n\nI think I know the answer but let's first dispense with the typical explanation. The typical rationale that is trotted out to explain spontaneous improvements like these is that they are just part of the normal maturation process. \u00a0As children with autism get older, they will eventually acquire the skills that did not develop properly when they were younger. \n\nBut, while this might happen in some children with autism and has happened with my children in some of their skill areas, it has never happened before involving their ability to use language. \u00a0Their lack of ability to use language makes up what could be considered the core of their autism and they have never made spontaneous progress in the use of language. \u00a0Ever.\n\nIt literally took them years of hard work before they could understand any spoken language. \u00a0And it took even more years of hard work before they could talk at all. \u00a0And then even more years more before they could use more than one word at a time. \u00a0Even today, they still have an extremely hard time when they try to talk and an even harder time when they try to use more than one word at once. \u00a0They have had some success with alternative communication methods but they are extremely limited even with these alternative methods.\n\nOr, to put it bluntly, the idea that the core disability of their autism suddenly and rapidly started disappearing because of some magical maturation process just doesn't hold water.\n\nSo, are you ready to hear my theory about why twin A has made this progress? \n\nThe answer is simple, we started her on a new supplement that is supposed to be an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and pro- very yellow pee. \u00a0This magical powder can also cure cancer, turn the moon into yellow cheese, and make everything you touch turn into gold. \u00a0Or maybe that last bit was supposed to be: make a lot of money for the company that sells the supplement.\n\nBut seriously, I am actually crediting twin A's recent progress to an over the counter supplement. \u00a0Now you might ask how I can do this with a straight face and without any double blind (or really any) studies to prove that my claims are true. \u00a0After all, parents are supposedly very easy to confuse and are willing to accept any possible correlation as causal simply because the two things happen at the same time.\n\nWell, I have my reasons and here they are:\n\nFirst, while we have tried many things in the past with little or no effect, we have also tried a few things that have made a large difference as well. \u00a0The most notable examples here for the twins are the GFCF diet and zinc supplements.\n\nSecond, identical twins - or at least our identical twins - tend to stay very close when it comes to abilities or lack of abilities. \u00a0They do get a little ahead of each other at times but the other one almost always starts to catch up within a month or so.\n\nIt was well over a month and twin B did not start showing any of the same progress. \u00a0That is until we started her on the same supplement. \u00a0She has not yet caught up to her sister and the distance is still growing but she has also started showing similar progress after we started the supplement.\n\nThird, for the past three years, twin A has lagged her sister during the winter months. \u00a0She has historically struggled with some sort of seasonal depression. \u00a0Now maybe our steps to mitigate the seasonal depression caused some of the progress but that is a topic for another time. \u00a0The short answer is that nothing that we did for that should cause an increase in language.\n\nFourth, in case you can't tell from other things I have written, I am something of a skeptic when it comes to the science and treatment of autism. \u00a0I don't accept anything without some sort of proof or evidence supporting it. \n\nBut, in this case, this new supplement was the only thing that has changed in the past six months and we aren't the only ones noticing the changes in twin A. \u00a0Several different therapists as well as her teachers in school have independently commented on her recent progress. \u00a0So we aren't imagining the progress.\n\nSo, after reading the above, you might be wondering if I have finally lost it and whether I am really suggesting that a simple powder that you buy over the counter can magically make minimally verbal children start talking.\n\nWell, the short answer to that question is both a no and a yes. \n\nThere is no magical powder that can teach a non-verbal child to talk. \u00a0You can't package up the knowledge of the English language into some powder and spoon it into a child.\n\nBut, and this is really the entire point of this post, recovering from autism is never going to be a single step process because recovering from autism involves more than just treating behaviors. \u00a0Recovering from autism is about mitigating behaviors but it is also about attempting to treat the underlying biological problems that lead to the behaviors. \n\nYou cannot effectively treat the behaviors of autism without also attempting to address the underlying causes. \u00a0Or maybe I should say that differently because you can\u00a0make\u00a0some progress without going after the underlying cause. \u00a0How about this: treatments for autism are going to be the most effective when you can target both the underlying cause in addition to the visible behavior.\n\nSo while I don't really believe that some new magical supplement gave twin A the ability to communicate better, I do believe that the supplement managed to partially correct one or more of her biological imbalances that are caused by or related to her autism.\n\nBeyond that, she is simply expressing abilities that she has learned over the years of therapy or maybe showing off new abilities that she has been able to learn recently because she is no longer blocked from learning them.\n\nBut whatever the source of her improvement, we will take it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//2.bp.blogspot.com/-lokyg-aeTEo/Tz7Z9mjnC4I/AAAAAAAAAWc/y45P9qoU1dk/s1600/horiz_2step.jpg"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2012/02/autism-recovery-two-step-process.html", "title": "\nAutism Recovery : A Two Step Process\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 14, 2012", "body": "\nA few years back, I talked quite a bit about how\u00a0pertussis (aka whooping cough) was becoming more common again and what the reasons for it might be. \u00a0Back then, the reason du jour in the mainstream media and certain parts of the autism world for the epidemic was that the more and more parents were refusing to give their children the pertussis vaccine which was leading to a decrease in herd immunity and allowing pertussis to make a come back. \u00a0This was the reason used in spite of the fact that there was evidence, even back then, that other factors played a larger role in the pertussis epidemic.\n\nWell, lets fast forward to today and a study1 that was just published in the New England Journal of Medicine that suggests that the main cause of the pertussis epidemic is that the vaccine induced immunity doesn't last nearly as long as was previously thought.\n\nThe old idea was that the vaccine induced immunity\u00a0gradually\u00a0faded over the years so that a person who was fully vaccinated would only need a booster shot every 8-10 years or so to maintain their immunity.\n\nThe new idea is that the vaccine induced immunity starts fading quickly after the last vaccine dose. \u00a0According to the study, the odds of contracting pertussis increased an average of 42% per year.\u00a0\u00a0So instead of needing a booster in ten years to maintain immunity, this finding suggests that the immunity is almost gone ten years out. \n\nBut that ten year figure assumes that the vaccine is at least 97% effective in the first year. \u00a0If, as other recent results have suggested2, the vaccine is much less effective than previously though, the immunity would fade even faster. \u00a0If the vaccine were 90% effective to start that would mean the protection would be cut in half in about four years and\u00a0largely gone in six years.\n\nThese numbers are just approximations and are going to vary based on a large number of factors but I think the overall point is clear - the current pertussis vaccine isn't nearly as long lasting as was previously thought. \u00a0The data from the outbreaks going on around the country also supports this idea. \u00a0I'm not going to go into details but, as an example, roughly one third of the cases in outbreak in California in 2010 were in mostly vaccinated children from 5 to 7.\n\nSo the main reason that pertussis is becoming more common isn't that parents are refusing the vaccine but rather that the vaccine doesn't work as well as it was thought to. \u00a0While this reinforces\u00a0the idea that vaccines play a critical role in protecting the population from serious illnesses it also serves as a reminder that vaccines aren't sacrosanct. \u00a0A vaccine should not be assumed to be safe and effective just because it is on the vaccine schedule.\n\nThis also serves as a reminder that we should wait for actual data and not jump to conclusions.\n\nIf you are interested in further reading on the subject there is the study abstract here and there are articles in Time, Web MD,\u00a0The Wall Street Journal, ABC News, and CBS News.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

We assessed 7 factors that may influence self-injury in a large cohort of children with ASD: (a) atypical sensory processing; (b) impaired cognitive ability; (c) abnormal functional communication; (d) abnormal social functioning;  (e) age; (f) the need for sameness; (g) rituals and compulsions. Half (52.3%, n = 126) of the children (n = 241, aged 2-19 years) demonstrated SIB. Abnormal sensory processing was the strongest single predictor of self-injury followed by  sameness, impaired cognitive ability and social functioning. Since atypical sensory processing and sameness have a greater relative impact on SIB, treatment  approaches that focus on these factors may be beneficial in reducing self-harm in children with ASD. \n\nThe list of possible factors is helpful but, like everything in autism, the devil is in the details. \u00a0It is one thing to say that \"atypical sensory processing\" is a major contributor to SIBs but it is quite another to find the specific sensory problem and to find a way to mitigate it.\n\n\n\nWe went through a rough couple of years where one of the twins would develop SIBs every fall that lasted until spring. \u00a0There are few things more disheartening that having to physically restrain your child to prevent them from hurting themselves. \u00a0\n\n\n\nFortunately, we managed to find a way to mitigate her SIBs after only three years of trying and she seems to be better able to regulate herself as she has gotten older. \u00a0But those were very long years and my heart goes out to families that have to deal with SIBs on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDuerden EG, Oatley HK, Mak-Fan KM, McGrath PA, Taylor MJ, Szatmari P, Roberts \u00a0SW.

{"date": "Friday, February 10, 2012", "body": "\nDid you know that eating only fried potatoes and rice balls can lead to dietary\u00a0deficiencies? I found that out this morning when browsing through some newly published studies and ran across this one-\n\nFried-Potato Diet Causes Vitamin A Deficiency in an Autistic Child.\n\nA 5-year-old boy with autism developed dry eye and xerophthalmia. Serum vitamin A was undetectable. Dietary history revealed a markedly altered intake consisting of only fried potatoes and rice balls for 2 years. Fried potatoes contain no vitamin A. Autism is a multifaceted developmental disorder infrequently accompanied by abnormal eating practices. To the authors' knowledge, most children with autism who develop dietary vitamin A deficiency have consumed an excess of fried potatoes. Attention to possible vitamin A deficiency is essential when fried potatoes are consumed exclusively\nHowever, as mildly amusing as the title and text of the study are, it is talking about what is a extremely serious problem for many children with autism - self-limited diets. \u00a0There are many children with autism who will self-limit what foods they will eat and will refuse to eat anything but a few very specific items.\n\nFor those of you who have not seen this first hand, let me just say that when food becomes one of the rigidities of autism you are in for a very bad time. \u00a0At best, the child will favor a few foods and simply refuse to eat anything but those favored foods. \u00a0At worst, it will not only have to be a specific food but a specific food that is prepared and presented in a specific way. \u00a0In the worst of the worst cases, if you so much as change one ingredient, one step in the preparation process, or put the dish or utensil even a millimeter out of place, then the child will have a meltdown and refuse to eat - sometimes for the rest of the day. \n\nWe have been very fortunate in that our children have never gotten this bad with their eating problems. \u00a0The youngest has no real food issues but her older sisters are limited in what they will eat.\u00a0 They will only eat certain things and will refuse to try anything new but we can (and do) push them on the food issue without triggering any undesired behaviors.\n\nBut even in the best of cases a self-limited diet causes problems. \n\nFor one thing your ability to go anywhere with the child becomes restricted. \u00a0You either spend your time carting around the food that they will eat (if you can) or you try and schedule every trip out of the house around meal times. \u00a0Going on vacations or traveling becomes even more challenging than it is with a typical child who has autism.\n\nAnother, more serious, problem is that a limited diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies.  There are a number of basic\u00a0nutrients\u00a0that come only from what you eat. \u00a0If you don't eat enough of the proper types of food then you are going to have problems. \u00a0A case in point is the child mentioned in the abstract above. \u00a0He was deficient in vitamin A because he only ate two types of food and that food did not contain vitamin A.\n\nAlthough, I have to caution against the widespread assumption that all (or even most) nutritional deficiencies in autism are due to self-limited diets. \u00a0My children have problems maintaining basic\u00a0nutritional\u00a0levels even when the foods they eat give them plenty of the nutrients or when they receive daily supplements of the\u00a0nutrient.\n\nFor example, all three girls have chronic problems with being iron\u00a0deficient even though they eat a diet that is high in iron. \u00a0The twins have problems maintaining an\u00a0appropriate\u00a0level of zinc even though they get daily zinc supplements. \n\nSo when you are looking at\u00a0nutritional\u00a0problems, you have to not only consider whether the diet is a problem but also whether there might be something else going on that needs to be addressed. \n\nThis is one area where, in my opinion, mainstream medicine falls flat on its face. \u00a0Given all of the documented\u00a0nutritional\u00a0problems and picky eating in autism,\u00a0doctors should do regular\u00a0nutritional\u00a0screening in every child with autism as a matter of course. \u00a0It doesn't matter whether there are any obvious physical signs or any specific complaints, the problems are widespread enough that some simple testing can go a long way towards stopping problems before they start.\n\nReferences\nTanoue K, Matsui K, Takamasu T.

{"date": "Thursday, October 18, 2012", "body": "\nI think I may have mentioned this once or twice in the past but, at the risk of repeating myself, let me say it again. \u00a0I am somewhat skeptical about the idea that autism is a primarily genetic disorder consisting of hundreds of extremely rare mutations. \n\nI understand the evidence that suggests that autism is \"genetic\". \u00a0I understand that twin studies suggest that something about being a twin greatly increases the risk of autism and that the risks are greater for identical than fraternal twins. \u00a0But what I don't understand is why the presumption is that genetics is the cause of the greater risk. \u00a0I don't understand why the other things that twins have in common - such as a shared prenatal and early childhood environments - are often ignored or overlooked.\n\nFor example, the existing evidence suggests that a fraternal twin has a greater risk of autism if their twin has autism than other, non-twin siblings do. \u00a0Fraternal twins are no closer genetically than other other siblings so the increased risk over non-twin siblings has to come from shared environmental factors.\n\nAnd then there is the little fact that the genetics of even identical twins isn't as straight forward as you might think. \u00a0Yes identical twins start off with identical genetic material at the moment of conception, but after that point things can get a little murky.\n\nAs I think I have mentioned in the past, my identical twin daughters who both have autism each have their own set distinct set of mutations. \u00a0Under the standard assumption that identical twins are always genetically identical that shouldn't happen. \u00a0But clearly someone forgot to tell them that they shouldn't be like that.\n\n\u00a0Just because identical twins start out with the same genetic code when they split from each other a few days after conception doesn't mean they will still be identical when they are born. \u00a0But if my little\u00a0anecdote doesn't make you say hmm, then consider the following abstract of a study that was just published -\n\nMonozygotic twins discordant for submicroscopic chromosomal anomalies in 2p25.3 region detected by array CGH.\n\nAlthough discordant phenotypes in monozygotic twins with developmental disorder are not an exception, underlying genetic discordance is rarely reported. Here, we report on the clinical and cytogenetic details of 4-year-old female monozygotic twins with discordant phenotypes. Twin 1 exhibited global developmental delay, overweight and hyperactivity. Twin 2 had an autistic spectrum disorder. Molecular karyotyping in twin 1 identified a 2p25.3 deletion, further confirmed by FISH analysis on leukocytes. Interestingly, array-CGH was normal in twin 2 but FISH analysis using the same probe as twin 1 showed mosaicism with 1/3 of cells with a 2p25.3 deletion, 1/3 of cells with a 2p25.3 duplication, and 1/3 of normal cells. Genotyping with microsatellite markers confirmed the monozygosity of the twins. We propose that the chromosome imbalance may be due to a mitotic non-allelic recombination occurring during blastomeric divisions of a normal zygote. Such event will result in three distinct cell populations, whose proportion in each embryo formed after separation from the zygote may differ, leading to discordant chromosomal anomalies between twins. We also discuss that the MYTL1L and the SNTG2 genes within the reported region could probably relate to the phenotypic discordance of the monozygotic twins.\nMakes perfect sense, right? \n\nOK, the text is a little bit dense, so lets break it down a little bit. \u00a0In this study there is a pair of four year old identical twin girls who have different but related developmental disorders -\n\nTwin 1 -\n\nhas global developmental delay (intellectual disability)\nis overweight\nis hyperactive\nhas a deletion at 2.25p3\n\nTwin 2 -\n\nhas autism\ndid not have an overall mutation at 2.25p3\nbut did show signs of mosaicism, meaning that roughly -\n\n1/3 of her cells had a 2.25p3 deletion\n1/3 of her cells had a 2.25p3 duplication\n1/3 of her cells had a normal 2.25p3 gene\n\n\nIf that last bit about one twin having a deletion at 2p25.3 while the other has a partial deletion and a partial duplication of the same gene leaves you confused, you aren't alone. \u00a0I had to read the abstract a few times and look up what some of the terms meant before it started making sense to me.\n\nI haven't read the full text of the study but there are a few things that jumped out at me.\n\nFirst, genetics - even in the case of identical twins - is not simple. \u00a0Most people hear the word \"identical\" and jump to the conclusion that identical means exactly the same. \u00a0But as this abstract and other results have shown, identical twins aren't exactly the same. \u00a0You cannot assume that because one twin has a certain genetic mutation that her twin will have the same.\n\nSecond, just because you can point to developmental differences between identical twins and can find a mutation in one twin does not mean that the mutation is automatically the cause. \u00a0There has to be a mechanism related to the mutation that could cause the differences.\n\nThird, when you find differences in the genetics of identical twins, the fact that there are differences might be more important than what the actual differences are. \u00a0Any mutation that is not shared has to happen after conception but before the fetus gets large enough that a mutation wouldn't be able to spread to the entire body. \n\nSince these mutations cannot be inherited there has to be something in the prenatal environment that causes them (and please don't say random chance). \u00a0It seems, at least to me, that any factor that is strong enough to cause\u00a0permanent\u00a0genetic change would also be able to play havoc with the\u00a0delicate developmental process of the fetus.\n\nFinally, you have to look at the overall picture of the twins to see if the mutation is important. \u00a0In the study the twins both have different yet related developmental disorders - global developmental delay and autism. \u00a0Since these conditions are so closely related and since it can be difficult to tell the difference between the two (especially in four year olds), I think the fact that both twins are both developmentally delayed is more important than the subtle differences between the two. \n\nThe bottom line here is that presumption that autism is largely genetic rests heavily on twin studies but the genetics of twins isn't as straight forward as you would think. \u00a0When you add in the facts that there isn't an \"autism gene\" or even a small set of \"autism genes\" but rather hundreds of mutations that might each account for a very small number of cases and that even identical twins don't always share these rare yet presumed causal mutations, the genetic presumption starts to look a little weak.\n\nReferences\n\nRio M, Royer G, Gobin S, de Blois M, Ozilou C, Bernheim A, Nizon M, Munnich A, Bonnefont JP, Romana S, Vekemans M, Malan CT.

{"date": "Saturday, October 20, 2012", "body": "\nA interesting paper was published a few days back on the genetics of autism that suggested that the genetic component of autism is made up of not one or two large mutations but rather many small mutations that add together to increase risk.\n\nAs the paper put it -\n\nFor simplex families, who have only a single affected individual in multiple generations, approximately 40% of liability traces to additive effects whereas this narrow-sense heritability exceeds 60% for ASD individuals from multiplex families.\nOr to put that another way, you can only blame genetic mutations for roughly half the risk of autism. \u00a0This idea isn't necessarily new but it is the first time that I have seen it presented so openly in a paper with the names of so many prominent autism researchers attached.\n\nI'm not going to dig into the methods used in the paper because, quite\u00a0frankly, I have no real understanding of the methods used to arrive at the result and so I don't have an opinion on whether the results fit the data. \u00a0If you want a good summary of the results in the paper, I suggest you read the write up over at\u00a0Questioning Answers.\n\nWhat I am going to point out is the excellent background section at the start of the paper. \u00a0The paper is open access, so I if you are interested in the genetic of autism I suggest you read at least that section. \u00a0I also wanted to point out two little bits from this section -\n\nBeliefs about the genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have changed dramatically over the past few decades. Early twin studies produced heritability estimates approaching 90% and, while no specific risk loci were known at the time, it was believed that liability was conferred by a handful of genes of large effect. Later, data on the distribution of ASD within families, together with results from linkage analyses, were interpreted to mean that liability arose from many genes. Recent work has definitively demonstrated the substantial contribution of de novo variation. Indeed multiple studies of rare single nucleotide and copy number variants (CNVs) have suggested that 15% or more of liability traces to de novo mutation, effects that are genetic but not inherited.\nand\n\n[D]espite a near-consensus that common and transmitted variation must confer liability, multiple genome-wide association studies have so far not revealed replicable common polymorphisms associated with ASD, and studies of rare structural and sequence mutations have largely failed to account for the anticipated risk associated with transmitted variation.\nI may be reading too much into these statements, but it almost seems like the paper is admitting that the assumption that autism is primarily an inherited genetic disorder is flawed. \u00a0Of course, the data in the paper tries to save the idea by suggesting that the genetic risk for autism comes from tens, hundreds, or thousands of small inherited mutations which, when acting together, give a greater risk for autism.\n\nAnd who knows, that idea may actually be true. \u00a0Maybe the genetic side of autism does in fact come from many small mutations acting together. \u00a0But here is the thing about science - it is all about the evidence. \u00a0An estimate from applying some fancy algorithm to an already over analyzed genetic data set doesn't tell us anything new.\n\nDespite a \"near-consensus\" that there have to be common genetic mutations that are passed from parent to child that increase the risk of autism, the fact is that after years upon years of looking no one has found them. \u00a0All that has been found are some relatively rare inherited conditions and a bunch of non-inherited mutations that, when taken together, make up the minority of cases of autism.\n\nIn fact, I would say that the lack of findings despite the efforts to date make a pretty convincing case that such common mutations do not exist, the evidence of twin and other studies notwithstanding. \u00a0Maybe it is time to start looking in more promising areas such as epigenetics or the biology of autism?\n\nReferences\n\nKlei L, Sanders SJ, Murtha MT, Hus V, Lowe JK, Willsey AJ, Moreno-De-Luca D, Yu TW, Fombonne E, Geschwind D, Grice DE, Ledbetter DH, Lord C, Mane SM, Lese Martin C, Martin DM, Morrow EM, Walsh CA, Melhem NM, Chaste P, Sutcliffe JS, State MW, Cook EH Jr, Roeder K, Devlin B.

{"date": "Thursday, November 15, 2012", "body": "\nAccording\u00a0to a recent study, people who have\u00a0schizophrenia, autism, and anorexia nervosa have fewer children than the general population. \u00a0This isn't a particularly happy topic or one that I enjoy dwelling on, but it is a rather important topic to think about when trying to understand whether autism is becoming more common.\n\nOne the one hand you have the idea that autism is strongly genetic and runs in families but on the other you have the\u00a0inconvenient\u00a0fact that having autism greatly reduces your chances of having children. \u00a0You would think that those ideas aren't\u00a0compatible, that the families who have a higher than normal number of members with autism would not keep going generation after generation as they would be \"strongly selected against\".\n\nOf course the issue isn't really that simple as that. \u00a0There are many other factors involved that\u00a0might be contributing to these families staying around such as extremely mild symptoms of autism,\u00a0recessive traits, the relative rarity of autism, and the like that could explain both facts. \n\nBut still, even if both ideas are true and autism is strongly genetic and \"strongly selected against\", you would, at best, expect it to stay about the same prevalence. \u00a0It would look more like\u00a0schizophrenia which is \"genetic\" (and environmental), runs in families, and is \"strongly selected against\" and still manages to stay at a relatively constant 1% of the population.\n\nYet with autism we have three ideas that really can't go together - that autism is strongly genetic, that autism makes you a lot less likely to have children, and that the number of cases of autism is growing fairly rapidly. \u00a0Although to be fair, all three of these statements are gross\u00a0oversimplifications of the complex realities of autism.\n\nJust food for thought. \u00a0The abstract of the study is below.\n\nFecundity of Patients With Schizophrenia, Autism, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, Anorexia Nervosa, or Substance Abuse vs Their Unaffected Siblings\n\nContext\u00a0\u00a0It is unknown how genetic variants conferring liability to psychiatric disorders survive in the population despite strong negative selection. However, this is key to understanding their etiology and designing studies to identify risk variants.\n\nObjectives \u00a0To examine the reproductive fitness of patients with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders vs their unaffected siblings and to evaluate the level of selection on causal genetic variants.\n\nDesign \u00a0We measured the fecundity of patients with schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, anorexia nervosa, or substance abuse and their unaffected siblings compared with the general population.\n\nSetting \u00a0Population databases in Sweden, including the Multi-Generation Register and the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register.\n\nParticipants \u00a0In total, 2.3 million individuals among the 1950 to 1970 birth cohort in Sweden.\n\nMain Outcome Measures \u00a0Fertility ratio (FR), reflecting the mean number of children compared with that of the general population, accounting for age, sex, family size, and affected status.\n\nResults \u00a0Except for women with depression, affected patients had significantly fewer children (FR range for those with psychiatric disorder, 0.23-0.93; P < 10-10). This reduction was consistently greater among men than women, suggesting that male fitness was particularly sensitive. Although sisters of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder had increased fecundity (FR range, 1.02-1.03; P < .01), this was too small on its own to counterbalance the reduced fitness of affected patients. Brothers of patients with schizophrenia and autism showed reduced fecundity (FR range, 0.94-0.97; P < .001). Siblings of patients with depression and substance abuse had significantly increased fecundity (FR range, 1.01-1.05; P < 10-10). In the case of depression, this more than compensated for the lower fecundity of affected individuals.\n\nConclusions \u00a0Our results suggest that strong selection exists against schizophrenia, autism, and anorexia nervosa and that these variants may be maintained by new mutations or an as-yet unknown mechanism. Bipolar disorder did not seem to be under strong negative selection. Vulnerability to depression, and perhaps substance abuse, may be preserved by balancing selection, suggesting the involvement of common genetic variants in ways that depend on other genes and on environment.\n\n\nReferences\nPower RA, Kyaga S, Uher R, Maccabe JH, L\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m N, Landen M, McGuffin P, Lewis CM, Lichtenstein P, Svensson AC.

It was not possible to predict confidently which of the phase 1 respondents with AQ-20 scores of >= 5 had ASD unless they had been assessed on the ADOS-4 in phase 2.Pay very close attention to that last sentence - having an AQ-20 score of greater than five could not be used to accurately predict which of the people had autism. \u00a0Yet that is exactly what the original survey did to arrive at the 1% estimate.\n\nI think it is safe to say that it is likely that the one percent estimate is wrong.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/mental-health/mental-health-surveys/autism-spectrum-disorders-in-adults-living-in-households-throughout-england--report-from-the-adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey-2007", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21536975", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21798110"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/08/revisiting-flawed-1-estimate-of-adult.html", "title": "\nRevisiting the Flawed 1% Estimate of Adult Autism in the UK\n"},

Autoimmunity to brain tissue may play a pathogenic role in autism. IL-17A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to play an important role in various autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to measure serum levels of IL-17A in relation to the degree of the severity of autism.\n\nMETHODS:\nSerum IL-17A levels were measured by ELISA in 45 children with autism and 40 healthy matched healthy controls.\n\nRESULTS:\nChildren with autism had significantly higher serum IL-17A levels than healthy controls (P <0.001), with increased serum levels of IL-17A found in 48.9% of the autism group. Patients with severe autism had significantly higher serum IL-17A levels than those with mild to moderate autism (P = 0.01), and raised serum IL-17A levels were significantly more common in children with severe autism (67.9%) than in those with mild to moderate autism (17.6%), P = 0.001.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nSerum IL-17A levels were raised in the group with autism, and the levels correlated significantly with the severity of autism. This is the first study to measure levels of IL-17A in relation to the severity of autism, to our knowledge. Further research, with a larger subject population, is warranted to determine whether the increase of serum IL-17A levels plasma has a pathogenic role in autism, and whether anti- IL-17A therapy could be useful.\n\n\nReferences\nAl-Ayadhi LY, Mostafa GA.

Recently, a novel intervention called Auditory-Motor Mapping Training (AMMT) has been developed, which aims to promote speech production directly by training the association between sounds and articulatory actions using intonation and bimanual motor activities. AMMT capitalizes on the inherent musical strengths of children with autism, and offers activities that they intrinsically enjoy. It also engages and potentially stimulates a network of brain regions that may be dysfunctional in autism. Here, we report an initial efficacy study to provide 'proof of concept' for AMMT. Six non-verbal children with autism participated. Prior to treatment, the children had no intelligible words. They each received 40 individual sessions of AMMT 5 times per week, over an 8-week period. Probe assessments were conducted periodically during baseline, therapy, and follow-up sessions. After therapy, all children showed significant improvements in their ability to articulate words and phrases, with generalization to items that were not practiced during therapy sessions. Because these children had no or minimal vocal output prior to treatment, the acquisition of speech sounds and word approximations through AMMT represents a critical step in expressive language development in children with autism.\n\n\nReferences\n\nWan CY, Bazen L, Baars R, Libenson A, Zipse L, Zuk J, Norton A, Schlaug G.

{"date": "Friday, September 16, 2011", "body": "\nThis summer and fall has been somewhat of a transition time for my family. \u00a0The twins, after a year delay, have finally left the early intervention system and are now in kindergarten.\n\nIt might be too early to call it, but it seems like the twins have made the transition from the one on one supports that they have been receiving for years to the public school system without too many problems. \u00a0They are still receiving special educations services and spend at least half of their time in a support classroom but they are also spending a great deal of time in the mainstream classroom as well.\n\nBaby C, even though she two years younger than her sisters (OK, she really isn't a baby anymore), will be following her sisters into kindergarten next year. \u00a0I expect that Baby C will be able to make the same sort of graceful transition\u00a0next year\u00a0that her sisters did, although that is certainly not a given. \u00a0She is higher functioning but has more behaviors to contend with than her sisters do. \u00a0But that is a story for another time.\n\nIt has taken the twins and us five long years of work to get to this point and, while we had once hoped that they would be \"recovered\" from their autism by now, they certainly have come a very long way. \u00a0If you compared what they looked like and how they acted back them to what they do now you might not even think they are the same children.\n\nSix years ago, the twins were normal babies. \u00a0They were developing at the typical speed and meeting all of their milestones at the appropriate time. \u00a0Or I should say that they were meeting all of the milestones at the appropriate times for twins, twins do develop differently than single babies. \u00a0We had no reason to think that anything was wrong.\n\nAbout six months after that they started to change. \u00a0Their development stalled (for a lack of a better word) and they started slowly developing the symptoms of autism. \u00a0I talked about this period in their lives a few months back, so I am not going to rehash it now.\n\nFive years ago when they received their autism diagnosis, they were very different than they were just six months earlier.\n\nThey did not look at people, they did not point, they did not understand or show emotion, nor did they respond to voices or any other sounds. \u00a0For a while there we (and several audiologists) though that they had gone deaf. \u00a0You could walk up behind them and scream at the top of your lungs and they would not show any sort of reaction whatsoever. \u00a0They certainly weren't responding to either verbal or non-verbal communication. \u00a0Nor could they talk or imitate any sort of sounds.\n\nInterestingly enough, at this point they had very few rigidities or restricted interests. \u00a0They did a little bit of stimming but that much more than a \"typical\" child does. \u00a0Their rigidities and restricted interests didn't really become noticeable until a few years later.\n\nThey also had some health problems. \u00a0They both had almost constant runny noises and were sick quite frequently. \u00a0They had almost constant eczema. \u00a0They had an extremely limited diet and, not to be gross, their stools were not what they should be. \n\nIf you look at the twins now, they do make eye contact and can read emotions from people's faces. \u00a0They still can't talk very well (one to two words at a time) but their verbal and non-verbal communication skills have developed. \u00a0On a good day they are only a year or two behind where they should be in receptive communication.\n\nThey don't have the social skills that they should but they do interact with adults and children as best as they can. \u00a0Even better, they are showing an interest in other people and sometimes are trying to be social. \u00a0Over the summer, one of the twins walked up to a peer and said \"Hi\" to them completely independently.\n\nTo those of you who don't deal with moderate to severe autism that might seem like a trivial thing, but to those of us who do, something like that makes your entire week. \u00a0Not to go off on a tangent but I think that is one of the reasons that adult self-advocates drive me to distraction. \u00a0They are out there pontification about how autism is just a neurological different and not a disability and here we are (and many families like us) \u00a0just happy that our children made an attempt to talk to another child. \u00a0It is two completely different worlds.\n\nBut enough about that, the real point here is how we got from where we were five years ago to how we got here. \n\nOver the past five years, we have gone from denial to hope for a quick cure to the understanding that helping a child deal with autism isn't a sprint to the finish line. \u00a0It is a long drawn out affair that will take dedication, years of work, and no small amount of luck. \u00a0And even after all of that, there is no guarantee that anything you do will make the slightest dent in the autism.\n\nOver the past five years we have waged a constant war against obsessions and rigidities that had appeared and threatened our girl's ability to function on their own. \u00a0After we let one or two obsessions develop to the point that they became real problems in everyday life (anyone else have a child who refused to walk in public for a year straight?) we learned that we had to act quickly when the behaviors first appeared and stop them from becoming a problem. \u00a0You can't - and shouldn't - break all of the behaviors, but you certainly have to break the ones that interfere with their ability to function.\n\nWe also spent three long winters tackling extreme mood swings and self-injurious behaviors in one of the twins until we finally understood that she had something like seasonal depression and treated it as such. \u00a0All it took (and still takes) to \"cure\" these problems is a little while sitting in front of a really bright light in the morning and a small dose of melatonin in the evening.\n\nBut probably the most important thing that we did was accept the fact that \"mainstream\" (pediatric) medicine doesn't have a lot to offer children on the spectrum. \u00a0Don't get me wrong here, I am a very firm believer in following the science and actually having something substantial and real behind what you do (as you should be able to tell from the other posts here). \n\nBut, when it comes to autism, mainstream medicine tells you exactly two things. \u00a0First, it tells you that there is no possible relation between autism and vaccines. \u00a0Second, it says that some ambiguous thing called early intervention is the key to a better future. \u00a0But it certainly doesn't define exactly what this early intervention is or what forms of early intervention will work best for your children.\n\nFive years ago, we walked out a well known children's development center with a shiny new diagnosis and a stack of papers with phone numbers. \u00a0The good people at the center were kind enough to inform us that our twins had autism and give us a stack of scripts for doing some standard tests. \u00a0They did not help us pick which specific therapies would be appropriate for our children nor did they even tell us which of the many providers on the stacks were any good. \n\nMaking these difficult choices was left completely up to us. \u00a0Even though neither my wife nor I knew the first thing about picking a style of behavioral therapy, occupational/physical therapy, or speech therapy, we were left completely on our own to find our own way.\n\nLuckily for us (and even more luckily\u00a0for the twins), we had an extensive support network that we could draw on to help us find our way through the process and select appropriate therapies for our children. \u00a0But even with that we have had some good experiences and some bad. \n\nAnd that is as far as the mainstream took us - behavioral therapy (ABA), speech, and OT. \u00a0Although the OT has been less than helpful for most of the time and the speech wasn't much better for the first three years. \n\nI have to say though that\u00a0without the ABA the twins would not be entering kindergarten the way they are now.\n\nBut if we had left it at that they twins would not be were they are today either. \u00a0We took it a step further and found people who helped us deal with the other biological issues that twins had. \u00a0We have used treatments that some would label as quackery or woo. \u00a0Some of them of worked, some of them haven't, but there was a specific reason that we tried each and every one of them.\n\nWe have used three biomedical treatments that I believe have played a large role in allowing the twins to progress as far as they have - the gluten-free, casein-free diet, zinc supplements, and melatonin. \u00a0There are a slew of other things that they have taken and still take that help to a greater or lesser degree but those are the big three. \u00a0If you take one one of those three away, the twins would probably not be where they are today.\n\nThis is one area were the \"science\" based crowd drives me nuts. \u00a0They are out there saying that there is \"no evidence\" that these things work and therefore they don't work and you shouldn't try them. \u00a0While it is true that these treatment are not supported by large scale trials and don't have proof\" that they are an effective treatment for autism, this lack of evidence does not mean that they can't or don't work. \n\nLike so many other things when it comes to autism, the answer for whether something will work for your child is it depends. \u00a0It depends on the specific symptoms of autism that your child has and whatever biological problems they have going on.\n\nIf we had listened to the \"science\" people then our children would not be were they are today. \u00a0My opinion is that if you have a solid reason for trying something (and not just because so and so suggested it), understand the possible benefits as well as the risks, and are can try it safely, then don't limit yourself to what \"mainstream\" medicine thinks is true. \u00a0And don't listen to the \"no evidence\" crowd either. \u00a0Instead, spend some time learning about the subject, talk to some people who actually understand the subject, and make and informed decision about whether it is appropriate for your child.\n\nOver the past five years we have also tried to accommodate the twin's sensory needs. \u00a0The idea that children with autism have broken sensory mechanisms is something that mainstream medicine is finally now beginning to wrap their heads around. \u00a0It will be another ten or fifteen years before there are any real options \"evidence-based\" sensory treatments. \n\nIn the meantime, parents will continue to try anything and everything to help their children regulate better. \u00a0For the twins, their big sensory need (right now) is to be immersed in water. \u00a0They love taking a bath every day and they absolutely love being able to go swimming everyday (just don't tell they we are going to have to close the pool in a few more weeks). \u00a0We only hit on this need for water last summer but the effect is rather amazing. \u00a0If you give them 30 minutes a day in water then they are more relaxed an are better able to concentrate.\n\nAlong the way to finding this need for water we tried the weighted vests, weighted blankets, lights, sounds, lack of light, lack of sound, deep pressure, etc, etc, etc. \u00a0Some of these things worked, some worked for a time, and some did absolutely nothing. \n\nAnd of course, probably the most important element in the twins growth is their willingness to work. \u00a0If they were not willing to apply themselves them no amount of therapy, biomedical treatments, or sensory help would be able to do anything.\n\nLooking back over the past five years, I think the thing that has made the most difference is the willingness to try new things and to adapt to the every changing challenges of autism. \u00a0While five years ago I might have wished for my children to be \"typical\" by now, I am very proud of all of the things they have been able to accomplish in spite of having the disability called autism. \u00a0I only hope that in another five years I can say that they are still making the same sort of progress.\n\n", "outgoing_links":

{"date": "Saturday, September 10, 2011", "body": "\nI ran across a recently published paper the other day that had a long title that didn't make much at first glance - \"Prenatal exposure to \u00df2-adrenergic receptor agonists and risk of autism spectrum disorders\". \u00a0According to the abstract1, this paper looked at exposure to \u00df2 adrenergic receptor agonists during the prenatal period and found that, in general, they did not increase the risk of having a child with autism.\n\nSo at first I though it was simply yet another paper ruling out a relationship between a type of drug and autism. \u00a0But then there was this little line that caught my attention -\n\nHowever, terbutaline exposure for > 2 days during the third trimester was associated with more than a fourfold increased risk for ASDs independent of indication although the limited sample size resulted in an imprecise and nonsignificant effect estimate (OR(adj) = 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-24.6).\nI didn't know what terbutaline was (or for that matter what a \u00df2 adrenergic receptor agonists was) but a four fold increase of autism is nothing to sneeze at. \u00a0So I exercised my google Phd and went and found out that, in general, \u00df2 adrenergic receptor agonists are a class of drugs that are used to treat asthma and other lung problems and that terbutaline is just the name of a specific drug of this type.\n\nBut it turns out that terbutaline is/was also used, off-label, to delay preterm labor. \u00a0So here you have a drug that has been used to delay preterm labor that might greatly increase the risk of autism. \u00a0That definitely isn't good.\n\nOn the flip side, this result is based on a small number of cases so can't just assume that the relationship is going to be the same in the general population. \u00a0But then again, this isn't the first study to suggest that neonatal exposure to terbutaline might increase the risk of autism. \n\nOther studies have found that fraternal twins who were exposed to terbutaline for longer than two weeks had an increased chance of both having autism2, that rats who were exposed to a large dose of terbutaline showed signs of neuroinflammation3, and that certain forms of genes related to the beta2-adrenergic receptor might be more common in people with autism4.\n\nSo while there is some room for doubt, I think it is safe to say that the risk is real. \u00a0Prolonged prenatal exposure to terbutaline probably does increase the risk of autism. \u00a0The good news is (if any of this can be good) that the FDA issued a warning earlier this year about prolonged use of terbutaline for treating preterm labor -\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning that terbutaline administered by injection or through an infusion pump should not be used in pregnant women for prevention or prolonged (beyond 48-72 hours) treatment of preterm labor due to the potential for serious maternal heart problems and death. In addition, oral terbutaline tablets should not be used for prevention or treatment of preterm labor. The FDA is requiring the addition of a Boxed Warning and Contraindication to the drug prescribing information (labeling) to warn against these uses.\nHopefully the medical community will get the message.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

{"date": "Thursday, August 4, 2011", "body": "\nIt is always a good day when the neurodiversity movement loses a follower -\nBy choosing to have the neurodiversity symposium encompass and showcase facilitated communication, the key promoters of the construct are signalling their support for a debunked communication form and actively supporting its continued use. And they are obviously, openly anti-cure. Based on the language here, one could argue that if an autistic individual happens to communicate by smearing feces, that this should be celebrated. I hope that's not what they mean.Perhaps there's a failure to think through here on their part, but regardless, it seems to be an extreme position that I can not, after having worked \u00a0for two decades with my son to help him overcome obstacles, to learn to communicate, to function in the wider world, support. I have not sought to make him neurotypical, but I have worked to help him function better, to master new skills, to become more autonomous (the same as I've done for my daughters). Imagine if I'd chosen to celebrate his (and their) autistic forms of communication and self-expression involving feces instead.\u00a0Since I have been somewhat critical of Kim Wombles in the past, I though I should take this opportunity to point out when she gets something right. \u00a0As I have been saying for years now, the neurodiversity movement is not a good thing for the majority of people with autism because it ignores the needs of those who are disabled by their autism and creates unrealistic ideas of what it means to have autism.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the basic idea of neurodiversity isn't a bad one. \u00a0Every person - disabled or otherwise - is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity, and you should respect a person's right to be different. \u00a0But like other grand philosophical systems (i.e. socialism), there is a disconnect between the lofty ideal and what it looks like in practice.\n\nIn practice, neurodiversity starts out with a respect for the individual and acceptance of their differences, but quickly degrades into an anti-cure, anti-treatment movement that attacks people who are trying to help their loved ones. \n\nAcceptance is a wonderful thing, but no amount of acceptance is going to give my children the ability to function on their own. \u00a0Acceptance can't teach them how to talk or socialize. \u00a0Nor will any amount of acceptance give them the ability to take care of themselves or live independently when they are older.\n\nIn practice, neurodiversity is a movement that ignores the fact that most people with autism are actually disabled by their autism. \u00a0It is a movement that ignores the\u00a0major challenges that autism creates and instead focuses almost exclusively on the \"autistic quirks\" of extremely high functioning.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between the \"quirks\" of someone who doesn't like velvet but can function well enough to serve on the IACC and a child that can't talk, can't socialize, and is almost incapacitated by their rigidities. \u00a0The neurodiversity made up of the former but pretends to speak for the needs of the latter while at the same time ignoring their very real needs.\n\nSo, I am happy to see that the neurodiversity movement has lost a follower. \u00a0Good job Kim.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2011/07/respect-people-with-disabilities-fc.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/08/neurodiversity-loses-follower.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity Loses a Follower\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 10, 2011", "body": "\n\nA study was published a few weeks ago that took a look at whether having a family history of pink disease (Infantile Acrondynia) leads to an increased risk of autism. \u00a0Pink disease is, as most of you probably know, a form of mercury poising linked to use of teething powders that used to be commonly seen in infants and toddlers. \u00a0And so, as would be expected when someone mentions the words \"autism\" and \"mercury\" together in the same sentence, this study has produced some rather strong opinions from all corners of the autism world.\n\nI didn't want to write anything about this one until I had the chance to read what the study did and did not say (unlike some other people). \u00a0But after reading it, I don't really understand what the big deal is. \u00a0The data contained in the paper is interesting, if very limited, but outside of the typical theories that fill the introduction and conclusion sections of almost every paper, there is no direct link made between mercury and autism. \n\nOr to put it another way, even if every bit of actual data in the study is 100% true and having a parent or grandparent who survived pink disease does increase the risk of having autism, it does not speak to why the relationship is there. \u00a0So this is just a simple association study saying that A might be associated with B, and a very\u00a0tenuous one at that.\n\nThe core of the data is quite simple. \u00a0The researchers sent out surveys via mail and e-mail to approximately 2,300 survivors of pink disease. \u00a0The surveys indicated that they were collecting data on the general health outcomes in the descendants of\u00a0survivors of\u00a0pink disease instead of identifying the interest in autism specifically. \n\nThe surveys asked questions about the number of biological children and grandchildren that each survivor had that lived until at least their fifth birthday. \u00a0It asked how many of the children and grandchildren had one or more of the following conditions : autism, Asperger's, ADHD, epilepsy, fragile X, intellectual disability, or Down syndrome.\n\nOut of all of the surveys sent out, only 522 completed, non-duplicate surveys were received back. \u00a0If you are looking for problems with the study, this is one of the first ones. \u00a0Only a small fraction of the surveys were returned leading to the very real possibility that people who chose to respond were biased in some way.\n\nThe breakdown of the responses is as follows. \u00a0I am only going to report the autism and ADHD numbers as those are the interesting ones.\n\nThere were a total of 1,103 children who had a mean age of 37.1 years old. \u00a0In this group, there were 11 children with any form of autism (3 autism, 8 Asperger) and 38 children with ADHD. \n\nThere were a total of 1,366 grandchildren who had a mean age of 11.3 years old. \u00a0In this group, there were 34 grandchildren with autism (12 autism, 22 Asperger) and 29 grandchildren with ADHD.\n\nThe researchers then compared the rates of autism in the grandchildren against other published estimates of autism prevalence from Australia. \u00a0There are some other sites out there (some of which didn't read the paper) that are claiming that this is one of the problems with this paper. \u00a0The claim is that there is no accepted autism prevalence number so there is nothing to compare against. \n\nThese claims are largely baseless as the prevalence estimates used in the paper are from other published research that specifically looked at autism prevalence in Australia in and around the age of the grandchildren. \u00a0Furthermore, the estimates used are in line with other published estimates in other countries during the same time period.\n\nPersonally,\u00a0I don't find these comparisons to other prevalence estimates all that useful or meaningful. \u00a0I think the raw numbers speaks for themselves even in terms of the most recent autism prevalence estimates.\n\nThe bottom line is that there were far more cases of autism in grandchildren than would be expected in a group of this size. \u00a0The total rate in this population would be almost 2.5%, or more than double what would be expected even in the youngest children today. \u00a0When the grandchildren are grouped according to age, the autism prevalence are -\n\n1 in 25 for 6-12 year olds (398 kids)\n1 in 35 for 13-16 year olds (141 kids)\n1 in 60 for 16+ year olds (827 kids)\n\nThat last point is my own extrapolation from the data included in the study. \u00a0As a point of comparison, the accepted expected rate of autism today is about 1 in 110, or at least it is in the US.\n\nThe study doesn't go into details about the children, but simple math would show you that about 1 in 100 of the direct children had a form of autism. \u00a0That number is far larger than would be expected considering that the majority of these people were born before 1980.\u00a0 Back then the expected rate would have been something like 4 in 10,000 - not 100 in 10,000.\n\nBut as shocking as these numbers are, you can't read too much into them because they are based on a survey. \u00a0No one went out and actually verified that the people had the condition that they said they did. \u00a0No one checked for any sort of response bias in the data. \u00a0No one even checked that the people who responded did actually survive pink disease.\n\nSo the results are interesting but hardly earth-shattering. \n\nThere are also two interesting artifacts in the data that give me pause. \n\nFirst, the proportion of people with autism compared to Asperger's is out of balance. \u00a0Normally you find one person with Asperger's for each 9 with classic autism or pdd-nos. \u00a0Yet in both the children and grandchildren Asperger's made up almost two thirds of the autism group. \n\nPerhaps the survivors whose children had autism were less likely to have grandchildren or were less likely to be included in the sample. \u00a0This could especially be true since the response to autism back them was to stick people in an institution for the rest of their lives.\n\nSecond, there is something interesting going on with the total number of autism and ADHD cases. \u00a0In the children, the percent with either form of autism or ADHD was about 4.5%. \u00a0In the grandchildren, this percent was about almost identical at 4.6%. \u00a0The two populations aren't the same size but it looks like about half of the increase in the autism group could have come from the decrease in the ADHD group. \n\nBut again, this is just survey data, so we can't read too much into these quirks just like we can't read too much into the autism rates.\n\nI am not going to go into the mercury/autism theories as there isn't too much point. \n\nAny possible relationship between pink disease and autism is purely hypothetical at this point. \u00a0If you wanted to prove some sort of relationship you would have to do a much better job with data collection and analysis. \n\nAnd on the flip side, we know almost nothing about the relationship between the type of mercury associated with pink disease and autism. \u00a0It is a different type of mercury delivered in different doses in a different way. \u00a0You can't look at the existing data on \u00a0intramuscular ethyl mercury exposure and draw conclusions about ingested mercury chloride. \n\nReferences\n\nShandley, Kerrie, and David W Austin. 2011. \u201cAncestry of pink disease (infantile acrodynia) identified as

Deer had written a number of critical articles about parents\u2019 claims of vaccine injury, and if he gave his real name, he doubtless feared, Child 2\u2019s mother would not agree to talk to him. Once she checked his blog, she would be more likely to kick him out of the family home than sit still for what turned into a six-hour inquisition.He even created a fake e-mail address for his fake identity, and he used it to communicate with her: lawrence_b_st@yahoo.com.Now, I am sure that your first reaction is a yes but. \n\nYes, but this is Age of Autism and everyone knows that are biased.\nYes, but this is Wakefied we are talking about and he is\u00a0evil incarnate.\nYes, but whatever other reason you come up with that this either A. never happened or B. is excusable.\n\nRemember, this isn't about Wakefield and two wrongs don't make a right. \n\nA journalist can play fast and loose with the truth and still be considered good enough to be published in the newspaper. \u00a0However, the standard for peer-reviewed research is much, much higher. \u00a0The standard for research is informed consent - a person has to be given enough information to fully understand exactly is happening and what their options are.\n\nSo the question here is one of fact. \u00a0Deer was either completely upfront about who he was and why he was doing the interview or he wasn't. \n\nConsider what Deer said about this interview in the article in the BMJ -\nI travelled to the family home, 80 miles northeast of London, to hear about child 2 from his mother. That was in September 2003, when the lawsuit fell apart after counsel representing 1500 families said that, on the evidence, Barr\u2019s autism claims would fail.23 By that time, Mrs 2 had seen her son\u2019s medical records and expert reports written for her case at trial.Her concerns about MMR had been noted by her general practitioner when her son was 6 years old.24 But she told me the boy\u2019s troubles began after his vaccination, which he received at 15 months.25 \u201cHe\u2019d scream all night, and he started head banging, which he\u2019d never done before,\u201d she explained.\u201cWhen did that begin, do you think?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThat began after a couple of months, a few months afterward, but it was still, it was concerning me enough, I remember going back . . .\u201d\n\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t want to be, like, massively pernickety, but was it a few months, or a couple of months?\u201d\n\u201cIt was more like a few months because he\u2019d had this, kind of, you know, slide down. He wasn\u2019t right. He wasn\u2019t right. Before he started.\u201d\n\u201cNot quicker than two months, but not longer than how many months? What are we talking about here?\u201d\n\u201cFrom memory, about six months, I think.\u201d\u00a0The next day, she complained to my editors. She said my methods \u201cseemed more akin to the gutter press.\u201d But I was perplexed by her story, since there was no case in the Lancet that matched her careful account.From the little bit of information included, it is almost impossible to know what the truth of the matter is. \u00a0Deer's admission that the mother did call and complain to Deer's editors about his methods does lend credence to the idea that something he did wasn't exactly on the up and up.\n\nIf AoA is correct and Brian Deer did lie about his identity to obtain an\u00a0interview then, by definition, he used fraud to obtain his \"data\". \u00a0If those \"data\" were later included in his \"peer-reviewed\" article, then his article was based, at least in part, on fraud.\n\nIt may be impossible to know what exactly happened here, but I can say one thing with absolute certainty - outright fraud has no place in science. \u00a0If statements included in the BMJ article were obtained fraudulently then the only ethical choice for the BMJ would be to retract the article.\n\nThink of it this way, if any other peer reviewed article in the BMJ stated that one the subjects in the study had to call and complain about a researcher's conduct, what exactly would you think of the article? \u00a0What would you think of the journal that published it?\n\nI know there are a lot of ifs here, but between Deer's statements about the interview, the articles being commissioned by the journal, Deer's inherit bias against Wakefield, the BMJ's admitted failure to disclose a relevant financial conflict of interest, and now the\u00a0accusation of fraud, this entire affair is starting to stink.\n\nI guess this is what happens when prestigious medical journals consort with tabloid\u00a0journalists.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/3226011817_bde407a762_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/28113115@N00/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/07/an-elaborate-fraud-part-1-in-which-a-murdoch-reporter-deceives-the-mother-of-a-severely-autistic-chi.html", "http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/07/did-brian-deer-use-deception-to-collect.html", "title": "\nDid Brian Deer Use Deception to Collect Data Included in the BMJ Article?\n"},

We conducted two studies examining the characteristics and/or quality of autism websites in 2009 and 2010.

However, despite many attempts, the search for common disease-predisposing variants in childhood developmental disorders has largely failed. Recently, a role for rare causal variants and de novo mutations is emerging in the genetic architecture of some of these disorders, particularly those which incur a large degree of selection against the phenotype. Here we examine these data as well as use classic genetic epidemiological approaches to gain insights into the genetic architecture of ASD. Future studies using next generation sequencing should elucidate the precise role de novo mutations play in disorders traditionally thought to have resulted from polygenic or common disease, common variants inheritance.\n\nGillis, Rob F, and Guy a Rouleau. 2011. \u201cThe ongoing dissection of the genetic architecture of Autistic Spectrum Disorder.\u201d Molecular autism 2:12.\nLink\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.molecularautism.com/content/pdf/2040-2392-2-12.pdf", "http://www.molecularautism.com/content/pdf/2040-2392-2-12.pdf"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/07/study-ongoing-dissection-of-genetic.html", "title": "\nStudy : The ongoing dissection of the genetic architecture of Autistic Spectrum Disorder\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 13, 2011", "body": "\nAs a parent of three children who suffer from autism, I can fully understand the difficulties and challenges that autism can bring to your life.  I can understand that some days it seems like nothing you can do can alter the course of autism or make a dent in the problems that is causes.  And I certainly understand that having to deal with autism can monumentally suck for both you and the child who, lets face it, gets the worst of it.\n\nI get all that because autism has been a part of my family's life for many years now.  And after all of these years, I think I can say that I truly understand the frustration and occasional hopelessness that that goes with it.  I don't think that you can really understand what autism can be like unless you live it day after day.\n\nI get that and so I normally don't comment on what other parents say about their experiences.  I understand that these parents are under tremendous stress and are simply trying the best they can\u00a0to deal\u00a0with an unfortunate situation.\n\nBut (you knew that was coming, right?), there are times when someone takes it too far.  In my opinion, Kent Heckenlively did just that in a post over at Age of Autism entitled \"When I Can Do Nothing\". \u00a0In this post, Mr Heckenlively talks about his feelings of helplessness when it comes to the getting the world to accept his view of autism.  He talks about how he has turned to religion to help him deal with his inability to make a difference.  He says, in part -\nI've been very busy lately.Unfortunately, I can't talk much about it.  What I can say is that on some level, my prayers to God for an understanding of the autism epidemic have been answered.  I now know why they fear us so much.  I can't prove it, and as a lawyer I understand that's the real show.  But I know.And yet, as thankful as I am for an understanding of what has happened to my child and so many others, my heart is heavy.  The Dark Forces which in the past have destroyed the careers of those who have found clues to the afflictions of our children and other disease communities are once again on the move.  You may very well read about their actions this week.  And I can't do anything to stop them.He goes on to talk about Stephen King's book The Stand and talks about how the forces of good in that book fought against the forces of evil.  And from there he goes on to quote Psalm 94 from the Bible, a passage entitled \"A Prayer for Vengeance\".\n\nI think the message he is trying to get across is pretty clear. \n\nNow, I have absolutely no problem with religion or someone turning to religion to help them through a difficult time.  It isn't my cup of tea, but I can understand why some people are religious and take comfort from their beliefs.  But here is the problem.\n\nThere is no enemy here to smite.  \nThere are no \"Dark Forces\".\nThere is no vast conspiracy to cause autism or to cover-up the cause of autism.\n\nWhat there is is a large number of people who are doing what they think is the right thing.  You might not agree with what they are doing and you might think that be acting out of their own self-interests.  And who knows, you could be right.\n\nBut there is no demonic Randall Flagg who is in need of smiting. \u00a0There are just mostly good people doing what they feel is the right thing to do. \u00a0Which is exactly the same as what most parents do.\n\nI can understand that scientific progress towards understanding exactly what autism is can be painfully slow.  I can understand that, after over thirty years worth of research, science is not much closer to understanding what autism is let alone understanding how to fix it.\n\nBut the answer is to work together to try and advance our understanding and to help those that we can deal with the problems that autism causes.  The answer is not to retreat into religion platitudes and to encourage your readers to engage in some holy war.\n\nDoing that makes you look like you are nothing more than a cult.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/-4XfLLGA3qY4/Th0UStFz53I/AAAAAAAAAV0/Ya9BjSuPSjk/s1600/smite.png", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/07/when-i-can-do-nothing.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/07/jabberwocky-of-day-age-of-autism-on.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Age of Autism on Smiting\n"},

Forty studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. For each exposure, a summary effect estimate was calculated using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity in effect estimates across studies was examined, and, if found, a meta-regression was conducted to identify measured methodological factors that could explain between-study variability.\n\nResults: Over 60 perinatal and neonatal factors were examined. Factors associated with autism risk in the meta-analysis were abnormal presentation, umbilical-cord complications, fetal distress, birth injury or trauma, multiple birth, maternal hemorrhage, summer birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age, congenital malformation, low 5-minute Apgar score, feeding difficulties, meconium aspiration, neonatal anemia, ABO or Rh incompatibility, and hyperbilirubinemia. Factors not associated with autism risk included anesthesia, assisted vaginal delivery, postterm birth, high birth weight, and head circumference.\n\nLink\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2011/07/06/peds.2010-1036"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/07/study-perinatal-and-neonatal-risk.html", "title": "\nStudy : Perinatal and Neonatal Risk Factors for Autism\n"},

Although individuals with autism have trouble with social cognition, their other cognitive abilities are sometimes largely intact.The paper looks at how autism's strengths may have played a role in evolution. Individuals on the autism spectrum would have had the mental tools to be self-sufficient foragers in environments marked by diminished social contact, Reser said.The penchant for obsessive, repetitive activities would have been focused by hunger and thirst towards the learning and refinement of hunting and gathering skills.Today autistic children are fed by their parents so hunger does not guide their interests and activities. Because they can obtain food free of effort, their interests are redirected toward nonsocial activities, such as stacking blocks, flipping light switches or collecting bottle tops, Reser said.The paper is available for free online if anyone cares to read it. \u00a0I made it through the first two pages but I couldn't make it through any more than that. \u00a0Who knows, maybe this guy has the right idea but I tend to doubt it. \u00a0It sounds more like he has never met a person with even moderate autism let alone any children with \u00a0autism.\n\nThere are so many wrong ideas in even the first two pages that it is hard to know where to start talking about it. \u00a0For example, the paper suggest that people with autism are \"ecologically competent individuals that could have been adept at learning and implementing hunting and gathering skills\". \n\nAs anyone who has struggled to teach their child to teach their child even basic skills can tell you, teaching children with autism is rarely easy. \u00a0There is a very good reason why behavioral therapies such as ABA are popular for teaching children with autism and that is because they don't normally learn naturally or from their environment. \u00a0To call most children with autism \"adept\" at learning about the environment is like saying that a rock is \"adept\" at swimming.\n\nAnd the idea children with autism are aware of their environment? \u00a0Many parents struggle with day to day basic safety concerns because their children have no awareness of their environments. \u00a0My children would walk out directly in front of a speeding car without blinking an eye. \u00a0They would walk up to a polar bear and poke it in the stomach, which would\u00a0definitely\u00a0not be \"ecologically competent\".\n\nMaybe this is all supposed to change when children achieve \"independence from their mothers\"... \u00a0Wait, how many children who have autism actually grow up to be able to live independently? \u00a0I know there are some but I don't think that it is the majority.\n\nTalk about one of the greatest fears that parents have for their children. \u00a0I am worried - like many other parents - whether my children will ever be able to learn enough skills to be able to function on their own. \u00a0Yet this paper assumes that young adults will automatically be able to achieve independence. \u00a0The hunter-gatherers must have had some kick-ass services available to be able to make that leap of faith.\n\nBut I think the most absurd idea here is that some trivial external factor such as hunger could refocus the repetitive and restricted interests of autism. \u00a0After having dealt with the repetitive and restricted in three children for over five years, I can confidently say that I don't think that it is really possible for any external factor to force these obsessions into a desired form. \u00a0You can extinct, redirect, distract, plead, beg, or threaten until you are blue in the face and still not make a dent in the behaviors - let alone changing them to focus on something specific.\n\nI wish that someone had told me that all I had to do to refocus the behaviors was to withhold food. \u00a0Because\u00a0\u00a0I spend at least an hour a day trying to get my kids to eat more. \u00a0Left to their own devices, I swear that they might forget to eat or only eat pretzels. \u00a0But according to this paper, letting the kids go hungry might help them able to be better survive on their own and learn that poking the polar bear would be a really bad idea.\n\nYeah, uhm, I am going to go out on a limb and say that I don't really think that it would work like that.\n\nBut seriously, I think the gentleman who wrote this, err, paper needs to get out in the real world and work with some real kids on the spectrum before coming up with any more theories.\n\nP.S.\u00a0The bit about starving children and withholding food is obviously a joke.\n\nP.P.S That is unless it actually works in which case there are going to be a lot of hungry children with autism shortly.\n\nP.P.P.S.\u00a0 Just in case, maybe someone should bring Dr. Lovaas back from the dead to tell him that he had the right idea but was using the wrong reinforcer.\n\nReferences (and I use that term loosely)\n\nJared Edward Reser.

Though unproven, genetic susceptibility to high mercury (Hg) body burden has been suggested as an autism risk factor in a subset of children. We hypothesized that exposure to \"safe\" Hg levels could be implicated in the etiology of autism if genetic susceptibility altered Hg's metabolism or intracellular compartmentalization. Genetic sequences of four genes implicated in the transport and response to Hg were screened for variation and association with autism. LAT1 and DMT1 function in Hg transport, and Hg exposure induces MTF1 and MT1a. We identified and characterized 74 variants in MT1a, DMT1, LAT1 and MTF1. Polymorphisms identified through screening 48 unrelated individuals from the general and autistic populations were evaluated for differences in allele frequencies using Fisher's exact test. Three variants with suggestive p-values <0.1 and four variants with significant p-values <0.05 were followed-up with TaqMan genotyping in a larger cohort of 204 patients and 323 control samples. The pedigree disequilibrium test was used to examine linkage and association.

{"date": "Sunday, June 19, 2011", "body": "\n\n\nPicture from Wikimedia Commons\nAutism is typically thought of as a neurodevelopmental disorder. \u00a0It is assumed that something goes wrong early in a child's development and that the brain doesn't develop properly and that the result is permanent.\n\nBut what if that wasn't the case?\n\nAccording to some recent research, the symptoms of Rett Syndrome (a form of autism) might caused by the continuing lack of the protein MeCP2 rather than problems with growth and development of the brain caused by the lack of MeCP2. \u00a0If that seems like splitting hairs, it really isn't. \u00a0That simple distinction means that Rett's might not be a neurodevelopmental disorder after all.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Rett Syndrome is (currently) one of the five conditions that together make up what is known as the autism spectrum. \u00a0However, Rett's is somewhat different from other forms of autism. \u00a0It is rather rare (1 in 10,000) and effects girls almost exclusively. \u00a0It also tends to involve physical issues such as loss of motor control, severe digestive problems, and heart problems. \u00a0However, unlike other types of autism, a probable mechanism for the problems of Rett Syndrome has been identified - mutations in the methl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene.\n\nBecause there is a known genetic mutation as well a known biological pathway that is disrupted, researchers have been able to create a number of different model of what Rett's looks like in mice. \u00a0Using these mice, researchers have been able to test a number of different theories about Rett's and this work has lead to a better understanding of the condition.\n\nEarly last year, researchers demonstrated, using mice that were deficient in MeCP2, that if you could restore the levels of MeCP2 in the brain that the mice's Rett-like symptoms would be reversed. \u00a0That part isn't too surprising but it does show that Rett's is an ongoing process.\n\nWhat is more surprising is work done just this year. \u00a0This time researchers took mice that developed normally with the proper level of MeCP2 and removed their ability to produce this protein as an adult. \u00a0Once the protein was removed, these mice developed the same Rett-like symptoms as mice that were MeCP2 deficient their entire lives.\n\nAs a result, researchers are now shifting from thinking about Rett's as a condition that is caused by the lack of this protein during critical developmental periods (i.e. neurodevelopmental) and instead thinking about it as a life-long condition that is caused by the lack of this protein. \n\nOr in other words, even though Rett's is \"genetic\", it is caused by an ongoing biological process and it should be possible to \"cure\" the condition by correcting this process. \u00a0So while there is not yet any cure for Rett's, the possibility of a cure for everyone with Rett's just got a little closer to reality.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that Rett's isn't the only known \"genetic\" cause of autism that works like this. \u00a0In recent years Fragile-X, the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability and autism, has been shown to be reversible in adults and there are actually drugs in the works that might be able to do just that.\n\nSo what if other forms of autism aren't neurodevelopmental disorders either? \u00a0What if, like Rett's and Fragile X, other forms of autism are caused by an ongoing biological process rather than caused by something that went wrong during early development? \u00a0I think there is certainly enough evidence of ongoing biological disruptions in people with autism to make this a possibility.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TN33lGsIvWI/AAAAAAAAAUM/PgLR57yAEQg/s1600/256px-Hersenen.png", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hersenen.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodevelopmental_disorder", "http://rettsyndrome.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/neurodevelopmental-no-longer/", "http://www.rsrt.org/about-Rett/", "http://www.rsrt.org/about-Rett/what-causes-Rett-Syndrome.html", "http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/06/01/science.1206593.abstract", "http://www.seasidetherapeutics.com/sites/default/files/Seaside_ACS_release_5_18_2011.pdf"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/06/what-if-autism-isnt-neurodevelopmental.html", "title": "\nWhat if Autism Isn't a Neurodevelopmental Disorder?\n"},

Recent evidence shows that IL-6 has a crucial role in the development and plasticity of CNS.\n\nMethods: Immunohistochemistry studies were employed to detect the IL-6 expression in the cerebellum of study subjects. In vitro adenoviral gene delivery approach was used to over-express IL-6 in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Cell adhesion and migration assays, DiI labeling, TO-PRO-3 staining and Immunofluorescence were used to examine cell adhesion and migration, dendritic spine morphology, cell apoptosis and synaptic protein expression respectively.\n\nResults: In this study, we found that IL-6 was significantly increased in the cerebellum of autistic subjects. We investigated how IL-6 affects neural cell development and function by transfecting cultured mouse cerebellar granule cells with an IL-6 viral expression vector. We demonstrated that IL-6 over-expression in granule cells caused impairments in granule cell adhesion and migration but had little effect on the formation of dendritic spines or granule cell apoptosis. However, IL-6 over-expression stimulated the formation of granule cell excitatory synapses, without affecting inhibitory synapses.\n\nConclusions:\u00a0Our results provide further evidence that aberrant IL-6 may be associated with autism. In addition, our results suggest that the elevated IL-6 in the autistic brain could alter neural cell adhesion, migration and also cause an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory circuits. Thus, increased IL-6 expression may be partially responsible for the pathogenesis of autism.\n\nPMID: 21595886\nDOI: 10.1186/1742-2094-8-52\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_6", "http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/pdf/1742-2094-8-52.pdf", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21595886", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-8-52"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/05/study-watch-il-6-is-increased-in.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : IL-6 is increased in the cerebellum of the autistic brain and alters neural cell adhesion, migration and synapse formation\n"},

I wondered if it mattered to anyone that a recent paper co-authored by Wakefield found no benefit from HBO for the symptoms of autism. So little of what I had seen and heard made sense.\u00a0Then Jamie took her 35mm SLR digital camera out of her handbag and snapped a picture of an HBO poster.Seconds later the conference organizer, Teri Arranga, walked up to us. She was all business. \u201cThere is no photography allowed here,\u201d she said. To prove her point, Teri sent a volunteer to bring back one of the many signs posted throughout the area that said \u201cNo video or audio recording allowed.\u201dJamie pointed out, politely and correctly, that a 35mm camera which only takes still pictures is not a video or audio recorder. ...Yet if you look at the conference policies that are linked to from conference registration page, you would see this very clear section -\nNo recording of any type is allowed without prior written permission. \u00a0Any individual using audio, video, or other recording or photographic devices without current written authorization from the conference organizers may be required to leave the conference.It is obvious that taking a picture clearly falls under this policy. \u00a0It doesn't matter if their were signs posted at the event that specifically listed \"photography\" as a separate activity from video recording. Mr. Reibel and his accomplice had to agree to these terms to register, so yes, by definition, they did do something \"wrong\". \n\nYou would think that since Mr. Reibel has a history for getting into trouble at this conference that he would have been extra careful to know and abide by all of the rules. \u00a0Especially if his intention was to be a \"peaceful, non-disruptive\" person. \u00a0Just between you and me, I don't think that was his intention.\n\nBut even without this rule breaking, the fact remains that conferences like this are considered private events. \u00a0A person does not have the right to attend and the organizers of the conference have the right to kick out anyone that they want to for any reason. \u00a0If the organizers felt that Mr. Reibel was going to be a disruptive presence - as he has been in the past - they would be well within their rights to kick him out.\n\nI don't think kicking him out was that far out of line either. \u00a0The organizers \u00a0put a lot of time and effort into getting the conference together and there are a lot of people who are attending because they want to hear what the people at the conference have to say. \u00a0If you were the organizers or an\u00a0attendee, would you want someone around who is there just to cause trouble or write nasty things about you later?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/-6O4GvOHn8wQ/Tebis5rV1tI/AAAAAAAAAVs/9ZPdrUSP7Vs/s1600/baby_crying2.gif", "http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1416", "http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/62", "http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/374", "http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/1416", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/05/expelled_anti-vaccine_style_2011_edition.php", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/autismone-dont-snark-on-me-weve-got-security-and-police/", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/05/autismone-again-expells-peaceful-non-disruptive-registered-attendees.html", "http://www.autismone.org/content/autismone-conference-policies"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/06/ken-reibels-obnoxious-streak.html", "title": "\nKen Reibel's Obnoxious Streak\n"},

Handley accused the then anonymous \"Sullivan\" of secretly being Bonnie Offit, wife of the ever-so popular Paul Offit. \u00a0Mr. Handley was so convinced that he was right (or that Sullivan would never out himself) that he makes two promises if he was wrong - never to publicly write about or utter the name Paul Offit again and to turn over the pauloffit.com domain to the Offits.\n\nMuch hilarity ensues from the right-wing of the autism world but the blogger known as Sullivan does not reveal his identity. \u00a0A few months later, Sullivan is \"outed\" by former members of the autism hub blogs and Handley is called on his promises. \u00a0Handley responds and says that he will make good on his promises.\n\nInterestingly enough, a few days after he is \"outed\", Sullivan writes an apology to J.B. Handley saying that \"I doubted that Mr. Handley would make good on his commitments, even going so far as to write that I didn\u2019t think he had the integrity to do so. For those comments I offer a sincere apology. I was wrong.\" (Although he may have since retracted his apology).\n\nAll of that takes us up to about three weeks ago and since then people seemed to be losing interest in the affair. \u00a0That is until Liz Ditz decided to stir up trouble and call J.B. Handley \"forsworn\" for not keeping his promises. \u00a0Specifically she has a problem because the pauloffit.com domain name has not been transferred to the Offits and the then current content on the site was hostile to Paul Offit.\n\nHere are a few facts that I can establish. \u00a0As of May 9th, 2011 at 04:19:54 GMT, google has a cache of the pauloffit.com domain that just has a single picture of the character of Sullivan from the movie Monster's Inc on it. \u00a0Liz Ditz published her piece on May 11th, 2011 at 4:45 PM EST (give or take). \u00a0I cannot find any record of what the pauloffit.com site looked like at that point but from the screen shot's included in Ms. Ditz's post, it appears that the site consisted of old news stories about Paul Offit. \n\nI am not going to judge whether putting those stories on the site was a violation of Handley's promise, assuming that he actually was the one who modified the page. \u00a0There is the letter of the promise and then the spirit of it. \u00a0I will say that if Mr Handley was the one who put up the page then one of these things might have been broken.\n\nMoving along, in jumps St. Wombles into the fray with a piece entitled \"Handley Backs Out of Agreement Regarding Offit Website\". \u00a0She says it is \"despicable behavior from an often vile group of people\" and that Handleys (alleged) behavior \"should not be surprise to anyone\", thus showing that she really does care about building community. \u00a0I mean, nothing builds community and shows tolerance for difference of opinion like calling someone \"despicable \"or labeling an entire section of autism parents an \"often vile group of people\". \n\nAhem. \n\nThe thing that I also found interesting is that it doesn't appear that the lady of science ever attempted to contact J.B. Handley to see what he was doing in regards to transferring the domain. \u00a0If you wanted to be strictly accurate, there was no evidence that J.B. Handley wasn't working to keep his promise. \u00a0As anyone who has tried to transfer a domain name from one party to another could tell you, it can sometimes take a little while for the transfer to happen. \u00a0Especially if the two parties to the transfer aren't on the best of terms as is clearly the case here. \n\nSo putting up a piece asserting that Handley backed out of his agreement without first actually establishing that that was indeed the case would be, what's the term, a little bit of \"woo\"?\n\nWell, that brings us to earlier today when J.B. Handley explains on the Age of Autism site what the problem was. \u00a0Basically he says that the initial transfer attempt was made on May 3rd - less than a week after the initial \"outing\". \u00a0An e-mail was sent, presumably to Paul Offit, telling him that he could arrange to transfer the domain to be under his name. \u00a0Handley asserts that he followed up with the\u00a0person who was co-ordinating the transfer twice in the next week and a half.\n\nWhich brings us back to another point of fact. \u00a0The pauloffit.com domain name was transferred on May 15th and Bonnie Offit is now listed as the contact on the domain. \u00a0The content of the site is now favorable to Paul Offit. \u00a0Presumably, the site is now in his hands.\n\nAt this point,\u00a0Liz Ditz writes\u00a0another post on the matter saying that \"Mr. Handley has finally done the honorable thing.\" \u00a0Sullivan wrote a response to the matter on Left Brain Right Brain giving his take on the matter, suggesting it was a \"tempest in a teapot\".\n\nSo, what do you think the Qwibbler does? \u00a0I know a rational person would either just drop the matter or post a brief note that the transfer was done and leave it at that. \u00a0But the Qwibbler, she doesn't strike me as the most rational person around. \n\nInstead of letting the matter drop, she instead launches yet another attack again Handley saying that he \"shows himself to be without honor, without decency, and without facts\". \u00a0She takes him to task for \"breaking his promise\" and for publicly talking about Offit while he was explaining the facts what was happening with the transfer. \u00a0Because, you know, \u00a0it is so easy to explain how you were attempting to communicate with someone without ever mentioning their name.\n\nI guess she is right, technically Handley did break his promise while he was attempting to explain how he was keeping his promise. \u00a0Way to stand up for evidence and community Qwibbler.\n\nDumbass.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ir0eUasRlH0/TFDTr8FQPCI/AAAAAAAAARU/7nx7Xl35DfU/s1600/turkey.png", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/11/is-paul-offits-wife-internet-trollautism-father-sullivan.htm", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/parent-reported-status-and-expectations-for-their-autistic-student-children-an-analysis-of-the-2007-national-household-education-survey/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/04/matt-carey-phd-says-hes-bonnie-offit-just-kidding.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/04/an-apology-to-mr-j-b-handley/", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/05/jb-handley-forsworn.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2011/05/handley-backs-out-of-agreement.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2011/05/pauloffitcom-the-website-no-one-wants.html", "http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2011/05/j-b-handley-makes-good-on-his-word-finally.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/pauloffit-com-a-tempest-in-a-teapot/", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2011/05/no-honor-no-decency-handley-breaks-his.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/05/jabberwocky-of-day-qwibbler-on-honor.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : The Qwibbler on Honor and Decency\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, May 14, 2011", "body": "\nAccording to a new report from the CDC, asthma became much more common in the US between 2001 and 2009 -\nDuring 2001--2009, the proportion of persons of all ages with asthma in the United States increased significantly (12.3%), from 7.3% (20.3 million persons) to 8.2% (24.6 million persons). A rising trend in asthma prevalence was observed across all demographic groups studied (Figure 1). Prevalence increased significantly during 2001--2009 for children (8.7% to 9.6%), adults (6.9% to 7.7%), males (6.3% to 7.1%), females (8.3% to 9.2%), whites (7.2% to 7.8%), blacks (8.4% to 10.8%), and Hispanics (5.8% to 6.4%).\u00a0...\u00a0In 2009, asthma prevalence was greater among children than adults (9.6% versus 7.7%), and was especially high among boys (11.3%) and non-Hispanic black children (17.0%). Prevalence among adults was greatest for women (9.7%) and adults who were poor (10.6%) (Table 1).Of course, the reason the for the increase is unclear (I broke the text below into paragraphs to make it more readable) -\nThe prevalence and number of persons with asthma have increased since 2001, and demographic differences among population subgroups persist despite improvements in outdoor air quality and decreases in cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke exposure (11--13). Although probable causes for the increase in asthma are unclear, CDC's top priority is getting people to manage their asthma better.Asthma has been more prevalent among children than adults, women than men, and blacks than whites since 2001. Similar to findings in previous studies (3--6), in 2009, asthma was more prevalent among children, women, non-Hispanic blacks, the poor, and in the Northeast and Midwest.\u00a0The cause of this variation remains unclear and might be the result of characteristics associated with asthma development and disease duration that were not examined in this study, including genetic predisposition, history of atopy (a genetic tendency to develop an allergic reaction), health risk factors (e.g., smoking, obesity), earlier diagnosis, socioeconomic status (e.g., education or occupation), and exposure to environmental allergens or irritants (e.g., mold, tobacco smoke, secondhand smoke exposure, pet dander, outdoor air pollution, and any upper respiratory infection, such as influenza or common cold) (1--3,5,6). In particular, obesity and exposure to tobacco smoke each have been associated with increased asthma severity (14,15).More detailed analytic investigation of these risk factors might help characterize subpopulations and identify those in greatest need of targeted prevention efforts.I think I might actually fall over if an organization like the CDC ever identified a\u00a0definitive\u00a0\"cause\" of something like asthma. \u00a0It is slightly bothersome when you have an (estimated) 4 million more people effected by a condition like asthma over an eight year period and the best the CDC can come up with is a \"our top priority is getting people to manage their asthma better\". \u00a0Don't get me wrong, it is critically important to teach people how to manage their asthma - their lives just might depend on it - but don't you think the top priority should be figuring out why more people are developing asthma?\n\nOK, that really isn't really a fair\u00a0criticism because conditions like asthma are complex and may have many different possible causes. \u00a0But when you have a group of condition that keep getting more common - such as asthma, childhood obesity, diabetes, ADD/ADHD, and autism - and your explanation and response to each is the almost the same, then maybe it is time to try a new approach.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6017a4.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6017a4.htm#fig1", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6017a4.htm#tab1", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5935a4.htm?s_cid=mm5935a4_w", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ind2011_su.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ind2011_su.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5608a1.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/05/asthma-becoming-more-common.html", "title": "\nAsthma Becoming More Common\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2011", "body": "\nAbout a month ago, I wrote about the CDC's recent efforts to address the issue of wandering in autism and how the \"Autistic Self Advocacy Network\" (ASAN) was opposed to the CDC's actions. \u00a0I'm not going to go into all of the details here, so if you are interested in the details go read my prior post or one of the many other resources on the subject.\n\nThe part of ASAN's objection that I wanted to readdress is the idea that \"the wandering diagnosis lacks meaningful research support.\" \u00a0Ignoring the obvious data points that existed before, there is now a new data point to consider in the form of a report from the Interactive Autism Network. \u00a0IAN is\u00a0conducting a national survey on wandering in autism and has released some\u00a0preliminary results based on the answers of 856 families -\nBased on responses to the IAN Elopement and Wandering Questionnaire, it is clear that roughly half of children with ASD between the ages of 4 and 10 attempt to elope. This rate is nearly four times higher than for the children\u2019s unaffected siblings. Between ages 7 and 10, almost 30% of children with ASD are still engaging in elopement behavior, a rate eight times higher than for their unaffected siblings. These figures are especially sobering when 35% of families with children who elope report their children are \u201cnever\u201d or \u201crarely\" able to communicate their name, address, or phone number by any means.Keep in mind that these results are preliminary and are based on the results of an Internet questionnaire. \u00a0But at the same time, IAN is not some fly by night operation and has successfully used Internet based questionnaires in published peer-reviewed research before. \u00a0These results are also based on a good sized group so I think that these numbers have some validity.\n\nI would draw your attention to the last part of the findings again - 1 in 3 children with autism who wander are unable to communicate who they are or where they live. \u00a0If you extrapolate that figure back to the entire population of children with autism, you will find that 15% of all children with autism wander AND are unable to communicate well enough to tell anyone who they are.\n\nThere is one other data point in the preliminary results that directly addresses another of ASAN criticisms. \u00a0ASAN is of the opinion that children with autism primarily use wandering as a means of fleeing stressful or abusive situations. \n\nHowever, according to the results, only 33% of the children have used wandering as a method of \"escaping demands/anxiety\" and 27% have used it to \"escape sensory discomfort\". \u00a0But 54% of these children \"enjoy exploring\" and 36% \"heads for favorite place\". \u00a0So in other words, it is more likely that the child is blissfully heading into danger simply because they do not understand the danger rather than actively fleeing a hostile situation.\n\nAs the report says so well in closing -\nPreliminary results of the IAN Elopement and Wandering Questionnaire demonstrate that elopement behaviors are a major problem for approximately half of families with a child on the autism spectrum at some point between the ages of 4 and 17; that eloping children encounter significant dangers; and that families of elopers are often stressed and socially isolated. This data validates long held concerns of families and advocates regarding elopement and ASD. It also gives us our first glimpse into the motivations and states of mind of these children while they are \u201cwandering,\u201d a word that may not fit what parents report: children who are often happy, playful, and focused on a goal when they depart safe spaces.Or simply put, wandering appears to be a major safety issue in children with autism. \u00a0As a parent whose children are on the spectrum, these results are not shocking to me. \u00a0What is shocking is that an organization who seeks to speak for the rights of everyone on the spectrum is against dealing with a major safety concern.\n\nASAN, are you paying attention?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=130", "http://www.awaare.org/", "http://autism.about.com/b/2011/03/19/a-medical-code-for-autistic-wandering-whats-your-opinion.htm", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2011/03/autism-disorders-wandering-vigilance.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/search/label/wandering", "http://www.ianproject.org/", "http://www.iancommunity.org/cs/ian_research_reports/ian_research_report_elopement"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/04/preliminary-data-on-autism-and.html", "title": "\nPreliminary Data on Autism and Wandering\n"},

So I don't know what possible \"legal battle\" could be mounted.\n\nBut then it gets even stranger when LBRB claims that the so-called vaccine court would never distort the relationship between vaccines and autism and that autism isn't defined by its behaviors -\nThe report \u2013 at least in this news story \u2013 doesn\u2019t seem to mention how many children were compensated for having autism. As we all kow \u2018autism like symptoms\u2019 or \u2018symptoms and behavior consistent with autism.\u2019 might be just that \u2013 but they are not autism. If they were I\u2019m sure the court would\u2019ve reported it.Both of the claims are just straight up wrong. \n\nThere have been at least 3 cases where the vaccine court compensated children for their autism and went out of their way to avoid saying what they were compensating for was autism. \u00a0Perhaps the most notable was the case of Bailey Banks where the court basically invented a new medical condition, non-autistic pdd-nos, to avoid making the link. \u00a0From the decision -\nThese facts likewise satisfy the Althen test set forth above. Petitioner\u2019s theory of PDD caused by vaccine-related ADEM causally connects the vaccination and the ultimate injury, and does so by explaining a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the ultimate reason for the injury. PDD is always autism yet the\u00a0title of the\u00a0ruling\u00a0is\u00a0\"Non-autistic developmental delay\". \u00a0If that isn't an attempt to avoid calling something autism, I don't know what it is.\n\nThen there is the idea that \"behavior consistent with autism\" isn't autism. \u00a0Yet autism is defined solely on the basis of behaviors. \u00a0If you have the enough of the behaviors of autism then, BY DEFINITION, you have autism. \u00a0If you don't have enough, then you don't have it. \u00a0There is absolutely nothing in the clinical definition of autism that makes cases whether autism was caused by genetics, environment, vaccines, or little green men from mars.\n\nI have to wonder how LBRB can champion the the idea that there is no \"autism epidemic\" because \"autistic traits\" are present, yet unrecognized, in the general population and then turn around and claim this set of \"autistic traits\" aren't autism because a vaccine might have caused them.\n\nThe\u00a0cognitive dissonance that they experience over there must be stunning.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2011/05/next-chapter-in-vaccine-autism-story.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2011/05/when-the-science-fails-you-turn-to-the-legal-option/", "http://www.fairwarning.org/2011/05/analysis-finds-evidence-of-autism-in-many-vaccine-injury-cases/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/05/jabberwocky-of-day-reality-distortion.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Reality Distortion\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, March 16, 2011", "body": "\nThe \"Autistic Self Advocacy Network\", aka ASAN, is putting its ideological goals ahead of the safety of people with autism by opposing the CDC's efforts to address the issue of wandering in autism. \u00a0You wouldn't think that an organization whose stated purpose is to advocate for the needs of people with autism would be opposed to addressing a safety issue, but here we are.\n\nHere's the deal. \u00a0The CDC recently proposed adding a medical diagnostic code for wandering in children and adults with autism, developmental disabilities, and other conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s. \u00a0The CDC wants to use the for the following purposes -\nDiagnostic codes for wandering associated with ASDs and wandering associated with other developmental disabilities would promote (1) better data collection for and understanding of this behavior (2) prompt important safety discussions between healthcare providers, caregivers, and the person with the disability to the full extent possible. Better data should help to increase awareness and action among first responders, school administrators and residential facility administrators to recognize and understand the wandering and develop proper emergency protocols and response while supporting self-determination principles.As many parents whose children have autism can tell you, wandering is one of the many\u00a0safety concerns that they have to worry about. \u00a0Some children with autism can and will wander away from home or other safe environments without any regard to the consequences. \u00a0They will get lost in the woods, drown in pools, walk straight into traffic, or do other things that will put their lives at risk. \u00a0They will do these things without any understanding that these things are dangerous because they are not aware of their environment. \n\nWhile there is not yet any hard data on how often wandering happens, there are plenty of stories of children with autism who wander away from home and die. \u00a0I believe there is an urgent need to get a handle on this problem and to get the programs in place to help prevent needless deaths.\n\nYou would thing that ASAN would be all for preventing needless deaths but you would be wrong. \u00a0ASAN put out an \"Action Alert\" two days ago telling the world that they are against addressing the problem of wandering. \u00a0However, rather than directly address the issues of wandering, ASAN is trying to re-frame the debate into nonsense terms.\n\nInstead of children wandering away because they don't realize the dangers, ASAN is claiming that children use wandering as a communication tool to avoid \"abusive or sensorily overwhelming environments\" -\nBy labeling hundreds of thousands of school children with disabilities with a diagnosis of \"wandering\", CDC will encourage districts to plan for the use of restraint for these students in Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and school safety planning. Furthermore, by claiming that \"wandering\" is an unavoidable medical diagnosis instead of a behavioral response to specific circumstances, children with little to no communication needs may lose one of their last ways of making family members and educators aware of abusive or sensorily overwhelming environments: trying to leave a dangerous situation. Far from making children with disabilities safer, this proposal will enable abuse \"in the name of treatment\" and make it harder for non-speaking students to communicate problems to their families.\u00a0Yes, I can see that identifying a very serious problem like wandering and putting a plan into place to keep children from harm will stop them from communicating. \u00a0How exactly does that work?\n\nASAN also claims that this label will \"enable abuse and restrict the civil rights\" of people with disabilities. \u00a0Or that the label might be used to enable \"insurance coverage for tracking devices\". \u00a0I mean being able to track children who have wandered away from home and find them before something happens would be terrible.\n\nHere's a hint ASAN, if you have an abusive parent, caretaker, or educator, they aren't going to be stopped by the lack of a label. \u00a0But a label has the potential to give us real data about how serious the wandering issue is and help prevent needless deaths.\n\nIf you ever needed a good example of why ASAN does not speak for the needs of children with autism, this is it. \u00a0Go read the entirety of why ASAN doesn't seem to care about children's safety. \u00a0Or better yet, support organizations like AWAARE that are working to prevent wandering incidents and deaths.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RkeyfFbE278/TYFxL30nZ-I/AAAAAAAAAVU/5irat-pzCiM/s1600/safety_osha_caution_sign.png", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=130", "http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/icd9/TopicpacketforMarch2011_HA1.pdf", "http://liveslosttoautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=130", "http://www.awaare.org/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/03/asan-puts-ideology-ahead-of-childrens.html", "title": "\nASAN Puts Ideology Ahead of Children's Safety\n"},

We need increased research financing directed toward rigorous science that can provide the answers that parents are looking for and deserve. Until this happens, we will continue to wallow in controversy, and people with autism and families will continue to struggle with autism on their own.In the blog post, Autism Speaks outlines some of their current priorities \u00a0-\n\nThe role of a multiple environmental factors that are potentially contributing to the increase in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) prevalence\nNew insights into the underlying biology of ASD that are leading to novel treatments\nWays we can address the medical conditions that impact the everyday lives of people with ASD, and\nPrograms that are being developed to help adolescents with ASD successfully transition to becoming happy and fulfilled adults.\n\nI have to agree (for once) with Autism Speaks. \u00a0It is long past time for the vaccine-autism discussion to come to an end. \u00a0All of the sides involved have made their points abundantly clear and nobody is going to adjust their position. \n\nThe medical establishment has gone all-in on their push for universal vaccinations and has adopted strong arm techniques in an attempt to force parents to adhere to the vaccination schedule. \u00a0They mean well, but this approach is going to come back to haunt them.\n\nThe other side (the so-called \"anti-vaxers\") have their problems as well. \u00a0Their ranks contain quite a few people who are very, uhm, vocal \u00a0and are quick to leap to the attack. \u00a0While I can understand and sympathize with where they are coming from, I have to say that they can sometimes be their own worst enemy. \n\nThe problem boils down to the lack of solid data showing a link between vaccines and autism. \u00a0Sure, there are studies both for and against the theory (mostly against) that purport to either prove or disprove the link. \u00a0And then there are the\u00a0conspiracy theories abound as to why there isn't better data.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, none of that matters because we still don't have any real idea what the biology of autism looks like. \u00a0It is one thing to say that autism is made up of these sets of behaviors. \u00a0It is another to be able to point to the biological causes of the disorder and have some clue as to how it can be corrected.\n\nSo I applaud Autism Speaks for trying to shift the conversation from one possible factor to how to deal with autism as a whole. \u00a0Lets just hope it works.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/opinion/l25autism.html", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2011/02/17/change-the-conversation/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/02/autism-speaks-changes-course.html", "title": "\nAutism Speaks Changes Course\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2011", "body": "\nAs was first pointed out on Autism's Gadfly, John Elder Robison is once again talking about things that he doesn't seem to have the faintest clue about. \u00a0Last time, Mr. Robison was making completely inaccurate statements about CDD. \u00a0This time, Mr. Robison is talking about the the fact that autism is far more common in males than females and coming up with some rather far fetched ideas to explain the discrepancy.\n\nAs most of you probably know, autism is about four times more common in boys than girls. \u00a0This gender skewing was first noted all the way back in the 1940s when Kanner \"invented\" autism and has remained a constant property of autism even as as the number of children with autism has exploded from 1 in 10,000 in the 1940s to 1 in 100 today.\n\nWhat you may not know is that a similar gender skewing is commonly seen in other childhood disorders as well, such as ADHD and intellectual disability. \u00a0The exact ratio of boys to girls changes with the disorder but in general boys are more likely to have a developmental disorder than girls. \u00a0So, in reality, there doesn't seem to be anything that different about autism in this regard.\n\nThe question is then why are boys more likely than girls to have development disabilities. \u00a0In my opinion, the general answer to that question is built into the question itself. \u00a0Obviously, there is some different between males and females that either makes males more susceptible or females less susceptible to these conditions. \u00a0Either the reason is genetic, biological, social, or (most likely) some combination of the three.\n\nThe trick has always been to identify the causes of the conditions and then to work backwards to determine why males are more affected than females.\u00a0 But since, when it comes to autism (and ADHD), we don't have any real clue as to what the the cause of the condition is, we don't have any real clue as to why the difference is there.\n\nBut that doesn't stop Mr. Robison from coming up with some rather, uhm, interesting ideas about why this difference exists. \u00a0He first seems to suggest that families with children on the spectrum are more prone to having boys than girls -\n\nIf we assemble a collection of families in which there is at least one autistic child, that distribution of sons and daughters is not 50/50. \u00a0It favors the males.\nBut I have never run across any study that has even suggested that families who have children on the spectrum are more likely to have boys than girls. \u00a0This claim would go against the generally held (and proven) idea that the chance of having a boy or a girl is roughly 50/50.\n\nIt would be a fairly simple matter to survey a large number of families who have with multiple children where at least one child has autism and see if this were true. \u00a0But I would like to think that, if this claim were true, someone would have noticed the discrepancy and published on the subject by now.\n\nIn fact, the largest autism sibling study to date that was published just this year and included data on 664 sibling showed (roughly) the expected 50/50 breakdown between the genders. \n\nWho knows, maybe Mr. Robison's proposed relationship has been demonstrated in other studies and I just missed it. \u00a0But if so, I think he needs to show us the data and not just make unsupported statements.\n\nNext, Mr. Robison goes on to show an astounding ignorance of basic chance when he suggests that -\n\nOne explanation is that some parents have a son with autism and stop having children. \u00a0So the girls that might even the male/female ratio are never born. \u00a0I think that explanation may be true today, but what about the ages before modern birth control?\nFrankly, I don't even understand how this could work. \u00a0It seems like Mr. Robison is suggesting that first born children are more likely to be a boy than a girl but that idea is just plain nonsense. \u00a0The chance of having either a boy or a girl in any given pregnancy is almost 50/50. \u00a0That fact is as true for the first child as it is for the last child.\n\nMaybe he is suggesting that a first born boy is more likely to have autism than a first born girl but then the chances even out after the first child? \u00a0But that would not make any sense either. \u00a0If boys and girls both had the same chance of having autism then you would have the exact same chance of having a first born boy with autism as you would a first born girl.\n\nThen Mr. Robison makes some rather strange claims about the\u00a0\"historical record\" (i.e. pre 1940) of people with autism -\n\nCritics might say that we don\u2019t know how autism was distributed among the sexes a hundred years ago, and that\u2019s true. \u00a0The autism diagnosis has only existed for sixty-some years. \u00a0Yet we do have strong anecdotal evidence. \u00a0Using that, some modern day people have \u201cdiagnosed\u201d historical figures with autism based on what we know of them and their lives. \u00a0How many of those individuals are female? \u00a0Almost none.\n\nThose \u201cpost-mortem diagnoses\u201d are certainly subject to challenge and I\u2019m sure some are even wrong. \u00a0That said, they can\u2019t all be wrong and the male-female ratio in the known historical record of autism remains strikingly tilted toward the male side.\nThere are so many things wrong with this argument that it is hard to know where to begin. \n\nPerhaps the worst part is the idea that a post-mortem diagnosis is evidence of anything besides someone having way too much time on their hands. \u00a0You simply cannot diagnosis someone based on little snippets of what is published about their life. \n\nIt is hard enough to diagnosis an adult with high-functioning autism who is sitting in front of you with their parents and has a complete record of their development. \u00a0When you add in a span of hundred years or so, several changes in culture, a selective report of only parts of their life, and the inability to talk directly to the person, then making an accurate diagnosis becomes next to impossible.\n\nThen the idea that\u00a0\"they can't all be wrong\" is just silly. \u00a0Yes, every post-mortem diagnosis can be wrong and, given the challenges in making an accurate historical diagnosis, I would be willing to bet that almost all (if not all) of them are in fact wrong.\n\nAnd calling a post-mortem diagnosis \"strong anecdotal evidence\" does a disservice to the word \"strong\" as well as the word \"evidence\". \u00a0The idea that speculation based on extremely limited historical information is actually \"anecdotal\u00a0evidence\" let alone \"strong\" is just absurd. \n\nBut, for the sake of argument, lets assume that these absurd statements are true and that the historical record does have more males than females with autism. \u00a0Does that tell us that there were more males than females in the past or does it tell us that, historically, men were much more likely to be written about than women? \n\nAnyone with even a cursory knowledge of historical literature should know the answer to that question.\n\nPerhaps the only intelligent thing that Mr. Robison has to say on this subject is that idea that female fetuses with autism are less likely to survive -\n\nGeri Dawson suggested another possible explanation for the male-female imbalance. \u00a0What if girl embryos are actually more susceptible to some factor implicated in autism, but in a different way? \u00a0The factor that produces autistic baby boys might result in unsuccessful pregnancies when the fetus is female. \u00a0The result \u2013 fewer baby girls with autism are born\nIf this idea repeated by Mr. Robison is correct then you would expect to see a noticeably higher rate of autism in children with prenatal complications. \u00a0Having a history of miscarriages means that you have a greater chance of having complications in future pregnancies. \u00a0But the most recent study of the topic suggested that there is no such broad association.\n\nFurthermore, in\u00a0some of the known genetic causes of autism the exact opposite happens - the male child is either more effected or has a lesser chance of surviving. \u00a0A male child with Rett Syndrome is very unlikely to survive while a female can because of her double X chromosome. \u00a0And in Fragile X, a female is somewhat protected against having the symptoms of the disorder, again because of genetic differences.\n\nSo, if anything, I think this idea might be correct if it was flipped. \u00a0Rather than female fetuses not surviving, it seems more likely that being female offers some sort of protection against developing autism as well as other development disabilities.\n\nBut again, maybe there is data out there that shows a higher rate of\u00a0miscarriages in mothers who children have autism. \u00a0But to me it sounds like grasping at straws. \u00a0Perhaps it would be better to have some actual concrete data to support a claim rather than just idle speculation.\n\nI think the most disturbing part of all of this isn't the nonsense itself but rather Mr. Robison's position at Autism Speaks. \u00a0It doesn't really matter than he has some really strange ideas about autism or that he seems to misunderstand some basic science. \u00a0We all have areas where we are less than knowledgeable but still like to pretend we know what we are talking about.\n\nNo, I think the most\u00a0disturbing\u00a0part is that Mr. Robison serves on the scientific advisory board of Autism Speaks and helps select what science they will fund. \u00a0If a non-expert like myself can see the gaping holes in his ideas then what does that say about the projects he would suggest funding?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2011/09/john-robisons-interesting-theory-on.html", "http://jerobison.blogspot.com/2011/09/surplus-of-males.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/09/jabberwocky-of-day-john-elder-robison.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : John Elder Robison on the Male Female Autism Imbalance\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, November 11, 2010", "body": "\n\n\nFlickr picture by The Doctr\nA few weeks ago, I talked about why it wasn't the best idea to give yourself the Autism Quotient and act based on the results of the test. \u00a0The Autism Quotient is not meant to be a diagnostic test and, even if you get a high score on the test, you are still fairly unlikely to have autism.\n\nBut, for the sake of discussion, lets say that you do have a history of having some autism-like symptoms and decide to take the test. \n\nIf you get a high score on the test you might believe that, based the test result and your life experiences, it is likely that you have a form of autism. \u00a0After all, you are an intelligent, mature person who has carefully done research and made honest self-appraisals. \u00a0And the AQ test bears out your idea, so what could be wrong?\n\nWell, to start off with, you might have schizophrenia, not autism. \u00a0According to a study1 published earlier this week (open access, go read it) -\nIn clinical practice, differential diagnosis of high-functioning autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCH) is difficult but important. It is especially difficult when adult patients with ASD have psychotic symptoms as a result of maladjustment to their circumstances. Diagnosis of ASD requires a knowledge of early developmental history, but sometimes that is difficult to clearly ascertain when the patient is an adult. If such patients were not diagnosed as having ASD during their childhood, we cannot distinguish their symptoms from the positive symptoms of SCH. Similarly, when ASD patients are in social withdrawal or in an autistic state, it is difficult to distinguish their state from the negative symptoms of SCH. Thus, a reliable measurement for differentiating the two disorders is needed.This study looked specifically at the Autism Quotient (AQ) test and how well it could distinguish between high-functioning autism and schizophrenia in adults. \u00a0The researchers gave the AQ to 51 adults of normal intelligence who had either autism or pdd-nos and 46 adults who had schizophrenia. \n\nThe main result was not too surprising. \u00a0The autism group, as a whole,\u00a0scored higher on the AQ than the schizophrenia group. But - and this is the important bit - the AQ misclassified 8 (17%) out of the 46 patients who had schizophrenia as having autism. \u00a0As the researchers say in their discussion section,\u00a0\"high AQ patients with SCH cannot be distinguished from ASD by using only the scores of the total AQ and its subscales\". \n\nLet me put this another way.\n\nThe AQ can't reliably tell the difference between schizophrenia and high functioning autism. \u00a0Trained clinicians - people who do this everyday as part of their job - have a hard time as well. \u00a0So what do you think the chances are that an untrained person, researching the condition on their own, is going to be able to tell the difference? \n\nNow, before you think this doesn't matter, consider that schizophrenia is known to be more common in adults that autism is. \u00a0The current figure for schizophrenia is about 1 in 90, or about 1.1% of adults over the age of 18. \u00a0The rate for autism in adults is not well understood but is, by most accounts, much lower than 1%. \u00a0I think it would be safe to say that, even if we were to be highly optimistic about how many adults have autism, there are going to be 3 adults with schizophrenia for every 1 with autism. \n\nSo, assume that you\u00a0had a group of 1,000 adults where you had 4 adults (1 in 250) that had autism and 11 that had schizophrenia, and that you gave them the AQ. \u00a0Based on what we know about the AQ, we would expect\u00a0about 25 of the group to score in the autism range. \u00a0Out of that group, most (20) would be misidentified,\u00a03 would have autism, and 2 would have schizophrenia.\n\nOr in simple terms, if the AQ gives you a high score and it is picking up on something that is really there, you have almost a 40% chance of having schizophrenia instead of autism. \u00a0That little fact might be important as\u00a0schizophrenia is more easily\u00a0treated\u00a0than autism is.\n\nAll of this is just one small example of how a self-diagnosis could go wrong. \u00a0There are many other ways that the process can go wrong. \u00a0The bottom line is, if you think you have a problem, don't self-diagnosis. \u00a0Go talk to a professional who knows what they are doing.\n\nReferences\n1.

{"date": "Saturday, January 15, 2011", "body": "\nAccording to blog entry written by Brian Deer for The Guardian, the \"medical establishment\" have \"closed ranks\" behind Wakefield to shield him from fraud claims. \u00a0No, I am not making this up, go read the article for yourself.\n\nI think my favorite part of the story is this one -\nBut a Philadelphia-based commentator was not impressed by the BMJ's intervention. \"It doesn't matter that [Wakefield] was fraudulent,\" Dr Paul Offit, a vaccine inventor and author in Pennsylvania, was quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer the next day as saying. \"It only matters that he was wrong.\"I wasn't surprised. From his establishment vantage-point, this was the third time Dr Offit had popped up to opine on the issue. Twice previously he'd been quoted as saying that my findings were \"irrelevant\" (although he'd been happy enough to use them in his books). Science had spoken, his argument went. There was no link between the vaccine and autism. It was experts like him who should rule on this matter, he seemed to imply, not some oik reporter nailing the guilty men.Uhm, well, err, yes.... \n\nDr. Offit is clearly trying to shield Wakefield from fraud claims. \u00a0In other news, pigs were seen flying in Philadelphia earlier today.\n\nDeer's solution to the problem of doctors defending doctors and relying on science?\nSo, what's my point? I think these comments reveal a striking pattern: doctors default to defending other doctors. In fact, until recently there was a GMC regulation that banned them from bad-mouthing colleagues.But in the specifics of their stance there seemed the idea that scholarly debate, epidemiology and suchlike, should arbitrate. Truth would emerge from the \"scientific method\", not from \"we can reveal\" media muck-raking.Let battle commence, I say. Let doctors expose each other. Let journals compete to get the truth out first. Because 13 years passed before I slayed the MMR monster. And although a single, severed hand may yet come crawling across the floor, for science and public safety 13 years is still too long.I think Deer nailed it. Journalism like his is clearly the best way to deal with the complex medical issues raised by Wakefield's research. \u00a0Who needs actual evidence to refute the claims? \u00a0We should throw out the scientific method and let the media tell us what is what.\n\nOr even better, \u00a0lets take it one step further and create a new reality TV show - Doctor vs Doctor. \u00a0We can lock MDs with different options in a house for a week and film the whole thing and let the public vote on who they like better. \u00a0Whichever doctor has the most votes at the end of the week is right. \n\nWho needs little things like data and the scientific method when we could just let people shout it out?\n\nBut seriously, this was written by the same person who is making fraud allegations against Wakefield. \u00a0Since none of us have access to the same records that Deer does, we have to rely on what he tells us they say. \u00a0We have to be able to trust him. \n\nGiven rants like this and other incidents in the past, I don't find him to be particularly believable or trustworthy. \u00a0Wakefield is certainly not a saint but I don't think that Deer is any better. \n\nBut, like always, make up your own mind.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2011/jan/12/andrew-wakefield-fraud-mmr-autism"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/01/jabberwocky-of-day-medical.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Medical Establishment Shielding Wakefield\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 12, 2010", "body": "\n\nFlickr Photo by dbkingAs I have talked above a few times before, there is a vaccine injury case - Bruesewitz v. Wyeth - currently being decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. \u00a0If you are interested in reading the filings and arguments before the court or would like to read a summary written by someone who actually understands the legal issues, I would refer you to the excellent page on SCOTUSblog.\n\nThe arguments before the court were heard about a month and a half ago and, while I was planning to write about it at the time, I never had the chance to do so. \u00a0But now, since a decision from the court might be handed down in the next few weeks, I thought it might might be a good time to talk about the case again.\n\nFirst let me say that I am not a lawyer nor do I play one on the internet. \u00a0I have read the filings and the transcripts from the the case several times and have attempted to understand the legal issues involved. \u00a0I think I understand the basics but my knowledge in this area is extremely limited and I could very easily be misunderstanding what is involved.\n\nHowever, having said all of that, it is my opinion that Bruesewitz is going to lose their appeal. \u00a0I think that the Supreme Court is going to basically say that vaccine manufacturers cannot be sued in civil court for any injuries that could be reasonably be expected to occur after being given a vaccine. \u00a0The Court is going to find that the only venue for these sorts of claims is the so-called vaccine court.\n\nThe reasons I say this have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with any debate surrounding vaccines or vaccines and autism but rather are completely based on what the relevant laws are. \u00a0In this case, the controlling law is the one that created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in the first place. \u00a0This law created the Office of Special Masters inside the US Court of Federal Claims - the so-called vaccine court, established how that program should work, and set the terms under which vaccine injury claims could be heard by civil courts. \n\nSo the central issue in\u00a0Bruesewitz\u00a0\u00a0v. Wyeth is about how this law should be\u00a0interpreted\u00a0in general, and more specifically, what this section of the law means -\nNo vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.While at first glance this passage seems to be as clear as mud, when you consider the backdrop of how product liability works it starts to make a certain kind of sense. \n\nProduct liability is the area of law that deals with how manufacturers (and others) should be held responsible for injuries that their products cause. \u00a0There are a few different types of liability but the relevant one for this case is strict liability. \u00a0Strict liability is the idea that a company is responsible for damage caused by their products regardless of any fault on their part.\n\nStrict liability is different than other types of product liability, such as negligence, in that it doesn't matter how careful the company is or what steps it takes to prevent problems. \u00a0If it can be proven that a company's product caused the damage then the company can be held liable. \u00a0With this type of liability there are three basic types of claims that can be made. \n\nThe first type of claim is called a \"manufacturing defect\" and deals with injuries that are caused because of problems during the manufacturing process. \u00a0For example, if a vaccine was contaminated by something while it was being made or if a worker didn't add some ingredient when they should have then that would be considered a manufacturing defect. \n\nThe second type of claim is called \"failure to warn\" and deals with injuries that occur because a company failed to warn about a non-obvious danger where the injury might have been able to have been avoided if the user knew about the risk. \u00a0An example here would be the warning about kickback that comes on every chainsaw. \u00a0Kickback is what happens if you get the tip of a chainsaw too close to an object, such as the ground - the blade has a chance of kicking back (rebounding) in the direction of your body and causing serious harm. \u00a0A novice user might not\u00a0realize the danger of that happening, hence the warning.\n\nThe final type of claim is called a \"design defect\" and deals with injuries caused by products that have a defective by design or products that cannot be made safe no matter what the design. \u00a0A example here might be a chair that was designed to only have three legs instead of four or a car whose brakes would fail to work when the car is going faster than 15 mph.\n\nNow, if you look back at the snippet of the law above, you can see that it mentions all three types of liability I just talked about. \u00a0The question is how should the law be interpreted and what exactly was the intent of Congress in writing the law.\n\nThe laws says that\u00a0if an side effect occurs even though a product was properly prepared (manufactured) and accompanied by proper directions and warnings then the company is not liable for that injury if it were unavoidable. \n\nSo, the case basically comes down to what an \"unavoidable\" side effect is. \u00a0My opinion is that the Supreme Court is basically going to find that a side effect is \"unavoidable\" if it is known that it can happen as a result of the vaccination and that there was no way to change the vaccine to prevent the injury.\n\nOr to put it another way, if the product was properly\u00a0manufactured and the possible risks are disclosed to the end user (or their parents) that the company is not liable if one of those side effects happens.\n\nBringing it all the way back to the current case, the seizures that Bruesewitz had were certainly a known side effect of the DTP vaccine as it was listed in the vaccine injury table of the original 1986 National Vaccine Injury Act and was still there up until a month before the Bruesewitz's initial claim was filed with the vaccine court in 1995. \u00a0There were no changes to the then-current\u00a0vaccine that could have been made to prevent the injury. \u00a0Hence the possibility of seizures was an \"unavoidable\" side effect of using the vaccine.\n\nNow, there is the second part of the argument - that\u00a0Wyeth had a different type of vaccine that it could have used and that type of vaccine might have been able to avoid the\u00a0seizures. \u00a0But that argument ignores the fact that the current vaccine was approved by the relevant agencies, was used properly, and (presumably) had the proper disclaimer pamphlet with it while the other vaccine was nothing more than vaporware. \u00a0The mere possibility that another type of vaccine existed did not make the side effect of this one avoidable.\n\nAs a result, I think the Supreme Court will look at the evidence, decide that the seizures were \"unavoidable\", and uphold the decision of the 3rd circuit court. \u00a0The only question for me is how far they will take it. \u00a0Will the ruling be a narrow one limited to only this case or will the Court attempt to set a general precedent that vaccine\u00a0manufacturers have broad based immunity and the only forum for hearing injury complaints is the vaccine court?\n\nTime will tell.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm1.static.flickr.com/23/37621686_0dcd0e12e5_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootbearwdc/", "http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/bruesewitz-v-wyeth/", "http://www.scotusblog.com/", "http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/09-152.pdf", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/authorizinglegislation.pdf", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_liability", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/12/bruesewitz-v-wyeth-unavoidable-outcome.html", "title": "\nBruesewitz v.

This may be due to the younger age range assessed but the suitability of the tools and aspects of Iranian culture could be other reasons for the lower prevalence. International comparisons of prevalence rates is fraught with difficulties, but it is a valuable endeavour as it can identify issues around cultural and societal perceptions of children's development.\nPubmed ID : 21610190 DOI : 10.1177/1362361311407091\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21610190", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1362361311407091"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/06/study-watch-autism-prevalence-in-iran.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : Autism Prevalence in Iran\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 7, 2011", "body": "\nReality is the state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may appear or may be thought to be. \u00a0Reality is value-neutral, it does not cast judgment on the rightness or wrongness of something. \u00a0So when we talk about \"reality\", we are talking about what things are rather than what we would want them to be.\n\nI believe that it is very important to deal with the reality of a situation rather than some abstract notion of what could or should be. \u00a0It is crucial to fully grasp the idea of what something is before you move onto the why it is like it is or what it should be like. \n\nYou may not like what reality is and you are always free to try and change it. \u00a0But to do that \u00a0you have to understand what exactly it is you are dealing with and what steps are required to change it. \u00a0The worst possible thing you can do when trying to change reality is to just pretend it is something other than it is. \u00a0When you do that you not only deny reality but also lose your ability to change it.\n\nI like to call\u00a0pretending that reality is something other than it is denialism. \u00a0Denialism is a problem in the autism world. \u00a0There are many \"autism advocates\" who, for whatever reason, seem to feel the need to pretend that autism is something other than it is or pretend that life with autism is something other than it is.\n\nConsider this recent post by a semi-retired neurodiversity blogger. \u00a0He is clearly very proud of his son and I don't blame him. \u00a0Every parent has the right (and the duty) to take pride in their children's accomplishments. \u00a0If that were my child I would be proud too.\n\nBut the problem is this gentleman has basically indoctrinated his son with a false reality about autism. \u00a0He denies doing so, of course, but no nine year old (with or without autism) has the mental capacity to grasp what exactly autism is or deal with the realities of the difficulties that autism can bring. \u00a0Hell, for that matter, most adults don't have the mental capacity to really understand autism either. \u00a0My experience has taught me that\u00a0\u00a0is very difficult for anyone to understand the reality of autism unless you live it or it impacts your daily life. \u00a0That goes double for the more severe forms of autism (and other major disabilities).\n\nSo while this gentleman is quite proud of his son, my older daughters just turned six years old and still don't have the communication skills to express basic concepts. \u00a0His \"autism\" reality is that his nine year old son questions the medical model of autism while mine is that my six year olds can barely express their basic needs.\n\nAs an example, just this past week Twin B developed a double ear infection. \u00a0Those of you who have had ear infections before know that they can be uncomfortable at best to downright painful at worst. \u00a0Yet, because of her autism, Twin B lacks the communication skills to express that her ears hurt. \u00a0She suffered in silence, unable to tell us that she was in pain.\u00a0\u00a0The only reason that we knew about the infections is that she happened to have a doctors appointment and they checked her ears.\n\nBut, if this blogger is to be believed, the reality of \"autism\" is that autism is just a difference that needs acceptance. \u00a0It is somehow more important to \"take down\" discrimination and let children like mine know they are loved and accepted for who they are than it is to take down a disorder that causes great hardship for my children. \u00a0These words ring hollow in the face of my daughter being in pain and prevented from seeking help for her pain.\n\nAnd this is just a trivial example.\n\nThe reality of autism for my children - and I suspect the majority of children with autism - is that it is not a quest for acceptance. \u00a0It is a struggle to acquire enough skills to be able to survive in the world. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, I want my children to know they are loved and accepted but I get the distinct impression that they would also love to be able to talk. \n\nThis rejection of a fundamental autism reality is the core problem with the neurodiversity movement and why I think of it as a sort of autism apartheid. \u00a0This movement effectively segregates the autism world into the very high functioning minority and rest - and then tries to focus the entire conversation on the minority while ignoring the needs of the majority. \u00a0Sure, you will hear the\u00a0occasional\u00a0lip service to the less fortunate ones but most of the conversation will be needs and wants of the \"there's nothing wrong with autism\" minority.\n\nThe majority of children with autism need real help just as much or more than they need acceptance. \u00a0They need the debilitating symptoms of their autism to be eradicated.\n\nAnother recent example of denialism comes from this recent exchange of posts between Harold Doherty and Astrid. \u00a0Harold is basically saying that the reality of severe autism is that people with severe autism are more vulnerable to abuse. \u00a0He is saying this to raise awareness of the problem so that it can be prevented.\n\nTo me, these statements are a complete no-brainer. \u00a0Autism can and does make people easier targets for abuse, especially if the victims are unable to communicate that the abuse occurred. \n\nYet Astrid feels the need to defend the virtue of autism and misrepresents Harold's point to mean the disability causes the abuse. \u00a0She takes exception with the idea that the disability has anything to do with the abuse. \u00a0She calls it \"abuse apologism\".\n\nI call her response denialism. \n\nI am not suggesting that a disability \"causes\" or invites abuse. \u00a0Abuse of any form for any reason is completely inexcusable and should not be tolerated. \u00a0But to deny the reality that severe disabilities, such as some forms of autism, play a role in abuse is absurd and downright dangerous to the disabled. \n\nThe reality is that a disability makes a person more vulnerable to abuse. \u00a0You either accept that reality and take steps to prevent it or you stick your head in the sand and pretend that the disability has nothing to do with it and thus ignore the danger. \n\nI know that when it comes to my children I would rather face what can be the grim reality of autism and try it change it rather than pretending it is something that it isn't. \u00a0My children need more than just acceptance and love - they need someone to take down their autism. \u00a0And, as I have talked about before, they certainly need to be protected from a world that they do not understand and from people who will take advantage of them.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TVCE9n9S93I/AAAAAAAAAU8/iqwvMCzQnTA/s1600/sign-realitycheck.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_judgment", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2011/02/bit-rusty-very-roud.html", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2011/02/severe-autism-reality-2007-flashback.html", "http://astridvanwoerkom.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/disability-doesnt-cause-abuse/", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2011/02/autism-realities-vulnerability-and.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/02/autism-reality.html", "title": "\nAutism Reality\n"},

\n\nOK, lets talk about ideas and being right or wrong. \n\nI am willing to keep an open mind on just about any subject and I always try to stay open to the idea that I could be wrong. \u00a0I try very hard to be consistent in what I say although, to be honest, you will sometimes hear logic sobbing softly in the corner as I tie it up in knots trying to remain consistent with myself. \n\nI also tend to advocate strongly for what I think is the right idea. \u00a0Sometime I do a good job of it and other times, well, lets just say the result aren't pretty.\n\nNobody's perfect, right?\n\nHaving said that, nothing gets under my skin like hypocrisy. \u00a0I don't particularly care what you think is true as long as you stick to your beliefs. \u00a0Nor do I really care if you decide to change what you believe in. \u00a0I am not one of those people who think that you can never change your mind. \n\nBut what really drives me nuts is when someone pays lip service to an idea but then their actions show that they don't truly believe it. \u00a0It also drives me nuts when someone gets up on their high horse only to resort to mudslinging.\n\nTo use a very bad example, it is like when someone claims to be a good christian and then turns around and is the most intolerant person. \u00a0Its like saying I treat everyone with love and respect, except him, he's a homosexual and that's a sin.\n\nWow, how many bad stereotypes did I use just then? \u00a0If the PC police are out in force today I might be in trouble, but hopefully you got the point. \u00a0(And no slight to christians intended)\n\nYour statements and actions need to agree with each other. \n\nAnyway, all of this is a (slightly convoluted) prelude to put what follows. \u00a0For the context of what I am about to talk about (and my own less than ideal performance in this matter), see the comments here and here. \u00a0It might take you a while to read through the first set of comments, so I will wait.\n\nDone reading yet? \n\nOK, I am posting my final response to Kim's comment here because I think it is important to understand just why the autism community is divided and how nasty the divide can be. \u00a0That and Kim promised to delete my comment there (yeah, I got banned, again).\n\nThe community is divided because we all believe different things about autism. \u00a0I personally believe that is a profound medical disorder that needs to be cured. \u00a0Others believe that it is a natural part of who a person is. \u00a0And then there are the sixty other view points as well.\n\nBut we all want the same thing which is a better life for our loved ones who have autism. \u00a0And sometimes we get so invested in our own positions that we forget this.\n\nSince I am currently quite invested in my position (and decently annoyed), I am going to break one of my own rules and make my some personal comments against someone who I feel is hypocritical. \u00a0I really don't like to do this, but every once and while you just have to rant. \n\n(Wait, doesn't that make me a hypocrite too? \u00a0Note to self, write angry rant about angry rant, decry self as double hypocrite.)\n\nSo here you go, me at my best. \u00a0Kwombles, this is for you.\n\n~~~~\n\nAw shucks.\n\nThe problem, Kim, is the difference between actions and words. \u00a0You write that you believe something but then your follow up comments show that you don't.\n\nYou say \"I'm all inclusive\" but then follow it with something like \"I can't believe those dumbasses think that GI problems could be related to autism\", that you aren't interested in \"speculation\". \u00a0You say you prefer \"I don't knows\" and then immediately label everything that falls into the grey area where knowledge is lacking as \"woo\".\n\nYou say you welcome opinions and then immediately launch personal attacks on people who have different opinions. \u00a0I think that the PBS did a good job with their Autism Now series in spite of the fact that no person with autism was directly interviewed, you say that means I lack empathy for people with autism.\n\nYou say that you keep an open mind and then reject everything that isn't \"proven\" via science. \u00a0Science isn't black or white and it isn't about absolutes. \u00a0That goes double for soft sciences like medicine and quadruple for even softer sciences like psychology. \u00a0Science is about seeking knowledge, not about wielding isolated facts like a club to silence those you disagree with. \u00a0It certainly isn't about a question being \"asked and answered\".\n\nI think my favorite thing was how you like to promote this image of having an open discussion about ideas and then immediately turn around and label everyone who disagrees with you a dumbass.\n\n~~~\n\nIf you made it this far, let me ask you two questions. \n\nDoes the part about\u00a0hypocrisy make sense now? It seemed to be a little bit of a stretch when I was writing this so I wasn't sure if it made sense.\n\nAnd more importantly, do you think this post would come across a little less harsh if I posted some pictures of flowers in the middle of it?\n\nNo? \u00a0Ok, I didn't think that would come across too well for me.\n\nAhem, now that I am done being an ass and\u00a0feel better worse, lets get to the serious point.\n\n\nSerious voice\n\nThe above sorts of exchanges are all too common in the autism \"community\". \u00a0Everyone is guilty of doing it to a greater or lesser degree. \u00a0I know that even though I try and avoid it that I sometimes get roped into it as I did above.\n\nIt is very hard to read something that is the complete opposite of what you believe and to not comment angrily. \u00a0When it is a loved one or yourself that you are arguing for that gets even harder and accusations start flying at the drop of the hat.\n\nI think the thing that set this all off was the use of one word - \"offended\". \u00a0Kim was \"offended\" that the PBS show didn't include interviews of people with autism. \u00a0I thought the show was excellent as it was and assumed that Kim was attacking it simply because she didn't like what the show had to say about autism (p.s. for some of us, its called the reality of autism).\n\nBut, after listening to some of her reasons, I have to conceed that having an interview with a moderate functioning person with autism would have been a good addition. \u00a0However, that lack certainly didn't make the show \"offensive\".\n\nWait, who am I kidding. \u00a0I still think that she called it \"offensive\" because she didn't like the side of autism that it showed.\n\nThe show was a ground breaking look at what life can be like when your children has autism. \u00a0It reflected a lot of what our family life is like - the challenges, the worries, the \"other\" medical issues, the fighting for appropriate supports, and the stress for the future.\n\nAutism isn't just about the people who have autism - it changes the lives of EVERYONE in the in the family - and these other people have a right to have their own opinion of it without being told that it is somehow wrong or \"offensive\". \u00a0We should be able to talk about how\u00a0autism can truly fucking suck some of the time without people jumping in and telling us we shouldn't say bad things about autism.\n\nMaybe if the general public had a better picture of what autism can do to people who have autism as well as their families we would be able to get some better help. \u00a0Instead we have the autism community tearing itself apart with some of us saying \"wow, this sucks\" while the other side saying \"shhh, you can't say anything negative about autism because that would give the wrong impression\". \u00a0Its no wonder we can't get along.\n\nP.C. Editors Note : Saying that autism sucks is in no way, shape, or form implying that people who have autism are defective, broken, non-human, or any of the other typical BS that gets assumed. \u00a0A persons is a person, not a disability. \u00a0Nor is this a denial that people with autism have a right to speak on their behalf, either. \u00a0Nor is it saying that I don't love or accept my children for who they are.\n\nOops, a little bit of the rant managed to find its way into the serious section.\n\nSo if you go back to the \"offensive\" word you might see were the problem came in. \u00a0I didn't realize it myself until I stopped to think about my own reaction. \u00a0Show = Offensive, My Life =~ Show, My Life =~ Offensive.\n\nI am (mostly) sure that she didnt mean to imply that but it is an example of how easy it is to take offense at something without realizing why. \u00a0I still think she is way off base with the idea that the PBS show was \"offensive\" (did I mention I am stubborn too?) but perhaps I should have approached the subject differently.\n\nYou live, you learn, and you move on.\n\nSo, consider this a plea for civility from someone who is equally guilty of not always being civil.\n\nExcept you Qwibbler, you can bugger off.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2011/04/autism-now-ignoring-people-with-autism.html", "http://kwomblescountering.blogspot.com/2011/04/autism-now-divide-along-ideological.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2011/04/community-whats-community.html", "title": "\nCommunity, What's a Community?\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 9, 2010", "body": "\nPerhaps the most important unresolved question today about autism is whether it is becoming more common. \u00a0Are we in the midst of an epidemic of autism or are social forces just making it appear that way. \u00a0The answer to this question has the potential to reshape how we think about autism and how we should deal with it. \n\nIf the rate of autism is not increasing then our focus should be on providing services and finding new ways to help people with autism live more productive lives. \u00a0But, if the rate of autism is increasing, then our immediate concern should be figuring out why and putting a stop to it.\n\nWhile I don't think there is yet a clear answer to the overall question, I think it is safe to say that the number of children with a label of autism is increasing each year. \u00a0The problem is trying to figure out if this increase is real or not.\n\nSince I think the question is important, I decided to take some administrative prevalence data from studies that I was reading and put them together to see what they looked like. \u00a0The papers are both about autism prevalence in Montreal, Canada and both use yearly administrative data from school boards to estimate the prevalence of autism. \n\nThere are several problems with what I am going to talk about below, so let me get those out of the way. \u00a0First, the general disclaimers about administrative prevalence apply - so yes, I know that there are problems with using this type of data. \u00a0Second, the papers used two different school boards so there is a problem with combining the data like I am doing. \u00a0But, since both of the school boards are in the Montreal area and both used the same definition of autism, I think the comparison has some relevance.\n\nSo, without further ado, I give you the first chart. \u00a0The years on the bottom are the birth year of the children. \u00a0Keep in mind that the age of the children is going from the youngest on being on the right (2002) and the oldest being on the left (1987).\n\nAlthough, the birth years aren't really exact birth years but rather an approximation based on what grade the child was in. \u00a0So if a child was held back a grade or two as might be common for children with special needs (if that even happens in Montreal, I don't know), then the ages could be skewed. \n\nThe blue line represents the children from the first study and the green line represents the children from the second. \u00a0I indicated the point at which the children on both lines would have been eight years old. \u00a0That can be important because that is the age where we can assume that most children with autism have been recognized and given the appropriate label. \n\nThe red line is a three period moving average of both lines and represents the overall trend of the numbers.\n\n\n\n(Click for a larger version)\nI think there are a few notable things on this chart.\n\nFirst, I think the overall trend is clear. \u00a0Younger children are more likely to have a label of autism than older ones and the number of children with an autism label is growing by about ten percent per year.\n\nSecond, notice that the prevalence goes up as the children get younger up until age eight when it starts to fall? This is what I was talking about above where younger children might not yet have a diagnosis, so we can assume that the numbers before age eight are lower than they should be.\n\nThird, if you look at where the blue and green lines overlap, you might notice that the rate of autism in the children from the second study is about half of that from the earlier study. \u00a0For example, in 1993 the children in the earlier study were about ten years old and had a rate of about 71 per 10,000 but in the second study the children would have been 15 and had a rate of about 48 per 10,000.\n\nAs I have commented on\u00a0before,\u00a0it looks like there might be a substantial group of children who have a diagnosis of autism when they are younger but lose it as they get older. \u00a0This is the third independent data set where I have seen this relationship and I am starting to wonder about it. \u00a0If I am not mistaken, this rate is similar to the recovery rate that has been historically demonstrated for ABA.\n\nMoving on, another nice thing about these two studies is that they gave a breakdown between the different types of autism. \u00a0One of the theories about the increasing rate of autism is that, as time goes on, there are more milder cases being recognized and that is partially responsible for the increase. \u00a0But, as you can see on the chart below, that didn't happen here.\n\n\n\n(Click for a larger version)\nEven though the average prevalence increased between the two studies, the breakdown of the types of autism is essentially unchanged. \u00a0The majority of autism cases here are PDD-NOS, followed by classic autism, and finally Aspergers bring up the rear. \u00a0And, as I talked about before, CDD is extremely rare with only 1 child having that label.\n\nTake away from this what you will, I just found it to be interesting. \u00a0Or maybe this is a sign that I need to get a better hobby...\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.\u00a0Fombonne, Eric, Rita Zakarian, Andrew Bennett, Linyan Meng, and Diane McLean-Heywood. 2006. \u201cPervasive developmental disorders in Montreal, Quebec, Canada: prevalence and links with immunizations.\u201d Pediatrics 118:e139-50. \u00a0doi:\u00a010.1542/peds.2005-2993\n\n2.\u00a0Lazoff, Tamara, Lihong Zhong, Tania Piperni, and Eric Fombonne. 2010. \u201cPrevalence of pervasive developmental disorders among children at the english montreal school board.\u201d Canadian journal of psychiatry.

{"date": "Monday, November 23, 2009", "body": "\n\nFlickr Photo by \nTwenty Questions\nThe Chicago Tribune has yet another article today attacking the use of alternative medicine in treating autism. \u00a0While the journalists do have some valid points, the general tone of the articles are troubling. \u00a0There are alternative autism treatments that do have value and can be effective and lumping all alternative treatments into the junk category is simply dishonest.\n\nTo illustrate what I am talking about, I would like to (unfairly) highlight one passage from one of today's articles -\nIntravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG, consists of pooled antibodies separated from the plasma of multiple donors. Its serious side effects run from fevers and headaches to anaphylactic shock and meningitis. Blood is screened, but there is still a remote risk of contracting some diseases, including \"mad cow\" disease.\nSo, from this you would infer that IVIG is a dangerous procedure - one that could give you some horrible disease like \"mad cow\", right?\n\nWrong. \n\nI cannot find a single documented case of anyone ever contracting \"mad cow\" from IVIG. \u00a0As a matter of fact, the blood supplies used for IVIG are very well screened\u00a0to prevent this sort of thing from happening -\nBeing a human product made from blood donations by many people, IVIG can transmit disease. IVIG available in the United States is very carefully screened to be free of all known transmissible diseases, including HIV, hepatitis, malaria, syphilis, and many, many others. However, as with blood transfusions, there is always a risk that the product contains an infection that has not yet been recognized -- either because it is a previously unknown disease or because a donor's infection was so early that his or her blood gave no clues.\nTo put this in perspective, American blood products are the safest in the world. Very, very few people have every gotten an infection from IVIG. However, in the past 30 years, IVIG has been temporarily removed from the market three times -- each time to test it for a newly recognized disease (HIV, hepatitis C, \"mad-cow disease\") that had not been excluded before the IVIG had been released to the public. In fact, IVIG did not carry these diseases and no one actually got sick because of the having received IVIG. However, no one can guarantee that a new disease will not appear tomorrow that will not have been yet tested for.\nDon't take my word for it, look into the safety of IVIG for yourself. \u00a0And if you are thinking of using a treatment like this on your child, you should most\u00a0definitely research it yourself..\n\nThis is a perfect example of what is wrong with this sort of reporting. \u00a0Reasonable people can disagree about whether a particular treatment, such as IVIG, is appropriate, for treating autism. \u00a0But when you bring this sort of sensationalism into the picture - such as statements implying that IVIG is going to give your child mad cow - all you are left with is nonsense.\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/2499109314_d87ea0c15b_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/twenty_questions/2499109314//", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-autism-science-nov23,0,6519404,full.story", "http://www.hss.edu/conditions_14271.asp", "//www.google.com/search?q=Intravenous+immunoglobulin+safety"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/11/alternative-autism-treatments-and-mad.html", "title": "\nAlternative Autism Treatments and Mad Cow\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 28, 2009", "body": "\nAs I wrote about last time, a new survey has been released in the UK that seems to show that the rate of autism in adults is the same as in children - about 1 percent.  These results are being pushed as some sort of final confirmation that autism is as common in adults as in children.Yet, if you take the time to look at what the survey says, you will see that this result of 1 percent is rather flimsy and based in large part on statical models.  I am going to walk through the numbers and how this survey has put together to show what I am talking about.Here is the document that I will working from  -Autism Spectrum Disorders in adults living in households throughout EnglandA group of 13,171 households were selected from what was designed to be a representative population of people living in private households in England.  The researchers contacted each of these households and 7,461 of them agreed to participate.  From each household one person between the age of 16 and 74 was selected to be interviewed for the survey.  This is referred to as phase I as of the survey.These interviews took place between October 2006 and December 2007, which means that the latest birth year included in the survey should be 1990.  As a side note for those people who think this survey disproves any relation between MMR and autism - keep in mind that the MMR was introduced in the UK in 1988. So the youngest people included in the survey most likely had the MMR.Each person interviewed completed a series of short tests designed to determine the probability of Psychosis, ASD, Borderline personality disorder, or Antisocial personality disorder.  Those that scored the highest in any of the four area were selected to be screened in phase II.The autism section of this questionnaire has derived from the Autism Quotient screening test.  But, the standard 50 question version of the test that was not used.  The researchers thought that version was too long so they created their own version.  They cut down the number of questions to 20 and changed the wording of some of the questions.This custom test is one of the problems with this survey.  Since this test has not been validated by other researchers (or even used anywhere else) it is difficult to know how well it finds individuals with autism.  This becomes important later.The exact method used to select for phase II is somewhat confusing.  The simple way of looking at it is that the researchers converted each score in the four areas to a probability that this person would be selected for phase II.  They then picked the highest single probability and used this as the chance that the person would be selected.  Anyone who had a non-zero chance and agreed to participate in the second phase was included.  This resulted in  a set of 4,050 who were \"eligible\" for phase II.The scales used to set the probabilities were very non-linear.  For example, in the autism portion of the test the scores were grouped from 0-4 up to 12+.  If your score was 0-4 you had no chance of being included while if your score was 9 you had 2.9 percent change, 10 was a 25 percent chance, 11 a 61 percent change, and 12+ was a 100 percent chance.  There were similar scales for the other tests, and in general they worked the same way.From this group of 4,050 the researchers selected those with the highest probabilities of being selected.  This resulted in a group of 849 individuals that, out of the entire population, were MOST likely to have autism.  Out of this group 630 agree to participate and were tested in a few ways, the most important being the ADOS.  This test is considered to be the current \"gold standard\" for diagnosing autism.In this group of 630 the ADOS ultimately identified 19 individuals with autism.  So far, so good.  The only real problem is that custom selection test.If you look at the numbers at this point, the second phase of the survey covered the 8 percent of the population most likely to have autism and found about 3 percent of this group had autism.  When put this back into terms of the entire population (19 in 7,461) you find that the rate would be close to 0.25 percent (about 25 in 10,000).  This result is in line with past estimates of autism in adult populations.This is where the survey gets strange.  The researchers assert that, if they had examined the entire population of eligible for phase II, they would have found an additional 53 cases of autism.  This would mean there would be 72 cases in all and the rate would jump to just under 1 percent.  It is this assertion that is being widely quoted in the media.Yet this figure is based on a complex statistical extrapolation that makes a lot of assumptions about the data.  One of the main assumptions here is that anyone who had a score about 4 on the custom autism screening test had a non-zero chance of having autism.  The problem is that we have no idea how good of  a job this test does at finding people with autism.  Is a score of 4, 7, 9, or highest actually associated with autism? This question has no answer because this test has not been validated.  I am unsure that you can successfully extrapolate from a smaller group to a larger one when the properties of both groups are unknown.I also find it hard to believe that, even though the segment most likely to have autism was examined, there are supposed to be more than double the the number of cases found in the remaining population.  If I gave a group of children a known screening test, such as the MCHAT, and used the results to select the 8 percent most likely to have autism, I would expect that this subset would contain most, if not all, of the children with autism.  I would not think that there would be more than double the number of children in the other 92 percent of the population.  The other major problem with this survey is that we are not given any data about the age of the individuals with autism.  All that we are told is that there were not enough individuals found to group into \"narrow bands of 10 years\", but, when combined into three broad bands of 20-30 years, there was a \"slight downward\" trend.  The end result is that we have no real information about the ages of these individuals so it is entirely possible that they are mostly found at younger ages.  But what we cannot say from what we know is that autism is evenly distributed across adults of all ages - we lack the data.  But again, this is being claimed in the media.The bottom line here is that you have to be careful when looking at the results of surveys or studies.  It is way too easy to get the results that you want using statistics.(P.S. If you made it all the way down to the bottom of this post you deserve an award)\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ic.nhs.uk/webfiles/publications/mental%20health/mental%20health%20surveys/Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_in_adults_living_in_households_throughout_England_Report_from_the_Adult_Psychiatric_Morbidity_Survey_2007.pdf", "http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/mmr.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Spectrum_Quotient", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Diagnostic_Observation_Schedule"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/09/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics.html", "title": "\nLies, damned lies, and statistics\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, April 2, 2009", "body": "\nDoC has another post up at Left Brain Right Brain talking about the recent HBOT study.  Unlike his prior review where he attempted to provide some real facts about the study this time he leaves that behind for the realm of pure conjecture.I can see from the title that he intends this to be a balanced review (much like the title of this post):Mild hyperbaric therapy for autism - Shh!\u2026don\u2019t say it\u2019s expensiveHis claims in the post seem to boil down to the following points:Simple O2 therapy raises the blood O2 level as much as HBOT does and is effective as HBOT.The authors had a disclosed financial conflict of interest therefore they have an interest in creating a long term revenue stream, possibly from insurance payments.Simple O2 therapy is much cheaper, equally effective treatment.And, \u00a0the most damning point, the lead author made the point that he did the study \u201cHoping to prove that it works.\u201dSo there you go, more reasons why the study was no good. \u00a0So lets start at the top, DoC asserts that simple O2 therapy is equally effective to HBOT. \u00a0I am sure being the the diligent person he is that he has a good source for that claim. \u00a0Lets see, he tags that claim with footnote 5 -5 Hyperbarics and Hypotheseshttp://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=60Uhm, that would be something that he wrote on his blog. \u00a0Lets look at that page on his site, are there any references over there? \u00a0Nope. \u00a0So it is true because he says it is true. \u00a0Ok....As an aside, who uses footnotes on a web page? \u00a0Most people will just throw in a link since that is more direct - especially for a reference to another site. \u00a0Methinks it is an attempt to appear more scientific.The second point is that the authors have a financial interest in the outcomes of the study because they sell this sort of treatment. \u00a0That point is true and fair enough \u00a0- the authors do have and did disclose their financial conflict of interest. \u00a0And they do apparently make money from this treatment, so keep this in mind when reading it.However, this criticism equally\u00a0applies to almost every study of medical treatments out there. \u00a0Do you think if a drug company pays for a study on a drug they developed that they aren't looking for it to become a source of revenue?\u00a0Next is the point that simple O2 is cheaper than HBOT. \u00a0The only source that he provides for this point is again footnote 5 - the reference back to his site. \u00a0Even still, this does seem like a fair statement. \u00a0However, since the part about O2 being as effective as HBOT remains in doubt this is point is irrelevant.As for the last point about the authors trying to prove that it works, let me see how I can nicely put is...ISN'T THAT THE ENTIRE POINT OF DOING A STUDY???????\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//www.blogger.com/a%20href=%22http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/9/21/abstract", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2041"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/another-bad-review.html", "title": "\nAnother bad review\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 7, 2009", "body": "\nThe nice people over at Right Brain Left Brain are at it again with yet another post about why the recent study on HBOT is all wrong. \u00a0The title of this one is :More Hot Air about HBOTI couldn't have put it better myself. \u00a0This time they appear to have handed the torch, so to speak, to\u00a0Prometheus who normally writes on his own blog. \u00a0I have to say, this post is better written that the earlier ones\u00a0but still falls short of the mark.I think it is worth reiterating at this point what I have said before about this study. \u00a0It is a step in the right direction but the results are still preliminary and need to be verified by further studies.So with that in mind lets look at what the \"problems\" are this time:The six centers that were involved in the study are small locations with primarily one doctor and make money from selling HBOT services.Well, this one is true at least on its face. \u00a0The centers in the study are smaller locations that have HBOT equipment available (and it isn't cheap) - so surprise, surprise, they actually use it.It would have been better if the centers involved in the study were all part of a large organization that happened to have HBOT equipment on hand and was willing to conduct a study with it. \u00a0However, this is an experimental treatment for autism - until there is a good amount of evidence that this is going to work then I don't think it is likely that large organizations are going to get involved.Given that larger organizations aren't going to be involved (yet), that leaves smaller groups. \u00a0So with that in mind if you are looking for smaller groups with HBOT equipment they are likely to have it because maybe they use it as part of their business? \u00a0Therefore it is not surprising that small centers would sell services using the equipment that they have purchased.As to the one doctor point, look at the small centers in your area like MRI clinics. \u00a0How many doctors are on staff at those places? \u00a0A quick check around my area showed that one or two is normal.[T]he decision to include one treatment subject who only completed nine sessions was curious. Why they included this subject and not any of the other three treatment subjects and three control subjects who also failed to complete the entire course of the study is concerning. The smart thing \u2013 and the proper response \u2013 would have been to drop this subject from analysis.To answer this problem I think we should look at the participants that dropped out to see if the reason become apparent.  Since the full text of the study is available I think that would be a good place to refer to:In the treatment group, two children dropped out of the study prior to beginning any treatments due to an illness (one with otitis media, the other with bronchitis). Another child dropped out before finishing one full treatment due to anxiety in both the child and the parent.So in the treatment group the three that dropped out did not complete any treatments.\u00a0In the control group, two children dropped out of the study prior to beginning any treatments (one because of a death in the family, the other because of the time commitment). One child dropped out prior to finishing one full treatment due to parental claustrophobia.So in the control group three of the four that dropped\u00a0out did not complete any treatments. \u00a0This is the same criteria as to why children were excluded from the treatment group.The last one, the one that was included from the treatment group was different -\u00a0\"one child was removed from the study after nine sessions because asthma symptoms worsened\". \u00a0This child is clearly different than then other six.So that is the answer to why the others were excluded, now, why were this one child's results included?this child's scores performed at time of drop-out showed mild improvements in behavior (as separately ranked by both the physician and the parents) and these scores were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The inclusion or exclusion of this child's scores had no significant effect on the statistical analysis.Or in other words it didn't change the outcome one way or the other. \u00a0The scores on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) are not linear and you should not do math on them.The issue here is that the authors took the CGI scores (1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse) and subtracted 4 from the number to change to scale to -3 to 3. \u00a0 Also these scores aren't supposed to be real numbers so\u00a0the difference between \"very much improved\" and \"much improved\" isn't the same as \"no change\" and \"minimally improved\". \u00a0So in numeric terms even though the difference might always be 1 he is saying that in some cases the relative difference might be more like 1.5 to 0.8.Unfortunately for\u00a0Prometheus \u00a0the decision to subject a fixed number from all of the scores does nothing except change the number from one pseudo number to another pseudo number. \u00a0Since each number is translated from the old scale to the new scale in exactly the same way and since the relative values of the numbers don't change this change is completely benign and meaningless. \u00a0This simple subtraction is not going to change any of the results of the analysis.As to whether the scale itself is linear I would point out that the CGI\u00a0scale has been in use 30+\u00a0years\u00a0so I would think that the representation would have been found to be adequate by now.Prometheus also raises the point that :This may seem like nit-picking, but it is a serious concern. Imagine, if you will, that the numbers were replaced by colors. Is the difference between green and orange twice the difference between orange and red? If half of a population of birds are blue and the other half are yellow, is the \u201caverage\u201d bird green? The simple fact is that it is not appropriate to treat these \u201cscores\u201d as though they were real numbers, to be added, subtracted and averaged.This may seem like nit-picking but the analogy comparing these scores to colors is completely wrong. \u00a0There is an implicit ranking in these scores that is not present in colors. \u00a0For example, a rating of 1 (very much improved)\u00a0is \"better\" than a rating of 2 (much improved). \u00a0There is no corresponding concept in colors - green is not \"better\" than red.So you could argue that the relative change between the ratings isn't always the same but you really can't say that there is no relation between the two. \u00a0And as I pointed out this scale has been in use for a long time so I think this point is moot.The statistics are wrongI have a rule for myself - whenever I don't really know the subject matter that well I tend not to comment. \u00a0The different types of statistics and when they apply and when they don't is one of those areas that I don't know that well, so I won't spend any time rebutting the specifics of what\u00a0Prometheus \u00a0is saying. \u00a0The only thing I will point out here is that I assume that a journal has reviewers checking the statistical methods that are used in studies and would not let anything that was a misapplication of statistics be published. \u00a0So my first reaction is this criticism is not valid. \u00a0My second reaction is that if you have any doubts, find someone you trust who really understands this stuff and ask for their opinion - don't rely on a random blogger's opinion of something like this (mine included).The other issue is that there is no discussion of why HBOT is thought to be superior to providing the same partial pressure of oxygen at room pressureThey also didn't discuss why breathing heavily or why breathing in the southern hemisphere wouldn't work equally well either. \u00a0For that matter, they completely ignored the fact that the same benefits could have been had by standing at sea level while hoping on one leg.This is the same thing that DoC said in his second post on the topic and the answer is still that it is irrelevant. \u00a0You can add on all of the extra things that you think the authors should have covered, but that doesn't make it a relevant criticism.\u00a0This study was not about simple O2 vs\u00a0HBOT\u00a0vs normal environment. \u00a0This study was about\u00a0HBOT\u00a0vs an almost normal environment - that was the defined scope and that was what was presented.So finally, in closing ....I went back and read what I wrote above and I guess it is on the longer side. \u00a0I am not sure how many of you are still with me here, but let me close with a simple piece of advice to LBRB -\u00a0Give it a rest already.\u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/9/21/abstract", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2055", "http://photoninthedarkness.com/", "http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/9/21", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_Global_Impression"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/discredit-hbot-take-iii.html", "title": "\nDiscredit HBOT, Take III\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, February 19, 2009", "body": "\nI ran across this rant written by Kev from Left Brain Right Brain today talking about authority and who has it.  And more importantly, who wants it.  I suggest you go read the entire post, but here are the highlights.You have to understand. This is not about scientific truth \u2013 or even truth at all \u2013 to these people. Its about winning and its about pushing their antivaccine beliefs as fast and far as they can. ...To these people science has no authority. Doctors have no authority. The Special Masters have no authority. The only people who have authority \u2013 real authority \u2013 can probably be counted on the fingers of one hand. ...But more than that, scientists and doctors need to get online and blog, get on Twitter and use them. Talk to people in their own language. Screw decorum. Ask people who\u2019ve been using their blogs to support vaccines for years what to do and how to do it....This needs to happen because we\u2019ve already lost one generation of kids to their loony parents. The loony parents who only recognise the authority of celebs, authors and each other in nests of email lists and blogs.The first thought I had after reading all this was that it is just another anti-anti-vaccine rant.    But then I thought about it some more and came to the conclusion that that there was some truth in what he was saying.  The question I was left with is who is believed and why are they believed?Kev from LBRB will have you believe that anyone who doubts vaccines and their safety is anti-vaccine and anti-science.  This is obviously not true.  These are no longer the Bush years were you are with us or against us - you should be able to question something without instantly being put in the against camp.  The obvious retort here is the \"asked and answered\" line.  The problem is that science does not work that way.  When anyone starts talking about \"scientific truth\" you know that they are trying to sell you something - there is no such thing as \"truth\" in science.  If think you know the \"scientific truth\" of something, I can guarantee you two things.  First, you are wrong.  Second, you have closed your mind to new ideas.But why do some people have authority and others not?  I think the answer is simple. Trust.So why have people lost their trust of the medical establishment?  There was a time when it was thought that doctors had all of the answers and were far wiser than the average person.  And for a while that was true.  But I believe the reason for that was the information they had.  As long as that information was restricted and difficult to obtain this system worked; doctors really did know a lot more than the average person could hope to.Then came the information revolution and tools like the internet.  Now, anyone can do a google search and learn reliable facts about most health topics. Now, when you go talk to your doctor you can have an idea what it is that you are talking about. The mystery of arcane knowledge is gone.  What you are left with is a person like anyone else, someone who perhaps has a better understanding of medicine in general but not necessarily of the area that you are interested in.  So the implicit trust that was once there is gone.  Doctors now have to earn their trust and reputation just like anyone else.So how can the trust be reestablished?Kev would have you think that scientists and doctors should launch what is in essence a PR campaign using new media to get the word out.  What he wants it for there to be many copies Dr Paul Offit.I think that is the worst idea possible.  I think the way to regain the authority and the trust is to actually listen to what people have to say and stop assuming that you have all of the answers.  If you are a doctor and a parent is telling you about problems that they think were caused by vaccinations, take their concerns seriously and listen to what they say.  Don't instantly start telling them about how that can't happen or how all of the evidence says that it can't.  Don't treat it as an opportunity to \"educate\" them about the \"scientific truth\" of the matter.  Listen to what parents have to say and address them as equals.  Because more and more the knowledge level of the average parent is going up.Whatever you do, don't say (as Dr Offit does) \"studies show that in theory, healthy infants could safely get up to 10,000 vaccines at once\" because that is such a line of BS that it isn't even funny.  If one shot has the potential to do enough damage  that (in some rare cases) it can kill a child, what would 10 or even 100 do?  On some level Offit might be right with that a normal, health child's immune system can handle a large amount at a time but I seriously doubt that you could safely administer even 10 different shots at once.  It took less than that to cause Hannah Polling to develop autism.  So lines like that do nothing but insult the people you are talking to and make them not want to trust you.So how to restore the trust and authority. If you really want to go the way of new media, how about using the model of Dr Sears instead of the awful Offit method.   On his blog Dr Sears takes the time to intelligently write about all sides of the issue before giving what his opinion is.  If you don't happen to agree, he suggests alternatives that could be tried to get to a mutually desirable end.  If you post comments to his blog, he will even give you an honest answer.  At no time does he pretend that he has all of the answers or that a question should not even be considered.Maybe Dr \"PR\" Offit could learn from his example.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1896", "http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/03/24/autism.vaccines/index.html", "http://www.askdrsears.com/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/02/authority.html", "title": "\nAuthority\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, May 17, 2009", "body": "\nOver at Newsweek there is an article by Claudia Kalb on Ari Ne'eman and neurodiversity. \u00a0 It is a one sided slanted view of the world of autism according to how Ari Ne'eman sees it. \u00a0According to Mr. Ne'eman, autism is not a \"medical mystery that needs solving\" but is \"a different way of being\" and should be \"accepted by society\". \u00a0He is pushing for accommodations in the classroom and supports to help adults live independently. \u00a0He is strongly opposed to a \"cure\" for autism. \u00a0\u00a0He believes that \"we're having a national conversation about autism without the voices of people who should be at the center of that conversation\".\u00a0Apparently he hasn't gotten the memo that a large number of people, possibly a silent majority, are unable to talk. \u00a0Yet here we have a person who says that they are on the spectrum and are \u00a0speaking for all people with autism - including those who can't communicate with the outside world. \u00a0 Maybe he is telepathic and that is how he knows what all of the other people with autism want.To be fair I should mention that Mr Ne'eman has a diagnosis of Asperger's rather than autism.  As pointed out by Harold Doherty in a recent post these two conditions are different. \u00a0 Aspergers does not have a disruption in communication skills and tends to be less severe than other forms of autism.I don't think the difference is really that important. \u00a0Mr.\u00a0Ne'eman is full of it. \u00a0I am not sure whether he truly has a form of autism, the description of him from the Newsweek article makes me wonder \u00a0-\u00a0It's spring in Washington, and Ari Ne'e-man, with his navy suit and leather brief-case on wheels, is in between his usual flurry of meetings. Ne'eman is a master networker, a guy you'd think was born in a campaign office and bred in the halls of the Capitol. He's fluent in policy-speak and interacts seamlessly with high-level officials (...) and inquisitive reporters alike. He's formal but sociable and has a well-timed sense of humor.This doesn't sound like many cases of \u00a0autism I have run across. \u00a0But in reality his exact malfunction is irrelevant, the important part is that he is not representative of what children with autism are dealing with and the problems that they face. \u00a0The author of the piece makes a big deal about how Mr\u00a0Ne'eman\u00a0has a problem with velvet -\u00a0His father used to drive a car that had fuzzy velvet-like cushioning, and it made Ne'eman crazy to sit in it. \"I'd wince because I'd think about how it would feel to get that under your fingernails,\" he says. I think I see him shudder at the 't .If that is the worst sensory issue that he has then cry me a river. \u00a0I would take that any day of the week over what my daughters are having to deal with.The\u00a0only reason that this sort of story is printed is because it casts a favorable light on what is increasing becoming a crisis. \u00a0People don't want to read about the problems with autism, they want to think that people with autism are just a little quirky and are all secretly little Einsteins who will solve all of the worlds problems. \u00a0There are other adults on the spectrum who have a different view of what autism is yet their story is never told. \u00a0Take for example Jonathan Mitchell's post\u00a0in which he publishes his letter to the editors of Newsweek asking for a chance to tell a different side of the story. \u00a0Anyone think that Newsweek will publish an article giving his perspective?Autism is a profound disorder that causes massive life long difficulties for its victims. \u00a0It is not something\u00a0that should that should be ignored, \"accepted\", or left untreated. \u00a0Yet if the advocates of neurodiversity get their way that is exactly what will happen.Publications like Newsweek should not be giving coverage to crazy talk about something as serious as autism.\u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/id/197813", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/05/aris-omission-autistic-disorder-and.html", "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/05/asking-newsweek-magazine-for-equal-time.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/05/neurodiversity-stop-insanity.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity : Stop the Insanity\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 11, 2009", "body": "\nIn my previous post I talked about the negative publicity that the Gluten-free Casein-free (GFCF) diet was getting and the need for more research into whether an elimination diet like the GFCF can work.  I also said that I am of opinion that it does work - even though there is not sufficient evidence to say that from a scientific or medical point of view.I thought I would take this opportunity to explain why I think the diet can work.  I will warn you in advance, my reasons are based on my experiences and not on any scientific study.  If you are the sort of person who thinks that there can be absolutely no value in such statements, you would want to stop reading now.  Having said that, I think my experiences are less common than most and I do have some objective data behind my statements.For those of you who don't know, I have three daughters who have autism.  My older two daughters are identical twins so they are among the 60-90% of identical twins who both develop autism.  As a fun fact, the change of having identical twins with autism happen to you are relatively small, something like 1 in 50,000.  Lucky us.The twins have been on the the GFCF diet for over three years now and have very good results from it.  My younger daughter, while her diet is somewhat being limited by living in the same house, is not on the diet and does not seem to need it.  So the following applies only to the twins, my youngest did not have have any of the issues listed below.This is going to be a little long, so I am going to break this post up into a few parts.  This part is  going to address the reasons why we tried the GFCF diet in the first place and later parts will go into what effects the diet had and some of the arguments against the diet.So, the reason that the twins are on the GFCF diet is simple - a developmental pediatrician recommended it. He recommended it for the several reasons -First, both girls had a history of having of frequent loose stools.  We did not experience the explosions that are referred to other other sites but, let me put it this way, things did not have the shape and consistency that they should (think applesauce).  We also had problems with constant diaper rashes and redness. Second, both girls constantly had bloated stomachs.  They were not badly distended to the point were their regular pediatrician would have taken steps to address the problem, but it was noticeable.  Third, up until the twins were 16 months old, neither girl was able to sleep for any length of time on their backs.  They had to sleep in a bouncer chair, a car seat, or something of the sort to sleep for more than 30 minutes.  Once they could turn over they started sleeping on  their stomachs and would sleep for longer but if they ended up on their backs they would quickly wake up crying.Forth, both girls craved milk and other dairy products such as cheese.  To put this into context, both girls were somewhat picky eaters and we couldn't get them to even try solid food until 16 months or so - they just weren't interested in what we were eating and refused to try what we gave them.  But, they would happily drink bottles and bottles of milk, and once they did start on solids, would happily eat as much cheese as we would give them.  They also loved eating tofu - how many infants do you know crave tofu?Firth, the twins had problems with eczema.  Twin A constantly had it all over her body while twin B would get large patches of it every couple of weeks.  This is one of the very few areas where they were different, and we still don't know why.As an aside, I think it is worth noting that we had talked about all of the above with the the twins' pediatrician and most of the time received only non-committal responses.  We did get some advice on the eczema - put skin lotion on it.  I really doubt that any of the above is in either girls medical charts, even though we mentioned each of the concerns several times.  This is the reason that I am skeptical of the Mayo Clinic study that relied on the children's medical charts - my children had some of the symptoms yet I don't think it would be on their charts.  Our pediatrician is actually very familiar with autism and its related problems.  They are the one who first picked up on the it in the twins and referred us for an evaluation at 15 months.  So if a pediatrician who is on top of all of the issues and can recognize autism that early wouldn't chart the non-specific GI complaints, who would?The last and most probably most important reason for the diet was food intolerance tests that the development pediatrician ordered.  As part of his initial consultation for the twins he went over their history, examined them, and then ordered blood tests to check for food intolerance to gluten, casein, and soy.  I am not going to go into detail about these tests but they are fairly standard things - they look for antibodies in the blood that would indicate an intolerance to a specific type of food.  The tests gave back a numerical score in the following sensitivity groups  - less than 10, undetectable or very low; 10 to 15, low; 15-20, moderate; 20 to 50, high; 50-100 very high; over 100, extremely high.  If you scored in the bottom group, as most people would, you had nothing to worry about.  As you went up the scale the the intolerance became worse and worse.Both girls had similar results and the results were interesting.  For gluten and soy both girls showed a very mild intolerance (low group) but for casein , well, let me put it this way, you know the saying \"off the chart\"?  That is exactly what their scores were, off the chart, coming in at over 100 in the extremely high group.Based on all of the above the we took them off of casein, then gluten, and soy. In the next part I will talk about the results of the diet.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//4.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/Sn9MzK7G9HI/AAAAAAAAAAU/7bsdsOKrWLE/s1600-h/GFCF.jpg", "http://www.webmd.com/allergies/guide/eczema"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/08/why-we-tried-gfcf-diet.html", "title": "\nWhy we tried the GFCF diet\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 3, 2010", "body": "\nEvidence-based medicine is the idea that all medical decisions should be based on the best scientific evidence that is available. \u00a0The concept is really very straightforward.  You take the results that research has provided, rank them according to the quality of the information, and use that ranked evidence to decide what the best course of treatment is.\n\nThe important thing to note here is that a treatment doesn't have to be proven beyond all possible doubts in every possible scenario before it can be used - it just has to be shown to be applicable to the case at hand and have enough evidence that says it is more likely than not to work.\n\nIn a way, the name says it all.  You base your medical decision on what has been shown to work, in other words evidence-based.\n\nAs easy as that concept is, some people seem not to understand it, especially when it comes to autism.  As it stands now, there are very few treatments that have been shown to be effective in helping people with autism.  There are many different things that are used in and attempt to help people (especially children)\u00a0with autism \u00a0but most of these things do not have a solid evidence base behind them.  I am not saying that these treatments can't or don't work but rather that they fall outside what is considered evidence-based medicine - they would be considered alternative medicine.\n\nOne of the few treatments for autism that does have a solid evidence base is\u00a0ABA\u00a0(Applied Behavior Analysis). \u00a0 While it is not guaranteed to work for everyone, the available evidence shows that it can be an\u00a0effective tool to help teach children with autism and is almost universally recommended.\n\nThat is, with the exception of the universe of Michelle Dawson. \u00a0As I have pointed out before, Ms Dawson has a real problem with ABA.  She seems to have an almost irrational obsession with proving that ABA is somehow unethical or immoral to use on children with autism.  She would tell you that she has ethical concerns and that there is very little evidence that ABA works. \u00a0However, Ms Dawson is almost universally alone in her opinion.\n\nWith that in mind, consider a letter that Ms Dawson wrote to The Lancet in\u00a0rebuttal\u00a0to a study1 published late last year.  In this letter2, Ms Dawson attacks the evidence cited in the study to support the assertion that ABA is \"highly effective\".  She dismisses three of the cited works as not studying ABA and says that another didn't study what it says it did. \u00a0This leaves, in her opinion, only one small study as the entire evidence base for ABA which leads to the conclusion that -\n\"the claims made by Levy and colleagues, with respect to intensive ABA-based programmes for autistic children, have no basis\u2014either in the review they cite or in any other published study.\"Open and shut case - ABA isn't evidence based - so says Michelle Dawson.  We should all stop using it now and rejoice that we have seen the error of our ways, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThe authors of the study responded3 to the letter.  They say\u00a0that Ms Dawson is correct about the one cited reference - it did not do what it said it did.  However, they \"respectfully disagree\" with her assertions about the other three studies and point out that they did in-fact study ABA.  They go out to point out that there were five additional studies that they did not cite directly because of space limitations and that brings the total to \"only\" nine randomized trials that support the effectiveness of ABA.\n\nRemember when I mentioned above the quality of the information?  Randomized trials (when done correctly) are considered some of the best evidence available.  To put this into perspective, most issues are considered \"proven\" when they have two or three good randomized trials. \u00a0Here there are nine supporting the conclusion that ABA is effective. And, as the authors go on to point out -\nIn addition to these trials, a host of other studies that used rigorous and sometimes not-so-rigorous quasi-experimental designs point to the efficacy of ABA-based methods, such as discrete trial training, pivotal response training, and teaching in functional routines, either alone or in combination, in improving adaptive behaviour, language, and in some cases socialisation of children with autism.In other words, the response to Michelle Dawson's letter was an unequivocal \"what do you mean there is no evidence?\" \u00a0Kinda makes you wonder what Ms Dawson is talking about.  Perhaps she should reconsider the evidence.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, the text of the letters are freely available on The Lancet's site (free registration required), go read them for yourself.\n\n\nReferences\n\n1: Levy SE, Mandell DS, Schultz RT.

{"date": "Wednesday, February 3, 2010", "body": "\n\nFlickr Photo by sflovestoryWhen I think of scientific research, a picture comes to mind of a person (women or man) standing in a laboratory performing some sort of experiment and carefully recording empirical results documenting the outcome of the experiment.  They then sit down with the data and examine it with an impartial eye to see if it supports their theory.  \n\nI know this is somewhat of a hokey image but to me it speaks of what a researcher should be - impartial, unbiased and disinterested.  Science is meant to be a search for the truth (or as close to it as we can get) and we should not be so attached to an idea that we are unwilling to go in a new direction when the data takes up there.  \n\nAnd yet, I am seeing more and more that this process is being subverted by the groups that are sponsoring the scientists.  I am not saying that this being done intentionally or maliciously, but rather it seems to be a byproduct of the system of the funding.  Think about it, if a corporation gives you money to fund research and you publish research that is critical of their products or industry, how likely are they to give you additional funding in the future?  And what is a corporation going to do with results that are not favorable?\n\nConsider the two following reviews.\n\nThe first one1, published this month the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, reviewed 43 published studies and looked at the relation between cigarette smoking and Alzheimer's.  The review of each study not only considered the quality of the data and outcome but also the affiliations of the authors of those studies.  \n\nOf the 43 studies, 11 of them had affiliations with the tobacco industry.  The studies that were affiliated with the tobacco industry showed that cigarette smoking did not increase the chance of developing Alzheimer's and might even help prevent it.  On the other hand, the studies that were not affiliated with the tobacco industry showed that it was likely that smoking greatly increased the chance of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nIt is not unusual for studies to show conflicting results, that happens all the time.  What is unusual (or perhaps not) is for the results to align so closely with a funding source.  So when it comes to the risks of smoking, are you likely to believe a researcher receiving funding from the tobacco industry, or one that is not?\n\nThe second study2 (thanks Maria), published last year in BMJ, looked at 259 studies of the effectiveness of the flu shot.  The researchers were looking for relations between study quality, take home message, and funding source. \u00a0Ignoring the conclusions about the flu shot's effectiveness (better studies said less effective), the researchers found a relationship between industry funding and higher quality journals.\n\nIf a study was funded by industry it had a better chance of being published in prestigious journals where it would, presumably, be cited more and have a larger impact on future work.  Or in other words, work sponsored by industry is more visible.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder what would have happened if any of the studies showed results that were not as favorable.  I would be willing to bet that they would be published in a less favorable journal, if at all.\n\nThere have been countless other examples of misdeeds recently, from ghost writing to journal companies publishing entire journals that are little more than paid advertisements.   When you put all of the facts together, I think it becomes clear that there is a problem.\n\nThe problem is not that corporations are attempting to achieve their goals - that is what they are supposed to do. \u00a0If they weren't trying to sell something and make money, they wouldn't be in business. \u00a0No, the problem is the mismatch between what science is supposed to achieve and what a company is trying to do. \u00a0Corporate sponsorship is tainting scientific research and biasing the results toward corporate goals.\n\nSo remember, the next time you hear about some exciting bit of science, consider whether it is a legitimate scientific result or a message from the\u00a0sponsors.\n\n1: Cataldo JK, Prochaska JJ, Glantz SA.

{"date": "Monday, March 8, 2010", "body": "\n\nFlickr Photo by dbkingA vaccine injury case is being heard by the US Supreme Court and it has the potential to change how the vaccine program works in this country. The primary issue in the case is whether vaccine makers can be sued directly in civil court for defects in their their products.\n\nAs matters stand now, if a person thinks they have been injured by a covered vaccine, they are required to file a claim with the National Vaccine Injury Program, otherwise known as vaccine court.  This is a special venue that was created by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 and was meant to provide a no-fault, swift, flexible, and less adversarial alternative to the traditional court system.\n\nUnder this system, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) takes the place of the vaccine manufacturer as the counter party and responds to claims of injury from vaccine. \u00a0A claim is handled in one of two ways.  If an injury occurs within a certain amount of time after the vaccine is administered and is on the\u00a0Vaccine Injury Table, then the assumption is that the vaccine caused the injury and it is up to HHS to prove that it wasn't. \u00a0If an injury does not fall on this table, then it is up to the person filing the claim to prove that the injury was more likely than not caused by the vaccine.  The exact method of proving this varies, but normally requires showing a biologically plausible mechanism whereby the vaccine could cause the injury as well as showing a relationship between the vaccine being administered and the injury.\n\nIf all goes well, a person will file a claim, the claim will be quickly processed by the vaccine court, and, assuming the injury was found to be caused by the vaccine, the person will be compensated for their injury.  But what happens if a person is not satisfied with their award or if the court rules against them? \u00a0The ruling can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims but if the appeal is rejected, or if the person so chooses, they can take their claim to civil court and file suit directly against the vaccine manufacturer.\n\nAt least, that's the theory.  In practice I don't think anyone has ever successfully brought a claim against a vaccine manufacturer in civil court because of how the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act has been interpreted by the courts. \u00a0This brings us to the current case.\n\nThe case before the Supreme Court is Bruesewitz v. Wyeth and at issue is whether vaccine manufacturers are liable for defects in their products or failing to take action to improve the safety of their products.  From SCOTUSBlog - \n\nTitle: Bruesewitz v. Wyeth \nDocket: 09-152\nIssue: Whether Section 22(b)(1) of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 \u2014 which expressly preempts certain design defect claims against vaccine manufacturers \u201cif the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warning\u201d \u2014 preempts all vaccine design defect claims, regardless whether the vaccine\u2019s side effects were unavoidable.\nOpinion below (3d Circuit)\nPetition for certiorari\nBrief in opposition\nSupplemental brief addressed to the amicus brief of the United States in American Home Products Corp. v. Ferrari\nAmicus brief of the National Vaccine Information Center\nIn this case, the parent say that their daughter Hannah suffered a series of seizures after receiving the third dose of the DTP vaccine in 1992.  She was later diagnosed as having a residual seizure disorder and developmental delay.  In April 1995, her parents filed a claim with the vaccine court alleging that it was the DTP vaccine that caused the injury and asking for compensation.\n\nOne month prior to their filling, HHS removed \"residual seizure disorder\" from the vaccine injury table for DTP which shifted the burden of proof from HHS to the family.  When the case was finally heard seven years later, in 2002, the special master hearing the case rejected the parents' claims because they failed to prove that the DTP was responsible for their daughter's injuries.\n\nHannah's parents rejected the finding and filed suit in civil court on the grounds that the vaccine maker knew that the vaccine was problematic, knew that the specific vaccine lot caused many injuries (a \"hot\" lot), and had a safer vaccine available yet failed to bring it to market.  The vaccine manufacturer, Wyeth, asked for, and was granted, summary judgment on the grounds that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act granted the company immunity from being sued for defects in their vaccine.\n\nThe parents appealed the ruling to the Third Circuit court where the summary judgment against them was upheld, which brings us to the case before the Supreme Court.  \n\nThe issue before the court is whether Congress, when it passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act,\u00a0intended\u00a0to grant vaccine manufacturers blanket immunity from being sued for defects in their products.  Was the vaccine court meant to be the sole way of recovering damages from injuries caused by vaccines?\n\nBe aware that I\u00a0am oversimplifying the issue somewhat and there are other issues that I am not mentioning. \u00a0The documents in the case are well over a hundred pages long and go into greater detail than I am able. \u00a0If you are interested in the full details, I suggest reading the briefs that are referenced above.\n\nI would like to highlight one other aspect of the case though. \u00a0There is another case, Am. Home Prods. Corp v. Ferrari, where the\u00a0Georgia \u00a0Supreme Court ruled in a different way from the 3rd Circuit. \u00a0In this case, the Georgia court ruled that vaccine manufacturers do not have automatic immunity and that each case must be decided on its own merits. \n\nThe Georgia ruling only applies in the state of Georgia, and the case was dismissed by the plaintiffs before it could be appealed to the US Supreme Court so it is unclear what the precedent of this ruling is. \u00a0But\u00a0the US Supreme Court may have decided, in part, to hear the current case to resolve the\u00a0difference of opinion between the Georgia Supreme Court and the 3rd Circuit.\n\nDepending on how the US Supreme Court decides the case, there could be far reaching consequences. \n\nThe first possibility, and the least satisfying, would be if the court ruled only on the specifics of the current case and did not address the broader issue.  If this happens, the split between the 3rd Circuit and the Georgia Supreme Court would stand and the underlying issue would remain unresolved. \n\nThe next possibility is that the court will find that vaccine manufacturers cannot be sued for defects in their products in civil court and that the vaccine court is the only venue for such claims.  This would mean that vaccine\u00a0manufacturers\u00a0would effectively have no liability for damages caused by their products since they have no part in the vaccine court nor do they pay the damage awards themselves - these are paid for by a surcharge on every shot.  \n\nI don't like this option and I\u00a0think that most people can agree that removing the possibility of liability from a six billion dollar industry is not a very good idea.  One of the checks that keeps companies honest is the threat of lawsuits and if those are removed I think the results would not be good. \u00a0And when you combine the greater potential for problems with the fact that\u00a0vaccines are increasingly becoming\u00a0mandatory, I think you can see that there would be an inevitable backlash against the system.\n\nThe other possibility is problematic as well.  If the court rules that vaccine makers can be liable for defects in their products, then there will be a huge number of lawsuits filed.  Remember the 5,000 or so claims in the autism omnibus that are still pending in vaccine court? \u00a0If vaccine manufacturers are liable, I would be willing to bet that all of these claims would jump to civil court and\u00a0create a large mess for these companies.\n\nOn the flip side here, it would be interesting to see what the discovery process, something that is not available in vaccine court, would turn up from these companies.  I am positive that they have researched the autism-vaccine connection and it would be most interesting to see what they have found.\n\nRegardless of the decision, one thing seems certain. \u00a0The current vaccine court system does not appear to be working all that well. \u00a0Claims are not handled in a quick manner (there is a backlog of about 7,000 cases) and the table of vaccine injuries is not being maintained well. \n\nBut, more importantly, it seems that some of the participants in the process are more interested in protecting the vaccine program overall than they are in awarding compensation to children injured by their shots. \u00a0That is how we get results like the one in the Bailey Banks case where the special master came up with the absurd notion of a \"non-autistic\" form of PDD-NOS to avoid saying that a vaccine lead to autism (hint PDD-NOS is, by definition, a form of autism).\n\nI honestly can't say which way this case is going to go, but it should prove to be interesting.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm1.static.flickr.com/23/37621686_0dcd0e12e5_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootbearwdc/", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/", "http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/table.htm", "http://www.scotusblog.com/2010/03/petitions-to-watch-conference-of-3-5-10/", "http://www.supremecourtus.gov/docket/09-152.htm", "http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073794p.pdf", "http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/09-152_pet.pdf", "http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/09-152_bio.pdf", "http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/09-152_Supplemental-Brief-Addressed-to-the-Brief-for-the-United-States-as-Amicus-Curiae-Filed-in-American-Home-Prods-Corp..pdf", "http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/09-152_Amicus-brief-of-the-National-Vaccine-Information-Center.pdf"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/03/vaccine-injury-at-us-supreme-court.html", "title": "\nVaccine injury at the US Supreme Court\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 6, 2009", "body": "\n\nVaccines are one of the greatest medical accomplishment of past century and are perfectly safe .... or they are responsible for causing an epidemic of autism. \u00a0Most people stand on one side or the other in this debate with very few in the middle. \n\nThe reality of the situation is not so cut and dry. \u00a0Vaccines are a life saving invention that are mostly safe and, at the same time, can (and do) cause side effects. \u00a0The side effects run the gamut from the benign injection site swelling to the more serious conditions like\u00a0Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\u00a0right up to (in rare circumstances) very serious ones like death. \n\nThis situation is not anything out of the ordinary - almost everything in life involves some sort of trade off between risks and rewards. \u00a0 I would have to say that most people are willing\u00a0to accept risks when they understand what they are.\u00a0\u00a0Take for example the fact that millions choose to get behind the wheel of the car every single day even though tens of thousands die each year in fatal car crashes. \u00a0People know they there is a chance of serious injury or death, but they are willing to accept the risks. \u00a0 I believe the part of the reason for this is that the risks are openly acknowledged - when you get behind the wheel of a car you know what to expect.\n\nThe problem with vaccines is that an honest dialog about risks and rewards is all but impossible. \u00a0The current party line by the medical community and the media is that vaccines are perfectly safe and effective\u00a0but any rational person knows that statement is not completely true. \u00a0I don't know about you, but I get very tired of people saying things that they know are not the true. \u00a0Yes, vaccines are (mostly) safe but, at the same time, they have to be honest about the reality of the situation and not deny the risks. \n\nAs a case in point, look at author Michael Specter. \u00a0Mr Specter wrote a book called Denialism\u00a0that is about \"How irrational thinking hinders scientific progress, harms the planet, and threatens our lifes\". I would agree with the basic premise here - too often people are irrational about important subjects and don't take the time to understand what it is that they are talking about. \u00a0Mr. Specter proved this himself on a recent appearance on The Daily Show where he made the\u00a0following\u00a0statement\u00a0(at about 1:00 in the video) -\nThere is flu virus going around that half of americans adults say they won't vaccinate themselves or their children against. \u00a062 million people have received this vaccination and zero people have been shown to have been killed or seriously injured. \u00a0So zero - 62 milllion, thousands dead without the vaccination, it doesn't seem like a difficult calculation to do.\nThis is a perfect example of skewing reality for the sake of proving a point. \u00a0Mr Specter is correct - this isn't a difficult calculation. \u00a0What I have a hard time understanding is why he exaggerated his numbers and denied the risks involved with the H1N1 shot.\n\nLets start with the assertion that 62 million people have been vaccinated against H1N1. \u00a0A quick check at the CDC\u00a0shows that number is wrong -\nDuring October 5--November 20, a total of 46.2 million doses of H1N1 vaccines (11.3 million LAMV and 34.9 million MIV doses) and 98.9 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines were distributed to U.S states and territories\nThe 46.2 million is the number of doses - not the number of people who received the vaccine. \u00a0Keep in mind that for some groups (children), the recommendations call for 2 doses of the vaccine. \u00a0And I would assume that there are still some vaccine doses that have not been administered yet. \n\nAs a result, I would guess that a more realistic number of vaccinated people would be 40 million. \u00a0But for the sake of argument, lets assume for a moment that a full\u00a0sixty two million people have been vaccinated against H1N1. Would that have mean that thousands of lives were saved?\n\nTo answer this question, we first have to know how common the flu is and then what the mortality rate is. \u00a0According to estimates from CDC,\u00a0around\u00a07 percent of the population is expected to catch the flu and approximately 18 out of every 100,000 was expected to die from the flu or\u00a0complications from the flu.\n\nThe next question to ask is how effective the flu vaccine is at protecting against the flu. \u00a0There are no real figures available for the H1N1 vaccine but the regular flu vaccine is though to be 70 to 80 percent effective (when it matches the circulating strain of the flu). \u00a0For the sake of argument, lets assume that 75 percent of the people would have been protected.\n\nPutting all of these numbers together - out of the 62 million, about 4.5 million people would be expected to catch the flu. \u00a0Out of that group about 800 people would have been expected to die. \u00a0Now assuming that the vaccine would have prevented 75 percent of these cases, we are left with about six hundred lives saved.\n\nWhile it would be a good thing to save\u00a0six hundred lives, six hundred is much less than the \"thousands\" claimed by Mr. Specter. \u00a0And when you adjust the sixty two down to the more likely 40, what you would find is the number saved would be under 400.\n\nTo put these numbers in perspective, the CDC puts the\u00a0(confirmed) death toll for all types of flu this season (Aug 30 - Nov 28th) stands at 1,336. \u00a0If you use the same estimates figures from above, you would find that the confirmed death toll would likely be 250 higher if people were not vaccinated. \n\nAs for the second claim, the one that zero people have been shown to have had a serious reaction to the vaccine, another trip to the CDC puts that claim to rest -\nThrough November 24, VAERS received 3,783 reports of adverse events after receipt of H1N1 vaccine, of which 204 were categorized as serious, and 4,672 reports after receipt of seasonal influenza vaccines, of which 283 were serious. [Snip]\nVAERS received 13 reports of deaths occurring after receipt of H1N1 vaccine; three deaths occurred after receipt of LAMV and 10 after receipt of MIV (Table 2). In nine of these deaths, significant underlying illness (including illness that might be indication for vaccination) was present; one death resulted from a motor vehicle crash, and the remaining three deaths await review of final autopsy results or death certificates by CDC.\nThese numbers are very rough and just because something was reported to VAERS doesn't mean it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. \u00a0But, I think it is reasonable to assume that a good number of these adverse effects were actually related to the vaccine and that puts the figure well above zero.\n\nIf Mr. Specter had limited his claims to the facts,\u00a0his point would be better received. Perhaps he could have said hundreds of lives were saved and mostly mild side effects have been seen. \u00a0But whatever the reason, he did not stick to the facts - he\u00a0exaggerated the rewards and denied the risks.\n\nThis approach is all too common when talking about vaccines and therein lies the reason that the autism-vaccine wars aren't going to end anytime soon.\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SrmRHcqkJ-I/AAAAAAAAADM/0cAcTUk5WG8/s1600-h/vac.png", "http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/table.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome", "http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspx", "http://www.amazon.com/Denialism-Irrational-Thinking-Scientific-Threatens/dp/1594202303", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/04/jon-stewart-interviews-ne_n_379985.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e1204a1.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates_2009_h1n1.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e1204a1.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/12/denialism-or-realism.html", "title": "\nDenialism or Realism?\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 6, 2009", "body": "\nPicture from NIHOne of the more popular arguments against searching for a cure for autism is equating the search for a cure with the desire to kill unborn children.The reasoning goes that since autism is genetic and immutable the only way to \"cure\" it is to prevent it from happening in the first place.  So when anyone talks about a cure what they really are talking about is developing a prenatal test to detect autism so that these children can be aborted.You know, like happens with Down syndrome.  It is estimated that, right or wrong, up to 90 percent of fetuses with Down's are aborted - although I believe this number is starting to fall as the prognosis for these individuals is improving.This line of reasoning is also used to argue against doing research into the genetics of autism.  Because you know, if we can find the genes responsible we can create a test and, well, I think you get the idea.There is only one problem with this idea - OK, I lie, there are many problems with it - but one in particular that I want to point out.Prenatal tests already exist for a form of autism called Rett's syndrome.  Rett's syndrome is one of the five conditions that make up what is called the autism spectrum.  It is the only one that has a known genetic cause.  And, according to the National Institute of Health there is a prenatal test available -Rett syndrome affects one in every 10,000 to 15,000 live female births. It occurs in all racial and ethnic groups worldwide. Prenatal testing is available for families with an affected daughter who has an identified MECP2 mutationSo here you have the ideal battleground for the Neurodiversity movement - a form of autism that has a proven genetic cause and a prenatal test that can be used to abort the fetus that have this condition.  Get ready for the outcry over this because this is going to be big....Wait, is that the sound of crickets that I hear?  Why hasn't the ND movement picked this up as a talking point?  This test has been around for long enough for people to notice so why are there no outraged protests over this form of prenatal testing?  These people are their fellow \"aspies\", why won't they stick up for them?  They claim to be dedicated to preventing this from happening, so why don't they try to stop this? Perhaps this group that claims to speak for all of autism actually doesn't have many with Rett's in their ranks.Or maybe it is because Rett's is a very serious condition that can have any number of \"side\" effects such as gastrointestinal disorders, inability to walk, spontaneous brainstem dysfunction, heart problems, seizures, and a shortened life span?  Could it be because if you are male and have Rett's you are unlikely to survive for more than a few months?In all seriousness, this really isn't a joking matter.  Rett's and Down's are serious condition and I don't know for certain what I would do if I were placed in a situation where I had to make a choice to abort a child. I would not give up any of children for the world nor do I think I could choose abortion except under the most extreme circumstances.  And at the same time I can understand where people come from when they make that choice.But, and this is the important part, trying to cure autism is definitely not the same as wanting to abort unborn children.EDITED : Reposting this because it for some reason when I initially posted it it appeared as of a month ago.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/images/ency/fullsize/9575.jpg", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/9575.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rett_syndrome", "http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/rett/detail_rett.htm#118363277"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/08/prenatal-testing-for-autism-is-here.html", "title": "\nPrenatal testing for Autism is here\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 26, 2010", "body": "\nAs covered on Autism's Gadfly, there was an article published in the January-February issue of Autism Asperger's Digest that is called \"Neurodiversity : A Balanced Opinion\". \n\nIf you have ever had any questions about what the moderate members of the neurodiversity movement believe and stand for, you will want to read this article.  The text is available from GRAP's web site.\n\nIf you ever doubted that neurodiversity can be harmful, you should read this article.  \n\nI am not going to go into the issues in depth, but I wanted to to highlight certain parts of the article.\n\nThe author is Nick Dubin, an adult in his early thirties who was diagnosed with Aspergers six years ago, when he was 27.  I do not doubt that Mr Dubin has this diagnosis, but I think it is important to note who he is and what he has accomplished.  If you look at his bio on the GRASP site, you can see that he is very well educated -\nDr. Dubin has a Bachelor's degree in communications from Oakland University, a Masters degree in special education from the University of Detroit Mercy and a Specialist degree from the Michigan School of Professional Psychology, where he recently earned his Doctorate in Psychologyand quite accomplished, especially for one so young -\nDr. Dubin authored three books and produced three DVD's, all relating to the autism spectrum. Dubin has been featured in Hour Detroit Magazine, CBS Detroit, Signature Magazine, Radio Disney, The Detroit News, National Public Radio and on Fox 2 (Detroit). Dubin also contributes to the Autism-Asperger Digest as a collumnist and has presented at over 80 conferences and seminars, including as the keynote speaker for the Autism Society of Michigan's fall conference and as a two time presenter at the Autism Society of America's national conference. He also serves on the board of directors of the Asperger Society of Michigan.I don't know about you, but I, like most parents whose children have autism, am worried about my children being able to express themselves or (hopefully) live independently. \u00a0I hope that one day they will be able to attend college and have successful lives. \n\nI don't think Mr Dubin's experiences are normal for a person with autism - or even for most \"typical' adults. \u00a0I believe this sets the tone for the rest of the article, a tone which I believe can be summed up as -\n\nNight, meet day. \u00a0Day, pretend night doesn't exist.\n\nSo onto the text. \u00a0What did Mr Dubin have to say about his experience with diagnosed with autism?\nWhen I was first diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s at the age of 27, I was despondent  and terrified. I thought being on the autism spectrum only involved deficiencies  and negative traits, and that I would be relegated \u2013 without my consent \u2013 to a  future of things I could never hope to accomplish. After interfacing with  several autistic advocacy organizations (I now serve on the board of directors  of one such group) my perceptions towards Asperger\u2019s shifted and I began to  recognize and own my own strengths. This new perspective gave me the courage to  write books and articles about being an adult on the spectrum, produce DVDs, and  become a national speaker.Yes, because when my children were diagnosed, they quickly interfaced with advocacy organizations and started writing books on the subject. \u00a0Oh wait, they couldn't talk. \u00a0But I am sure that they will feel inspired to write books and produce DVDs, as soon as we can communicate with them well enough to explain the concepts.\n\nWhat does Mr Dubin have to say about curing autism?\nThat I have been able to accept having Asperger\u2019s, and even view it in a positive light, makes me personally reject the need for a cure. First, I believe \u201ccuring autism\u201d is an illusory goal, an effort to eradicate something that is not yet even remotely understood or adequately defined. Second, to advocate cure would have increased my shame in having Asperger\u2019s to the point of paralysis.So instead of looking to \"cure\" his condition, he decides to write books about it.  How very appropriate of him. Wait, how many other conditions do people have where they feel shame at advocating for a cure?\n\nWhat does he have to say about to people who don't like this rejection of a cure?\nIn theory, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a chink in the armor of neurodiversity\u2019s philosophy. Who would argue with the notion that society should take responsibility for how it treats some of its most vulnerable but creative citizens? Or that people with autism have inherent gifts and should be respected by others?Yupe, he is certainly right, no chinks in the armor. It is a good thing that he is encouraging society to take care of people who write books, produce DVDs and appear on television to promote their take on autism. \u00a0You know, the most vulnerable but creative citizens. \u00a0I thought for a minute there he might be talking about helping children with autism, but the neurodiversity movement discourages that.\n\nWhat about the idea that autism is an disability and not just caused by societal norms?\nNeurodiverse supporters counter by saying it is society that needs to learn to recognize and accommodate these differences, without having to label them as being defective or deficient. While I do not think anyone will argue with the fact that autism and Asperger\u2019s produces some disabling consequences for the person who has it, the hotly debated question remains: what responsibility should society shoulder for this being the case?He must be right - it is society at large that is to blame for my children having autism, right?  So if \"society\" as a whole would just accept the fact that many children with autism have problems with communication, social skills, and restricted interests, then autism is no longer a problem, right?\n\nMaybe it isn't quite so easy.\n\nAnd, my favorite quote from the whole article - who does this gentleman idolize in the neurodiversity movement?\n[Michael John Carley] serves as a true role model for people of all ages on the spectrum. His character and actions exude tolerance and respect and his efforts to serve as a bridge of understanding to those who are not on the spectrum are admirable.Oh, you mean the gentleman who was quoted on NPR as saying -\nBut the change is going to be hard for some people with Asperger\u2019s, says Michael John Carley, executive director of the Global and Regional Asperger Syndrome Partnership in New York and author of Asperger\u2019s From the Inside Out. \u201cI personally am probably going to have a very hard time calling myself autistic,\u201d says Carley, who was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s years ago.Many people with Asperger\u2019s take pride in a diagnosis that probably describes some major historical figures, including Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison, Carley says. Under the new system, those people would represent just one extreme of a spectrum. On the other extreme is \u201csomebody who might have to wear adult diapers and maybe a head-restraining device. This is very hard for us to swallow,\u201d he says.Mr Dubin is completely right. \u00a0Michael John Carley \"exudes\" tolerance and respect and is very accepting of differences. \u00a0I think he is about the perfect model of neurodiversity, especially what is wrong with it.\n\nAnd he wonders why parents like me would have a problem with the movement.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/02/another-article-on-neurodiversity.html", "http://autismdigest.netsam.com/ourlatestissue/tabid/59/Default.aspx", "http://www.grasp.org/media/Neuro.ASDig.pdf", "http://www.grasp.org/ab_who.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/neurodiversity-manifesto-by-nick-dubin.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity : A Manifesto by Nick Dubin\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 2, 2009", "body": "\nIf you look at the about autism page on the site for the Autism Science Foundation you are treated to what the foundation feels is important to know about autism.  Given that this is a \"science\" organization you would think that the information would be the best that science has to offer but that doesn't seem to be the case.It starts out with the standard boilerplate about the three core deficits and the fact that autism is more common in boys than girls.  Then there is the language about how we know autism is a genetic condition because of twin studies and blah, blah, blah.Then we hit this part about the different types of autism -There are five Autism Spectrum Disorders, sometimes called Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD):PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Delay - Not Otherwise Specified).Autism (sometimes referred to as Classic Autism, Early Infantile Autism, Childhood Autism, or Autistic Disorder)Asperger SyndromeRett SyndromeChildhood Disintegrative DisorderNotice the word that I highlighted - delay.  The term PDD-NOS has a very specific meaning and it isn't \"pervasive development delay\" - it means \"pervasive development disorder\".  I thought that was a very curious mistake to make until I kept reading.Continuing on the page you find the a section on how autism is diagnosed with the normal lip service to early diagnosis and intervention and a section on how common autism is with the typical reference to the trinity of denial.Then you get to the meat of the page - what the ASD feels are appropriate treatments for autism and what they feel are inappropriate.  In the appropriate or \"evidence-based\" treatments you find - Applied behavior analysis (ABA)Occupational therapySpeech therapyPhysical therapyIn the inappropriate section entitled \"Beware of Non-Evidence-Based Treatments\" you find the following -ChelationLupron protocolHyperbaric oxygen therapyGluten Free-Casein Free (GFCF) DietStem cell therapyThis inappropriate list is an strange grab bag of alternative treatments.  None of these treatments except HBOT have much in the way of any evidence either for or against them - HBOT actually has some evidence showing that it does work.  And I know from my own personal experience that the GFCF can make a huge difference in children with autism.  But I digress.But getting back to the usage of \"delay\" - I found this section on recovery in the \"appropriate treatment\" section -Some service providers, celebrities, parent groups and medical practitioners may talk about \u201crecovery\u201d from autism. \u201cRecovery\u201d is a subjective term, and what one family calls \"recovery\" may be different for others. Parents should be skeptical of any health care provider holding out \"recovery\" as an option, as it often leads to expensive and ineffective treatments that can burden families with needless debt. Remember, autism is pervasive developmental delay, which means children will continue to develop, learn, gain skills and adapt as they age. Sometimes children lose their diagnosis altogether, leading to claims of recovery. Keep in mind that symptoms of autism change as a child develops.And now the use of the word \"delay\" makes sense.  The ASF appears to be pushing an unconventional view of how autism progresses in an attempt to defuse the whole \"recovery\" debate.  They are saying, in effect, that even if a treatment appears to \"recover\" a child that it probably wasn't the treatment but rather the normal growth and development of the child that was responsible.  After all autism is a \"delay\" and not a \"disorder\" - and that which  is delayed may still come to pass when something that is disordered might not.What they are saying is true, after a fashion.  Almost every child with autism will progress on their own as they mature and grow older and the symptoms of autism will change over time.  But that is a long way from the the implication that alternative treatments have no effect and precious few children with \"lose their diagnosis altogether\" simply as a function of aging.  This view of autism as a delay is not supported by science and is certainly not in line the stated mission of the ASF - \"Our organization adheres to rigorous scientific standards and values\".

{"date": "Friday, March 5, 2010", "body": "\nThe Chicago Tribune is at it again, pushing yet another article in its \"unbiased\" coverage of alternative treatments for autism in its \"Dubious Medicine\" series of articles. \n\nThe title of the story, \"Doctors sued over \u2018dangerous\u2019 autism treatment\", tells you what you are supposed to think. \u00a0It tells you that some \"dubious\" doctors are being sued for their unethical and experimental treatments of autism. \u00a0The story is gripping from the get go - a father, James Coman, is suing two doctors and a testing company, alleging that they harmed his son with \"dangerous and unnecessary experimental treatments.\" \n\nBut as I read the story, I realized that some of the plot just didn't make sense. \u00a0If these treatments were so horrendous and caused such harm to his son, why did he agree to them in the first place? \u00a0Did the father initially agree to these treatments only to change his mind later?\n\nI soon found part of the answer included in the last paragraph of the story -\nThe treatments Coman's son received are also the subject of a bitter divorce and custody battle between Coman and his wife. She has been a proponent of the therapies for the boy, according to divorce court records.Oh.\n\nNow the story is starting to make a little sense. \u00a0Divorces, even the run of the mill ones, can get a little dicey and here we have one that is being described as \"bitter\". \u00a0Anyone see War of the Roses?\n\nBut even considering the divorce, things still don't quite add up. \u00a0If you read the story, you would see that this isn't the first time that this family's struggles have appeared in the Chicago Tribune. \u00a0The father's side of the story and his beef with the doctors has been covered twice\u00a0before. \u00a0And, according to these stories, this isn't the father's first action against these doctors either. \u00a0He claims to have filed complaints with the state medical boards sometime last year. \u00a0I guess that didn't work out for him so now he is suing instead.\n\nWhy is the Chicago Tribune giving so much coverage to this \"bitter divorce\" and the father's complaints against the doctors? \u00a0If these treatments were so horrible and these doctors as terrible as the suit makes them out to be, wouldn't other parents be lining up to complain?\n\nIn his lawsuit against the doctors, Mr Coman alleges that his son \"suffered bodily injury\" and \"has sustained injury to his health, strength, activity, and cognitive functioning, all of which injuries have caused, and continue to cause, A.J. mental, physical, and nervous pain and suffering.\" \u00a0And yet, in the earlier articles, he describes his son as \"a playful, funny and outgoing 7-year-old\". \n\nHe also say that his son \"would have progressed developmentally without any medical treatments.\"\n\nOh. \u00a0He's one of those. \n\nI don't know if Mr Coman was only talking about \"bio\"-medical treatments or he is talking about other \"medical\" treatments such as ABA, but I do know one thing for certain. \u00a0It is impossible to know where his son would be at today without treatment. \u00a0To be in line with what his court filings have said, Mr Coman must believe that his son would be further along than he is if he had not been treated. \u00a0And yet, he describes him as \"playful, funny, and outgoing\". \u00a0Does that sounds like the average 7 year old with autism to you?\n\nThen there is the matter of when these treatments started. \u00a0In his complaint, Mr Coman says that they started almost six years ago, in April 2004, when his son was two years old. \u00a0Has he been fighting his wife about this for six years now? \u00a0Or, as I suspect, have his concerns only surfaced after he and his wife started getting a divorce? \u00a0If Mr Coman though these treatments were hurting his son, why didn't he act sooner?\n\nI think the real story here is much simpler than the Chicago Tribune is making it out to be. \u00a0I think the title of the story should have been something like \"Divorce gets messy; father sues doctors\" - that would have been closer to what appears to be going on. \u00a0Having a child with autism can stress even strongest marriages, it is no wonder than it could cause one to end badly.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-autism-storygallery,0,6581479.storygallery", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-met-autism-therapy-lawsuit-20100304,0,5271734.story", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Roses_(film)", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-autism-treatments-nov22,0,7095563,full.story", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/la-he-autism-main7-2009dec07,0,3934605,full.story"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/03/dan-doctors-sued-aka-divorce-gets-messy.html", "title": "\nDAN doctors sued - aka divorce gets messy\n"},

{"date": "Monday, February 23, 2009", "body": "\nWell, this is one post on autism that I never expected to see:Life-Changing Benefits of DiagnosisAccoring to Dora Raymaker at the autism.change.org site getting a diagnosis of autism isn't all bad.So often a diagnosis anywhere on the autism spectrum is discussed in apocalyptic terms. The horror. The doom. Hearts sink and mouths go dry. That, however, was not my experience. Nor does it seem a common experience for people on the spectrum themselves.The terms of \"horror\" and \"doom\" are appropriate for what the parents of newly diagnosed child do often feel.  Especially if your children are very young.  To deny that this is the case or to suggest that these are not valid feelings to be having is very harmful to the parents and very destructive to the process of dealing with a diagnosis.  If you are the typical parent you have daydreams of who your child will be when they grow up, what college they might attend, them getting married and having a family of their own.  When you receive the diagnosis that future is torn away and replaced by a huge uncertainty about the future.  Instead of wondering what college they will go to you wonder if that will ever be able to live unassisted.  Instead of wondering what profession they might choose you are left wondering if they will be able to support themselves.  Instead of wondering who they will marry you just hope they will be able to have friends of their own.Of course it might not be that bad - they could be high functioning enough to be able  to function in society on their own or with minimal supports.  They could go on to write blogs about how you should be happy to receive the diagnosis.  The future is not determined and who you child is has not been written yet.But still, what you expected and hoped for your child is torn away and replaced with nothing but fear for what the future might hold and the desperate hope that it will turn out OK.The post continues:There are enormous internal, personal benefits to diagnosis. For the autistic individual, self-awareness is one of the necessary keys to effective self-advocacy and to empowerment. Without properly understanding your needs, you can't get them met.If you lack the communication skills to even be able to understand what someone is saying to you how could you possibly even understand let alone be in a position to be self-aware of what the diagnosis means for you?There are benefits to parents too--especially those parents who were wrongly blamed (at times by medical professionals even) for their child's behavior. Parents who maybe too felt guilt for doing something \"wrong\" that lead to their child's struggles. Parents who, given better understanding, are also now empowered to be more effective advocates for their kids, and better able to accept themselves as good parents.Ah, so we parents should feel better because now we know that we didn't \"cause\" our children's struggles.  Except, on the other hand we did cause them because autism is \"caused\" by genetics or being too old of a father or whatever the latest \"pure genetic\" theory of the day is.I think Ms Raymaker forgets the fact that the majority of the people being diagnosed with autism currently are children.  And while she does have a point that for the smaller group that are adults or have been misdiagnosed in the past that getting the appropriate diagnosis can be a good thing that does nothing to address the fact that the rest the group doesn't share this benefit. I think if she wanted to be a true advocate for people with autism she would stop living in a fantasy world and come live in the real world where a diagnosis of autism is not a \"life-changing benefit\".  It is a life changing event and not normally a positive one for those involved.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.change.org/blog/view/life-changing_benefits_of_diagnosis"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/02/congratulations-youve-got-autism.html", "title": "\nCongratulations, you've got Autism!\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, February 11, 2009", "body": "\nOver at the autism.change.org site, which seems to be quickly becoming home base for a group of neurodiversity bloggers, we have yet another guest author invited to post.  This time we are treated to the writing of Estee Klar who is perhaps best known for her Joy of Autism blog.Call me silly but the title of the her blog strikes me as an oxymoron.  You want to talk about the joy of children, sure.  The joy that your child brings to you, that works too.  But the joy of autism?  Really?  Your child has autism and that fact brings you joy?  Anyway...The post is supposedly about how autism is viewed in Canada.  It starts out by talking about the initial diagnosis process - any parent whose child has autism has been there.  But then we get to this passage:Whatever the entry point into the foray of autism, what lies ahead is largely dictated here in Canada of what the government dictates is the proper autism \u201cintervention.\u201d Based on the notion that autism is a disease or something \u201cwrong,\u201d the government of Canada continues to endorse an intervention promoted by a series of parents in Canada.That statement just floors me.  If you have a condition that is defined in something  called the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" then here's a hint:  There is something wrong.She continues This government-stamped intervention is Applied Behavioural Analysis or ABI (Applied Behavioural Intervention). Based on a history of viewing cognitive disability as an illness, a human deficiency, and of treating Canadians with cognitive disabilities as less than human in our own history, the Canadian Government has continued to base its autism policy not in the social model, but in this deficiency or medical modelHere's another hint, by definition autism is a medical condition.  If you define it to be something other than what the word means we are no longer talking about the same thing.Notice if you will the subtle association between ABA and treating people as \"less than human\".  As I have written about before this is a common ND theme.And there is still moreAs long as we continue to view autistic people as requiring an intervention to make them \u201cbetter,\u201d our system can never claim that it accepts diverse citizensPeople with autism, especially young children, certainly do require intervention to help then learn the skills that are required to survive in the world.  But I guess little things like being able to dress yourself, learning not to injure yourself, understanding that you can't run out in the street directly in front of a car, or really silly things like learning how to talk aren't really making someone \"better\".  If we all just accept our \"diverse citizens\" and possible sing a verse or two of kumbaya everything will be perfectly fine.Acceptance will not help your child be able to survive in the world on their own.  If that were all it took then there would have never been a need to institutionalize people with autism.  That was the common response to autism only a short few decades - do we really want to drop the interventions that have given people with autism a chance of being able to function on their own in society?  Oh wait, that wasn't very accepting of me.  Of course there are many high profile people out there with autism who are doing fine in living in society and many of them have not had the interventions that are being talked about.  However, I think they are the exception rather than the rule and that the silent majority could have benefited from the extra support and help.The thing I just don't get it is why people like Ms Klar go around spouting this nonsense.  She obviously loves her child and wants the best for him.  And I am assuming that she is doing what she thinks is best for him.  But what possible reason can there be for trying to reclassify what is a medical condition as just a \"difference\" or for trying to say that there is nothing \"wrong\" in autism.I just don't get it.Edited to add : Apparently I am not the only one who doesn't like the post.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://joyofautism.blogspot.com/", "http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_canadian_autism_climate_too_cold_for_comfort_introduction", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/02/changeorg-and-estee-klar-misrepresent.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/02/there-is-something-wrong-with.html", "title": "\nThere is something wrong with neurodiversity\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, July 18, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the more popular yet controversial treatments with autism is the gluten free/casein free diet.  There are a large number of parents who try this diet with their children and many report good results.  Yet mainstream medicine tends to laugh at the idea of a dietary change helping something like autism.Very little research was been done that looks at how well the diet works and even less still has been done looking at the reasons that a diet might be effective.  However, there are theories about why the diet works, one of which is called the leaky gut theory.  The basic idea in this theory is that a child's intestine is more permeable than it should be and lets all sorts of things into the body that should not be there.  One of the things that can get through partially broken down parts of wheat and milk proteins (gluten and casein) and that can lead to a set of problems.  But that is a subject for another day.One of the things that I never fully understood was how or why this condition could develop in the first place - what could cause something like this and why can't the body repair itself.  I ran across a study the other day in Science Daily that might help answer this question.  It seems that there is an ingredient in breast milk that helps protect and repair the gut in newborns -The lining of a newborn's gut is particularly vulnerable to damage as it has never been exposed to food or drink. ...The researchers found small amounts of PSTI in all the samples of breast milk they tested but it was seven times more concentrated in colostrum samples. The ingredient was not found in formula milk.The researchers examined the effects of PSTI on human intestinal cells in the lab. When they inflicted damage to the cells they found that PSTI stimulated the cells to move across the damaged area forming a natural protective 'plaster'. They also found that PSTI could prevent further damage by stopping the cells of the intestine from self-destructing. Additional research suggests that PSTI could reduce damage by 75 per cent.So it is possible that breastfeeding can help prevent and repair damage to a newborn's intestinal track which might be able to help prevent something like a leaky gut from getting started.  This is obviously not something that \"causes\" autism  but perhaps it can help mitigate some of the damage that autism can cause.Please note that I am not saying that going the formula route is a terrible thing, after all, we did it with our twin daughters.  The twins are on the GFCF diet and have had large improvements because of it.  But the funny thing is that our youngest daughter does not have the same dietary issues that her sisters did.  She was breast feed and has never had the bowel issues, or eczema, or abnormalities in her blood work.  So maybe there is something to this protect factor.Just food for thought.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismweb.com/diet.htm", "http://www.autism.com/families/diet/leakygut.htm", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090629200754.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/07/breast-milk-and-leaky-gut.html", "title": "\nBreast Milk and a Leaky Gut\n"},

The study is (long title) : Gastrointestinal symptoms in a sample of children with pervasive developmental disorders.I have not read the full text of the study as of yet, but from the abstract it talks about GI symptoms in a population of 172 children with autism.  In this sample there were \"thirty nine (22.7%) were positive for GI problems, primarily constipation and diarrhea\".  There were no differences on some measures of adaptive functioning between the groups but the group with GI problems \"showed greater symptom severity on measures of irritability, anxiety, and social withdrawal. Those with GI problems were also less likely to respond to treatment.\"The problem that is immediately apparent is that there isn't any information about how common GI problems are in a sample of normal children.  However I would imagine that if 22% of \"normal\" children had persistent GI issues that it would have been reported by now.I find this study interesting because it documents that there is an identifiable  subset of children with autism that have GI issues.  If there is a GI issue then it is possible that some of the symptoms of autism can be corrected by addressing the dietary issues, especially if the group with GI issues show greater symptom severity as eluded to by the abstract.But there are those that do not accept that this is the case or say that it is unrelated to the autism.  For example, the self-styled \"Autism Diva\" frequently argued that there was no relation as in this sequence of comments:The GFCF diet should NOT be tried on all autistic kids and all kids with behavior issues. This is just bizarre and has not basis in fact.If a child is getting sick after eating wheat or dairy, then fine, change the diet, but that does nothing to the autism. If you read through the comments you will see a lot of talk against the relation between autism and diet/GI issues.  Now I did partially instigate this sequence of comments but this is fairly representative of a normal exchange. I do know that my daughters both had GI issues and that their stomaches were bloated consistently for the first two years of their lives.  Once we changed their diet the issues diminished and then faded (although there are still some issues occasionally).  As a side benefit their attention, ability to focus, and eye contact went up as we restricted their diet.

{"date": "Thursday, February 26, 2009", "body": "\nThere is a new case that has hit the public awareness concerning one Bailey Banks who \"suffered a seizure and Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis ('ADEM'), which led to Pervasive Developmental Delay 'PDD'.\"  His case was somewhat recently (2007) decided by the special masters of the vaccine court in his favor and awarded compensation.From the decision (page 27):Based upon that finding of fact, it follows as a natural conclusion that Petitioner has carried his burden of proving to a preponderance that the MMR vaccine at issue actually caused the condition(s) from which Bailey suffered and continues to suffer. Inasmuch as the other elements of \u00a7 300aa\u201311 (b) and (c) have already been satisfied, the Court holds that Petitioner has met his burden on his case in chief.These facts likewise satisfy the Althen test set forth above. Petitioner\u2019s theory of PDD caused by vaccine-related ADEM causally connects the vaccination and the ultimate injury, and does so by explaining a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the ultimate reason for the injury.So the chain of events was MMR to ADEM which lead to PDD.So, the question here is what is meant by PDD?  A footnote on page 2 of the decision makes it clear that the term PDD is being used to refer to the child's diagnosis of PDD-NOS:Pervasive Developmental Delay describes a class of conditions, and it is apparent from the record that the parties and the medical records are referring to Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (\u201cPDDNOS\u201d) ... In the interest of consistency, the Court will follow the convention adhered to by the medical records and by the parties in this case, and this condition will be referred to herein as \u201cPDD\u201d.So PDD is being used to represent PDD-NOS.  So what is PDD-NOS?  The decision also includes a reference to the definition from the Yale School of Medicine:Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) is a 'subthreshold' condition in which some - but not all - features of autism or another explicitly identified Pervasive Developmental Disorder are identifiedSo PDD-NOS is normally used to refer to people who have most but not all of the features of another form of PDD. \u00a0There are 5 subtypes of PDD : Autism, Asperger's, Rett's disorder, Childhood disintegrative disorder, and PDD-NOS. \u00a0Rett's has a known genetic cause and mainly affects girls and\u00a0Childhood disintegrative disorder is very rare and doesn't apear until after 3-4 years old (whereas autism is always before 3). \u00a0I think we can safely eliminate Rett's and CDD from the discussion. \u00a0 So that means that the PDD-NOS here is refering to a \"subtreshhold\" condition of either autism or aspergers.Or in other words, the MMR lead to ADEM which lead to a form of autism.Of course the reactions from the autism world have been quite heated as normal.  The left wing started this whole debate with this post by Robert F Kennedy Jr and David Kirby in combination with a full page add in the USA today. \u00a0The right wing is of course attempting to highlight the use of PDD instead of the more specific term autism and to point out that the title of the decision is \"Non-autistic developmental delay\".So, what to make of all of this?First, PDD-NOS is normally considered a diagnosis that falls on the autism spectrum.  This is the official diagnosis that my children have and they are considered as having autism.  So saying PDD-NOS is, under normal conditions, the same as saying a form of autism.But the title makes it clear this this is supposed to be a \"Non-autistic developmental delay\" so how can we reconcile between the normal usage of PDD-NOS and the distrinction used here? \u00a0I think an answer to this deiliema can be found on page 7 of the decision :Moving on to the alternative hypothesis/diagnosis of autism, Dr. Lopez distinguishes autism as a more generalized condition without a known etiology, and contrasted it to Bailey\u2019s condition, which he says is clearly attributable to demyelination based on neuroimaging evidence.In other words, it isn't autism because we know what caused it. \u00a0Or what is more likely the case, we won't call it autism because \u00a0we know a vaccine caused it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis", "http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Abell.BANKS.02-0738V.pdf", "http://www.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/pddnos.html", "http://www.childbrain.com/pddq3.shtml", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/vaccine-court-autism-deba_b_169673.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/generation-rescue-ad-in-usa-today-court-again-concedes-vaccines-cause-autism.html", "http://autism.change.org/blog/view/behind_the_vaccine_scare_parental_fear", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1917&cpage=1"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/02/pervasive-developmental-disorder-not.html", "title": "\nPervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, July 22, 2010", "body": "\nOver at Astrid's Journal, Astrid is talking about a recent study that claimed to look at \"lay perceptions\" of autism.  While she does have a point that there is a divide in the autism community in how autism is portrayed, the study she cites is absolute nonsense.  \n\nThe \"study\", and I use that term loosely, gave ten \"lay\" people (people not involved in the autism world) a \"semi-structured\" interview about autism and then looked at the data using \"interpretative phenomenological analysis\" and \"discourse analysis\".  Yes, those are real things.\n\nBased on their analysis, the authors came up with the following conclusion - \nParticipants demonstrated clear views (although not necessarily correct) about the nature, origins and manifestations of autism. They drew upon their understanding of normal child development to make these assessments and they made judgements about the ability of individuals with autism to attain social independence. It is recommended that interactions between lay people and people with autism may help develop positive conceptualisations of autism.I have not read the study, nor do I intend to, because by the time you actually read the study (or the conclusion), you have missed the point.  Where any discussion of this \"study\" should have stopped is at the point where they point where you see that the results are based on the opinions of just 10 people.\n\nTo be fair, Astrid does note that \"the study group was very small (only ten participatins), so no generalizations should be made\" but I think that is the wrong way to think about the \"study\".  Ten random people cannot be representative of anything, especially a population as large as the \"lay\" autism population (think billions).  \n\nSo, the question is then what are these ten peoples' opinions being used to represent?  Or to borrow a line from the person who writes The Last Psychiatrist, what do the authors want to be true?  \n\nTo help answer that question, I would direct your attention back to an earlier \"study\" written by the same two people that looks suspiciously familiar.  In this \"study\" the authors gave a \"semi-structured\" interview to 9 young people with high functioning autism who were \"capable of providing a verbal account of their perceptions of autism and diagnosis experiences\" and looked at the data using \"interpretative phenomenological analysis\".  \n\nNotice the setup.  Another infinitesimally small group whose opinions were analyzed and taken to mean something.  The conclusion from this \"study\"?\nIn relation to the existing literature, it is suggested that the effects of diagnosis, or disclosure of diagnosis, from the perspective of the person with autism be given greater consideration.So, what do the authors want to be true?  They want to people with autism (presumably the high functioning ones) be given a greater voice in describing their autism and \"lay\" people to interact with them so that they can develop a positive attitude towards autism.\n\nOK, fair enough, people with autism are people just like everyone else and have the right to have their voices heard.  But what do we do with the vast number of children with autism who aren't able to communicate well enough to provide their perspectives of autism?  Do we let the young, high functioning adults give a perspective for them?\n\nShould we keep on ignoring their needs while singing kumbaya and thinking happy thoughts about autism?\n\nThe real questions are how did this nonsense get published in the first place and how did the authors get away with suggesting that they are talking about the other people's perceptions of autism.  If they wanted to voice their opinions about autism, they should write articles that state that these are their opinions and publish them as such.\n\nWe don't need more junk pretending to be science.\n\nReferences (and I use that term loosely)\n\nHuws JC, Jones RS.

{"date": "Tuesday, August 17, 2010", "body": "\nAs many of you are no doubt aware, earlier this year Ari Ne'eman was nominated to serve on the  National Council on Disability. At the time, I said that I thought it was a bad idea.  Then, out of the blue, his nomination was put on hold for some reason.\n\nI hoped that the hold was because someone had come to their senses and realized that Mr. Ne'eman was not a good person to represent the needs of people with autism. \u00a0But my hopes were soon utterly crushed when not only was his nomination to the National Council approved, but he was also appointed to serve on the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC).\n\nWell, what's done is done and Mr. Ne'eman's appointments are going to run for a couple of years.  Hopefully during that time he will be able to grow to become someone who truly represents the needs of everybody on the spectrum - including the silent majority who are unable to speak for themselves. \n\nBut given some recent events, I am not going to hold my breath.\n\nAs I was watching the videocast of the most recent IACC meeting, I ran into a prime example of exactly why Mr. Ne'eman is not qualified to serve on the IACC or the NCD.  The transcript of the meeting is not yet available, but if you look at the video, starting at about 40:00 you can witness Mr. Ne'eman displaying his maturity. \u00a0Or, alternatively, you can read my transcription of the exchange below.\n\nJust as background, at this point in the video, Michael Ganz, Ph.D. has just finished giving a presentation on the costs of autism in the United States.  If you don't want to watch the presentation (it is interesting), let me just summarize it by saying autism = expensive.\n\nAri Ne'eman : Thank you. I appreciate your presenting on this in so far as you work can help improve access to services, I think we can support it.  I want to sort of drill down into this concept of indirect costs you put forward connected to what I think you referred to in your presentation as the value of prevention.  You know, I wonder if you couldn't speak to some of the ethical implications here.  I mean, correct me if I am wrong but isn't what you are saying here essentially these people are expense, we have calculated exactly how expensive they are, now, let's save that money by preventing them from existing?  How would you distinguish your views from the views from of, say, the eugenics movement of the 20th century which did a very similar thing.\n\nMichael Ganz, Ph.D : I don't want to insult anybody but I think that's a ridiculous statement.  The point of this work is to point out the lost opportunity costs associated with people who have a health condition that hopefully can be prevented and I am not meaning that the folks should be prevented from being born.  I mean that they should be prevented from experiencing that condition.  Just like there is tons of literature on the costs associated with depression, with breast cancer, with over active bladder, it doesn't mean we want to prevent people from being born who might have over active bladder, we just mean that's the cost the associated opportunity cost, those costs can be going to something else like playgrounds --\n\nAri Ne'eman : What about in the example of say downs syndrome that is the example in which you see very high rates of prenatal termination fetuses that test positive for downs syndrome.  Now, according to your methodology, does that result in a net economic benefit for society.  You know does that represent part of the value of prevention?\n\nMichael Ganz, Ph.D : It might but I am not -- I really don't -- well let's point it this way that's not the perspective I am coming from, I am coming from the perspective a person is born, again with a condition and can we treat it and what would you save if you treated it.  That's -- I think that reading too much into this from an ethical standpoint, certainly people are going to do that but that's not what I set out to do.  I set out to do an accounting exercise --\n\nAri Ne'eman : Let me say it a different way...\n\n(Thomas Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health and Chair of the IACC interrupts at this point and steers the conversation back into grown up land).\n\nIf you watch the video, you can see Mr. Ne'eman ask - with a straight face - whether Mr. Ganz was\u00a0supporting the idea of\u00a0eugenics. \u00a0\u00a0Simply suggesting that someone supports eugenics is insulting in the first place, but to ask that as a serious question in a professional environment like the IACC?\n\nThe question along is like walking up to a random person on the street and saying \"Hi, I hear you want to murder unborn children\". \u00a0That alone is bad enough, but consider if you did the exact same thing in the middle of an executive meeting at a large company.\n\nI can think of only one word to describe this behavior - juvenile. \u00a0If anyone pulled this sort of crap in a professional environment, I have no doubt that they would be quickly voted off of the island.\n\nDr. Landis's notes are starting to look good in comparison.\n\nEven if you ignore the whole absurd notion that anyone on the IACC would even suggest systematically aborting every child with autism, the question still makes no sense. \u00a0Mr. Ne'eman didn't ask someone who was working on a biomarker for autism, nor did he ask someone who was looking for prenatal signs of autism, nor did he even ask someone who was doing any sort of biological research - he asked someone who is basically\u00a0economist.\n\nNow,\u00a0I know economist are guilty of doing a lot of things, but for some reason I highly doubt that developing a prenatal test for autism and then making everyone abort any child who failed the test is on their agenda.\n\nI think Mr. Ganz said it best in in his initial response to the question when he basically said \"I\u00a0don't want to insult you but you are being ridiculous.\"\n\nI second that idea. \u00a0Mr. Ne'eman, grow up.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S7pqNh3KirI/AAAAAAAAAN4/-nKXIuwI4JQ/s1600/ariignorance.jpg", "http://www.iacc.hhs.gov/", "http://videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?Live=9432", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/ari-neeman-at-iacc-meeting.html", "title": "\nAri Ne'eman at the IACC Meeting\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 20, 2010", "body": "\nEarlier this month, a study was published in Pediatrics that suggested that there might be a relationship between neonatal jaundice and autism. \u00a0After reading the study several times, I think I can best sum it up as a little weak and very confusing.\n\nIn this study, researchers examined the electronic health records of at all 733,826 children born in Denmark between 1994 and 2004 and collected data on a variety of factors. \u00a0These factors not only included whether the child had jaundice or one of several developmental disorders but also included data on their birth weight, gestational age, fetal presentation, apgar score, demographic information about the parents, and other factors. \u00a0Or, in short, they collected a lot of data. \n\nThe researchers found that almost 5% of the children in the study had a diagnosis of neonatal jaundice noted in their medical records. \u00a0As would be expected, these children were more likely to be born premature (36 weeks or earlier) by a margin of 43% to 4.4%, more likely to be underweight - 53% to 14%, and more likely to have an irregular fetal presentation - 29% to 17%. \u00a0I don't know if any of these relationships are statistically significant as the study does not say, but I don't think that really matters as none of these relationships are controversial.\n\nMoving onto the autism side of things, the study found a total of 1,721 children who had a diagnosis \"in the spectrum of disorders of psychological development\". \u00a0This spectrum included disorders of speech, motor, and social development as well as autism and intellectual disability (ID). \u00a0In this group, there were 577 children that had a diagnosis that put them on the autism spectrum and 1,239 children that had intellectual disability. \u00a0There were 74 children in this group that had both intellectual disability and autism.\n\nThe researchers crunched the numbers and found some rather peculiar results. \u00a0Jaundice was found to be associated with autism but only in full term infants. \u00a0To make matters more confusing, this association partially disappeared when the children were separated out by the time of year that they were born (summer vs winter) and whether they were first born or not. \u00a0Children with jaundice who were born in the summer or who were first born did not have an increased risk of autism, while children born in the winter or were not first born did.\n\nAs I said, I find this result to be rather confusing. \n\nThe lack of association between jaundice and autism in premature children is odd. \u00a0Children with jaundice are much more likely to be premature and premature children are more likely to have autism. \u00a0The numbers found in this study bear that out - 43% of the children with jaundice were premature and prematurity is more common in the children with autism (7.8%) than the general population (6.3%, 4.4% in those without jaundice). \u00a0Intuitively it seems like there should have been a relation there, but there wasn't. \n\nThe authors try and explain away the time year effect by exposure to sunlight and hence vitamin D levels, but, while that sounds good, there is no demonstrated correlation between vitamin D and autism. \u00a0Similarly, they try to explain the order of birth effect by differences in hospital discharge policies and maternal antibodies in second and later pregnancies. \u00a0I don't find any of these reasons convincing as I like to see actual data behind assertions rather than just magical thinking. \u00a0Although, to be fair, some studies have hinted that there might be a seasonal bias with autism.\n\nI have to question how significant the association found is. \u00a0It is one thing to say that there is an increased risk but the actual significance of the association rests on the count of cases. \u00a0So I would have liked to see the actual number of children who had autism and jaundice but the only figures provided are hazard ratios (HR). \n\nNot to get too technical, but this hazard ratio, which is basically a relative risk, provides an estimate of how much higher the (relative) risk of the outcome (autism in this case) is if the child had exposure to what was being measured (jaundice) when compared to those who were not. \u00a0So in this case, an HR of 1 would mean equal risk while an HR of 2 would mean that the children with jaundice were twice as likely to have autism than the children who didn't have autism.\n\nThe overall unadjusted HR for all children with autism was found to be 1.84 while that number dropped to 1.56 after being adjusted for maternal smoking, apgar scores, mother's citizenship, birth weight, and congenital malformations. \u00a0So we aren't talking about a large increase of risk. \u00a0But perhaps more telling is the ranges of these values. \n\nAt the risk of getting a bit technical again, the study says that the 95% confidence intervals for these figures are 1.05 to 2.69 and 1.05 to 2.30, respectively. \u00a0This confidence interval basically means that we would be 95% certain that the \"real\" value of the HR would be between these values. \u00a0These values represent a rather large range - from no increased risk to about 2.5 times the risk - which suggests that the increased risk are based on relatively few cases. \u00a0A result based on a fewer cases or, more appropriately, on a a small difference in the relative number of cases, would be weaker than a result based on a larger number of cases or a larger difference.\n\nA crude example here would be if the unexposed group had 1 case in a group of 10 while the exposed group had 2 cases in a group of ten. \u00a0In theory, the exposure group would have twice the risk but in practice that risk could shift drastically if you looked at a larger sample.\n\nAnd, speaking of relatively few cases, consider the total number of children with autism in the study. \u00a0In ten years only 577 children with autism were born in Denmark? \u00a0That would equate to a rate of about 7.8 per 10,000 which is extremely low when compared to the 91 per 10,000 recently found in this country. \u00a0This isn't data from the 80s or early 90s when you would expect to see this rate of autism, this data was from the late 90s and almost halfway through the 2000's. \u00a0It it possible that the 577 number would increase over time as the children aged (the youngest children in the study would have only been a little over 3 when the data was collected), but still, if you considered all of the children found to have a disability included in this study, we are still only talking about 23.5 per 10,000.\n\nEither there are simply fewer cases in this country or the majority of children with autism have been missed. \u00a0If it is the first reason, then I would have to wonder at how applicable these results would be the world and, more importantly, why researchers aren't trying to figure out what is different about this country. \u00a0If it is second, then the association found would likely be flawed as well.\n\nSo, as I said at the beginning, the results from this study are confusing. \u00a0If I had to guess, I would think that the association found wasn't real, but that is just my opinion. \u00a0The only way to know for certain would be to do more studies.\n\nReferences\n\nMaimburg RD, Bech BH, V\u00e6th M, M\u00f8ller-Madsen B, Olsen J.

{"date": "Thursday, November 4, 2010", "body": "\nThe \"Autism Self Advocacy Network\" is at again, this time planning to protest the Autism Speaks Walk on Saturday in Washington D.C. \u00a0While Autism Speaks is not exactly my favorite autism organization, I really have a hard time understanding exactly why these young aspies feel the need to protest at a fund raising walk and what they hope to accomplish.\n\nIf you have ever been to one of these walks, you would know that they are mostly made up of \u00a0parents whose children have autism as well as their families and friends. \u00a0I think it would be safe to say that the majority of the people at these walks are people whose lives' have been impacted because of a child's autism. \u00a0These are people who take autism seriously and are doing what they think is a good thing to help everyone who is affected by autism. \u00a0They\u00a0are not going to take kindly to being heckled for supporting what they feel is a worthy cause.\n\nSo,\u00a0ASAN's planned protest\u00a0begs the question, what exactly do they hope to accomplish?\n\nThe people at the walks are not ignorant of autism and certainly don't need their awareness raised - they are quite aware already. \u00a0\u00a0I am starting to think that ASAN organizes these protests because they don't have any other better targets and they feel the need to protest something. \n\nBut, to be fair to ASAN, I went looking for the specific reasons that they are protesting these walks, but all I can find are reasons like the following -\nThe group of protesters will be protesting the lack of funding that Autism Speaks spends on funding services for children and adults with autism, as well as the fact that they are researching a prenatal test for autism to encourage soon to be parents to abort fetuses of children who may have Autism.\u00a0So lets talk about these reasons.\n\nThe first reason is slightly valid - Autism Speaks does not spend very much funding services for children or adults with autism. \u00a0But, and this is the important part, they never said that they would. \u00a0According to the organization's site, funding services is not their primary mission -\nWe are dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments, and cure for autism; to raising public awareness about autism and its effects on individuals, families, and society; and to bringing hope to all who deal with the hardships of this disorder. We are committed to raising the funds necessary to support these goals.So I am not really sure what ASAN's beef is. \u00a0You can't just go up to an autism non-profit and say \"Hey, I have autism so I should decide how you spend your contributions.\" \u00a0Autism Speaks is very clear about how they are going spend the money that they raise. \u00a0People who give money to Autism Speaks do so with the understanding that it will be used to pursue the goals of the organization. \n\nIf ASAN doesn't like the goals, then the proper course of action is for them to discourage their members (and anyone else who will listen) from donating to Autism Speaks. \u00a0They should set up their own non-profit and and do their own fund raising. \u00a0If people agree with what ASAN plans to do with the funds, then they will donate - if they don't then they won't. \u00a0But it is completely wrong for ASAN to try to misappropriate funds given to Autism Speaks for its own agenda. \n\nAs of the second reason, that Autism Speaks is trying to develop a prenatal test for autism with the goal of aborting all children with autism, well, I think the following picture sums up my thoughts on the matter.\n\n\nAny person with more than half two working brain cells should understand that the goal of genetic research is to find answers as to what causes autism so that better treatments can be found. \u00a0If you don't understand what something is or what it does then it is very hard to come up with an effective treatment. \n\nThe goal of genetic research is not to commit\u00a0genocide against some theoretical autistic race. \u00a0Autism is not about civil rights or about protecting some different race of autistic people. \u00a0Autism is a mental disorder and people who suffer from it need help.\n\nIf anyone knows of any other reasons why ASAN is protesting Autism Speaks, feel free to leave a comment and tell me what I missed. \u00a0But, from what I can see, ASAN is doing nothing more than behaving like an immature adolescent. \u00a0Their goals are certainly not in the best interests of people who are disabled by their autism and I have to wonder what exactly they think they are going to accomplish. \n\nAnd if they think that heckling people at an Autism Speaks walk is going to get people to take them seriously, they are very badly mistaken. \u00a0Because from my perspective, they are doing nothing more than being a nuisance and getting in the way of the people who are trying to solve a very serious problem.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.aspieweb.net/autistics-protesting-autism-speaks-washington-dc/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/mission.php", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TNNPN8CmB8I/AAAAAAAAAUI/3frJ4mmaohw/s1600/facepalm.jpg"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/11/jabberwocky-of-day-asan-protesting.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : ASAN Protesting Autism Speaks Walk (Again)\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 27, 2010", "body": "\nOver in the autism area on about.com, Lisa Jo Rudy posted something today where she talks about how taking the self-administered\u00a0Autism Quotient (AQ) test might be a good first step if you think you have autism -\nOf course, there is a disclaimer that these tests are not diagnostic, and they're only to be used for \"genuine research.\" Still, for parents of children on the autism spectrum, adults wondering whether they might fall into an autism spectrum category, or anyone concerned about the symptoms of autism, these tests may be a useful first step in deciding whether or not to seek an evaluation.This is very bad advice.\n\nFirst of all, if you seriously think that you may have a disorder such as autism or any other mental disorder then you should seek professional help. \u00a0You should not try to take a test you found on the Internet to see if you might \"fall into an autism spectrum category\" or to give you a \"hint\". \u00a0None of the lists of signs symptoms on the Internet nor any of of the tests out there are going to be able to tell you whether you have autism. \u00a0Your \"hint\" should be that you think there is something wrong and that alone should spur you to seek a professional's opinion.\n\nBut lets say that you have decided to take Lisa's advise or that you, like many people before you, have decided that this test is an appropriate way to determine whether you have autism. \u00a0 The question then becomes if you take the Autism Quotient test and score high enough, how likely are you to actually have autism?\n\nIt turns out that the answer is not very likely - the odds are about 1 in 10. \n\nTo say that the opposite way, if you had a group of ten people who all scored high (over 32), nine of them would not have autism. \u00a0So if you are claiming that you have autism based solely on a self-administered AQ test then you are most likely wrong.\n\nTo make matters worse, even if you score below that 32 number, you are still somewhat likely to have autism. \u00a0If you took a group of ten people who actually had autism, two of them would likely score below the 32 cutoff.\n\nSo either way the AQ isn't going to tell you that much.\n\nTo understand the reason the odds are so very much against you, you have to understand what the purpose of a test like the AQ is - and what it isn't. \u00a0A test like this is supposed to be used to help find people who are more likely to have a condition. \u00a0It is not supposed to be able to tell you that one specific person has the condition. \n\nA test like this can be used as a screening tool in research to help researchers find the people who are more likely to have a condition so that they can focus on those people. \u00a0Or, if the test has been validated in earlier studies, researchers can use the results of the test to draw general conclusions about the people in their study.\n\nIn either case, to properly use the test you have to know how good of a job the test does at finding those who have a condition and eliminating those that don't. \u00a0These concepts are formally called sensitivity and specificity. \u00a0The sensitivity of a test tells you have good of a job the test does at finding the people who have the condition while the specificity tells you how good of a job the the test does at telling you which people don't have the condition. \n\nIn an ideal world, you would want every test to identify every person that has a condition (sensitivity of 100%) and exclude every person who doesn't (specificity of 100%). \u00a0But, in the real world, tests are never that accurate and we have to make do with what we can get.\n\nWhen it comes the sensitivity and specificity, the AQ isn't the greatest but it isn't too bad. \u00a0According to a recent paper that I was reading, the AQ has been demonstrated to find 80% of the target group (sensitivity 80%) while only misidentifying 2% of the rest (specificity ~ 98%). \n\nWhich leads me to my next, point, what is it exactly that the AQ is supposed to be finding? \u00a0Here's a hint, it isn't what you normally think of as autism - \"The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) has been developed to measure the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has autistic traits\". \u00a0If you dig a little bit more, you would see that this test is meant to find adults who have \"traits\" of Asperger's or high-functioning autism. \n\nOr in other words, this test is geared towards finding individuals who fall on a small portion of the autism spectrum but is not going to be very helpful in identifying the majority of people with autism. \u00a0Well, it won't be helpful \u00a0unless you believe that - all evidence to the contrary - the majority of people with autism are high functioning.\n\nSo far the AQ doesn't seem to bad - it should be capable of identifying the majority of its target audience. \u00a0But there is one last piece to the puzzle of understanding why the AQ isn't able to tell you much, and that piece is called the\u00a0positive predictive value. \u00a0The idea is to take the\u00a0sensitivity and\u00a0specificity and put them in practical terms, and this value does that by telling you how likely it\u00a0is that you have a condition if you have a positive value on the test. \n\nThis is where the AQ starts running into some serious problems - the positive predictive value is somewhere between 8% and 12%. \u00a0This means that even if you have a positive value on the test, you are only about 10% likely to have Asperger's or high-functioning autism. \u00a0The other 90% of the time the test is just wrong.\n\nIf that doesn't make any sense to you, perhaps an example would make the picture clearer.\n\nSay you are looking at a group of 10,000 people and that we can assume that 1% of the people have any form of autism. \u00a0How many people will the AQ correctly identify, how many will it fail to identify, and how many will it falsely identify? \n\nThe first thing we need to know is how many of the cases of autism we would expect to be classified as Asperger's or high-functioning autism. \u00a0While there isn't a good answer to this question, I think it would be reasonable to assume that 25% of all of the people with autism fall into one of those two groups. \u00a0I suspect that the actual number would be less than this, but this number is good enough for this example.\n\nSo, with 10,000 people, we would expect 100 of them to have any form of autism and 25 of them to have Asperger's or high-functioning autism. Given what has been found in studies that\u00a0looked at the validity of the AQ, we would expect that the AQ would correctly identity 20 of that 25 (80% sensitivity) and miss 5 out of the 25. \u00a0We would also expect that 2% of the rest of the population would be falsely identified as having Asperger's or high-functioning autism, or roughly 200 people.\n\nIf we put that all together, we would find that,\u00a0out of the 220 people identified by this test, only 20 would actually be correctly identified and another 5 would be missed. \u00a0Hence the\u00a0positive predictive value would be about 9.1%, which translates roughly to a\u00a01 in 10 chance of being correctly identified.\n\nNow, just to nitpick my own argument and be completely honest, \u00a0one possible source of error in the above analysis is what the AQ would show for the 75 other cases of autism. \u00a0Would it be able to label them as having autism or would it miss them as well? \u00a0The short answer is that we don't know because this test has never been validated in this population. \u00a0No published research has shown how well the AQ does at detecting classic autism, PDD-NOS, Retts, or CDD in a large group of people and, without that information, it is simply impossible to know how well it would perform. \n\nBut, for the sake of argument, lets assume that the AQ works the same for every person with autism rather than just the higher functioning ones. \u00a0If you use the same assumptions that I used above, you would find that a positive result in the test would give you a 1 in 3.5 chance (or about 30%) of actually having autism.\n\nThe bottom line is that even if you get a high score on the Autism Quotient you are not likely to autism. \u00a0 So if you think you might have autism, don't take a random test on the Internet - go talk to a professional instead.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.about.com/b/2010/10/27/could-you-be-autistic-quiz-gives-a-hint.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Spectrum_Quotient", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mp.2010.102", "http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2005_Woodbury-Smith_etal_ScreeningAdultsForAS.pdf", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_predictive_value"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/10/think-you-have-autism-dont-take-quiz.html", "title": "\nThink You Have Autism?

{"date": "Thursday, August 12, 2010", "body": "\nA new blog/memorial site called Lives Lost to Autism was announced on Age of Autism yesterday.  The new site is meant to \"tell the stories of the precious lives cut short by autism\".\n\nWhile I understand why this site was created and why it is important to not overlook the problems that autism brings, I can honestly say that the site gives me the heebie-jeebies.  I known that autism has caused many lives to be cut short but I don't really want a daily reminder of that fact.\n\nHowever, be that as it may, this site has the potential to be an apt memorial of those who have passed.\n\nBut then, we have those who feel differently. \u00a0Those who feel that somehow this site is being unfair to autism itself.  I am speaking of a response on Left Brain Right Brain entitled \"Autism is not murderous\" - \nBut the name \u2018Lives lost to autism\u2019, the strapline \u2018For many, autism can be deadly.\u2019 and most particularly the statement \u2018This site tells the story of the precious lives cut short by autism.\u2019 are very misleading. Blaming autism for murder is utterly misleading. Autism didn\u2019t murder any of the children listed as murder victims \u2013 or the ones that haven\u2019t been listed either.The site seems to be set up and run by Ginger Taylor (left) who\u2019s position on autism has grown more and more extreme over the years. It seems now she is happy to denigrate autism itself as a murderous entity.That's right, the site is wrong because it unfairly criticizes autism the \"entity\".  And here I was unaware that autism was it fact an entity -\n1 a : being, existence; especially : independent, separate, or self-contained existence b : the existence of a thing as contrasted with its attributes2 : something that has separate and distinct existence and objective or conceptual realityI was under the impression that autism was a disease, disorder, or condition that people had, not some independent thing that had the person.  I mean, if autism was an independent of separate thing that would mean it would have to somehow gain\u00a0possession\u00a0or infect someone before they could be said to \"have\" autism. \u00a0If autism were an infectious entity, that would go along way to explaining the increase in autism, wouldn't it?\n\nBut somehow I don't quite think that was what Kev meant.\n\nRegardless, the suggestion that blaming a death on autism is somehow misleading or tarnishes autism's good name is just plain silly. \u00a0Autism is not a good thing and has in fact\u00a0directly caused many deaths. \n\nLet me put it this way, if\u00a0someone dies as a direct result of being shot would you try to claim that it was the bullet and not the person pulling the trigger that is to blame? \u00a0In a similar fashion, autism robs people of abilities or facilities that they would normally be expected to have and it is this lack that can directly lead to death.\n\nAutism can prevent children from understanding their environment and that lack of understanding can very easily be fatal.  Autism can easily prevent people from being able to understand what effect their actions have on others and thus lead to their deaths.  This likely happened in the case of Sky Walker - do you think he killed his mother or was it his autism that lead to her death?\n\nI have seen many attempts to whitewash the spectrum but this one takes the cake.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TGSNWwzNYoI/AAAAAAAAASk/Vo0I7TsDenk/s1600/Foot_mouth.gif", "http://liveslosttoautism.blogspot.com/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/08/new-site-lives-lost-to-autism-launched.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/08/autism-is-not-murderous/", "http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entity", "http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/14/earlyshow/health/main4802860.shtml"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/jabberwocky-of-day-dont-speak-ill-of.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Don't Speak Ill of Autism\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 16, 2010", "body": "\nLast week, I opined when talking about current events that autism is a casual factor in some deaths and that children with autism have more safety issues than \"typical\" children do. \u00a0These posts got a little bit of a response.\n\nOn the bright side, Harold Doherty from Facing Autism in New Brunswick agreed with me in that there are dangers inherent in having autism and Ginger Taylor from Adventures In Autism defended her site \"Lives Lost to Autism\" (the site that started the debate) by pointing out that research has actually shown that people with autism have an elevated death rate.\n\nOn the not so bright side, Astrid took my statements out to the woodshed not once, but twice while someone named Laura from Life in the House That Asperger Built brought out Spock to crush my illogical opinions. \u00a0They both has several problems with the idea that autism is\u00a0culpable\u00a0in some peoples deaths but, before I go into the details, I wanted to clear up a few\u00a0basic misconceptions about what I wrote.\n\nFirst, when I talk about \"autism\", I am talking about the conditions commonly known as autism as they are defined in the relevant medical manuals. \u00a0I am not, however, always talking about people who have autism. \u00a0These are two different concepts. \u00a0As I have said in the past, a person is a person, not a disability.\n\nSecond, if a person causes, either through direction action or negligence, the death of another person then they are responsible for the death. \u00a0Or, to put it simply, they are to blame.\n\nThird, just because a person does cause another person to die does not mean that there weren't other factors involved. I do not think that most events are ever simple enough to only have one cause and just because one thing is \"to blame\" does not means that something else is not equally \"to blame\". \u00a0When you are talking about death, there is always more than enough blame to go around.\n\nWith that out of the way, I think the\u00a0criticisms\u00a0are as follows. \u00a0If I get these wrong, feel free to tell me where I am mistaken.\n\nLaura said that it isn't the disability that kills children but rather neglect on the part of their caregivers. \u00a0If their caregivers had properly taken care of them, they would not have died.\n\nWhile I agree in general, as I said above and elsewhere, that if a person shows actual neglect that they are responsible for the death, I have to strongly disagree with tone and implications. \u00a0As I talked about earlier, parents and caregivers often go to\u00a0extraordinary\u00a0lengths to protect their children but it only takes one moment of inattentiveness or one moment when your focus is elsewhere for a\u00a0tragedy\u00a0to happen. \n\nI think it is long past the point where we should be automatically point the finger at the parents. \u00a0We didn't cause our children to have autism nor did our poor parenting skills and we are trying our damndest to help them, so enough with the guilt trips already.\n\nSecond, and probably more importantly, even when there is actual\u00a0negligence, that does not mean that autism did not play a role in the death. \u00a0Let me be clear, that does not excuse the negligence - in my mind it actually makes it worse. \u00a0But it is important to acknowledge the fact that autism comes with additional risks. \u00a0I will expand as to why this is the case in a little bit.\n\nAstrid pointed out that it isn't the disability that leads to problem but rather unsafe situations while Laura said that the lack of abilities that is part of autism can only lead to death in the\u00a0presence\u00a0of other circumstances.\n\nOn one level, I agree with what they are saying. \u00a0If you are standing in the middle of room doing absolutely nothing, a person with autism is no more likely to die than any other person would be. \u00a0The problem only comes in when you have things happening in the environment that interact with autism. \n\nAnd that is exactly why part of blame belongs to autism. \u00a0Autism impairs a person's ability to understand their environment, both on a social level and on a physical level. \u00a0It is that\u00a0impairment\u00a0- an impairment that is part of the core of what autism is - combined with the environment that causes the problem. \u00a0If you removed the\u00a0impairment, the situation might not be unsafe.\n\nThat does not mean that you ignore the situation or just shrug your shoulders and say \"well, that's autism\". \u00a0On the contrary, parents and caregivers need to be very aware of exactly what situations would pose a danger to their child and actively work to keep the child from harm. \u00a0But that extra step of precaution is not possible without first\u00a0acknowledging\u00a0the fact that autism is creating an extra risk.\n\nAn apt example here would be if someone drugged you and then left you wander out onto a busy highway where you were hit and killed by a car. \u00a0Is the car the only think to blame in your death or is the person that removed your ability to understand what you were doing also to blame?\n\nA more appropriate example would be the children than wander away from home only to die from exposure. \u00a0Is it the weather that killed them or the lack of understanding of the environment caused by autism? \u00a0Or are you really going to always blame the parents for not keeping the kids safe (i.e. you should have put that fourth lock on the door)?\n\nPerhaps an\u00a0even more appropriate example would be the twelve year old boy with autism who was rescued from a fire only to break free from his rescuers and run straight back into the fire where he died. \n\nIt isn't always that situations are\u00a0inherently\u00a0unsafe but rather that situations are unsafe because of autism.\n\nAstrid and Laura both said that autism is not an excuse for a parent murdering their child.\n\nI agree completely, and said as much not too long ago.\n\nFinally, Astrid said that blaming autism shifts the focus away from the concept of safety to the disability itself. \u00a0The focus should be on providing accommodations to make the world a safer place for people with the disability.\n\nI think she is missing the point. \u00a0It is critical that parents and caretakers understand the increased risks that come along with a child having a diagnosis of autism. \u00a0If you don't understand that the child might not be able to properly understand their environment and may engage in behaviors that are not in their best interest, you will not be able to adequately keep them safe. \n\nTo make matters worse, you may not get a second, so\u00a0sticking your head in the sand and pretending that the problem does not exist is only going to lead to more dangerous situations, not less.\n\nIt seems to me that critics like Laura and Astrid would rather pretend that autism doesn't carry greater risks while at the same time blaming the parents and caregivers for not providing better protection. \u00a0They can't have it both ways.\n\nI\u00a0think the overall problem with both critics is that they seem to feel that the condition known as autism is a part of their identity and they view any attack on it as an attack on them. \u00a0I don't really want to go into that whole debate now, so suffice it to say that if you choose to make a medical condition a part of your identity, you cannot complain when people accurately describe the condition.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2010/08/autism-dangers-result-in-lives-lost-to.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2010/08/lives-lost-to-autism.html", "http://astridvanwoerkom.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/autism-doesnt-kill/", "http://astridvanwoerkom.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/on-the-medicalization-of-safety/", "http://lifewithasperger.wordpress.com/2010/08/13/autism-is-the-bullet/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/blaming-autism.html", "title": "\nBlaming Autism\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 6, 2010", "body": "\nProbably the most important unanswered question when it comes to autism is whether there is a real increase in the number of people with autism or whether the increase is an artificial one that is being caused by changing definitions and social factors. \u00a0The answer to this single question has the potential to completely change how we look at autism.\n\nHowever, at the same time,\u00a0I would suggest that the answer to this question is quickly becoming a moot point as the needs of the ever increasing number of autistic children are quickly outpacing the services that are available for them. \u00a0The State of Texas seems to be learning this lesson the hard way -\nCauses aside, autism\u2019s effects are indisputably profound on students, parents and teachers. Nearly 30,000 of the 4.8 million students in Texas schools are classified as autistic, according to TEA data. Lawmakers have taken note of the growing autistic population and the increasing volume of complaints from frustrated parents. And they are looking to new programs and to other states for potential solutions.Many Texas teachers have limited knowledge and training to teach students with autism. With more and more autistic students in regular classrooms, many parents say teachers must be better prepared.The article mentions this 30,000 number is a 400% increase over the past decade but leaves out the fact that \u00a0the situation is only going to get worse. \u00a0If the most recent figures from the AAP and CDC (1 in 110) are to be believed, the number of children with autism in Texas should still be another 50% higher - almost 45,000 children.\n\nIf the rate of autism isn't increasing, then I have to wonder what these extra 22,000 children were called before being lumped in with the autism group and how their needs were being met. \u00a0If the children - and their needs - have always been there, why isn't the education system in Texas prepared to deal with them?\n\nBut regardless, it doesn't really matter where these children came from, what matters is that they are here now.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.texastribune.org/texas-education/texas-education-agency/educators-officials-face-400--spike-in-autism/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/it-doesnt-matter-where-they-came-from.html", "title": "\nIt Doesn't Matter Where They Came From\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 19, 2010", "body": "\nEarlier this week, yet another study was published that failed to find a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism. \u00a0This long awaited study was commissioned by the CDC and is the first serious look at the relationship between thimerosal and autism in US based populations since the controversial Verstraeten study in 2003.\n\nThe study looked at 256 children with autism and matched them against 762 typical children and found that the amount of thimerosal that they were exposed to had no relationship to their chances of having autism. \u00a0Or in simpler terms, more mercury did not mean more autism. \u00a0And actually, some of the analyses showed that having a higher exposure to thimerosal actually decreased the chances of having autism.\n\nYes, you read that correctly. \u00a0The study found that more mercury meant less autism.\n\nI was planning on writing a serious review of the pros and cons of this study because I think that this is an important one. \u00a0But the more that I dug into the study, the less sense that it made to me. \u00a0Sure, the study is well designed and appears to have been carried out meticulously. \u00a0But how the data was presented and that nonsensical part of the conclusion made me wonder.\n\nThe study's stated goal was to \"examine relationships between prenatal and infant ethylmercury exposure from \u00a0vaccines and/or immunoglobulin preparations and ASD and 2 ASD subcategories: autistic disorder (AD) and ASD with regression.\"\n\nTo do that they looked through the health records for three HMOs, found all of the kids born between 1994 and 1999 that had a label of autism, and attempted to get them to participate in the study. \u00a0They started out with 802 children with autism but ended up only including 256 of them in the final results. \u00a0These children were matched against 70,801 potential control children with 762 being the final number of controls. \u00a0The control children were pretty well matched against children with autism on a variety of factors such as birth year, gender, weight at birth, parent's age, mother's education level, as well as other factors.\n\nThe cumulative exposure to thimerosal was then calculated for three time periods - birth to 1 month, birth to 7 months, and birth to 20 months. \u00a0These exposures (along with a bunch of other data) were put into a variety of models and no relationship between the level of thimerosal exposure and autism was found.\n\nBut, if you are paying attention, you might have noticed a problem. \u00a0The goal of the study was to look for a relationship between thimerosal and autism - not to look at the relative risk from a higher thimerosal exposure. \u00a0Yet, it is that second question that was the one actually addressed.\n\nLet me put this another way. \u00a0If I told you that I was doing a study to evaluate whether smoking can cause cancer but instead gave you a study that compared people who smoked one pack a day to those who smoked two packs a day. \u00a0Then, when I found no increased risk of cancer between the two groups, I said that my study showed no relationship between cancer and smoking. \u00a0While it might be true that smoking more does not lead to a higher risk of cancer that is not the same as saying that smoking at all doesn't increase the risk of cancer. \u00a0When you compare cancer rates in smokers vs non-smokers the association jumps out.\n\nThose of you who know the history of the tobacco research would recognize that studies like this were actually used by industry to obscure the relationship between smoking and cancer. \u00a0But I didn't want to think that the CDC would put out such a distorted study, so I looked at the actual numbers a bit closer.\n\nThere are two measures of risk in the study. \u00a0The first is an odds ratio associated with an increase of 1 unit (1 mcg per 1 kg) of exposure. \u00a0That measure is clearly looking at whether more thimerosal means more autism, not whether thimerosal has a relationship to autism.\n\nThe second measure was an odds ratio between a low and high exposure group. \u00a0The low exposure group is defined to be (roughly) the children in the bottom 10% while the high exposure group is defined to be the children in the top 90% group. \u00a0The question then becomes what is the actual difference in exposures between these groups. \n\nAre we talking about groups where the \"low\" exposure group had 5 shots vs the \"high\" exposure group getting 6 or are we talking about groups where the low exposure group basically have no exposure while the high exposure group had close to the maximum. \u00a0The former comparison would be worthless while the later would be close to what we would want to see.\n\nHere is where things got a little confusing.\n\nThe ranges between high and low are quoted in mcg per kg but the data published for the groups is quoted in cumulative mcg. \u00a0For the birth to 1 month value is 4.08 mcg/kg which roughly translates into about 16 mcg of exposure - or about one shot. \u00a0Then I looked at the exposure table - the range for birth to 1 month group was 0 to 74 with a mean of 2.7 for the autism group and 0 to 100 with a mean of 2.35 for the control groups. \u00a0But how can the mean for the groups be that much less than one shot (12.5 mcg) and why does the control group have a higher maximum than the autism group?\n\nFor the birth to 7 month and birth to 20 month groups a similar pattern plays out. \u00a0The range between the groups seems to get a little larger (about 125 mcg and 200 mcg, respectively) but the ranges and mean seem to be strange. \u00a0All of the groups for all of the time frames have a minimum of zero exposure, so does that mean that the low exposure groups were primarily made up of children with no exposure to thimerosal?\n\nThe study doesn't really go into any details about the composition of the high and low exposure groups. \u00a0But then I remembered there was a reference about supplemental data and went looking for it. \u00a0Typically the supplemental data will contain some of the extra data that didn't fit in the study because of space constraints, and I thought it might be able to shed some light on the subject. \n\nWell, I found the supplemental data here and here - all 387 (!) page of it. \u00a0I have never seen a study with this much supplemental data in it. \u00a0But even more interesting was were I found it, on the web site of Abt Associates. \n\nIt turns out that the majority of the work for the study was not done by the CDC but rather a private company. \u00a0This is kind-of mentioned in the study but it doesn't really call out the fact that \"one of the largest for-profit government and business research and consulting firms in the world\" did the work for the study nor that \"in 2008, Abt Associates was ranked 20th among the top 50 U.S. market research firms by the American Marketing Association.\"\n\nIt is possible that the answer to the my question is buried in the supplemental data but I don't have the time (or desire) to read through almost 400 pages to find the answer. \u00a0The results of the study are somewhat confusing but the sheer amount of data that was dumped along with it makes it that much harder to get at what question was actually answered or what the results actually mean.\n\nI am beginning to suspect that was the point.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2010-0309v1", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/112/5/1039", "http://abtassociates.com/reports/Aut_Tech_Report_Vol1_090310.pdf", "http://abtassociates.com/reports/Aut_Tech_Report_Vol2_090310.pdf", "http://www.abtassociates.com/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/09/yet-another-thimerosal-study.html", "title": "\nYet Another Thimerosal Study\n"},

As a case in point, all of my own children show an elevated (almost toxic) level of copper, a low level of zinc (2 of 3 were zinc deficient), and low levels of seleniumSo far we have just another person who doesn't take the time to actually read and understand what they are attempting to mock.  It is sad but not unusual enough to comment on.  But the funny part comes next, in the comments section, where Sophomoricus announces that evidence based medicine should not be based on evidence but rather the popularity of the idea. \n\nI started the comment thread with -\nI am glad you find my children's nutritional problems amusing.OK, so it wasn't the best opening. I get annoyed when people think nutritional problems should be mocked.  Sophomoricus responded by saying -\nThe thermonuclear-grade bullshit is the issue at question, not your children.to which I said -\nThen you must not have read the text that you quoted where I said my children were zinc deficient, had low levels of selenium, and had too high levels of copper.Do you understand what these substances do inside the body and what the developmental implications are? From your flippant tone, I don't think you do. So here's an easy one to get you started zinc deficiency - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_deficiencySo what is the bullshit here - your lack of understanding of biology or your irrational disbelief of scientific evidence that these trace elements are out of balance in some children who have autism?And then we get to the funny response -\nLook dude - if your graph had even the slightest chance (1 in 100) of holding true - every autism research group on the globe would be chasing the prize.I have absolutely no doubt levels of all kind of things are out of kilter in Autistics. I'm too busy experiencing the Joy of Autism to further engage with you at this poit. 'cuse me while I go get chelated.There you have it, a scientific study isn't valid unless it wins awards for popularity. Here, I was laboring under the apparently false impression that a study's data and interpretation of the data was the important part.  But no, it is the popularity of the idea that matters, not the data.  That would explain why the mainly genetic model of autism is still talked about even though no one has managed to find any significant genetic links to autism as a whole.\n\nThe bonus joke here has to do with chelation - does anyone know what one of the accepted medical treatments is for people who have toxic levels of lead or copper?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2109/1589053458_db848bdc90_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lebatihem/1589053458/", "http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/2010/07/week-in-autism-twtwtwia-viii.html", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/lead-poisoning/FL00068/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/wilsons-disease/DS00411/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugs"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/jabberwocky-of-day-sophomoricus.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day : Sophomoricus\n"},

{"date": "Monday, October 4, 2010", "body": "\nI am constantly amazed at the inaccurate reporting that appears in major media sources, especially ones that are science oriented.  In some cases it seems like there is a message that they want to get out and the facts are either ignored or forced into fitting the message.\n\nTake for example the rhetoric about the pertussis (whooping cough) outbreak this year in parts of the country.  If you were to follow what major media outlets are saying, you would believe that this is the worst outbreak in 50 years and that the reason for the outbreak is parents who are refusing vaccinations.\n\nBut, as I have talked about ad nauseum, the reality of the situation seems to be different. \u00a0It is true that parts of the country are experiencing outbreaks but, for the country as a whole,  this is nowhere near the worst epidemic in 50 years.  And more importantly, declining vaccination rates are only one possible explanation for the outbreak.  \n\nMore likely reasons include the facts that pertussis outbreaks follow a\u00a0cyclical\u00a0pattern  and happen every three to five years, that the number of pertussis cases have been on the rise since the 1980s, that the protection from the vaccine only lasts 10 years, or that there is evidence that the bacteria is changing the the vaccine simply isn't working as well.  If you are interested in the details behind the facts, I would refer you to some of the earlier posts that I have written.\n\nBut none of these reasons seem to matter to the New Scientist in an article that they published a little over a week ago.  The title of the article is \"Whooping cough epidemic suggests bacteria are adapting\" but the very first paragraph is as follows -\nNINE babies have died in California, and four in Australia, so far, in the worst epidemic of whooping cough in rich countries since vaccination became widespread in the 1950s. The main cause is a lack of re-vaccination, but the bacterium may also be adapting to beat vaccines.While the rest of the short article plays lip service to the idea that the there could be something else going on, the main theme is that the failure of people to use vaccines aggressively are behind the epidemic. Take for example the following statement -\nVaccination protects babies - these recent deaths have been in babies not yet vaccinated  - but immunity wanes with age, so older children and adults can be unwittingly infected with whooping cough and infect unvaccinated babies.While that statement is factually accurate, it leaves out one very important detail.  The children who died didn't receive the vaccine because they were too young - not because their parents refused them.  But this sort of nuance is completely absent from the reporting and has been replaced with an overriding \"take your vaccines\" message.\n\nAs for the assertion that this is \"the worst epidemic of whooping cough in rich countries since vaccination became widespread in the 1950s\", well I leave you with a pretty picture to dispell that notion.\n\nThe numbers on this chart are from the data published by the CDC and represent total number of cases week by week for the years 2004, 2005, 2009 and 2010.

{"date": "Saturday, July 24, 2010", "body": "\n\n\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\nIs there a relationship between certain trace and toxic elements and autism?\n\n\u00a0I know this is one of those areas that gets everyone all riled up, but I ran across the a study earlier this month and thought the results were interesting and worth pointing out.  Just a quick note before I start, if you are one of the people who see the M word used in an article about autism and get all bent out of shape, I would ask that you ignore that part of it and consider the other the other findings.  So, without further ado..\n\nThe study in question looked for and found a possible relationship between the levels of trace and toxic elements and the severity of autism in children.  The trace elements in question are copper, zinc, magnesium, and selenium while the toxic elements are lead and mercury.\n\nThe researchers looked at hair and nail samples from a total of 95 children.  These children were divided into four groups - a typical (control) group with 50 children, and a low functioning group (LFA) with 15 children, a medium function group (MFA) with 15 children, and high function group (HFA) that also had 15 children.\u00a0The children were placed in their groups by their score on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) test, a older but still valid test for autism.  Children in the HFA group had a score on the CARS of 15-30, MFA was 30-45, and LFA was 45-60. \u00a0The children lived in India and were between the ages of 4 and 12.  The groups were matched on age as well as gender.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the samples and found that there were significant relationships between the severity of autism and the measured level of these elements.  In general, children with more severe autism had higher levels of copper, lead, and mercury and lower levels of selenium and magnesium.  Zinc was the exception as there wasn't a significant relationship between severity and the level measured.  However, children in the LFA group did show a significant decrease in zinc when compared to the control group.\n\nSince these relationships are easier to visualize rather than read, I am including some graphs below that show the mean values for each group for each sample type (hair and nail).  Most of the values below reached the threshold for significance ( p < 0.01 or p < 0.001) but not all of them did (Zinc in hair  and nails for MFA and LFA as well as lead in nails for MFA and HFA did not).\n\nThere are two\u00a0caveats\u00a0to keep in mind as you look at the charts.\n\nFirst, these data points do not \"prove\" that autism is caused by any specific thing.  They only show a relationship between the level measured and a severity of autism. Or to put it a different way, the relationship here is between the level measured in hair or nails and the score on the CARS test. \u00a0Although on the flip side, CARS is a decent test and can distinguish between autism and pdd-nos, so it should be an acceptable way of determining severity.\n\nSecond, there is no data about why the numbers look the way they do.  All of the children were from the same general area but that does not mean that they all come from the social or economic background.  It is also entirely possibly that these differences could be caused by differences in diet between the groups\n\nHowever, it is my feeling that these results do reflect the reality of what can happen in certain children with autism.  As a case in point, all of my own children show an elevated (almost toxic) level of copper, a low level of zinc (2 of 3 were zinc deficient), and low levels of selenium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLakshmi Priya, M.

Yet from some of his recent comments, I am not sure that he grasps the science behind one of the fundamental questions about autism - is autism increasing?\n\nBelow is something that Mr. Robison recently wrote about the increase in autism as part of a larger conversation.  I am not going to address the main points of the\u00a0discussion\u00a0because Jonathan  already did a good job of that at Autism's Gadfly.  Instead, I want to focus on his statements about the apparent increase in the rates of autism -\nThe 600% thing may be misleading, but it's still real. Is some of it caused by more inclusive standards in the new DSM? Sure. Is some caused by much greater public awareness? Sure. Is some caused by increases in certain kinds of autism . . . probably. There have not been any studies to clarify this point because there is no data on the prevalence of certain kinds of autism in years past - there's only data on the whole spectrum. It's very hard to explain the reason for the increase and no one has figured out a way to determine if certain conditions like childhood disintegrative disorder are increasing, or just more visible. The same can be said for Asperger's.The 600% refers to the apparent increase in autism rates over the past decade or so.  Now, I have to give Mr. Robison credit for actually admitting that \"certain types of autism\" are \"probably\" increasing.  But all of the credit goes bye-bye when he says (presumably with a straight face), that increases in conditions like childhood disintegrative disorder might be responsible for part of the increase and that there is no data on the breakdown of the spectrum.\n\nFor those of you who don't know,\u00a0childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) is a very rare condition that is one of the five conditions that together make up the pervasive developmental disorders - more commonly known as the autism spectrum. \u00a0And while it is true that children with CDD do look a lot like children with autism, there are some very\u00a0significant\u00a0differences. \u00a0Children with CDD have an extended period of \"normal\" development (at least 2 but no longer than 10 years) before undergoing a very\u00a0significant\u00a0(and most times very rapid) regression where previously acquired social, communication, and motor skills are lost. \u00a0After the regression, these children do show the same behaviors as other forms of autism but, unlike other forms of autism, once skills are lost, they are typically never regained.\n\nTo put it bluntly, when your child goes from being a bright talkative five year old to being a child with an intellectual disabilty who no longer talks, looses motor skills, and no longer has bladder\u00a0control\u00a0and stays that way for the rest of their life, that would be CDD.\n\nCDD can make even lower functioning autism look good by comparison.\n\nThe strange thing is that it isn't\u00a0like we have no idea how how (un)common CDD is.  All the way back in 2002, there was a review article published that cited\u00a0prevalence estimates\u00a0from 1966 onward and came up with a figure of about 1.7 per 100,000 for CDD. \u00a0Compare that to the recent CDC figure of about 910 per 100,000 for all types of autism.\n\nEven if CDD has seen the same massive increases that other forms of autism did over the past decade, we are still only talking about 10 per 100,000 compared to 910 per 100,000. \u00a0But I have not been able to find any published work that even suggests that the rate of CDD could have increased this much and, as recently as\u00a02009, the 1.7 per 100,000 figure is still being used.\n\nSo, in other words, if you ignore all of the data that has been published on the subject and make some huge leaps of faith, you could possibly conclude that about 1% of all current autism cases are CDD. \u00a0However, a much more realistic\u00a0scenario\u00a0is that CDD hasn't increased so drastically and makes up less than 0.5% of all autism cases. \n\nIn either case, it is highly unlikely that an increase in CDD is a major (or even minor) factor in the 600% increase in autism.\n\nWhich leads into the second problem with what Mr. Robison said - that we don't have a clear picture of what types of autism are increasing. \u00a0If you even do a quick search,\u00a0you can turn up several places where breakdowns have been done.  Take for example this study from 2009 that clearly gives a breakdown between the types of autism -\nThis article reviews the results of 43 studies published since 1966 that provided estimates for the prevalence of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), including autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, PDD not otherwise specified, and childhood disintegrative disorder. The prevalence of autistic disorder has increased in recent surveys and current estimates of prevalence are around 20/10,000, whereas the prevalence for PDD not otherwise specified is around 30/10,000 in recent surveys. Prevalence of Asperger disorder is much lower than that for autistic disorder and childhood disintegrative disorder is a very rare disorder with a prevalence of about 2/100,000. Combined all together, recent studies that have examined the whole spectrum of PDDs have consistently provided estimates in the 60-70/10,000 range, making PDD one of the most frequent childhood neurodevelopmental disorders.Notice how the two types of autism that Mr. Robison called out - CDD and Asperger's - are both listed as being rare relative to a overall rate of 60-70 per 10,000. \u00a0The bulk of the cases of autism in this review are either PDD-NOS or classic autism.\n\nThe current rate for the entire spectrum is about 90 per 10,000 and, as the CDC said in its most recent report, the increase from the earlier 60 per 10,000 isn't all in the conditions like Aspergers. \u00a0As a matter of fact, the increases are somewhat spread out but the classic autism category might show a greater increases than the other conditions -\nThe widening of diagnostic criteria over time to include persons who are more mildly affected has been suggested frequently as a factor influencing increases in ASD prevalence. (snip) However, in this analysis, a clear shift was not identified from 2002 to 2006 in the use of the more broadly defined ASD diagnoses. In fact, for several sites, increases were recorded in the use by community professionals of the autism diagnosis rather than the other ASD diagnoses. Another indicator of identifying children on the more mild end of the spectrum would be a differential increase in prevalence among children with borderline or average to above-average cognitive functioning. Although the overall pattern among these higher cognitive functioning groups indicated substantial increases in ASD prevalence, increases also were observed among children with cognitive impairment. Increases varied across sites, and a clear pattern did not emerge that would permit attributing the majority of the increase in ASD prevalence to the use of the broader ASD spectrum.So for Mr. Robison to suggest that any significant part of the increase in autism is due to CDD or that we have absolutely no idea what type of autism is increasing is disingenuous at best and intellectually dishonest at worst.\u00a0\u00a0What is he doing serving on the scientific committee of Autism Speaks if he can't even get the basic facts right?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh5.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SpNUhW9YJTI/AAAAAAAAACk/BwDLiC1I9Y4/s1600/ApplesDucks.jpg", "//www.blogger.com/profile/07407165016025447113", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/overview/advisory_boards/scientific_advisory_board.php", "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2010/08/alex-plank-sycophantic-saga-continues.html", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/08/09/the-importance-of-studying-environmental-factors-in-asd/", "http://childstudycenter.yale.edu/autism/cdd.html", "http://www.agre.org/program/criteria.cfm?do=program", "http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Childhood-disintegrative-disorder.html", "http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/childhood-disintegrative-disorder/DS00801/DSECTION=symptoms", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12083281", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19218885", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19218885", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5810a1.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/08/does-john-elder-robison-understand.html", "title": "\nDoes John Elder Robison Understand Autism Prevalence?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 21, 2010", "body": "\nLast time I talked about a recent study that looked at adults with severe intellectual disability (ID) in a city in Iceland and found that a decent number of them had undiagnosed autism.  The numbers are fairly small (25 cases) but then again, so is the city that we are talking about (population 70,001).  \n\nBut still, if this many cases of autism were missed in a population that presumably receives a lot of medical care, does that mean that there would be an equal or greater number of cases missed in the general population?  Is there really a hidden horde of adults with autism?  The data from the last study doesn't directly answer this question but that hasn't stopped some people from speculating that this study helps provide the answer.\n\nSo lets look at what numbers to see what we can possibly gleam from the study.  As you read the following, please keep in mind that most of this is speculative in nature and could easily be completely wrong.\n\nLets start off with some basic assumptions.\n\nThe study talks about \"adults\" with severe ID and autism, but what does the label \"adult\" mean here?  It is always important to know how old the \"adults\" are and when they were born.  Any adult population that you are looking at should have an autism prevalence in line with the rest of their generation.  That means if we are talking about \"adults\" born after the mid 1980s when the autism rates started shooting up we could reasonably expect then to have a higher autism rate than \"adults\" who were born in the 1960s.\n\nThe study says that the age range of the participants was from 18 to 67 years old, but it isn't exactly clear what these ages are in reference to.  In one location the study seems to give the ages in reference to the year 2000 but then the results were not submitted for publication until this year.  I can't believe that all of the data collection was done in 2000 and it has taken ten years to analyze the data.  So based on the dates, the youngest participant was born sometime between 1982 and 1992.  When you consider the fact that the majority of the cases found were younger (under 32), that means we are likely looking at people born between the the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s.  \n\nThe next assumption is how many people with autism we expected to find.  Fortunately, we have a study that looked at autism rates in Iceland during two different time period - 1974 to 1983 and 1983 to 1993.  During the first time period the rate was approximately 3.8 per 10,000 while during the second it was 8.6 per 10,000.  \n\nOne thing to note here is that the diagnosis during the earlier time period were largely based on an earlier version of the diagnostic criteria (ICD-9 vs ICD-10).  The earlier criteria did not have as broad of a definition of autism and focused more heavily on people who would have had cognitive problems in addition to autism.\n\nSo, with that in mind, we get to the first question.\n\nDid the initial number of people with autism in the severe ID population agree with the what the earlier estimates were for the time period?  We know that the prevalence was thought to be 3.8 per 10,000 in the \"adults\" born between 1974 and 1983 which means that we would expect to find a total of 26 people with autism.  The study initially had 13 people with autism - 11 in the population examined (119) and 2 in the part of the population that was not included (if you care about the details, ask in the comments and I can elaborate).  \n\nThere would be two other groups of people with autism - those in the population with mild ID and those in the general population who didn't have ID.  I don't have an exact figure for how many people have ID, but an accepted range seems to be between 1% and 3% of the population.  Based on some discussion on the study, I am thinking that number in Iceland is little under 1% or approximately an additional 444 people with mild ID.\n\nWe know that autism is much more common in severe ID than in milder ID and it was present in about 5% of the severe cases. \u00a0Lets assume that the rate is about half in the milder cases which would mean about an additional 11 cases. \u00a0That brings the total to 24, but we aren't done yet.\n\nThe last part of the puzzle is how many people with autism are expected to have a form of ID.  Again, there are no good numbers here but for now I am going to go with a rate of 80% as we are talking about the earlier criteria (again, if you are curious about this number, ask in the comments and I will try to explain).  \n\nGiven this 80% number there would be an additional 6 cases which would bring the total up to 30 cases.  That number is higher than the 26 that we would have expected, but considering the estimations used, the numbers aren't too far off.\n\nWhich brings us to the next question - what does the increase in the number of cases in the severe ID group mean for the entire population?  \n\nSince the second part of the study only examined half of the severe population, I am going to use the 21% rate that the researchers gave for the severe ID group and about 10% for the milder ID group.  Putting these two figures together means that we would expect about 100 people with ID to have autism.\n\nI used an 80% figure for the number of people with autism and ID in the earlier estimate, but for this estimate I am going to drop it.  The reason is that we are talking about current diagnostic criteria which includes many milder cases of autism and we have some recent estimates from the CDC that we can use.  The estimates from the CDC vary depending on the state you are looking at and how broad your definition of ID is.  The highest estimate using the broadest definition of ID is about 80% while the lowest using the narrowest definition of ID is about 30%.  \n\nFor the sake of simplicity, I am going to take the 41% figure that the CDC cites as an average.  Using that figure, we arrive at a total of about 245 people with autism.  This is a rate of about 35 per 10,000.\n\nThe final question is what would we have expected to find if autism is as common in adults as it is in children?\n\nLooking back at some of the estimates from the few years, you would see numbers like 1 in 250, 1 in 150, and, most recently, 1 in 110.  Those numbers translate into 40 per 10,000, 66 per 10,000 and 90 per 10,000. \n\nSo the answer is\u00a035 per 10,000 compared to 90 per 10,000\n\nOr in other words, the most recent estimate for autism is still 3 times higher than an aggressive extrapolation based on the data in the study.  \n\nThe bottom line is that the hidden horde is still in hiding\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/07/more-unidentified-autistic-adults-found", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11450814", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/07/hidden-horde-still-in-hiding.html", "title": "\nThe Hidden Horde Still In Hiding\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, September 26, 2010", "body": "\nEarlier this month, an opinion post appeared on the \"Autism Speaks Official Blog\" that talked about the differences between Asperger's Syndrome and Autism.  The opinion post was written by one Hannah Fjeldsted, a college senior who has Asperger Syndrome.  The entire post was about how the Ms. Fjeldsted feels that grouping people with Asperger's (aka \"aspies\") in people with autism is somehow an insult and degrading to them.\n\nI guess the irony of being an advocate for the acceptance of people with Asperger's while at the same time bashing their less fortunate peers is somehow lost on her.\n\nWith this rant, Ms. Fjeldsted joins the growing ranks of aspie bigots who think that they are better than the rest of the people on the spectrum and should not be lumped in with \"them\".  Like other bigots before her, Ms. Fjeldsted is laboring under the false impression that Asperger's Syndrome is currently a separate condition from the other types of autism and that the upcoming DSM V is going to force people with Asperger's to be lumped in with the rest of the spectrum.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth.  \n\nAsperger's is already, by definition, a form of autism.  It is included in the current DSM IV under the pervasive developmental disorder category along with autism, pdd-nos, Rett Syndrome, and childhood disintegrative disorder.  It is this group of conditions that make up what is typically called the \"autism spectrum\".\n\nSo sorry Ms. Fjeldsted, if you have a diagnosis of Asperger's you are already one of \"them\".\n\nFactual problems aside, the rant is quite entertaining in its own way, with some breathtaking statement of intolerance such as -\nAs someone with Asperger\u2019s, I am strongly opposed to this proposal and I firmly believe that autism and Asperger\u2019s should continue to be classified separately. This proposal will do more harm than good because it will further perpetuate stereotypes and misunderstandings about Asperger\u2019s, it will serve as an insult and a mockery to those who are severely affected by Asperger\u2019s, it will cause further confusion and ambiguity in diagnostics, and it will attack the identity in which many Aspies, like me, take pride.and\nFirst of all, many Aspies already suffer enough from the negative stigma and stereotypes society holds against them. To call Asperger\u2019s \u201chigh-functioning autism\u201d or \u201ca form of autism\u201d will only contribute to this stigma. The label of Asperger\u2019s at least gives observers the impression of intelligence and ability. But, when most people think of \u201cautism,\u201d they think of someone who should be institutionalized and cannot live independently. Therefore, if people with Asperger\u2019s are merged under the autistic group, brilliantly gifted and capable individuals could be unfairly stereotyped as incapable and unprofitable.You really have to read the whole piece to get the complete picture, these snippets cannot do it justice.  The overall tone is elitist and the whole thing is one big insult and stereotype aimed squarely at people who suffer most from autism.\n\nI am not the only one who found this post insulting and, in what is probably a record for the Autism Speaks blog, there are 74 comments on the post, the overwhelming majority of them being highly critical.  \n\nI am not sure what I find to be more troubling here - the fact that there are so many aspie bigots like Ms. Fjeldsted out there or that Autism Speaks gave one of them a platform for their bigotry.  \n\nTo its discredit, Autism Speaks did respond to the angry comments with a comment of their own -\nIt is noted that these words are the opinion of the author, not necessarily representative of Autism Speaks. We aim to present a variety of opinions from members of our community. The author\u2019s viewpoint is simply that \u2013 her opinions.So their response was a very lame \"we didn't say she did\".  While I can understand that people have a variety of opinions, Autism Speaks should not be in the business of giving a platform to an opinion that is insulting and demeaning to the group that they are supposed to be serving.  Autism Speaks needs to grow a pair and take a stand against stupidity like this.  Bigotry against people who suffer from autism is not a valid viewpoint.\n\nI wish I could say that opinions like Ms. Fjeldsted's are rare, but they seem to be becoming increasingly common.  I think the neurodiversity movement is in large part to blame for this with their absurd notion of autism being just a difference.  It is one thing to accept people as people, limitations at all, but completely another to romanticize a medical condition like autism.  Autism is a very serious development disorder that causes major problems for those affected.  It is a medical condition that requires treatment and a cure, not some civil rights movement.\n\nSo Hannah Fjeldsted, if you want to take pride in being an \"aspie\" and want think of it as you \"identity\" and don't want to be lumped in with those others, you know, the ones that belong in institutions, here is my suggestion. \n\nGet the hell off the spectrum and go find some other group of disabled people to insult. \u00a0People with autism and their caretakers have enough to worry about without having to deal with your bigotry.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/09/04/itow-fjeldsted/", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/09/25/itow-what-is-autism/", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/09/04/itow-fjeldsted/#comment-7033"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/09/aspie-bigotry-at-autism-speaks-blog.html", "title": "\nAspie Bigotry at Autism Speaks Blog\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 8, 2010", "body": "\nA few weeks ago, an epidemic of whooping cough (Pertussis) was declared in California.  As of June 30th, five infants have died and a total of 1,337 cases have been confirmed.  The majority of these cases (89%) have been in infants less than six months old.  As the number of cases is well over the number of cases that had been seen at this time last year in California (258), an epidemic was declared and health authorities are actively trying to encourage vaccination in an effort to curtail the spread.\n\nFirst let me say that the death or illness of any child, especially when it could have been prevented, is a tragedy and my heart goes out to those families that have been affected.\n\nI would normally not write about a subject like this because I feel it is crass to talk about a family's tragedy. \u00a0However, there are certain other parties who don't seem to feel the same and are using this epidemic to score rhetorical points against the so-called anti-vax movement.  Some of these people are suggesting that the deaths of the infants are because of the fear of vaccines while others are just suggesting that the current epidemic was worsened by this movement.\n\nI think that using this outbreak to further your propaganda is quite simply wrong, especially when you don't even bother to get the facts correct. \u00a0So, to set the record straight, I wanted to point out a few simple things.\n\nAccording to the CDC, pertussis outbreaks follow a cyclical pattern with larger peaks happening every three to five years.  In general, the number of cases of pertussis have been on the rise since the 1980s \u00a0and outbreaks like this are not uncommon.  The last peak was in 2005 when approximately 25,000 cases were reported in the US and 3,000 cases in California.  As of June 2005, there were 1,261 cases in California which means the current outbreak is just sightly ahead of 2005.  \n\nThe majority of the people who are getting pertussis this time are too young to have received the vaccine or to be fully vaccinated.  Or to put this bluntly, the majority of the cases were not directly caused by parents refusing to vaccinate their children. \u00a0In children old enough to get the vaccine, the rate of vaccination in California is high, somewhere north of 95%.\n\nThat means that the problem is the people surrounding these very young children, these are the ones that are passing the illness to them.  When there is a population that cannot get a vaccine for one reason or another, the goal is to vaccinate enough other people around them to prevent the illness from spreading - this is called herd immunity.  This is an area where we will have to wait for data from CDC to be certain of what is going on, but I can make a few educated guesses.\n\nFirst, the current vaccine does not provide long-lasting protection as the immunity gained from vaccines gradually fades over 6 to 10 years.  This means that the majority of teenagers and adults do not have protection against pertussis making these populations the perfect staging ground. \u00a0And in fact, the majority of the cases over the past years have been centered in these groups and there\u00a0is also some evidence that pertussis actively circulates in these populations in a milder form that might not be as readily\u00a0noticed.\n\nSecond, according to the CDC, the current vaccine might not provide as effective as older vaccines were at providing immunity.  To further complicate matters, the pertussis bacteria might be mutating into forms that are not covered by the existing vaccine. \u00a0There is a new version of the vaccine that was approved earlier this year that might help this situation.\n\nThird, there are some hints that this outbreak is mostly impacting a population that, for social reasons, might not have as good vaccine coverage as would be expected.  \n\nWhen you put these facts together you are left with an illness that is increasing and has regular outbreaks and a vaccine that does not provide lasting immunity while at the same time loosing effectiveness in the cases that it does cover.  I don't think it takes a genius to see what is happening here and it isn't that pesky \"anti-vax\" movement.  \n\nBut, if you live in California and are around young children or other vulnerable populations and have not had a recent vaccination against whooping cough, now might be a good time to visit your doctor.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh3.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SrmRHcqkJ-I/AAAAAAAAADM/0cAcTUk5WG8/s1600/vac.png", "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/us/24cough.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/us/24cough.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5926a5.htm?s_cid=mm5926a5_x", "http://www.theautismnews.com/2010/06/25/whooping-cough-re-ignites-the-vaccine-debate/", "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/calif-whooping-cough-outbreak-due-to-anti-vaccine-movement", "http://autismsciencefoundation.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/real-guys-immunize/", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5926a5.htm?s_cid=mm5926a5_x", "http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/dis-faqs.htm", "http://www.countyofsb.org/uploadedFiles/phd/dc/2010-6-21%20Pertussis%20Epidemic%20Provider%20Alert%20Pertussis%20_3_.pdf", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5541a3.htm#tab2", "http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000291", "http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/2/297.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5909a2.htm", "http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/us/24cough.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/07/rhetoric-about-pertussis-epidemic.html", "title": "\nThe Rhetoric about the Pertussis Epidemic\n"},

Sure, vaccines are important and do safe many lives each year. \u00a0But at the same time, there are times when vaccines aren't a good idea either. \n\nTo make an important decision like this you need to understand the issues, the benefits, the risks, and, most importantly, how these factors apply to your child's specific situation. \u00a0What you don't need is a an advocacy group attempting to goad you into blindly following their lead by telling you that you aren't a \"real guy\". \n\nAll of the \"real\" guys out there know better than to respond to name calling and peer-pressure. \u00a0All of the \"real\" guys should know that is is far more important to do what is in the best interest of your child rather than to blindly adhere to a one-size-fits-all campaign like this.\n\nOn in other words, real guys think.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//4.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TBq2LkJNF8I/AAAAAAAAAPk/Ef_lyP7aJz4/s1600/graphic_dumb_guy.gif", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/real-guys-immunize/", "http://autismsciencefoundation.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/real-guys-immunize/", "http://www.vaccinatenow.org/realguysimmunize/", "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wuse"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/06/real-guys-think.html", "title": "\nReal Guys Think\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, June 17, 2010", "body": "\nOne of the problems you run into when researching autism on the Internet is skewed and biased reporting of scientific subjects.  There are too many sites that present information from their own biased viewpoints and ignore inconvenient facts that get in the way of how they want to look at the world.  You always need to consider the source of anything you read (that goes double for what you read here).\n\nOne of the worst offenders of late has been Left Brain Right Brain and their obsession to prove all things biomedical wrong.  Take for example this recent post Study Finds Supplements Contain Contaminants that starts off with -\nA story in the New York Times by Gardiner Harris discusses the results of a Congressional investigation on dietary supplements. Many were found to be contaminated with heavy metals and/or pesticides:Right off the bat, you get the impression that we are talking about \"dietary supplements\".  When it comes to autism, the phrase \"dietary supplements\" usually refers to vitamins, minerals, and other products (such a probiotics) that are designed to help support bodily functions. \u00a0And the first impression is that a congressional investigation found that these supplements are contaminated with heavy metals or pesticides.\n\nUnfortunately, that impression is wrong and I will get to why in a moment.  The post on LBRB continues with some highly selected quotes from the report, and then adds this about the Kirkman recall earlier this year -\nEarlier this year, Kirkman Labs (who markets their supplements towards the autism parent community) was found to have a number of supplements contaminated with antimony.And there you have the tie back to autism - dietary supplements are contaminated, Kirkman had a contamination problem, therefore dietary supplements in general can be dangerous.\n\nBut here is the rub - the congressional report did not look at companies like Kirkman that make what amount to specialized vitamin products.  Instead, the report dealt with \"herbal dietary supplements\" - specifically chamomile, echinacea, garlic, ginkgo biloba, and ginseng - and how they are marketed to elderly consumers.  The report found that some companies were making illegal claims about what their products would do and that some products had detectable levels of undesirable heavy metals and/or chemicals.  If you want the exact details, go and read the report yourself.\n\nIf you were paying attention to the list of \"supplements\" tested, you would have noticed that none of them are common supplements given to children with autism (as far as I know). \u00a0You might have also noticed that most of them are grown. \u00a0Hmm, where do you think plants would pick up heavy metals or pesticides? \u00a0If the report had looked at contamination in raw garlic in the grocery store, what do you think the \u00a0results would have been? \u00a0And the bonus question, why do many people try to buy organic products for their children with autism?\n\nIf you looked a little closer at the report, you would have also noticed that vitamins and mineral \"supplements\" are strangely absent from the list of products tested.  There was not a single vitamin tested nor was there a single product from Kirkman.  Yet, the post on LBRB ties the two together and implies that companies like Kirkman have regular contamination problems.\n\nFacts, mean ideology, ideology, ignore facts.\n\nIf you want a less biased presentation of this report, I would suggest this post on Julie's Health Club.  \n\nIn the meantime always consider the source.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh5.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TA76cd_Fp8I/AAAAAAAAAPI/fzFFsCrkxl4/s1600/fail.jpg", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/05/study-finds-supplements-contain-contaminants/", "http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-662T", "http://www.autism.com/fam_ratingsbehaviorbiomedical.asp#", "http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_julieshealthclub/2010/05/supplements-watch-out-for-deceptive-claims-.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/06/watch-out-for-biased-science.html", "title": "\nWatch Out for Biased Science\n"},

And personal experience will always color our choices.  But hopefully most of us will take a moment to review the evidence before assuming that our personal experience is sufficient to fully understand the causes, treatments, and science of autism.OK, fair enough. You do have to consider the fact that what you think you saw might not have actually happened and that the scientific method does yield more accurate results.  But then in the comment, she goes on to say that -\nNor am I hopeful that we will suddenly discover a key to \u201crecovery\u201d \u2013 especially since, in the vast majority of cases, I don\u2019t think people with autism are injured (and so they have nothing to recover FROM).This doesn't strike me at a particularly\u00a0scientific\u00a0statement. \u00a0I can't help but wonder if the source of the statement isn't other peoples opinions of autism. \u00a0Maybe I missed the study that just discovered this. \u00a0But wait, the\u00a0coup de grace comes later in another comment when she apparently forgets the point of her own post and says -\nPersonally, I take most scientific studies with a grain of salt because I know that the people funding, setting up, conducting and interpreting the studies all have their own perspectives and agendas. But that doesn\u2019t mean I feel that the scientific method is worthless.And all I can say is what the ?!?!? \n\nWe can't trust personal experiences and we should take studies with a grain of salt, so that leaves what, religion? \u00a0Is it time to go to church to find out what we should believe about autism? \u00a0I hear there is a new\u00a0chapel\u00a0of Neurodiversity opening soon.\n\nAnd moving right along, we come to the launch of the hug zone, as announced on the\u00a0premier\u00a0anti- anti-vaccine pseduo-science site, Left Brain Right Brain. \u00a0They are running a shameless (self) plug for a new \"blog/book project\" called \"The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism\". \u00a0This is apparently a new blog that has all of two posts so far but describes itself like so -\nThe Thinking Person's Guide to Autism (TPGA) is the book and website we wish had been available when our children with autism were first diagnosed. We want to help people with autism and their families make sense of the bewildering array of available autism treatments and options, and determine which are worth their time, money, and energy.OK, so you want to tell me what the best treatments for my children are? \u00a0Given the incredible breath of problems associated with autism and the diversity of possible treatments geared to deal with them, how exactly do you intend to do that? \u00a0Maybe you should know a little bit more about my (or other people's) children's specific needs before presuming to offer advice on what would be worthwhile for them?\n\nBut then it gets even funnier -\nThink of us as a little bit of Snopes for the autism community -- trusted, accurate, and friendly.Of course, trusted, accurate, and friendly - since you told me you are, I guess I have to take your word for it. \u00a0LRBR is plugging it, so it has to be err, trusted and accurate. \u00a0And of course, we all know how friendly LBRB is.... \u00a0Uhm, this wouldn't be a you\u00a0scratch\u00a0my back I scratch yours sort of thing, would it? \u00a0Hmm, I wonder what other blogs they link to\u00a0- Autism Science Foundation, Kristina Chew,\u00a0Left Brain Right Brain .... No, no sign of back scratching or an ideological bias here.\n\nBut the plug \u00a0from LBRB still bothers me. \u00a0Those folk aren't know for a rational approach to autism and are very firmly in the deny-its-a-disability ND \"acceptance\" camp. \u00a0This isn't going to be yet another autism is great site, is it? \u00a0You will be publishing articles that talk about the real challenges of dealing with autism and are honest about the science behind autism. \u00a0Wait, what's that tagline on the header on your site?\nInformed decisions made with loveOf course, because what's a thinking person's guide if the decisions aren't based in love? \u00a0We all know that those \"other\" people aren't thinking people at all AND they clearly don't love their children. \u00a0But if I read your trusted, accurate, and friendly site you will tell me exactly what treatments are worth the \"time, money, and energy\" AND I get to love my children too? \u00a0Where do I drink the kool-aid?\n\nYou gotta love Mondays.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm1.static.flickr.com/52/114393497_99dcf9a7ca_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/43169829@N00/114393497", "http://autism.about.com/b/2010/06/06/personal-experience-v-science-and-the-autism-parent.htm", "http://autism.about.com/b/2010/06/06/personal-experience-v-science-and-the-autism-parent.htm#comment-6", "http://autism.about.com/b/2010/06/06/personal-experience-v-science-and-the-autism-parent.htm#comment-45", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/06/the-thinking-persons-guide-to-autism/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2010/06/autism-resources-for-thinking-person.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/06/muddled-monday-church-and-astroturf.html", "title": "\nMuddled Monday : Church and Astroturf\n"},

There are a number of factions out there in the community, and it seems like none of them trust the others.\n\nThere are parents who feel that vaccines cause autism, and they don't trust the medical establishment.  There are parents out there who feel that autism is a gift, and they don't trust anyone who thinks that autism is a disease.  And then there are the rest of the parents who don't really care about ideology but are just trying to help their children overcome their autism, they don't trust people with an ideological axe to grind.\n\nThere are high functioning adults and adolescents who feel that autism is their identity, and they too don't like anyone who says anything bad about autism.  Then there are the adults with autism who are actually disabled by it, they tend not to trust people trying to whitewash autism.  And then there are the rest of the lower functioning people with autism, and we don't really what they think because they lack the skills to speak for themselves in society.\n\nThen there is the medical community, and they don't trust anything that didn't pass the popularity contest and get published in a journal.\n\nAnd of course, then there is everybody else who doesn't fit into one of the nice, tidy categories above.  But the point is most of these groups don't don't trust the other groups.  Sometimes this lack of trust can be reasonable, while other times, it is not.  \n\nTake for example, a recent post on Age of Autism concerning the lead author of a recent genetic study - \"Scherer of Nature Autism Gene Study Fails to Disclose Pharma Funding As Competing Interest\". \u00a0The point of the post is that the lead author on the study holds the \"GlaxoSmithKline-CIHR Pathfinder Chair in Genetics and Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children and University of Toronto\" and, since vaccines cause autism, this relationship should have been declared as a conflict of interest in the paper - at least according to AoA.\n\nThe only problem is that this paper had nothing to do with vaccines, gut problems, or any environmental factor that could be involved in causing autism.  The study in Nature was about rare genetic variants that might be linked to autism.  This paper really had no relationship to vaccines whatsoever and yet AoA still jumped on the researchers simply because they published on autism and possibly had funding from a vaccine maker.\n\nIt would be easy enough to dismiss this post as the entire premise is rather flimsy, but I think it might be more useful to take a step back and ask why AoA published it at all.  I believe the problem is, quite simply, a complete lack of trust in the medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nI can understand why this community would have their doubts about companies that make vaccines, but at the same time, most things are not going to be a conspiracy to cover up a possible relation between vaccines and autism.  This was a pure genetics study and nothing in it precluded a possible role for vaccines in causing autism, yet it was still denounced because of a tenuous tie to a vaccine company. \n\nMaybe it is time to put down the ideology and stop looking for a conspiracy in everything.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/06/scherer-of-nature-autism-gene-study-fails-to-disclose-pharma-funding-as-competing-interest.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/06/not-everything-is-conspiracy.html", "title": "\nNot Everything is a Conspiracy\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, May 22, 2010", "body": "\n\nFlickr photo by andypowe11According to a new study in Pediatrics, there might be a relationship between exposure to certain pesticides and ADHD.  The study found that children who had a higher level of organophosphate pesticide by-products in their urine were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of ADHD.\n\nThe study is freely available, so if you are interested I suggest you read it from yourself.\n\nThe first question that came to mind when I read this study is exactly what is an\u00a0organophosphate pesticide. \u00a0An organophosphate pesticide is a type of insecticide that is widely used in agriculture, the home, gardens, an veterinary practice. \u00a0These pesticides work by disrupting the normal function of the nervous system and affect people as well as insects (some\u00a0organophosphates\u00a0were used in World War II as nerve agents).  However, these chemicals do not persist for long in the environment so are thought to be safer than the chemicals that they replaced (such as DDT). \n\nIn this study there\u00a0were a total of 1,139 children between the ages of 8 and 15. \u00a0Of these children,\u00a0119 met strict criteria for ADHD while an additional 30 children did not currently met the criteria but were on medications for ADHD.  Since ADHD, like autism, is behavioral based diagnosis you need to consider those children whose behaviors are currently being controlled by medication and don't currently appear to have ADHD.  The prevalence of ADHD in these children was about 12.1% percent which is slightly higher than the national average but isn't too far out of line.\n\nThink about that number for a minute - one out of every ten children has a form of ADHD.  You may be one of those people who think that this diagnosis is overused or that this is just an excuse for misbehaving children, and I am sure that there is some of that going on.  But ADHD, like autism, is a large problem in this country and awareness and/or other social factors cannot account for the scope and magnitude of the growth. \n\nAll of the children in the study had a urine sample collected and these samples were analyzed to try to determine exposure to a organophosphate pesticides.  Since these chemicals are broken down by the body, the researchers could not directly measure the exposure level in the urine.  Instead the researchers looked at the levels of 6 different metabolites (by-products).  The majority of children (94%) had a detectable level of at least one of the metabolites, meaning that the majority had at least some exposure to these pesticides.\n\nThe researchers found that children with a higher levels of these metabolites had a greatly increased chance of having ADHD, even after taking into account gender, race, income level, body mass index (BMI), blood lead level, maternal age at birth, and maternal smoking during pregnancy.  The exact risks varied from depending on the metabolite in question and varied from a low of 20% greater chance (odds ratio 1.21) all the way to a 100% greater chance (odds ratio 2.09).  \n\nThe interesting thing to me is that these children had what would be considered an \"average\" level of exposure to these pesticides.  The majority of the exposure in these children is thought to be from dietary sources and residential usage.  Or in other words, most children in the US would have a similar level of exposure.\n\nOn the flip side, there are some potential problems with the study.\n\nThe result is based on a single urine sample and measures exposure at a specific point in time.  Since these chemicals are thought to be cleared from the body in a matter of days, this sample would only measure short term exposure and does not mean that the at-risk children had a continuing higher exposure.\n\nThe other problem is that this study does not establish what the nature of the relationship is - it does not say that higher exposure to pesticides causes ADHD.  It is possible that children with ADHD have behaviors that give them a higher exposure, perhaps by favoring a certain type of food.  Or perhaps the relationship is just a fluke of the data set.\n\nRegardless, this is definitely something that needs to be researched further.\n\nReferences\n\n1: Bouchard MF, Bellinger DC, Wright RO, Weisskopf MG.\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Urinary Metabolites of Organophosphate Pesticides.

We report results from a two-stage, 24-month, randomised, controlled trial incorporating an adaptive 'catch-up' design and interim analysis. Stage 1 of the trial saw 72 Danish children (aged 4 years to 10 years 11 months) assigned to diet (A) or non-diet (B) groups by stratified randomisation. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS) were used to assess core autism behaviours, Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) to ascertain developmental level, and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - IV scale (ADHD-IV) to determine inattention and hyperactivity. Participants were tested at baseline, 8, and 12 months. Based on per protocol repeated measures analysis, data for 26 diet children and 29 controls were available at 12 months. At this point, there was a significant improvement to mean diet group scores (time*treatment interaction) on sub-domains of ADOS, GARS and ADHD-IV measures. Surpassing of predefined statistical thresholds as evidence of improvement in group A at 12 months sanctioned the re-assignment of group B participants to active dietary treatment. Stage 2 data for 18 group A and 17 group B participants were available at 24 months. Multiple scenario analysis based on inter- and intra-group comparisons showed some evidence of sustained clinical group improvements although possibly indicative of a plateau effect for intervention. Our results suggest that dietary intervention may positively affect developmental outcome for some children diagnosed with ASD. In the absence of a placebo condition to the current investigation, we are, however, unable to disqualify potential effects derived from intervention outside of dietary changes. Further studies are required to ascertain potential best- and non-responders to intervention.

However, magnetic resonance imaging analyses revealed significant reductions in cortical gray matter in flu-exposed animals. Regional analyses indicated the largest gray matter reductions occurred bilaterally in cingulate and parietal areas; white matter was also reduced significantly in the parietal lobe.In other words, the offspring of the monkey's that were exposed to the flu had a 4 - 7 percent decrease in the number of cells in the\u00a0cerebral\u00a0cortex and these differences may be permanent. \u00a0What is interesting is that it doesn't appear that the flu virus that caused the problems but rather the mother's response to it -\nMaternal infections were mild and self-limiting.

In primates, including humans, the inflammatory response is more pronounced in the third trimester of pregnancy, the time when the animals in the new study were infected.\u00a0This is not the first piece of research to show that a pregnant women's immune response can effect the developing fetus and I am sure it is not going to be the last. \u00a0 The kicker is the authors suggestion based on the research -\nThe take-home message of the research, Coe argues, has compelling public health implications: Pregnant women or those who expect to conceive during flu season should be vaccinated. Flu vaccinations are widely regarded in the medical community and by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as safe for pregnant women.\u00a0I know that this isn't necessarily bad advice. But, I have to point out, what exactly is it that vaccines do if not stimulate an immune response? \u00a0The reaction might not be as strong as it would be to the full flu but at the same time the current research doesn't deal with the strength of the immune response, just the fact that there is a response. \n\nSounds like more research is needed (what else is new).\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/", "http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/bps/article/S0006-3223(09)01419-X/abstract", "http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/177132.php"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/01/pregnancy-flu-might-be-bad.html", "title": "\nPregnancy + flu might be bad\n"},

{"date": "Sunday, January 17, 2010", "body": "\n\nPicking up where I left off last time ...\n\nGastrointestinal problems can lead to problematic behaviors such as sleep disturbances, vocal or motor behaviors, aggression, or self-injury in people with autism.  It is sometimes difficult to relate these behaviors back to an underlying condition however it is important that care providers consider the possibility that these behaviors could be caused by gastrointestinal symptoms.  Care providers need to become more aware of what the typical and atypical signs and symptoms are in people with autism.  \n\nPrimary care providers also need to be alert to potential nutritional problems in patients with autism.  Children with autism are known to be picky eaters and restricted diets might be nutritionally inadequate.  However, even children who are not on a restricted diet have been shown to have nutritional problems.  \n\nStrangely, this is one of the areas where the panel does not call for additional research.  My opinion is that this area is critical to understanding the role of gastrointestinal dysfunction in autism.  If a child has a problem absorbing nutrients from their diet there are going to developmental consequences.  \n\nMoving along, we come to what is probably the most cited part of the report, the section on special diets.  I think the exact wording of this section is important so I am going to include it -\n\n\"Anecdotal reports have suggested that there may be a subgroup of individuals with ASDs who respond to dietary intervention.  Additional data are needed before pediatricians and other professionals can recommend specific dietary modifications.\"  \n\n\"Available research data do not support the use of a casein-free diet, a gluten-free diet, or combined glutenfree, casein-free (GFCF) diet as a primary treatment for individuals with ASDs.\"\n\nNotice what the panel is actually saying here - there are some anecdotal (parental) reports that suggest that diets work in subsets but there is not enough evidence to recommend using the diet as a primary treatment for autism.  This is not a blanket statement that diets don't work but rather a qualified on that there is some reason to believe that a certain subset of people with autism could benefit from special diet.  However, modern medicine will not (and should not) recommend a treatment based solely on anecdotal data and so the panel does not recommend it.  \n\nSo, contrary to what is suggested by media reports, the problem isn't that research has looked at the question and found that diets don't work but rather that the the question has not been properly examined as of yet.  The panel does give some suggestions on how a trial of a special diet should be conducted but does not call for additional research in this area.  Go figure.\n\nThe report goes onto talk about how care providers should look compile a detailed history of their patients and look for physical signs of food allergies to identify potential associations between exposure and behavioral symptoms.  A guide on how to evaluate and treat common gastrointestinal problems with children with autism published in the same issue of Pediatrics.  \n\nI want to call out one other statement that was made concerning gastrointestinal symptoms and autism because it runs directly counter to what you will often see quoted on the Internet -\n\n\"The patient's parents, teachers, or other caretakers are an important source of information, because they are in a position to observe an association between exposure and the person's response\"\n\nGot that? \u00a0Parents DO have some idea what they are talking about. \n\nThere are a few points in the report on how there is a possible link between immune dysfunction and autism but that this is (yet another) area that needs further study.  But that is a topic for another time.\n\nThe report concludes with how it is likely that there is more than one type of autism.  Given the differences in people with autism and the conflicting research findings \"it is likely, therefore, that different pathogenic mechanisms underlie ASDs in individuals who have received this diagnosis\". \n\nSo there you have it, in three rather long parts, what this report says rather than the simplistic version presented in the media.  If you have made it here and read all three parts, I think you deserve a gold star.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh6.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/Sn9MzK7G9HI/AAAAAAAAAAU/7bsdsOKrWLE/s1600/GFCF.jpg", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/125/Supplement_1/S19"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/01/consensus-report-on-gastrointestinal_17.html", "title": "\nConsensus Report on Gastrointestinal Disorders in Autism, Part 3\n"},

When you are so sure that you have all of the answers or don't want to consider that you could be wrong, it is an undeniable sign that you need to pull your head out of your posterior section and think about what you are doing.\n\nI am speaking specifically of the shinning example of the neurodiversity movement, Left Brain Right Brain.  As I said several months back, this once decent site has been on a downward spiral and they seem to have taken a new step down the path towards irrelevance - censorship.\n\nEven though I removed LBRB from the reading list on the side of the page for anonymously stalking a mother who was trying to help her child, I still do occasionally look at what they have to say - mostly for the amusement value (that Sullivan, he is a regular comedian).  The last time that I looked in at the site, I read this post on the DAN! doctors that were being sued as part of a messy divorce.\n\nSullivan was at comedic best, insisting that this law suit was simply because father was lied to by the doctors in question and that the father say that he saw no benefits from the treatments. He spends a lot of time harping on a specific method of testing for the amount of heavy metal in a person's body and how the validity of the test has not been established.  The coup de grace of the entire piece is when he accuses someone else of ignoring the \"real questions\" involved in the case.\n\nThe irony of Sullivan's statements was too much for me and I felt the need to comment.  I pointing out that he ignored the context of the surrounding \"bitter\" divorce and the fact that the mother apparently disagrees with the father about the effectiveness of the treatments.  I thought I was being at least civil in how I expressed my opinion but, like all of the comments I have left on that site in the past several months, this one came up with the \"comment awaiting moderation\" and went into limbo. \n\nThere the comment still sits, awaiting the blessings of whoever moderates the comments over there now.  I don't think it will ever see the light of day.  Sullivan gets so touchy when you point out the gaping holes in his logic.\n\nTo be honest, I don't really care that the comment wasn't published.  Every site has the right to publish the comments that they choose and to not publish the ones that they don't want to.  Commenting is a privilege, not a right.\n\nThe thing that I find interesting is the break from the long standing policy that the site had of publishing all comments and the fact that the apparent policy has been silently changed without any public sign of the change. The site went from a quasi-open discussion to a restricted one without such much as a whimper. \u00a0As I understand it, the censoring of\u00a0contrary\u00a0opinions of one of the things that LBRB complains about when it comes to the Age of Autism site. \u00a0I guess they don't notice the\u00a0hypocrisy when they do what they are complaining about.\n\nAs I said earlier, one of the clearest signs that a site is going down hill is when they start censoring other opinions. \u00a0Left Brain Right Brain is definitely going down hill and at the rate they are going, they are going to hit bottom soon.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/03/listen-to-parents-except-when-they-say-things-you-dont-want-to-hear/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/03/left-brain-right-brains-unprovoked.html", "title": "\nLeft Brain Right Brain's Unprovoked Nonsense\n"},

I think this is going to be the case for Dr. Wakefield.  There will be something that he did that could have been done better, something that he said that he might not have, or something that perhaps should have been done differently (Note to self : don't take blood samples and children's birthday parties).\n\nThe GMC has been noodling about the case for over two years now so they are sure to have found something that they can pin on him.  So, I firmly believe that Dr. Wakefield will be found guilty of something.\n\nI don't mean to sound cold or uncaring here - I am sure the issue is very important to the doctor, his family, and his supporters.  I am sure that these people firmly believe that Dr. Wakefield has done absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nBut that isn't really true.\n\nThere is one thing that Dr. Wakefield did that is beyond doubt - he made the medical establishment think for a short while that vaccines, their\u00a0golden child,\u00a0might have something to do with autism.  They have since manged to convince themselves, rightly or wrongly, that this isn't true. \u00a0But, for at least a little while, he had them scared.  And for that, if no other reason, he is going to be found guilty.\n\nThe question that I find myself asking is how much this will matter to the field of autism.  Fortunately, I don't think it is going to have a large impact.\n\nThe more controversial areas of Dr. Wakefield's research have already been written off but the more grounded idea of a link between gastrointestinal problems and autism lives on.  The proof of this is the consensus report published this month in Pediatrics that (finally) acknowledges that there just might be something worth looking into.  I know that Dr. Wakefield wasn't the first to propose such a relationship but the controversy sounding him has helped by making people more aware of the idea.  \n\nSo, regardless of whether you think that Dr. Wakefield has done something wrong and regardless of whether you think there is any relation between the MMR and autism, I think we should be glad that Dr. Wakefield helped advance the idea that there is a relation between gastrointestinal problems and autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh6.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S1aCdtzVK9I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/uFCG5aajvfw/s144/justice_scales.png", "http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:US_Department_of_Justice_Scales_Of_Justice.gif"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/01/dr-wakefield-will-be-found-guilty-but.html", "title": "\nDr. Wakefield will be found guilty, but does it matter?\n"},

This report was the product of a multidisciplinary panel that met in May of last year.  After reading it, I can honestly say that I think this is report is some of the best news that has come down the pike recently concerning GI issues and autism is a long time.\n\nThe panel basically said that there might well be something to the idea that GI problems are more common in individuals with autism and that, when present, these problems can exacerbate the symptoms of autism.  They also pointed out (numerous times) that children with autism would likely have a hard time communicating that they are experiencing pain and that, left untreated, could lead to problem behaviors.  Of course, they also strongly emphasized that no association has been proven, that the available evidence is badly lacking, and that much more research is needed.\n\nOf course, if you read the news and blog coverage of this report, that isn't the story you will see.  Mostly I found stories like this one Evidence lacking for autism diets, panel says that focus on the \"no evidence for special diets\" line or the ones that say that there is \"no evidence that digestive problems are more common in children with autism\".  The first statement is true and I will get to that is a minute, but the second is just plain wrong.\n\n\u00a0The paper clearly states that the limited (weak) evidence does suggest that GI disorders are more common in autism, saying \"Despite the limitations in type and quality of available evidence, the preponderance of data were consistent with the likelihood of a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders associated with ASDs.\"  The authors hedge this statement by emphasizing that the available data is flawed and more research is needed but this statement is clearly a far cry from \"no evidence\".\n\nAs for the common statement about no evidence that a special diet can help treat autism, well, that is true, but not for the reasons that most people would assume.  The reason that evidence is lacking is not because the question has been examined an no relationship has been found, the reason is that the question has not been examined.  There have been only one or two studied that directly looked at the question and none that done properly.  So perhaps the better way of phrasing the lack of evidence would have been to talk about the fact that it is an unanswered question, not a lack of evidence.\n\nRegardless of what the media has to say about this report, I think this is an important report that possibly marks a turning point in mainstream attitudes about an association between autism and gastrointestinal disorders.

However, we have learned that there are likely many causes for multiple types of ASDs. There may be many different factors that make a child more likely to have an ASD, including environmental, biologic and genetic factors.\nWhat Research Tells Us\nMost scientists agree that genes are one of the risk factors that can make a person more likely to develop an ASD. Studies have shown that:\u00a0\nAmong identical twins, if one child has an ASD, then the other will be affected about 60-96% of the time.\nIn non-identical twins, if one child has an ASD, then the other is affected about 0-24% of the time.\nParents who have a child with an ASD have a 2%\u20138% chance of having a second child who is also affected.\u00a0\n\nASDs tend to occur more often in people who have certain other medical conditions. About 10% of children with an ASD have an identifiable genetic, neurologic, or metabolic disorder, such as:\u00a0\nFragile X syndrome\nTuberous sclerosis\nDown syndrome\nOther chromosomal disorders\u00a0\n\nSome harmful drugs taken during pregnancy also have been linked with a higher risk of ASDs, for example, the prescription drugs thalidomide and valproic acid.\u00a0\nWe know that the once common belief that poor parenting practices cause ASDs is not true.\u00a0\nThere is some evidence that the critical period for developing ASDs occurs before birth. However, concerns about vaccines and infections have led researchers to consider risk factors before and after birth.\nSo there you have it - the CDC has quietly shifted its position and seems ready to look into the biological and environmental side of autism. \n\nIts about damn time.\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/research.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/12/maybe-cdc-finally-is-getting-point.html", "title": "\nMaybe the CDC finally is getting the point?\n"},

It is hard to say what really happened, but there is no doubt that Ms Fisher did contact the hotel hosting the event and did attempt to pressure them into canceling it.  Whether you call that being a \"bully\" or not depends on your definition of the word.\n\nOf course Sullivan also wrote about the outrage over the recent attacks against Dr. David Gorski, aka Orac, aka smearblogger extraordinaire.  For those of you who don't know, the crew at Age of Autism attempted to get the good doctor in trouble at work for failing to disclose possible financial conflicts of interest.  While I don't condone the sort of behavior, I can't help feeling that it is somehow poetic justice.  Using his alias Orac, Dr Gorski has launched many, many, many, many, many, many personal attacks against other people and has smeared other doctor's reputations.  His writing is littered with insults against his opponents, belittling their ideas and impugning their character.  Or in other words, Dr Gorski is one of the bigger bullies out there.\n\nFinally we have the subpoena against blogger Kathleen Seidel.  This is the same Ms Seidel who is involved in the OSR #1 controversy and wrote to the university that Dr. Haley is associated with and attempted to get him into trouble.  Wait, isn't it \"wrong\" to do this?  It certainly was, according to Sullivan, when this happened to Dr Gorski, so I have to wonder what makes Ms Seidel's actions different.\n\nBut the thing that bothered me most about the entire post was the shear audacity it takes for LBRB to talk about bullying with a straight face.  LBRB is known to harbor notorious bullies, such as Clay Adams, and the comment section on the site is filled with attacks against those who don't drink the kool-aid.  Back before they started censoring my comments, I was the target of many attacks and bullying attempts (well, I say target but I mainly just laughed at the attempts).\n\nAnd lets not forget that the site itself also engages in bullying.  There have been a quite a few incidents like the one last year where LBRB ran an article featuring the actions of an anonymous stalker.  This anonymous stalker had, well, stalked a mother online and then wrote a lengthy article belittling her attempts to help her child who has autism.  It that isn't bullying, then I don't know what is.\n\nBullies don't get to complain when their victims fight back.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TDiRxHZypdI/AAAAAAAAAQA/-fD2Kkdj1hs/s1600/bully.png", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/07/what-constitutes-a-blogger-bully/", "http://my-socrates-note.blogspot.com/2010/06/crossing-line.html", "http://autism.about.com/b/2010/07/05/osr1-autism-and-the-web-a-case-study-in-confusion.htm", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/168"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/07/left-brain-right-brain-bullies-on.html", "title": "\nLeft Brain Right Brain : The Bullies On Bullying\n"},
{"date": "Friday, January 15, 2010", "body": "\n\nAs promised (or threatened) last time, I am going to attempt to cover what was said in the consensus report was published last week in Pediatrics.  The report contained 23 statements that covered a wide range of topics relating to gastrointestinal disorders and autism.  \n\nI am going to give a general summary of what the report said with some minimal comments.  If you have access to the report itself, I highly recommend that you read it.  So, without further ado, the report says ...\n\nPeople with autism who have GI symptoms deserve the same treatment for their symptoms as other patients would receive.  Gastrointestinal conditions that are common in \"typical\" individuals are just as common in people with autism.  However, the problem is that people with autism may have a hard time communicating their symptoms effectively and there is a lack of guidelines for how to evaluate someone with an impaired ability to communicate.  Further compounding the problem is the fact that gastrointestinal disorders in people with autism can cause or aggravate other seemingly unrelated problems, problems such as sleep disturbances, irritability, vocal or motor tics, tantrums, aggression, and self injurious behavior.\n\nWhile these may seem like trivial statements, I believe that they are squarely aimed at children's doctors who have grown accustomed to automatically dismissing parental reports of GI symptoms.  The statements are an admonishment to remember that children with autism can have GI problems too, and that these symptoms need to be taken seriously.  Ahem, moving along...\n\nIt is not well understood how common gastrointestinal abnormalities are in autism.  There are studies that show that these abnormalities are very common in people with autism while others say that these abnormalities are no more common than in the general population.  Unfortunately, most of the research that has been done in this area is flawed and that makes it hard to draw any reliable conclusions.  \n\nEven still, based on the evidence that is available today, the preponderance of the data suggest that gastrointestinal symptoms are more common in people with autism than in \"typical\" people.  More research is needed to properly address this question.\n\nBut while it is possible that gastrointestinal symptoms are more common in autism, there is no evidence establishing a gastrointestinal disturbance specific to people with autism.  Specifically, this point  refers to Wakefield's \"autistic entercolitis\" - there simply is not enough direct evidence to support the idea that it exists.  \n\nThis should not come as a surprise to anyone.  I would suggest that the reason for this has more to do with politics than with science.  Given the stigma attached to Wakefield's work, I can understand why other scientists are reluctant to take up this question.  Which is really tragic, because the main thrust of Wakefield's work was that there is a gastrointestinal disturbance that contributes to autism, not that the MMR vaccine causes autism.  Continuing with the paper ...\n\nThe panel found that there is limited evidence of abnormal gastrointestinal permeability (leaky gut) in people with autism.  While some studies have found that this can be an issue in a subset of children, the available evidence is not sufficient to confirm that a abnormal permeability is an issue or that it contributes to autism.  This is yet another area that needs more research.\n\nJust to interject, the idea of a \"leaky gut\" goes to the heart of how some special diets, such as the gluten-free casein-free diet, are thought to work.  It also goes to the heart of why the existing research on dietary interventions in autism are badly flawed.  The idea is that some, but not all, people with autism have GI issues and a subset of this group would benefit from dietary treatments.  Yet the research that has been done has not attempted to locate the subset that would benefit from the diet and has just lumped everyone with autism into one big bucket.  And as most people know, people with autism are nothing if not diverse. \n\nSo far I have covered the controversial parts of the report, next time I will continue with some of the more common sense things the report had to say.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh6.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/Sn9MzK7G9HI/AAAAAAAAAAU/7bsdsOKrWLE/s1600/GFCF.jpg", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/125/Supplement_1/S1"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/01/consensus-report-on-gastrointestinal_15.html", "title": "\nConsensus Report on Gastrointestinal Disorders in Autism, Part 2\n"},

The average prevalence of ASDs identified among children aged 8 years increased 57% in 10 sites from the 2002 to the 2006 ADDM surveillance year. Although improved ascertainment accounts for some of the prevalence increases documented in the ADDM sites, a true increase in the risk for children to develop ASD symptoms cannot be ruled out.Looks strangely like the lines that we have been hearing for years now. \u00a0Yes, autism is once again more common than thought, but no, we don't know why that is. \u00a0We think it is because we are getting better at finding it but we cannot rule out a true increase.\n\nI love that phrase - \"cannot rule out\". \u00a0That phrasing makes you believe that there is strong evidence that shows that autism is not rising but, to be overly cautious, they will still admit that it might be possible\u00a0that it is more common than it used to be.\n\nLike the movie Groundhog Day, I think we will be seeing these lines again when we hear about the next revision in two years. \u00a0I am going to go out on a limb here, but I expect the number that we will hear next is 1 in 80.\n\nBut enough of me rambling on about this, I think I have made my opinion clear before. \u00a0Instead, I am going to use some pretty pictures to demonstrate my point. \u00a0The numbers on the following charts are from the CDC's data for\u00a02000, 2002, 2004, 2006\u00a0and the National Survey of Children's Health\u00a0(NSCH).\n\nFirst up is the prevalence of autism in 8 year olds from the CDC and NSCH from 2000 to 2007. \u00a0The last point is from the 8 year olds from the 2007 NSCH survey and is likely a little high. \n\n\nThe next chart is the approximate year over year change in the autism prevalence from the above chart. \u00a0If you look at the average percent change, you will see that the number of 8 year olds with autism is growing about 10% per year.\n\n\nThe next series of charts are from the CDC's data for 2000,2002, 2004, and 2006. \u00a0For each of the states that had data for at least 2 years I charted the prevalence per 10,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone see a pattern?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5601a1.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5601a2.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5810a2.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5810a1.htm", "http://www.nschdata.org/", "//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxMbgkJ1fI/AAAAAAAAAGs/N5OM1tp7_DQ/s1600-h/prevalence_2009.gif", "http://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/year-over-year.asp", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxOc6en4GI/AAAAAAAAAG0/V8JZdT7WE34/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_yoy.gif", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxQhWt7SZI/AAAAAAAAAG8/55gwScfbWHo/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_alabama.gif", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxQkvkWq4I/AAAAAAAAAHE/cTqM5vQmAs4/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_arizona.gif", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxQowrR87I/AAAAAAAAAHM/a1tOAo5xWRU/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_colorado.gif", "//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxQr2JQlaI/AAAAAAAAAHU/B0GCIOvYoOw/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_georgia.gif", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxQwPsIOWI/AAAAAAAAAHc/rin1KC_t8Vw/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_maryland.gif", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxQ0VE54-I/AAAAAAAAAHk/X7yRLRqsTsM/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_missouri.gif", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxQ3hYIUXI/AAAAAAAAAHs/rqeiTJmOkV8/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_newjersey.gif", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxQ7Hw-7vI/AAAAAAAAAH0/3oAPRfWyw5A/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_pennsylvania.gif", "//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxQ_-LlorI/AAAAAAAAAH8/b9tzaW5f36w/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_southcarolina.gif", "//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SyxhavaRh4I/AAAAAAAAAIE/_kVC5HA3dOc/s1600-h/prevalence_2009_wisconsin.gif"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/12/autism-rising-its-groundhog-day.html", "title": "\nAutism Rising : Its Groundhog Day\n"},
{"date": "Monday, July 19, 2010", "body": "\nOne of the many unanswered questions when it comes to autism is just how many adults have autism. \u00a0While this may seen to be an academic question at first, the answer to the question is quite important. \u00a0The reason is that if we knew how many adults have autism it would give us a clue to whether autism is more common now than it was in the past. \u00a0If there are just as many adults out there are children, that would mean that autism is not becoming more common and it is likely that we are just better at recognizing it. \u00a0If there are not as many then that would strongly suggest that something else is going on.\n\nUnfortunately, there have been very few (if any) high quality studies that have looked for autism in adults. \u00a0For example, the most recent study that looked for autism in adults in the UK came up with a figure of 1% but the study had major problems with how it was done. \u00a0As a result, we can only guess at how many adults have autism.\n\nWith that in mind, consider a recent study published that was recent published in the Journal of Intellectual Disability Research. \u00a0I wish I could say that it directly looked at the autism rates in adults but it didn't. \u00a0What it did do is look at how common autism is in adults with intellectual disability. \n\nIntellectual disability (ID) is roughly defined as having an IQ under 70 along with potential problems with motor, language, and self help skills. \u00a0ID is thought to be fairly common in people with autism - estimates range from 20% all the way up to 80% when you include borderline ID. \n\nIn this study, the researchers looked at all of the adults (ages 18 to 67) with severe intellectual disability (IQ less than 50) who were registered for government services in in Reykjavik, Iceland in 2000. \u00a0The city had a population of 70,007 and there were a total of 256 adults were registered for services for severe ID.\n\nThe researchers sent out letters to all 256 adults and attempted to recruit them for this study. \u00a0However, only 119 of the 256 people elected to participant. \u00a0Those who elected to participant were significantly younger and more likely to live in group homes than those who didn't. \u00a0As you will see, this fact become important later on.\n\nThese 119 people were then screened (by psychology students working on their thesis) using a slightly modified Bryson scale followed by a the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) with modified cut-off point (26 or above instead of the usual 30 or above). \u00a0Afterwards, an experienced clinician administered an ADI-R to confirm that the person did in fact have a form of autism.\n\nThe overall results were not that surprising. \u00a0The study identified a total of 25 cases of autism, 14 of which had did not previous diagnosis of autism. \u00a0Seventeen of these cases were autism while the other 8 where atypical autism (think PDD-NOS). \u00a0I could not determine from reading the study what the exact breakout of autism vs atypical autism was in the initial 11 cases compared to the new 14 cases. \u00a0It appears that the 11 people who already had a diagnosis had a diagnosis of autism which means 6 of the new cases were autism while 8 where atypical autism, but I could easily be wrong.\n\nThe breakout of autism vs atypical autism in the groups may sound like a minor point, but it actually can help us determine why the cases were \"missed\" in the past. \u00a0One of the arguments against the rate of autism actually increasing is that the diagnosistic criteria have undergone major revisions over the years. \u00a0The earlier criteria were much more limited in what they would call autism while the most recent crieria have expanded their scope, especially in the area of atypical autism or PDD-NOS. \u00a0Therefore, if the newly diagnosed group were mostly in the atypical group, it could be argued that they were \"missed\" earlier because they would not have met the criteria for any form of autism.\n\nBut from what I can gather, it is a mixed bag with only about half of the newly diagnosed people falling under an atypical label which means that the change in the diagnostic criteria only played a partial role in the new cases.\n\nRegardless, one of the other interesting points here is that most of the people diagnosed were relatively young. \u00a0The ages ranged from 19 to 63 with a mean of 32.56 and a standard deviation of 10.92. \u00a0The study does not give more of a break out of how these cases are distributed by age, but from looking at the statitics, you can tell that there are far more younger cases than older ones. \u00a0I don't know whether this age bias is a function of the subset of the population that responded (which we know were younger), or whether it is a function of autism becoming more common each year (younger people have a higher autism rate), or both. \u00a0I suspect it is both.\n\nGoing back to the population of adults with severe ID, the rate of autism in this group was about 21%. \u00a0This number is not surprising and, if anything, is on the lower side. \u00a0Other similar studies have suggested that the rate is higher, possibly around 30%.\n\nBut in general, the results of this study agree with earlier results and doesn't give us much new information.\n\nReferences\n\nSaemundsen E, Juliusson H, Hjaltested S, Gunnarsdottir T, Halldorsdottir T, Hreidarsson S, Magnusson P.

{"date": "Sunday, October 4, 2009", "body": "\nIn a completely expected move, the CDC announced today that the autism is now thought to affect 1 in 91 children in the US. This finding is largely based on a new study that was published today in Pediatrics.  In the study the researchers looked at the recent results of the National Survey of Children's Health and, after cleaning up the data, arrived at the figure of 110 out of 100,000 children aged 3 to 17 have a form of autism.The CDC has confirmed, through media sources, that the most recent (and still unpublished) ADDM data agrees with this estimate.  This number should not come as a surprise to anyone as this change has been widely expected for a while now.  What concerns me is the reaction from the CDC over this issue.  There has been plenty of press coverage today with reports from the Huffington Post, New York Times, CNN, NPR, and many others.But, if you looked at the CDC's web site earlier today, there was not a word of the announcement.  If you looked at the press releases on their site you would see that \"Fewer U.S. Schools Selling Less Nutritious Food and Beverages\" but you wouldn't see anything about autism.  I realize this is a minor nit-pick, but you would think that they would at least have a press release about it on the day of the announcement.Minor points aside, what really concerns me are comments like the ones  attributed to Dr. Thomas Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health and head of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee -\"The concern here is that buried in these numbers is a true increase,\" said Dr. Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. \"We're going to have to think very hard about what we're going to do for the 1 in 100.\"He is concerned that, buried in a 60 percent increase, there might be a true increase? First it was 1 in 500, then 1 in 250, then 1 in 166, then 1 in 150, and now 1 in 91 and we are still debating about whether there is a true increase?  The prevalence of a profound disorder like autism increases by 500 percent over a twenty year period and the head of two major governmental agencies charged with addressing the problem needs to \"think very hard\" about what to do and wonders if the rate is really going up?I guess the real question here is why the CDC and the US Government aren't doing everything in their power to find answers to some of the most basic questions about autism.  These questions have have been asked for over a decade and it is long past for them to be answered.Are we going to have to wait another few years and hear the same excuses when the rate of autism is approaching two percent?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.public-domain-photos.com/free-cliparts-3/shapes/arrows/arrow-up-red_benji_park_01.png", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-1522v1", "http://www.nschdata.org/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/05/autism-rates-government-s_n_309290.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/health/research/06child.html", "http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/10/05/autism.study/index.html?iref=newssearch", "http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2009/10/autism_strikes_nearly_1_in_100.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/media/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/05/autism-rates-government-s_n_309290.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/10/autism-now-1-in-91.html", "title": "\nAutism now 1 in 91\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, September 19, 2009", "body": "\nPhoto by samantha celera(flickr)There has been a lot of chatter recently on the new H1N1 (Swine) flu vaccines concerning how well they will work, what side effects they might have, and what testing (or lack of) has been done.  Much of what I have run across up until now has been speculative and devoid of any real information that would help a parent decide whether to vaccinate their child.So I thought that I would point out this excellent article by Dr. Sears about the new vaccines -Four Swine Flu Vaccines Approved by FDAIf you are interested in the topic I highly suggest reading this.  Mainstream medicine does a lot of lip service to the concept of informed consent but they tend to provide a one sided version of the facts and the only \"informed\" decision that is acceptable is the one that they agree with.  Dr. Sears provides real information on which to base a decision.To paraphrase what Dr. Sears is saying, the vaccine manufacturers basically took their existing flu shots and replaced the part that targets the conventional flu virus with one that targets H1N1.  So the pros and cons of the components of the shots themselves are the same as the other flu shots. The main concern with these vaccines is that they have received very little testing so it is not known whether they will be effective in preventing swine flu.  Also, if you following the CDC's recommendations and give your child both the regular flu shot and the H1N1 shot they could be receiving up to four shots over a month.  Giving a child this many shots flu shots in a short period of time has not much safety testing.Some types of these shots still contain up to 25 mcg of mercury.  If you need two shots of each type and do them at the same time, this could add up to 100 mcg in a 30 day period and, well, haven't we all been down this road before?  All I will say is that if you are following the recommendations for your child ask for the versions of the shots that do not contain mercury.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/2945724127_b18b5f8eca_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/scelera/2945724127/", "http://www.askdrsears.com/thevaccinebook/2009/09/four-swine-flu-vaccines-approved-by-fda.asp", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/09/swine-flu-vaccine.html", "title": "\nSwine Flu Vaccine\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, August 23, 2009", "body": "\nPeople throw around a lot of figures and charts when talking about autism in an attempt to prove their point.  Some of the time the information is valid and other times the comparison is as valid as comparing apples and ducks.Take for example a recent post written by Sullivan at Left Brain Right Brain -Autism Epidemic? Not in the NSCH dataThe basic point of his post was to compare this chart from Thoughtful House (TH)to one that was his own creation that is similar to the one below and based on data from the National Survey of Children's Health (I didn't want to rip off his chart so I made one of my own, feel free to compare it to the one on Sullivan's original post).He then talked about how the charts don't look anything, that the magnitudes of the numbers are completely different, and furthermore that the NSCH data is \"basically flat\" and shows no evidence of an epidemic of autism.Well, I have to agree with him, the charts don't look anything alike.  But there is a good reason for that - the data on the charts aren't directly comparable.Lets first start with some definitions.The data on the TH chart is labeled a \"crude\" incidence.   It is the basically the yearly change in the number of children with a label of autism served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  This number is then assumed to represent the number of new cases and all of those cases are assumed to be in the youngest age.  There are number of problems with this approach, but like the title says, it is very crude.  There are some comments on the LBRB post here and here that describe the data in more detail.The data on the NSCH is the number of children found during the survey in 2007 who currently have autism or another ASD.  This number is broken out by the age of the child and then normalized to be a number of children per 10,000 children based on the number of children in the age group.  This is basically a prevalence figure.The CDC tells us the difference between \"incidence\" and \"prevalence\" is Incidence is the number of new cases of disease in a defined group of people over a specific time. Prevalence is the number of existing disease cases in a defined group of people during a specific time period. Public health professionals use prevalence measures to track a condition over time and to plan responses at local, regional, and national levels. Incidence is very difficult to establish because the exact time a person develops an ASD is not known.And what is an epidemic?In epidemiology, an epidemic occurs when new cases of a certain disease, in a given human population, and during a given period, substantially exceed what is \"expected,\" based on recent experienceSo, what are the problems with the comparisons that Sullivan did?First and foremost, the data being compared don't even represent the same thing.  The figures from the TH are meant to represent incidence while the ones from NSCH are prevalence.  You can't directly compare them to each other as they don't represent the same thing.The second problem is that the group being represented isn't the same.  The TH data represents children who are being served under the IDEA act and is based on the classification of a child in a public school system.  A particular child with autism maybe classified as having autism, having some other problem, not having a problem, or not even included in the data if they don't attend public school.  The NSCH data is a survey meant to be a representative sample of the entire population of children.  So the data on the two charts does not even represent the same underlying population.The third problem is that the time periods that are being compared aren't at all equivalent.  The numbers from the TH graph were derived from historical IDEA prevalence figures published over a number of years.  The numbers of the NSCH are a snapshot of what the current prevalence was in 2007. The last problem is that an epidemic isn't defined by numbers on a chart, it is defined by something being substantially more common than was expected.  The NSCH data from 2007 indicates that the current prevalence is about 1 in 100 (although it does vary by age and substantially by state).  Prior to this data being released the accepted figure from the CDC was 1 in 150, and that estimate was from 2002.If the data from NSCH is accurate and autism is 33% more common now than 5 years ago I think that would count as a substantial increase.  The CDC is expected to publish similar findings in the near future and, if they confirm that number, they are going to have to either call an epidemic or provide some other explanation for the increase.  Or they might just weasel out of it again, who knows.  (My money is on the weasel).But the point is that you don't look at a chart of prevalence figures and declare there is no epidemic without comparing it to what the expected prevalence is.  The CDC is \"the\" authority in the US for this sort of thing so it is there estimate that counts.So, how could the comparison have been done better? Well, it would have helped to be able to compare like to like, but given the data available from IDEA this isn't possible. But, I am going to try to do the next best thing.  I am going to use the data from the 2007 and 2003 NSCH surveys and attempt to back into a \"crude\" incidence.I will freely admit that this isn't the most scientific approach and does suffer from some of the same flaws that I mentioned above.  However, I think the results are closer to how the chart from TH is being generated and will demonstrate what I am saying about comparing apples to apples (well, maybe apples to oranges in this case, but certainly not apples to ducks).To produce the following chart I took the data from the 2007 and 2003 NSCH data sets and broke out the rough prevalence grouped by the child's age.  I then shifted the 2003 data so that the ages of the children between the two data sets would line up properly (ie a child in 2003 that was 5 would be 9 in 2007) and be directly comparable.  The result is the following.There are a few things of note here.First, while there has a been a push in recent years to diagnosis autism at a younger age, the figures from the youngest age are very likely understated.  So the first two ages (2 and 3) for 2007 is likely low as is the 2003 data shown at ages 6 and 7.Second, there is something off at age 12 in the 2007 data - the number is substantially higher than its surrounding points.  If you look at the original 2003 data there was also something off at the unadjusted age 12 - it was too low compared to the the surrounding ages.  I don't know what is going on there but it is strange.If you notice on the chart above there is a a very clear upwards trend as you go from older to younger children.  This says to me that there are more younger children being diagnosed than older ones and that the number is growing.  Unfortunately, this chart cannot tell you why this is happening.As a final comparison I took the difference between the prevalence on the above chart to show a (very) crude incidence between 2003 and 2007.  You should disregard the points at age 6 and 7 but the overall increasing trend is clear.Doesn't this look more like the chart from Thoughtful House?  It is amazing what happens when you try to compare data properly .\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SpNUhW9YJTI/AAAAAAAAACk/BwDLiC1I9Y4/s1600-h/ApplesDucks.jpg", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2777", "http://www.fightingautism.org/idea/autism.php", "http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/", "//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SpNQch2967I/AAAAAAAAAB8/BLGKvJJkBI8/s1600-h/th_crude_incidence.jpg.png", "http://www.nschdata.org/", "//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SpNQ4t9u2GI/AAAAAAAAACE/n403OkwZTho/s1600-h/NCSH_2007.gif", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individuals_with_Disabilities_Education_Act", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2777#comment-61525", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2777#comment-61643", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/faq_prevalence.htm#Whatisthedifference", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2009/07/cdc-may-release-1-in-100-autism.html", "http://lh5.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SpNTCNMlb2I/AAAAAAAAACU/duYerOmPZK4/s400/NSCH_2007_vs_2003.gif", "//4.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SpNTxjwYOrI/AAAAAAAAACc/d3l--diqV1E/s1600-h/NSCH_2003_change_2007.gif"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-not-to-compare-data.html", "title": "\nHow not to compare data\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 6, 2009", "body": "\nPhoto by Leo Reynolds (flickr)Michelle Dawson has a major problem with using ABA to treat autism.  She likes to claim that ABA is unethical, unproven, and bad for \"autistics\".  I am not sure who these \"autistics\" are or how they differ from the group of adults and children who have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum, maybe they are the same.  But, according to Ms Dawson, ABA is bad for them. Oh, and unethical too, although I can never seem to find the her exact ethical complaints with ABA spelled out precisely, just the assertion that it is, in fact, unethical.But this isn't anything new and anyone who was familiar with her writings would already know this.Ms Dawson also has a bad habit of discouraging parents from using ABA to help their children - I wrote about an example of this earlier.  She seems especially keen to reach the parents of newly diagnosed children and convince them that ABA is bad for their children.  Now, if you ask her about this she will tell you that this is not what she is doing, that is trying to provide accurate information from primary sources, which is good for autistics.Did I mention that she thinks that ABA is unethical, unproven, and bad for autistics?  Good, I didn't want to forget mentioning that.Now, here is the thing.  There is almost universal agreement that ABA is one of the most effective treatments for children with autism that is available today.  No one is saying that it is a cure or that it will work for every person on the spectrum - as the saying goes, if you have seen one person with autism then you have seen one person with autism (this holds true even for identical twins). A huge body of literature and evidence exists that supports the notion that ABA, in general and specifically for autism, is an effective teaching technique.  Every major organization dealing with autism agrees on this point, from Autism Speaks to the Autism Science Foundation to the CDC to the American Academy of Pediatrics to the groups that think autism is caused by vaccinations.  Heck, even some of the Neurodiversity and ASAN folks accept that it as a valid treatment and they are normally against any treatment for autism.Then you have Michelle Dawson arguing that ABA is unethical, unproven, and bad for autistics as she did, yet again, just a few weeks ago.I am all for listening to peoples ideas and considering all possible points of view, even ones that are completely at odds with conventional wisdom, but I don't understand Ms Dawson's obsession with trash talking ABA.  At first I thought that Ms Dawson underwent ABA as a child or young adult and had a bad experience.  But I have not been able to find any references to that occurring and everything that I did find seems to indicate that she never had any ABA style therapies, so that can't be it.Then I thought that Ms Dawson might have some sort of agenda that she is pushing.  But I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and I can't see what agenda she would be pursuing or any possible benefit to pursuing it.  This view is certainly not helping other people with autism and is especially harmful to young children with autism.So what I am left with is that Ms Dawson really believes that ABA is unethical, unproven, and bad in spite of the overwhelming evidence against her position.  But she seems to be an intelligent person, so I can't see how she can sustain her belief - it isn't rational.  And it isn't like she is in an isolated environment where it is easier for irrational ideas to take root.But then I remembered.  Ms Dawson has autism and part of autism is getting fixated or obsessed with items or possibly ideas.  Could that be the reason?I have no idea.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm1.static.flickr.com/7/12364944_14794d1055_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/lwr/12364944/", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/03/challenging-beliefs.html#comment-8974944184826037775", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/whattodo/what_is_aba.php", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/aboutautism.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/treatment.htm", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/07/anomaly-in-autism-intervention-research.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/08/michelle-dawson.html", "title": "\nMichelle Dawson\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, August 12, 2009", "body": "\nI think the Gluten-free Casein-free (GFCF) diet can work for some children with autism.  My opinion is not based on a preponderance of scientific evidence because science has not yet caught up with the realities of why people use the diet.  Rather my opinion is based on the specific symptoms that my children had and what results that I have seen in my children as a result of the diet.If you missed the first part where I went into the reasons that we tried the diet for my twin daughters, go back and read it.  Done reading it?  Good.Before I go into our experiences let me just say that your experiences can and will vary.  If you are thinking of trying this diet with your children do a lot of reading about it first - there are several good sites and books - and if at all possible consult with an appropriate medical person to help deal with any issues that come up. So as I wrote last time we decided to try the GFCF diet for the twins - or technically in their case we were going GFCF and SF (soy-free).  We started off first by slowly removing all sources of dairy (casein) from their diets over a four week period followed by wheat (gluten) over the next four weeks followed by a quick removal of soy.  You have to take it slowly because if there is a real food intolerance there, as was the case with the twins, they can go through a form of withdrawal as you remove the food.  (Hint, autism + withdrawal = very bad)Just to mention it, this is one of the problems with the studies done so far on the diet - they are too short.  The only double blind study on the diet lasted only 6 weeks.  At 6 weeks we were still removing food from the diet.  And it takes a while for the effects from the intolerance to fade, it doesn't necessary happen overnight - it will happen over the course of several months to a year.What we saw from the removal of dairy was impressive.  First, there was an improvement in some of the core problems of autism - both girls showed an increase in eye contact, an increase in attention, and they started paying attention to sounds.  The last part is a little bit strange, so let me explain it.  After the twins turned a year old they slowly seemed to loose their hearing.  It wasn't as if they couldn't hear at all - we did see them respond to some sounds some of the time.  But for the most part the simply did not respond to sounds such as talking or noise.  What was extremely unusual was they would not startle or react to sudden, loud noises.  You could sneak up behind then and bang two pot lids together and they wouldn't flinch, blink, or show any sort of reaction. Being good parents we took them for a hearing test.  They both failed.  We took them to a pediatric ENT who examined them, found no obvious physical problems, and sent them for another hearing test.  They failed.  Finally, he ordered a test called an ABR (auditory brainstem response).  This test involved sedating the child and directly measuring the electric signals generated in the brain as a result of sounds.  They \"passed\" this test and established that, physically, they could hear perfectly well.What is unusual here is the amount that the twins were able to tune out all sounds.  I had read that you might wonder if your child with autism was deaf because they wouldn't respond when you talked to them but I have never seen anyone else talk about their child being able to tune out all sound so completely that they wouldn't even startle.So eliminating dairy seems to have started them down the path of responding to sounds again.The speech and development therapists who were working with the twins at the time also noted that they started doing much better with their therapy.  They would pay attention and become more interactive.  They started learning and progressing through the tasks faster than they had before.The other symptoms that I mentioned last time also started a slow fade and over the course of the following year disappeared.  Their stools became normal, the bloating in their stomachs went down, they could sleep on their backs, and their eczema finally went away.A year later when we repeated the food intolerance tests the readings for all three types of intolerance had dropped to just under 10 - for the casein that is a drop from over 100 to 10 which is a significant drop. So, in short, for the twins the diet was a huge success.  We saw the majority of the changes from removing dairy from their diet - they do not seem to be anywhere near as sensitive to wheat and soy.  But, to be on the safe side, since there was some intolerance shown by their blood work, we keep it out of their diet.We did not have the instant talking that you will hear about other places, and if fact we had to wait two more years before they would start talking to us.  Nor did they become non-autistic and loose the autism diagnosis but even still, the changes were significant. \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//4.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/Sn9MzK7G9HI/AAAAAAAAAAU/7bsdsOKrWLE/s1600-h/GFCF.jpg", "http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/testing/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/08/our-results-with-gfcf-diet.html", "title": "\nOur results with the GFCF diet\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 30, 2009", "body": "\nPhoto by kikisdad (flickr)Like everyone, I have my pet peeves - those small things that will annoy me to no end even though most people would think the thing it is no big deal.  One of my largest pet peeves is when media outlets or blogs do not accurately report on scientific research or they skew the results to make for a more sensational story.The world of autism has more than its fair share of misinformation and really doesn't need more.Take for example a recent post by Lisa Jo Rudy at autism.about.com entitled Autism Caused by Breast Milk?!.  From the opening line of -Could breastfeeding cause autism?!to the closing line of -Would it have an impact on your decision to breast feed your child?the post talks about the possible link between breast feeding and autism based on the result of a \"new\" study (the study is over 2 years only).Yet, if you go read the actual study (open access) what you find is a study about exposure to PCBs and developmental issues.  Specifically, it looks at how the rat brains develop differently when they are exposed to a high level of PCBs very early in life.  This study is an excellent example of how it is possible for chemicals in the environment to cause developmental problems. But it certainly isn't about breast feeding causing autism as the title of post implies.  If you read the study you see that the researchers fed the rats the PCBs almost from the start of pregnancy to when the infant rats were weaned.  So the link to breast feeding comes into play because PCBs can be passed from the mother to the infant in breast milk.  But then again they can also be passed during the prenatal period across the placenta - the study doesn't differentiate between the two methods. So the real point of the study is that PCBs can be passed from the mother to her offspring and, if the exposure is high enough, can cause developmental problems.  When it comes to the \"dangers\" of breast feeding, the authors have this to say -Although numerous studies have shown that breastfeeding of infants is superior  to existing alternatives, these data suggest the possibility that, in extreme  cases, for mothers with high levels of exposure to PCBs and/or other closely  related toxicants that bioaccumulate in breast milk, lactational exposure of  genetically at-risk infants may in fact not be in the infant\u2019s best interest.Notice the use of the words \"possible\", \"extreme cases\", \"high levels of exposure\", \"genetically at-risk\" followed by a \"may not be in the infant's best interest\".  Slam dunk against breast feeding, right?It would have been much more accurate to report that exposure to high levels of PCBs early in life may cause developmental problems but that wouldn't be a shocking as breast feeding causing autism, now would it?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm1.static.flickr.com/96/254008177_b56a322105_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/kikisdad/254008177/", "http://autism.about.com/", "http://autism.about.com/b/2009/07/28/autism-caused-by-breast-milk.htm", "http://www.pnas.org/content/104/18/7646.full.pdf", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?doi=10.1289/ehp.6424"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/07/distorting-science-for-traffic.html", "title": "\nDistorting science for traffic\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, August 23, 2009", "body": "\nThe U.S. Geological Survey released the results of a new study this past week that looked at the mercury contamination in the environment.  The study looked at 291 streams from around the country and found that mercury contamination is present in all of them.The bad news in all of this is that no fish is safe - every single fish that was sampled had a detectable level of mercury.  One in every four fish sampled had a level of mercury that exceeded the EPA's safety limit.  Two thirds of the fish exceeded the EPA's level of concern for fish eating mammals.  The good news?  The remaining fish would not be that bad to eat - as long as you didn't eat too many at once and only ate them every once and a while.  This finding is also expected to help grow the fish population because more fishermen will participant in the catch and release program.  Those who don't choose to participate and actually eat their fish?  Well, they won't last that long so nothing to worry about there.So where does all of this mercury come from? According to the study it comes from atmospheric sources and, to a lesser extent, other source like mining operations. The main culprit seems to be coal burning power plants - they emit a form mercury into the air which then ends up in the water supply and works its way up the food chain.  By the time the fish end up on our tables they are full of methylmercury goodness.OK, so there really is no good news here and nothing to be joking about.  Methylmercury in the environment is no laughing matter and can cause serious health problems.  It is a neurotoxin that can seriously mess you up if you are exposed to too much of it or happen to belong to a vulnerable population.  This is why the EPA suggests limiting fish intake for young children and women who are or might become pregnant or are nursing.  According to the EPA, exposure to methylmercury in the womb and shortly after can result in impaired neurological development, damage to the nervous system, and problems with cognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, and fine motor and visual spatial skills.So, if you have kids, what you really should be watching out for is the fish.  I mean just look at that list of things it can cause - it almost sounds as bad as autism.  It is a good thing that we know that there is absolutely no relation between mercury exposure and autism otherwise I might start to worry about eating fish.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh4.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SpBSkuC5BMI/AAAAAAAAAB0/jY4NLWwLuSQ/s800/deadfish.jpg", "http://www.usgs.gov/", "http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5109/", "http://www.epa.gov/mercury/health.htm", "http://www.epa.gov/fishadvisories/advice/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/08/dont-eat-fish-they-might-give-you.html", "title": "\nDon't eat the fish, they might give you autism\n"},
{"date": "Friday, August 21, 2009", "body": "\nOne of the burning questions about autism is whether it is more common today than in the past.  This question is more than idle curiosity and the answer has the potential to reshape how we think about autism.  Over the past twenty years we have been treated to an ever rising statistic for how common autism is.  Twenty years ago it was something like 4 in 10,000, ten years ago it was 1 in 500, and in 2002 it was 1 in 150.  How common is it today?  Good question, the CDC is supposed to tell us any day now....No one will dispute the fact that we seem to be able to find more children with autism than we could in the past and that an ever increasing number of  children are being diagnosed each year.  Yet there is no agreement of what these rising numbers mean.So, are we in the midst of an autism epidemic or has the medical community finally put on their collective glasses and seen what has been staring them in the face these past several thousand years of human existence (Gee, the kid can't talk, won't look me in the eye and keeps doing funny things with their hands, maybe something isn't right there) ?As Harold Doherty recently pointed out researchers have been noodling over this ever increasing figure for a number of years.  However, to date, the response has been something along the lines of - \"Huh, that's strange, I wonder what is causing that. Maybe we should look at that closer\".  I am sure that they will get around to looking closely at the issue any day now.  Earlier this month we were handled another tidbit of information in the form of  the second National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH).  This is a nationwide survey of children's health issues that was first done in 2003 and then again in 2007.  The results of the 2007 survey were released earlier this month and they had something interesting to say about autism -The rate of autism now seems to be at 1 in 100.That rate does keep moving up, maybe looking at why  would be a good idea?Since the data for 2003 and 2007 are publicly available I thought I would make a pretty picture of the differences in rates between the years.  Just as a note, this comparison is not perfect because the wording of the question changed between the years.  In 2003 the question was whether the child ever had autism while in 2007 it was whether the child currently has autism or another asd.  I think the ever vs current would over estimate the 2003 numbers and the autism vs \"autism or another asd\" has the potential to inflate the 2007 numbers.  Although in all honesty, I don't think the exact wording of autism vs \"autism or another asd\" would make a huge difference because most parents whose child had pdd-nos or aspergers would have said \"yes\" to the autism alone question in 2003.But, without further ado, here is a pretty picture of the rates between 2003 and 2007.Those number are definitely going up, I just have to wonder what it means.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.public-domain-photos.com/free-cliparts-3/shapes/arrows/arrow-up-red_benji_park_01.png", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/08/autism-prevalence-why-wasnt-research.html", "http://www.nschdata.org/", "//4.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/So9ihNVyK-I/AAAAAAAAAAc/gnHTZ2fRB8Y/s1600-h/NSCH.gif"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/08/autism-rising.html", "title": "\nAutism Rising?\n"},

SLOS, as I have written about before, is a generic disorder where the body is unable to produce enough cholesterol which causes a wide variety of problems, including autism.  Earlier research had demonstrated that autism is very common in individuals with autism so the researchers were looking into whether SLOS was a common cause of autism.The study selected 100 samples from children contained in the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE).  These children were  from families with 2 or more children with non-regressive autism.  Blood samples for each of the participants were analyzed for cholesterol level and all cholesterol precursors.  None of the samples had indications that the individuals had SLOS.  However, 19 of the 100 individuals had total cholesterol levels less than 100 mg/dL, which is very low.  There were also indications that the lower level of cholesterol in this subset was due to problems with the body's process of making cholesterol rather than a lack of dietary sources. To put this cholesterol level in perspective, the normal average total level should be in the range from about 160-200, depending on age, sex, and other factors.  If you look at data published by the CDC that is referenced by this study this level is in the bottom 5th percentile for children (ie over 95% of children have a higher level with the average level being 60% higher).The study concluded that although autism is very common in individuals with SLOS that SLOS is not a common cause of autism.  But, and this is the interesting part for me, the finding that about 20% of the sample had a very low cholesterol was not expected and the researchers suggest that further research is needed.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/117928900/grouphome/home.html", "http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2553243", "http://www.agre.org/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/06/study-watch-abnormalities-of.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : Abnormalities of Cholesterol Metabolism in Autism Spectrum Disorders\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, July 9, 2009", "body": "\nSome of the mystery surrounding the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) recent action in the matter of Brian Deer's reporting in the Times has been clarified.  As I mentioned before it appeared that the PCC had requested that the Times remove the articles written by Brian Deer until the matter was resolved.  The Times complied with the request and removed the articles.But now they are back up with a weakly worded warning that \"[t]his article is subject to an on-going Press Complaints Commission complaint\".  Or basically, the Times appeared to have decided to not obey the request from the PCC.It has been suggested that it was Dr Wakefield's claim that the PCC \"ordered\" the Times to take down the articles was not accurate and that the PCC merely \"asked\" the PC to do so and this is given as the reason that the articles were reposted.It seems that this claim is at least partly true.  There is the original press release from Thoughtful House that does use the phrase \"interim order\" but now there are some further details about the case available.   These details include what appears to be the text of the informal decision.  I suggest you go read the full e-mail trail included on that page to get the full context.  I am sure that this grouping of e-mails is not the entire story but there is one thing that I think can be cleared up - the Times was not \"asked\" to remove the stories, the PCC told them to.  The exact wording is -Given the ongoing nature of the dispute, the articles should be removed from the newspaper\u2019s website until this matter has been concluded.  This would not be an admission of any liability on the part of the newspaper.That doesn't sound like \"asking\" to me which means that Dr Wakefield's claim that the PCC ordered the articles down is more or less true - the word ordered might be a little overstated but it certainly wasn't merely an informal suggestion.If read further you get the impression that the reason the articles were reposted was that the Times and Brian Deer were n0t happy about Dr Wakefield publicly announcing the PCC's request/order -In the light of the actions of Dr Wakefield and/or his representatives, and the inaccurate \"spin\" which has been put on the PCC request, my client feels that it is entirely inappropriate and prejudicial to keep the articles down. My client will therefore be reinstating the articles onto its website, but will be tagging them to make it clear that they are subject to a PCC complaint which is ongong. I wouldn't be happy if I were them either.  But that doesn't mean the Times should disobey the PCC just because taking down the articles makes them look bad.Finally, if you look at the last e-mail in the chain you see Brian Deer writing directly to who I am assuming is a lawyer representing Dr Wakefield and almost gleefully talking about his articles being republished. He accuses Dr Wakefield of making \"false claims\", \"misleading the public\", and of being \"dishonest\".  I have to wonder if he has looked in a mirror lately.If I were Brian Deer's lawyer I think I would be telling him to shut up right about now and stop getting involved.   But then again Mr Deer has a history of writing inappropriate things so his e-mail doesn't come as a shock.Given the overall tone of Mr Deer's letter I think it is reasonable to say that he as a personal beef with Dr Wakefield that could very easily be affecting his objectivity and judgement in the matter.It will be interesting to see what, if anything, the PCC does in response to the Times reposting the articles.  I would be willing to bet that they will take no real action - I am not even sure that they have any action that they can take besides telling them to take it down again.Time will tell.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.pcc.org.uk/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2542", "http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/pr/sunday-times-ordered-to-remove-brian-deer-MMR-stories.php", "http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/pr/sunday-times-defies-press-complaints-commission.php"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/07/brian-deer-thumbs-his-nose-at-pcc.html", "title": "\nBrian Deer thumbs his nose at the PCC\n"},
{"date": "Monday, June 1, 2009", "body": "\nLast month a new autism research organization was formed called the Autism Science Foundation (ASF).  This organization was founded by Alison Tepper Singer after she left Autism Speaks with other refuges from Autism Speaks as well as the illustrious Dr. Paul Offit.As I have written about before the goals of this organization seem to be rather particular.  The main goals of the organization seems to be to fund the \"right\" scientific research into autism and to make clear that vaccines have nothing to do with autism.  I always thought that scientists were willing to go where ever the data took them regardless of whether they thought they already knew the answer - but what do I know.The ASF seems to be attempting to become a mainstream organization and appears to have the long term goal of replacing Autism Speaks as \"the autism organization\".  So far they seem to be off to a rather rough start.Take for example the situation with Alison Tepper Singer when she abruptly resigned from her position at Autism Speaks because of a disagreement on an upcoming vote on the IACC.  First,  it is still a mystery how she knew about the vote being scheduled the next day because the other public members did not know anything about it.  Nor should there have even been a planned vote that was organized outside of the normal structure of the committee.Second, Ms Singer chose to announce her resignation via a press release from Every Child By Two, which is a prominent pro-vaccine organization.  The announcement was released on the same day that she resigned which makes it appear that her resignation was not a spur of the moment decision but rather a pre-planned event.   If that was not bad enough Ms Singer decided to hang onto her seat on the IACC after her resignation; a seat that she had only because of her employment with Autism Speaks.  She is now using this seat to represent the new ASF.Given the fact that this is a brand new organization that does not yet have any real sort of presence or authority on the issues surrounding autism it is a mystery to me why Ms Singer feels that it should have a voice in the national plan for autism.  If this new organization wants to be included in the national plan perhaps they should take the time to do the work to get there on their own without stealing from the hard work of others?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/pressreleases.html", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/press/autism_speaks_withdraws_support_for_strategic_plan.php", "http://iacc.hhs.gov/", "http://www.rescuepost.com/files/ecbt-singer-4.pdf", "http://www.rescuepost.com/files/ecbt-singer-4.pdf"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/06/autism-science-foundation-rough-start.html", "title": "\nAutism Science Foundation : Rough Start?\n"},

{"date": "Friday, March 13, 2009", "body": "\nThere is an excellent opinion article in Friday's Atlanta's Journal-Constituion by Dr Jon Poling.  Dr Poling, for those of you who were under a rock about a year ago, is the father of Hannah Poling whose vaccine injury case before the Vaccine court was conceded by the government.In his opinion piece Dr Poling  touches on a range of topics from the myth of better diagnosis, to  thoughts on investing research dollars, and even takes the time to smack down Dr Paul Offit (always a good time).Go read the opinion, it is definitely worth it.This article is being written about in some of the normal places.  Harold Doherty at Facing Autism in New Brunswick has an entry here.  Age of Autism has the full opinion here. And then you have the other side of the commentaries, one written by Do'C on Autism Street here and Sullivan on LBRB wrote one here.The right wing of the autism world doesn't seem to be mounting an effective response this time around.  So lets look at what Do'C had to say.  His first point is that :Yep, Hannah Poling\u2019s case was conceded, but contrary to popular internet re-interpretations which claim a court \u201cdecision\u201d about autism causation, the case was apparently never actually heard by the court - and no court ruling about whether or not Hannah\u2019s autistic features were caused by vaccination was ever made.So the point that the it wasn't a decision by a special master of the court but rather by Department of Health and Human Services means that it wasn't the judicial branch of the government but rather the executive that made the \"decision\" is supposed to be important.  Why it matters I couldn't tell you.Next up, straw land:Anyone who claims \u201cbetter diagnosis\u201d is solely responsible for the increase in autism diagnoses over the past couple of decades is pretty likely to be fairly scientifically illiterate. Writing to suggest that this may embody any representative scientific consensus, is nothing more than construction of a giant straw man argument.So, no one claims that better diagnosis is involved in the increase of autism.  Or as Do'C would have you believe, Dr Poling claimed that better diagnosis is \"solely\" responsible.  The only problem is that he never said that.  Regardless, lets see if we can find any references to better diagnosis by these \"scientific illiterate\".Here is one on msnbc from Feb 12th of this year : Recent data suggest a 10-fold increase in autism rates over the past decade, although it\u2019s unclear how much of the surge reflects better diagnosisHere's another from the Washington Post from 2007 :The cases are rising, experts say, primarily because of better diagnosis and services: Parents and teachers are more attuned to the signs of autism, and doctors are better equipped to spot it than they were two decades ago.Here is one from Autism Vox, a blog that was written by Kristina Chew before she went on to write at change.org :But could it be that we are simply diagnosing autism better? That we ourselves have gained greater knowledge and understanding of autism, and are therefore counting cases of autism more and more accurately?Finally here on page 10 of the decision reached by the vaccine court written by Special Master Hastings (as everyone knows, a real scientific \"illiterate\"):Other experts argue that the increase in diagnosis does not represent a real increase in the incidence of the condition, resulting instead from a broadening of the diagnostic criteria for autism, improved recognition of autism, and other factors.I think it is safe to say that it better diagnosis is commonly used.  So survey says - one stack of straw for Do'C.Next up Do'C take issues with Dr Poling's claim of \"drowning in the red ink of educating increasing numbers of special-needs students\" by showing a graph of the percentage of children served in California under IDEA vs the residential population over the past 10 years.  This graph is a straight line implying that there has been a) no rise in the number of special needs students, and b) no rise in cost.  The problem is that the if a percentage is flat but the underlying population is growing then the actual number of students would be increasing.  The other problem is that his chart has no information whatsoever about the costs incurred by the school districts while educating these children.  Lets not even talk about the fact that just because California has one pattern that not all other school districts in the country are the same.  And lets certainly not discuss the differences in cost between providing relatively simple services such as speech therapy and the very costly proposition of providing a one-on-one aid for a child on the spectrum or a special purpose classroom.  None of that is apparently relevant.  Just keep your eye on the nice flat line.That's the end of my attention span for Do'C.  So lets turn to what Sullivan has to say.His main beef seems to be that:why is it that people who claim to support \u201cgene-environment\u201d interactions seem to have disdain for the \u201cgene\u201d part? How are we supposed to separate the various autism subgroups without identifying the genes? And, if we identify genes, won\u2019t their function give us some idea of what environmental causes might be worth studying?For which he gets the \"YOU'VE MISSED THE POINT\" award of the year.  The point that Dr Poling was making is that continuing to pour more research dollars into a fruitless search for a gene or genes that could be contributing autism is doing nothing to help create early interventions that could help prevent autism.  His point was that if we can identify the environmental trigger you could change the course of the disorder.There have been countless genetic searches done for the \"smoking gun\" gene that \"causes\" autism.  It has yet to be found, most likely because it as a singular entity does not exist.So instead of continuing to dig in the same haystack for that one piece of hay that might not even exist it might be time to consider switching to more other neglected areas that have more potential to show results.I will skip Sullivan rehashing Do'Cs arguments - regurgitated straw doesn't taste good.Sullivan's final point is that the entire reason for Dr Poling's piece is that this \"is rather poorly disguised attempt to air his ongoing battle with Dr. Paul Offit.\"  I think Sullivan has a point here, after a fashion.  There is clearly a disagreement between Dr Poling and Dr Offit.  These two have been having a back and forth over these issues for a while in a variety of places, from journals to newspapers.On one side you have have Dr Offit who represents everything that is wrong about the modern medical industry.  He is an insider who has had large vested financial interests in one side of the argument winning.  Autism is not his field, he just comments on it as a hobby.  On the other side you have Dr Poling who is the father of a child whose autism was caused by vaccinations.  Dr Poling has done research with other scientists to try to determine how his daughter developed autism - and he found the answer.  He helped to document how his daughter's autism was caused.Dr Offit has repeatedly attacked him and the acknowledged  fact that his daughters autism was caused by vaccinations.   This is despite the fact that Dr Offit had no special knowledge of Hannah Poling's case or medical history.  From all appearances he did it solely to protect his vested interest in the vaccine industry.So whose side are you going to take?  An industry-made millionaire or the father fighting for his child with autism?It isn't a tough choice.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2009/03/13/polinged_0313.html", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/03/vaccine-autism-war-dr-jon-poling.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/dr-jon-poling-i-cannot-fathom-turning-my-back-on-a-child-nor-science-to-avoid-inconvenient-questions.html", "http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=325", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1970", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29160138/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/09/AR2007060901344.html", "http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/better-diagnosis-and-so-called-epidemics/", "http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/vaccine_files/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/03/trolling-against-poling_13.html", "title": "\nTrolling against Poling\n"},

This study was published in Annals of Human GeneticsA Genome-wide Association Study of Autism Reveals a Common Novel Risk Locus at 5p14.1This study is looking for genetic risk factors for autism and to replicate an earlier finding of a relation between autism and the CNTNAP2 gene.There were two data sets included in the study.  The first was data from the Collaborative Autism Project (CAP) that included data from 1,537 subjects with autism from 487 families.  The second data was from Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and included data on 3,512 individuals with autism from 680 families.The authors looked for relations in both data sets individually and then jointly to attempt to find any associations with autism.  Like the other study on the same topic there was no significant association in either data set alone but when taken together the results became more significant.This study failed to replicate the association between the CNTNAP2 gene and autism.I think the authors closing statement puts the the results of this study into the proper context -Our results, in combination with the multiple rare variants already identified, suggest that the genetic architecture of autism is as exquisitely complex as is its clinical phenotype.There are a few other things that I wanted to point out about this study as it relates to the other study.   First and most importantly, the data sets used in this study (CAP and AGRE) were also included in the other study.  Second, several of the authors on this study, including the principal authors, were also authors on the first study.

{"date": "Saturday, May 30, 2009", "body": "\nAs was widely expected from leaks earlier this year a new study has been released that estimates that the current prevalence of autism in the UK is 157 per 10,000.  That means that 1 out of every 64 children is expected to have some form of autism, or in a simple percentage form 1.5% of all children in the UK.According to the same study, the accepted prevalence of autism in 1978 was 4 per 10,000.  To get the proper perspective on the relative difference between those numbers, lets look at a picture - For every child in 1978 that was thought to have autism there are slightly over 39 today.If this growth pattern were seen in any other disorder I think people would sit up and take notice.  The word epidemic might even be used.  But this isn't any other field, this is autism, so there is some magic wand that makes these numbers make sense, right?  The authors of the study suggest - improved recognition and detection changes in study methodologyan increase in available diagnostic servicesincreased awareness among professionals and parentsgrowing acceptance that autism can coexist with a range of other conditionsa widening of the diagnostic criteriaOr in short - the criteria changed, we are better at seeing it because more people know what to look for, and there are more services so more people are likely to seek the diagnosis.  These reasons make up what I call the holy trinity of denial.  To be fair there is some truth to some of these reasons.  The criteria in 1978 was different that it is today and more people know what autism looks like and are less likely to call it something else.  Given the history of autism I don't think the services part holds water but that is a subject for another day.But lets accept for a minute that all three reasons are true and each had the effect of doubling the number of cases.  We would then be talking about 32 per 10,000 which is still a far cry from the 157 per 10,000 number.I think science needs to come up with some better reasons for this growth, something that fits the facts, rather than sticking their collecting heads in the sand.  Because if autism keeps growing at the same rate 30 years from now we will be seeing autism in every 1 out of 2 children and then there really will be a problem.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1163606/One-child-60-suffers-form-autism.html", "http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/short/194/6/500", "//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SiHVpz_PFsI/AAAAAAAAAAM/UTQLwDRvsn0/s1600-h/chart.GIF"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/05/celebrating-30-years-of-better.html", "title": "\nCelebrating 30 years of better diagnosis\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, May 21, 2009", "body": "\nThere were two studies published at the end of last month with a large amount of fanfare announcing that a gene was discovered that might be responsible for as many as 15 percent of cases of autism.I wanted to write about them earlier but the studies are complex and understanding what exactly they are saying has taken me some time. \u00a0I am going to start with the main study and should follow up with the second study shortly. \u00a0The main study was\u00a0published on April 28th in Nature -Common genetic variants on 5p14.1 associate with autism spectrum disordersThis study has an large list of authors with over 50 people attaching their name to the study - I don't recall ever seeing a study with so many names attached to it. \u00a0The study itself is a very dense five pages of material although the supplementary material weights in 65 pages.In this study the authors were attempting to identify common genetic risk factors for autism. \u00a0They first started by looking for associations in a data set from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) that ultimately contained 3,101 subjects of European descent from 780 families. \u00a0 \u00a0There were no associations found that were significant. \u00a0However, the authors proposed that there could be meaningful associations that among the results that showed some possible association yet did not rise to the level statistical significance.To that end examined a second data set from an Autism Case-Control cohort (ACC) containing 1,204 case subjects and 6,491 control subjects that were provided from multiple projects across the country and from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia.No significant associations were found in this data set either.However, the authors took it a step further and did a meta-analysis of the two data sets together using very recent techniques and found a result that reached significance and several others that came close. \u00a0The most significant association was found at 5p14.1 with the others being located at several nearby locations.To confirm these findings two other data sets were examined.  The first was the Collaborative Autism Project (CAP) cohort with 504 subjects and the second was the Center for Autism Research and Treatment (CART) cohort with 108 case subjects and 540 controls.\u00a0 Neither of these two data sets yielded a significant association on their own but like the AGRE dataset they showed some associations that did not reach the level of significance. \u00a0However, when these data sets were combined with the original two the areas identified above were again significant.All of the areas of interest identified are location in a region between the CDH9 and CDH10 genes. \u00a0The authors hypothesized that the locations identified were showing functional variations in one of two two genes.These genes and others that could be related are thought to be involved play a role in shaping the physical structure and functional connectivity of the brain. \u00a0These are two areas that other research as identified as potential issues in people with autism, so the results do fit with other theories of autism.\u00a0As an aside, there is a\u00a0post at autism.about.com where Lisa Jo Rudy published some questions and answers from the study's lead author that is worth reading.I am not sure what to make of this study.It is not straightforward at all and the amount of information published with the study is far larger than is normal. \u00a0I think this is likely because the authors wanted to cover all of their bases yet I have to wonder why those chose to add all of it. \u00a0I am confused as to why a significant association was not present in any of the individual data sets but only appeared when the data sets were analyzed together. \u00a0I would think that if the claim of 15% of autism cases contained in the press releases for the study were correct that the association would have been more apparent from looking at any of the data sets individually. \u00a0Or I would have thought that it would have been identified in one of the other large genetic searches that were done prior to this.I also have to wonder at the methodology used to perform the meta analysis of the data sets. \u00a0From what I can gather the technique is very new - the reference that the study provides to the methodology was published just a month or two (October 2008) before this study was submitted to the publisher (Nov 2008). \u00a0I did not investigate the methods in depth but from what little I did see gives me pause. \u00a0The results of the study rest on the meta analysis of the data sets - if this methodology is flawed or was implemented badly then association found would fall apart.\u00a0So all in all I would think that this is a potentially promising study but that further confirmation is required.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature07999.html", "http://www.agre.org/", "http://autism.about.com/od/geneticsandautism/a/chopautism.htm", "http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/R2/R122"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/05/study-watch-common-genetic-variants-on.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : Common genetic variants on 5p14.1 associate with autism spectrum disorders\n"},

{"date": "Friday, April 3, 2009", "body": "\nIn an earlier post I wrote about a study that showed a possible abnormal immune reaction in children with autism to a flame retardant called BDE-47. \u00a0At the time I thought it was mostly an academic concern and was just a good example of how the environment could interact differently in children with autism.It turns out that there could be more to it than that. \u00a0According to an article on Science Daily a new report has been issued by NOAA\u00a0scientists concerning the concentration of flame retardants in coastal waters -NOAA scientists, in a first-of-its-kind report issued today, state that Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs), chemicals commonly used in commercial goods as flame retardants since the 1970s, are found in all United States coastal waters and the Great Lakes, with elevated levels near urban and industrial centers.The new findings are in contrast to analysis of samples as far back as 1996 that identified PBDEs in only a limited number of sites around the nation.The original report is available on this page. \u00a0I have not yet read the entire report but there are some facts that have jumped out at me from the parts that I have read.First, this report is is talking about\u00a0Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) which are\u00a0brominated flame retardants\u00a0like BDE-47 that was mentioned in the earlier study. \u00a0So the results from earlier research could possibly apply to the PDBEs that a child is exposed to from the environment.Second, from the executive summary of the NOAA report -In recent years, PBDEs have generated international concern due to their global distribution and associated adverse environmental and human health effects. Laboratory studies indicate that PBDEs may impair liver, thyroid, and neurobehavioral development, and the most sensitive populations are likely to be pregnant women, developing fetuses, and infants.So there are concerns that exposure can cause impaired neurobehavioral development in fetuses and infants.\u00a0Third, even though production of PDBEs have been banned in Europe and Asia there are still some forms that are being made in the Unites States (from the executive summary again) -PBDE production has been banned throughout Europe and Asia, and production of some PBDE mixtures has been voluntarily discontinued by U.S. industry, although one form of PBDE is still produced. While production of PBDE flame retardants began in the 1970s and peaked in 1999 they are still found in many consumer products including many household items. Because the application of PBDEs has been so widespread \u2013 including many consumer plastics, textiles, electronics, and furniture \u2013 scientists speculate that they may present an ongoing and growing problem in coastal environmentsWhich is indeed what this most recent report has found - that the concentration of PBDEs in coastal waters are growing.The following is conjecture on my part - I am not an expert in this subject and it is entirely possible (some would say likely) that I am could be completely off base here.\u00a0\u00a0Having said that if you put the above pieces of information together, specifically -PBDEs can\u00a0impair neurobehavioral development in infants.PBDEs could cause immunine problems in some children with autism.\u00a0The concentration of PBDEs in the environment is growing.what you are left with is an example of how a growing chemical exposure could be related to the growing number of cases of autism. \u00a0I am not saying that I think that PBDEs are in any way responsible for the growth of autism but still it seems plausible that there could be relation.Just my 2 cents worth.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090401112450.htm", "http://www.noaa.gov/", "http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/about/coast/nsandt/PBDEreport.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybrominated_diphenyl_ethers", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brominated_flame_retardant", "http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/about/coast/nsandt/pdf/PBDEreport/pbde-execsum.pdf"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/flame-retardants-in-environment.html", "title": "\nFlame retardants in the environment\n"},

According to the story\u00a0at\u00a0Age of Autism, \u00a0Dr. Landis was observed at a recent IACC meeting exchanging notes with one of her colleges, Dr. State. \u00a0After the meeting was over, one of the parents attending the meeting saw that there were notes on the floor near were the good doctors were sitting. \u00a0People being who they are, the parents picked up the notes and the contents made their way to the Age of Autism site. \n\nThe contents of the notes are a\u00a0fascinating\u00a0glimpse\u00a0into the mind of one the committee members. \u00a0There are five scribbled notes on the, four of which I will quote below. \u00a0 If I am reading what was written correctly, Dr. Landis does not care for either the so-called \"anti-vax\" movement of Age of Autism nor the \"anti-cure\" movement of Neurodiversity.\n\nThis is what Dr. Landis had to say about vaccines and autism -\nI wonder is Lyn Redwood is pushing autism as a multisystem disorder to feed into vaccine injury?\nWould be a good justification for looking at vaccine injured kids who have gotten awards.\nAnd about the Neurodiversity movement -\nThis is like the controversy over cochlear implants and the deafness co\nThere are advocacy groups claiming its more like homosexuality\nAs a direct result of these notes being published on Age of Autism, Dr. Landis resigned from the IACC committee on Saturday. \u00a0And, as David Kirby reports over at the Huffington Post, Dr. Landis issued an apology that her \"personal reflections during the meeting have been taken out of context and have been interpreted by the community in ways that I would never intend\". \n\nShe also threw a bone to the Age of Autism crowd and implied that her remark about looking at kids who have gotten awards really meant that she was in favor of looking for a link between vaccines and autism. \n\nYea, right. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it would be a good thing if someone seriously tackled the remaining questions concerning vaccines and autism. \u00a0But I don't believe for a second that her second remark was talking about doing that. \n\nAs for what the ND movement had to say about this? \u00a0Well, if you need a good laugh go look at the attempted spin on this\u00a0post at Left Brain Right Brain. \u00a0Poor Sullivan tries so hard to spin this into something that is isn't but all he ends up with his is own \"big oops\" that should have been deleted rather than posted. \u00a0But what else is new.\n\nI think the true importance of what Dr. Landis wrote was the candor of her statements and the insight into what public health officials think of the various factions in the autism world. \u00a0There is the impression that the vaccine-autism crowd is looking for a quick payday and that the ND crowd is trying to trying to turn a serious condition into a trivial debate on whether autism is a mental health disorder and whether to treat it.\n\nI don't necessarily agree with everything that Dr. Landis had to say but I do find it refreshing that officials in the government show signs of intelligence. \u00a0At least one of the above views is accurate (in my humble opinion). \u00a0Here's a hint - most people who have children with autism are looking for answers and a way to help their children - autism is not a get rich quick scheme (if it is, would someone please let me in on the secret?).\n\nI\u00a0believe the real reason that Dr. Landis is calling it quits is because of what she wrote about fellow committee member Lyn Redwood. \u00a0If you are going to publicly state that a college is in it for the money, you had best have something to back up your statement. \u00a0She may not have intended for her comment to become public but it did. \u00a0In the future perhaps she could prevent this sort of trouble by not passing notes?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/St5X2LQExJI/AAAAAAAAAFI/6Vibbnz3Ry0/s1600-h/note.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/wheatfields/1803278949/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/dr-story-landis-autism-not-a-multi-symptom-disease-but-a-money-making-scheme.html", "http://www.rescuepost.com/files/iacc-sp-workshop-notes---dr-landis0001.pdf", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/nih-agency-head-backs-vac_b_325221.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3326"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/10/dr-landis-leaves-trail-of-genius-at.html", "title": "\nDr. Landis Leaves a Trail of Genius at the IACC\n"},

This study investigated the expression of several nuclear proteins and their dependence on MeCP2 dose and presence of the Rett causative R306C mutation. To this end, we developed in vitro models representing MeCP2 deficiency induced by siRNAs, and cells expressing the R306C mutation. Using an extended antibody microarray validated by specific assays, revealed that MeCP2 dose was correlated with specific nuclear proteins profiles including the BRM/SNF2 component of SWI/SNF complex, PRMT1 methyl transferase and HDAC2. Furthermore, while exposing the MeCP2 knock-down system to therapeutic concentrations of valproic acid (VPA), a known HDACs inhibitor, we observed a partial restoration of MeCP2 expression levels. Exposure to VPA also increased the levels of BRM, as well as of BDNF, an important co-factor in MeCP2-mediated pathway. Our findings provide additional evidence of diverse mechanisms of MeCP2 function as transcriptional repressor and activator of specific genes. As it has been recently demonstrated that post-natal restoration of MeCP2 deficiency may reverse neurological defects in a mouse model of Rett syndrome, we suggest to study the restorative effect of HDAC inhibitors in MeCP2-deficient mouse model.\nThe thing that I find most interesting here is that\u00a0valproic acid, the substance that might help restore normal functioning, is one of the substances that is known to increase the risk of autism\u00a0during\u00a0pregnancy. \u00a0Or in other words, if you are on valproic acid while you are pregnant, you stand a good chance of having a child with autism. \u00a0Yet the same substance might be able to help correct the problems that lead to Rett Syndrome, go figure.\n\nObviously it goes without saying that this research is very theoretical in nature and that there has been no case where Rett's was actually reversed in a person. \u00a0However, it is encouraging that there may be the possibility of one day being able to \"cure\" a genetic form of autism. \u00a0It gives me hope that someday other forms of autism can be cured.\n\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S1zAbmJd65I/AAAAAAAAAKk/r-ffX6Oa_Rc/s1600-h/dna_puzzle.jpg", "http://images.wellcome.ac.uk/indexplus/result.html?_IXMAXHITS_=1&_IXACTION_=query&_IXFIRST_=1&_IXSR_=JiT2xg8idnc&_IXSS_=_IXFPFX_%3dtemplates%252ft%26_IXFIRST_%3d1%26%252asform%3dwellcome%252dimages%26%2524%2bnot%2b%2522Contemporary%2bclinical%2bimages%2522%2bindex%2bwi_collection%3d%252e%26_IXACTION_%3dquery%26wi_credit_line%253atext%3d%2522Adrian%2bCousins%2522%26%2524%253dsort%3dsort%2bsortexpr%2bimage_sort%26%2524%2bwith%2bimage_sort%3d%252e%26_IXSESSION_%3ddu7wLUZ_8U2%26_IXMAXHITS_%3d250%26%2524%2bwith%2bwi_sfgu%2bis%2bY%3d%252e&_IXSPFX_=templates%2ft&_IXFPFX_=templates%2ft", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rett_syndrome", "http://www.landesbioscience.com/journals/epigenetics/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20093853", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valproic_acid", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15749245"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/01/could-rett-syndrome-be-reversible.html", "title": "\nCould Rett Syndrome be reversible?\n"},

FodstadObjective: While autism spectrum disorders (ASD) constitute a group of similar conditions, considerable heterogeneity in symptoms of these neurodevelopmental disorders have been noted. One of the most important, yet least studied, of these factors is developmental regression.Methods: One-hundred and twenty-five children were studied and broken down into the following three groups: ASD children with and without substantial regression and typically developing children. In study one, the three groups were compared on global measures of ASD symptomatology, comorbid psychopathology, challenging behaviour and social skills. In study two, the two ASD groups were compared on each individual item from the dependent measures.Results: Mean age when regression occurred was 27.76 months. The ASD children as a whole differed from the typically developing controls, showing more symptoms of ASD, as would be expected, and poorer social skills, while differences were also noted between the two ASD groups.Conclusions: It was determined that children with ASD who regress present with a distinct behavioural profile when compared to children with ASD who do not regress, which included greater levels of impairment on global measures of ASD symptomatology, comorbid psychopathology, challenging behaviour and social skills.It has long been thought (or speculated at least) that children who regress into autism are different than children who show signs of it from birth or simply fail to acquire skills when they should. \u00a0Yet, there has not been much research into the exact differences between the two groups. \u00a0This is one of the first studies that I have seen that says that there is a behavioral difference between the groups.\nIt is my belief that this regressive group is more likely to have a form of autism that is \"triggered\" by something rather than to have a purely genetic form and should be broken out separately from other forms of autism in research studies. \u00a0Yet, up until now, I have not seen anybody suggest that it would be possible to separate the two groups. \u00a0Perhaps it would be possible if regressive autism has slightly different behaviors associated with it.\nInteresting.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17518420903107984", "http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17518420903107984"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/comparing-regressive-to-non-regressive.html", "title": "\nComparing regressive to non-regressive autism\n"},
{"date": "Friday, January 16, 2009", "body": "\nI have seen this argument a lot as of late.  It normally runs the standard course of correlation does not imply causation with a good implication of just because there is a correlation does not imply a relationship.Unfortunately it isn't really true.It is true that a correlation between two variables, say for example the weather and autism rates, does not imply that one causes the other.  But it does not rule it out either.So making a statement about implying a lack of causation is as wrong as saying that there is causal relationship - there simply is not enough data from a correlation to say either way.  Actually, for causation there first has to be a correlation, but I digress.  In reality the best you can do is make a neutral statement.However, a correlation does say that these two variables have a relationship where they change in tandem, ie they are not independent.  This means that the variable are related in some way or there is some other factor to which they both respond.So at that point you either a) have bad data b) have a spurious correlation or c) there is a relationship between the variables.For a better explanation of this I suggest reading the belowhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causationSo going back to the ice cream and murder from the post that I linked to, the correlation between the two apparently unrelated items does show that they both can sometimes be related to some outside factor, in this case the weather can effect both.  So while ice cream sales and murder don't cause one another they do have a causal factor in common, the weather.  Not that this implies that the weather is the only factor driving both, it simply implies that it is a factor.Or, while we are talking about the weather, if you have studies showing a correlation between autism rates and the weather while it does not follow that the weather causes autism or cause autism to be diagnosed, it does follow that there is some common factor between the two (assuming that there is not some problem with the data or the study).  Which implies that there is something related to the environment that can effect autism.  And for a disorder that is taken to be strictly genetic that would be a bit of pickle.But I guess that is the real issue anyway.  As a parent, if I see a therapy change the behavior of my child with autism, authors like the above would have me doubt that the therapy worked.  Or if I change my child's diet and see drastic improvements in attention and eye contact, that might have just happened anyway with out the diet change.After all, just because B follows A doesn't mean that there is a relationship.  Taken to the extreme, just because I turn the door handle on a door and the door opens, it does not follow that me turning the handle opened the door, right?Only it turns out that once you start down that road you can't really prove a relationship between any two events at all.  I push the key on the keyboard and a letter appears on the screen of the computer - what evidence do I have that the two have any real correlation let alone a causal one?It is a good thing that people have the ability to reason.  After all, you might have identical twin girls who both get a shot on the same day, both develop a fever within the next 24 hours and spend the next month sick and mostly non-responsive.  And after the end of the month you give them another shot because everyone knows they are perfectly safe and the doctor is saying that you should do it.  And then you spend the next six months wondering if they can still hear when they answered to their names before but now don't respond to any sounds.  Then the diagnosis.Could it have happened anyway?  Of course.  Was there any relationship between the shots and the regression?  There is no way to know for certain.   Would it have happened regardless of the shots?  Again, that isn't knowable.  But, given the fact that they are genetically identical yet separate people and they both had the same reaction and the same time (illness) it makes it less like likely to be just chance and more likely to be a potential factor in the equation, just like the hot weather helps to sell ice cream.But I am guessing this will be just another one of those meaningless correlations for some people.  Just because it happened to one, oops, I mean two, people the same way at the same time means nothing.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.change.org/blog/view/causation_correlation_and_ice_cream_sundaes", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/01/correlation-causation-and-non-sense.html", "title": "\nCorrelation, Causation, and non-sense\n"},

This document is an overview of what we know about autism and, in a section entitled \"How many people have autism\",  I found this gem -\nSome estimates of prevalence rely on previously published studies. Researchers review all the published data on a topic and take the averages of these calculations to determine prevalence. Independent researchers recently conducted two such reviews. Based on these studies, the best conservative estimate of the prevalence of ASDs in the United States is that one child in 1,000 children has an ASDThe document was published in 2005.  Today, the conservative number is that 1 in 110 children have autism, a staggering 900% percent change from only 5 years ago, but we still don't \"know\" whether autism is increasing. \u00a0I mean with only a 250% increase over 10 to 15 years followed by a 900% increase in five years, it is very hard to tell.\n\nNext, from the \"ouch, you just hurt my head\" department, we have Sullivan (of LBRB infamy) chiming in with the non sequitur of the day in his comments on OSR #1 controversy.  His comment was made in reference to the allegations that OSR #1 is an \"industrial chelator\".  The company that makes OSR #1 had this to say about the the claim -\nOSR#1\u00ae as produced by CTI Science is not now and has never been marketed or tested as an environmental or industrial chelator. Nor has OSR#1\u00ae been tested in humans as a chelator by CTI Science, and no claims of chelation treatment use are made by CTI Science.Sullivan, in all of this wisdom, came up with this response to the statements -\n[T]his may have been addressed already, but CTI science has *not* stated that OSR is *not* a chelator.  (Quoted text removed).  They state it is not an *industrial* chelator. They state that it has not been *tested* as a chelator by CTI Science. \u00a0Mr. Haley\u2019s company was originally called \u201cChelator Technologies\u201d. \u00a0The chemical used is a chelator.How does a company responding to a claim that their product is an \"industrial chelator\" by saying it is not an industrial chelator get changed into them not saying that is is not a chelator by saying that is not a chelator?  Maybe the logic makes sense to Sullivan, but it just hurts my head.\n\nBut the funniest quote of the day comes from the Clay Adams as a response to me labeling him a notorious bully -\nI see he calls me a \u201cnotorious bully\u201d, for taking Jonathan Mitchell to task with satire. What he failed to read was that it was all \u201cpay-back\u201d for him bullying people I know and like on his blog.Because you know, you aren't being a bully if you are only doing it for \"pay-back\".\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh3.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/Ssi81ox8HoI/AAAAAAAAADc/aQV9_fCVnfQ/s1600/snipercat.jpg", "http://health.nih.gov/topic/Autism/ChildTeenHealth", "http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs_details.cfm?from=&pubs_id=3903", "http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/207/", "https://www.ctiscience.com/CTIScience/FAQs.do", "http://autism.about.com/b/2010/07/05/osr1-autism-and-the-web-a-case-study-in-confusion.htm#comment-43", "http://astridvanwoerkom.wordpress.com/2010/07/13/against-the-autism-dichotomy/#comment-7649"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/07/jabberwocky-of-day.html", "title": "\nJabberwocky of the Day\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 13, 2010", "body": "\nAlmost a year ago there was a study released in Pediatrics about parent's refusing the Pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine and how that lead to a greater risk of contracting whooping cough.\n\nAt the time, certain sites suggested that the increase of cases of pertussis that we have been seeing over the last number of years were related to more and more parents refusing the vaccine. \u00a0Or in simple terms, it was the \"anti-vaccine\" movement that was to blame.\n\nWell, according to a new report from the CDC, we can put that myth to rest.  According to this report, while it is still unclear exactly what is going on, there are several factors that are suggested -\n\n1. Waning immunity\n2. Suboptimal vaccine coverage\n3. Improved surveillance and diagnosis\n4. The switch from whole cell vaccine (WCV) to acellular vaccine (ACV)\n5. Adaptation of circulating Bordetella pertussis strains.\n\nThe first reason is a no-brainer - the immunity granted from a vaccine does wear off over time (6-10 years), and no one really expects it to last for longer than that.  Interestingly enough, the outbreaks that have been seen are in older children (10-19 year old), which fits well with the theory.\n\nThe second reason, well, I know the CDC publishes data on the uptake of the vaccine and I believe the coverage is very high so I don't know how much this contributes to the problem - especially since the majority of the increase is being seen in older children where the first point is more relevant.\n\nThe third reason I am not going to talk about other than to say that it seems that increases in everything are blamed on more awareness and better diagnosis. \u00a0I am sure that it plays some role, but, at the same time, give it a rest already.\n\nWith the last two reasons, I think we come to the real problem.  The vaccine was switched several years back from a whole cell vaccine to an acellular vaccine.  What this means, according to an article in The New Scientist is that -\nA key issue is that the whole-cell vaccine contained hundreds of antigens, which gave broad protection against many strains of pertussis. But the acellular vaccine contains only three to five antigens. Our findings suggest that the use of the acellular vaccine may be one factor contributing to these genetic changesThe new vaccine does not as create as broad of immunity as the old one.  And, equally important, it looks like several strains of the pertussis virus have mutated so that the vaccine no longer protects against them.\n\nSo there you have it, the most likely reason that cases of pertussis are rising is that the vaccine that is supposed to\u00a0prevent\u00a0it is not as effective as it used to be.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh3.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SrmRHcqkJ-I/AAAAAAAAADM/0cAcTUk5WG8/s1600/vac.png", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2009/03/anti-vaxxers-rejoice-you-got-another-one/", "http://autism.about.com/b/2009/05/26/fear-of-autism-raises-rate-of-whooping-cough.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5450a3.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/2/297.htm", "http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2010/02/whooping-cough-evolves-to-esca.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/parental-refusal-of-pertussis-vacation.html", "title": "\nParental refusal of pertussis vacation, take 2\n"},

Be it an immune-mediated connection, versus a 'brain-gut axis' interplay such as seem in irritable bowel syndrome, the increased prevalence of GI symptoms in this group of patients cannot be denied, nor the added distress that these symptoms could have on an individual who is already communicatively challenged.

I don't know that much about the specifics of his principles, so lets ask our good friend wiki to help:Finding the behaviorism of his time to be problematic, Skinner branched off his own version he called Radical Behaviorism which unlike methodological behaviorism did not require truth by consensus so it could accept private events such as thinking, perception and emotion in its account. Also, unlike all of the other behaviorists such as Tolman, Hull and Clark, Skinner's version radically rejected mediating constructs and the hypothetico-deductive method, instead offering a strongly inductive, data driven approach that has proven to be successful in dozens of areas from behavioral pharmacology to language therapy in the developmentally delayed.So taking thinking, perception, and emotion into account and using a data driven approach.  This makes our children into robots?So, does Ms Chew have anything good to say about ABA?BA teaching has been very beneficial to my son's learning, but often precisely because of the \"human element\"---because of the people who are teaching him, and who don't always say the same phrase exactly the same way, and sometimes respond one way and sometimes don't.So the good thing about ABA is when it isn't?Sigh.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.change.org/blog/view/when_the_teachers_are_robots", "http://autism.change.org/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner#Radical_behaviorism"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/02/hello-mr-robot-how-are-you-today.html", "title": "\nHello Mr Robot, how are you today?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, June 9, 2010", "body": "\nIn this month's issue of the journal Pediatrics, there is an excellent article entitled \"Autism in 1959: Joey the Mechanical Boy\" that talks about part of the history of autism. \u00a0It talks about how, not that long ago, the predominate causation theory of autism was that it was something that happened to children because of cold and uncaring mothers. \u00a0This was known as the\u00a0refrigerator-mother theory of autism and was thankfully debunked many years ago.\n\nWhile I \u00a0like to think that we have come a long way since then, I was recently\u00a0reminded that some people still seem to think that autism is something that a parent does, either\u00a0intentionally\u00a0or unintentionally, \u00a0to their children. \u00a0To those people I would have to say, well, you really need to spend some time learning of what you speak.\n\nIt was nice to see the an article in a mainstream journal like Pediatrics taking the theory to task and putting it in its proper historical perspective. \u00a0But more than that, the author of this article points out that some of the parental distrust of the medical community might be able to be traced back to these earlier theories of autism. \u00a0Here are a few excerpts from the article that I found to be\u00a0particularly\u00a0worthwhile -\nFor many in the autism community, the popularity of the refrigerator-mother hypothesis before the 1970s continues to be remembered as an example of what might be called \"the tyranny of expertise\"\u2014the danger of giving professionals too much power. ...The most obvious legacy of the refrigerator-mother saga has, thus, been a willingness to question medical authority. This questioning reflects, of course, a broad social trend not limited to autism: patients since the 1970s have increasingly sought greater participation in decision-making in almost every domain of medical practice, both conventional and otherwise. Every physician who works with autistic children has encountered the formidable array of restriction diets, vitamins, and other alternative \"biomedical treatments\" embraced by many parents for autism despite a lack of evidence from controlled trials. The coalescence of the antivaccine movement around autism has become especially polarizing, pitting parents against one of the most valued tools in the pediatric armamentarium to promote child health.Yet, focusing on the theme of antagonism obscures the positive contributions made by many parents to research and treatment approaches in autism. It was, in large measure, thanks to parents that the refrigerator-mother paradigm finally collapsed. ...At a moment in time when the polarization over vaccines has created a deep rift between many parents and professionals, it is worth viewing today's conflict from the vantage point of history. Forgotten for the most part by physicians, the memory of the refrigerator-mother explanation of autism has fundamentally shaped the autism community.

We have been having some issues with sleep for the past few weeks so the topic is very much on my mind.One of the things that we use to help our children sleep is\u00a0melatonin.Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone\u00a0that serves many purposes in the body, one of which is helping you fall asleep. \u00a0It is relatively safe to use in children and has very few (if any) side effects. \u00a0However, while it is available over the counter as a supplement, I would suggest talking to a medical professional before giving it to your children. \u00a0That is just common sense for anything like this that you give to your children - especially the ones who can't communicate well.With that in mind I wanted to point out some new research that appeared in the April 15th\u00a0issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0The Efficacy of Melatonin for Sleep Problems in Children with Autism, Fragile X Syndrome, or Autism and Fragile X SyndromeI think this is one the first double-blind placebo controlled studies\u00a0that I have seen that looks specifically at the question of how effective melatonin is in helping\u00a0children with autism sleep better. \u00a0The\u00a0study was on the smaller side with only 12 of 18 subjects completing the study as well as being on the shorter side being only 4 weeks long. \u00a0Each of the participants took either melatonin or a placebo for two weeks and then switched to the the other group.The authors found that the group taking melatonin feel asleep faster and stayed asleep longer than the group taking a placebo.I have not read the full study so I can't comment about why 6 children dropped out or if there were other problems with the study but I don't think the findings are all that surprising. \u00a0I believe the practice of giving melatonin to children with autism to help them sleep better is fairly widespread. \u00a0The only point of contention that I have seen is how\u00a0much you should be giving. \u00a0\u00a0In this study the dose was 3 mg but I have read other places of the range being from 1 mg up to 6 mg. \u00a0We give our daughters 0.25 mg on nights they are having trouble falling asleep and that works for them. \u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin", "http://www.aasmnet.org/jcsm/ViewAbstract.aspx?pid=27443"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/study-watch-efficacy-of-melatonin-for.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : The Efficacy of Melatonin for Sleep Problems in Children\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 21, 2009", "body": "\nThe New York Times earlier this week published an article entitled Trying Anything and Everything for Autism.  You would think that with a title like that it would be a hopeful story about parents trying to help their children on the spectrum in search of a cure.You would be wrong.Rather this article is one of the many boiler plate articles as of late that are attempting to sway public opinion about what autism is and how best to treat it. It starts out like normal articles of this type talking about \"the diagnosis\" followed by some descriptions of treatments with a small nod to the fact that autism is not a uniform disorder :It is also true that autism is highly variable, with periodic improvements and regressions, and most children receive several therapies at once. So it is difficult to say what makes things better or worse at a given timewhich is unfortunately one of the last balanced statements in the article.  From there we go straight to the FUDWe don\u2019t know what would have happened if we had done nothing.with a quick stop to listen to the voice of god (although in this case god has a son with autism) proclaim:In \u201cDefeating Autism: A Damaging Delusion\u201d (Routledge, 2009), Dr. Michael Fitzpatrick, a general practitioner in London whose son is autistic, likened the alternative medicine approach to a return to \u201cmedicine\u2019s dark ages.\u201dEvery biomedical intervention, he wrote, \u201cis supported by anecdotes and personal testimonies: it is understandable that parents want to share their experience that their child has made progress, and it is equally understandable that other parents are impressed by success stories.\u201dDr. Fitzpatrick continued, \u201cWhen parents have invested money, time, energy and, above all, hope into a particular treatment, it is natural to seek to attribute any improvement to that treatment.\u201d But, he added, anecdotal examples and wishful thinking are not science.and finishes up the the enlightenment of the one true treatment of ABA :The one approach that has been scientifically validated to help, though by no means cure, autistic children is behavioral intervention that mimics the way normal children learn, Dr. Schreibman said....the results are not instant, but it does work. But the earlier in a child\u2019s life it is started, the more effective it is likely to be.So, in a few short paragraphs we have the dark ages, wishful thinking on the parent's  part, and, my favorite, anecdotal examples are not science.  Followed by the one true path of ABA.Don't get me wrong, I believe that ABA is an effective treatment to use, my own children are benefiting from it.  I just don't believe it is enough on its own nor do I believe that it will work for every child.This is the standard form for these articles now; the diagnosis, the brush with quackery, the voice of reason, followed by the use ABA and avoid the rest of that stuff.Well, then, here is my question.  Where is the science to prove or disprove how well these other treatments work?  When a new drug is first introduced to treat some new disease or condition or restless legs it is normally described as \"promising\" and its potential to help people is played up.  But when you are talking about treatments for autism they are \"wasting valuable time, effort and money on remedies that lack a scientific basis and proof of effectiveness\".Autism has been around for many years in its current form and when you consider the original label was coined over fifty years you would have thought that there would have been enough time to evaluate some of these anecdotal examples. Take for example the dietary changes that the article mentions, the gluten-free and casein-free (and sometime soy-free) diet that was mentioned.  This is a very common intervention that is used by parents yet there are very few studies that have even looked at the question and none that have some so properly.  Yet parent's keep doing it, so lets ask ourselves, why? For myself I can answer that we pursue the diet for my twins who have autism because it worked - both twins showed a large improvement in eye contact and attention when their diet changed.  Although in our case I believe it is mostly milk that they have an issue with.So how about some science that identifies the subset of people with autism who many have issues with certain dietary elements which them proceeds to measure the physical signs of this intolerance.  Then do a controlled study were you remove the substance in question and remeasure.  This isn't rocket science. There are plenty of studies looking for the genetic smoking gun that causes autism but so far none have been found.  Why not take some of the funding for these genetic studies and investigate some of the other promising areas?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/health/20brod.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-york-times-earlier-this-week.html", "title": "\nThe press's autism boilerplate\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 9, 2009", "body": "\nOver the weekend the the Times Online has reported the results of an investigation  that \"prove\" that Dr. Wakefield altered the data behind his controversial study linking the MMR vaccine and autism.   The stories are both authored by one reporter by the name of Brian Deer.  Mr. Deer has been involved in covering this story for many years and seems to attempting to be Wakefield's Harry Markopolos.  For those of you who don't know or who have been hiding under a rock for the past several years, Dr Wakefield is currently facing charges in the UK over this matter.  It is worth noting that the trial/hearing/procedure is still currently underway and no verdict has yet been rendered.These reports have of course created the usual stories for the usual places with the right wing of the autism debate proclaiming that this is yet another nail in the coffin for the theory and the left wing proclaiming that this is yet another smear job by Brian Deer.Then you have the instant classics like this one :How many of you have read Peter Pan? Do you remember Tinker Bell? Do you remember her saying that every time someone says that they do not believe in fairies, a fairy dies? It is the same with immunisations. Every time someone says they don't believe in immunisations, a child will die.(Ok, that isn't really a fair quote, but that passage is way over the top.  Go read the original for the complete context)And yet another one : This may cause a firestorm in the antivax community, but there are two things I will guarantee: the first is that in the end antivaxxers will stick to their beliefs that vaccines cause health problems like autism, because this is not and never has been, for them, about the facts and evidence. It\u2019s a belief system, and like most other belief systems, it is impenetrable to evidence.And then you have the ones here and here and here, really, it is everywhere.  Dr. Wakefield has responded to the allegations here.The standard line is that his study has been disproving many times over.  But that is a funny thing, if you go looking for a study that attempts to replicate his findings, there aren't many.  Oh there are studies that were attempted that used other methodologies, and then there are the studies that looked for a correlation between autism and the MMR and failed to find one - but most took a different path than the original study.The only decent size study that I am aware of that attempted to replicate his methodology is this one. (This study is open access, so go read it yourself for the full picture). Now this study is presented as a study disproving the theory - yet there is one very interesting tidbit that is buried in the study.  Apparently out of the 38 subjects in the study (25 cases and 13 controls) they did find evidence of the measles virus in the GI tract of two of the subjects - one from each of the groups.You may say so what, but what I find interesting is that before this it was not accepted that it was possible for the measles virus to do this.So what's the bottom line here?  The new allegations from the Brian Deer is based on \"hidden\" and \"confidential\" medical records so there isn't any way to verify what he s saying.  Mr Deer clearly has an axe to grind - which doesn't mean he is wrong but it does cast some doubt on what he is saying.  Science hasn't properly attempted to replicate his study and the only one that did hints at some things that weren't though possible.Overall I think I have to agree with that Harold Doherty wrote here.  The jury is still out and it is premature at best to declare that Wakefield is guilty.Edited to add:This is an example of how these sorts of allegations could be handled differently (site requires free registration).\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece", "http://autism.change.org/blog/view/manipulated_data_behind_mmr-autism_controversy", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1849", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/brian-deer-history-repeating-itself-as-farce.html", "http://nhsblogdoc.blogspot.com/2009/02/im-believer-mmr-measles-autism.html", "http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/07/did-the-founder-of-the-antivax-movement-fake-autism-vaccine-link/", "http://autism.about.com/b/2009/02/09/andrew-wakefield-autism-and-the-mmr-a-new-controversy-arises.htm", "http://blogs.usatoday.com/sciencefair/2009/02/report-doctor-m.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/08/doctor-andrew-wakefield-w_n_165033.html", "http://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/sunday-times-sinks-to-new-low-with-yet-more-mmr-junk-journalism#Wakefield_Response", "http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003140", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/02/so-much-for-due-process-timesonline.html", "http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/55408/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/02/it-was-wakefield-in-study-with-false.html", "title": "\nIt was Wakefield, in the Study, with the false data?\n"},

Research must aim to discover the mechanisms of action that trigger autism, as well as safe, effective and novel treatments to enhance the quality of life for children and adults currently affected.Early diagnosis and early intervention are critical to helping people with autism reach their potential, but educational, vocational and support services must be applied across the lifespan. Science has a critical role to play in creating evidence-based, effective lifespan interventions.Vaccines save lives; they do not cause autism. Numerous studies have failed to show a causal link between vaccines and autism. Vaccine safety research should continue to be conducted by the public health system in order to ensure vaccine safety and maintain confidence in our national vaccine program, but further investment of limited autism research dollars is not warranted at this time.Sounds good right? \u00a0Uhm, maybe not so good. \u00a0Lets take a closer look at those goals again -\u00a01. Autism is known to have a strong genetic componentI think this is a safe enough statementResearch must aim to discover the mechanisms of action that trigger autism,So autism is a genetic disposition that has some sort of \"trigger\" that causes it to occur. \u00a0So far so good, nothing out of the ordinary.as well as safe, effective and novel treatments to enhance the quality of life for children and adults currently affected.This is an interesting phrasing. \u00a0You have a condition that has triggers that you are attempting to identify - if you succeed in identifying the triggers then why focus on treatments that \"enhance the quality of life\", why not focus on preventing the condition from being triggered in the first place?The use of the words \"safe\" and \"effective\" is also an interesting choice. \u00a0It almost sounds like they are describing a drug based treatments ... oh uh.2. Early diagnosis and early intervention are critical to helping people with autism reach their potentialThis goal starts off well enough. \u00a0Early intervention is thought to be key to helping people with autism overcome their disability.but\u00a0As my parents were always fond of pointing out when you use the word \"but\" you are essentially negating what came before. \u00a0So early intervention would be key except but...educational, vocational and support services must be applied across the lifespan.\u00a0Ah, early intervention is important but services must be there for the entire life. \u00a0Or in other words, we are going to focus on treatments for adults on the spectrum. \u00a0Sounds like a good idea, there are going to be a huge number of adults on the spectrum in the coming decades and there need to be services to help them since it is likely that the majority will not be able to live independently.Science has a critical role to play in creating evidence-based, effective lifespan interventions.I have never heard of scientific, evidence-based educational, vocational, or support services. \u00a0Do you think they are going to conduct studies to \"prove\" which vocational trades are most suited for people with autism? \u00a0Or do you think they are talking about developing drugs again? \u00a0I'm thinking drugs.3.\u00a0Vaccines save lives; they do not cause autism.Yikes - a \"science\" foundation making a\u00a0unequivocal\u00a0statement of fact. They are in essence saying that all possible avenues of thought have been explored and Science has decreed that there is no possible relationship and that vaccines cannot, under any circumstances cause autism. \u00a0I have to wonder how they know this.\u00a0Numerous studies have failed to show a causal link between vaccines and autism.\u00a0Now I feel much better. \u00a0They have numerous studies that failed to show a link. \u00a0And, as everyone who has taken the basic science knows, having \"numerous failures\" to show a link clearly means that the link isn't there. \u00a0It couldn't be possible that it was just the wrong question being asked.\u00a0Vaccine safety research should continue to be conducted by the public health system in order to ensure vaccine safety and maintain confidence in our national vaccine program,So vaccine safety research should continue to be left up to the companies that are developing the vaccines and marketing them in a liability free market place. \u00a0No possibility of problems there.I also have to wonder at including maintaining confidence as a goal of safety research. \u00a0I would think that the goal of safety research is to make sure that they are safe not to make people feel better about thembutThere is that word again.\u00a0further investment of limited autism research dollars is not warranted at this time.Safety research is important but we won't be doing it - which does make a certain amount of sense since they have already decreed that there is no possibility of any sort of relationship.So, what is the the goal of this new group? \u00a0Simple, to help develop drug based treatments for the up and coming adult autism population. \u00a0It is a good thing that someone started doing the research to serve this market, after all, with 1 in 150 children being on the spectrum the potential market is going to be huge.\u00a0There is more to this story than just the mission of the organization. \u00a0The founders of the group are an interesting lot and, like normal, the reaction on other blogs is fascinating. \u00a0But this post is already on the long side, so that will have to wait for later.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/aboutasf.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/autism-science-foundation.html", "title": "\nThe Autism \"Science\" Foundation\n"},

Well, that is unless you are suggesting it at a potential treatment for autism.  But, unlike last month's sensational headlines based on research presented at a conference, this study is one that you probably won't see in the headlines.\n\nThe reason you won't see this study in the headlines is that it does not deal with an exciting new disease like autism but instead looks at an older, less exciting condition, schizophrenia.\n\nIn this study, researchers from John Hopkins School of Medicine looked for evidence that individuals with schizophrenia had an increased level of antibodies against casein (the protein in cow's milk).  While I don't want to get into a discussion of the various types of antibodies and how they relate to food allergies and/or intolerances, I did want to point out that the researchers took a different approach than is typical and looked at IgG rather than IgE antibodies.\n\nThe researchers did find a large, significant relationship between these IgG antibodies and schizophrenia.  Or, as the researchers put it -\nIn both [schizophrenia] groups, we found elevated IgG to casein proteins, particularly to whole casein and the alpha(s) subunit (pThe elevated IgG and unique patterns of antibody specificity to bovine casein among diagnostic groups provide a rationale for clinical trials to evaluate efficacies of dietary modifications in individuals with neuropsychiatric diseases.Let me put it in even simpler terms.  If you have an elevated level of IgG antibodies against a specific food protein, it might not be a bad idea to try eliminating them from your diet.  And, if you have a mental health condition that has a strong association to these antibodies, perhaps there might be something going on that is worth investigating.\n\nYou might be asking yourself what this has to do with autism, and the answer is simple.  Autism and schizophrenia may be two sides of the same coin.  Many of the areas in the genome that are associated with autism and also associated with schizophrenia and there are theories that these two conditions are in fact just opposite ends of a developmental spectrum.  In other words, if you have too much of some chemical or duplications in a genetic region, you may get autism.  If you have too little or deletions in the same region, you may have schizophrenia instead.\n\nOn a more personal level, this finding is important to me because my twin daughters had an extremely high level of IgG antibodies against casein.  This antibody level was one of the reasons that we tried a restricted diet with them, a diet with which we have had good\u00a0results.\n\nNow imagine what would happen if researchers looked looked for similar antibodies in other children with autism and targeted their dietary interventions at the children who had a biological basis for trying the diet. \u00a0Instead of a study that excluded children with milk or wheat allergies, we might instead have one that tried eliminating casein when there are antibodies against casein or gluten when there are antibodies against gluten. \u00a0Perhaps that would finally give us a better answer to whether a GFCF diet can help children with autism and who it might help.\n\nWouldn't that be something?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/TBbBfpBgiNI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/LzdQwaKqroQ/s1600/mad_cow_cartoon.jpg", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071146", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18226-autism-and-schizophrenia-could-be-genetic-opposites.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/06/shh-restricted-diet-might-help.html", "title": "\nShh, A Restricted Diet Might Help Psychiatric Diseases\n"},

The\u00a0task force\u00a0immediately ruled out fixing the source of the problem - after all, Americans didn't want to have to change their lifestyles, they just wanted the problem to go away.  So for the next several years the\u00a0task force\u00a0met until they finally hit on what seemed to be a good solution.\n\nSince there was nothing that the\u00a0task force\u00a0could do about the actual problem, they decided instead to try to cool down the Earth instead.  The plan was to spread a substance known as Floating Low Atmospheric Particles, Agent F.L.A.P for short, in the air and hope that it would reflect enough of the sun's heat to allow the Earth to stay cooler.\n\nThe plan was initially tested by releasing Agent F.L.A.P. from the ground in New Jersey.  That failed to cool anything down, so the next attempt was to release the substance from helicopters over Missouri.  When that the plan didn't work, the\u00a0task force\u00a0went to its final option and released Agent F.L.A.P over the entire continental U.S. from the space shuttle.  This last step seemed to finally do the trick - although the result in the northeastern US was the blizzard of 1993.\n\nHaving successfully combated global warming without asking a single American to give up anything, the\u00a0task force\u00a0congratulated itself on a job well done and handled the project off to the Army and NASA to run.\n\nAnd that is where the real trouble began.\n\nThe program was included as a line item in the regular budget for the Army and NASA and everyone forgot about it.  But the program has been still been operating for all of these years, silently dumping an ever increasing amount of Agent F.L.A.P. into the atmosphere.  That is, until earlier this year when brave soul actually read the federal budget, noticed the expense program, and investigated what was going on.\n\nThe investigation lead to an internal review by the Army and NASA and today's statements by General E.N. Vironment. \u00a0According to the general, the program has \"not worked exactly as planned\" over the years as global warming is still a problem and, with the notable exception of the blizzard of 1993, Agent F.L.A.P. \"hasn't done diddly squat\" .\n\nExpect, that is, for possibly causing autism.  It seems that Agent F.L.A.P consists of 20% mercury and, in a health study conducted earlier this year by the CDC, all children exposed to the substance developed autism within a year.  The CDC called this finding \"not significant\", pointing out that the children's autism could have been caused by something else - like space aliens.  \n\n(In the statement issued earlier today, NASA denied that space aliens exist and pointed out that none have visited lately. \u00a0The Army added that the aliens were scared away by Agent F.L.A.P since they didn't want to develop autism).\n\nHowever, as General E.N. Vironment said earlier today, spreading Agent F.L.A.P. over the US \"might not have been the best idea\" and that there \"might be some small relation\" between this substance and autism.  The government is now launching a study, lead by Dr. Brad Iased, to take a closer look at the question.  The results of this study are expected to be released in 2150, or whenever hell freezes over, which ever comes first.\n\nStay tuned for more information.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/04/us-govt-admits-to-causing-autism.html", "title": "\nThe US Govt Admits to Causing the Autism Epidemic\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, January 30, 2010", "body": "\nRecently, Michelle Dawson wrote a post called 1 in 86:\u00a0the prevalence of autism among adults\u00a0where she asserted, among other things, that the prevalence of autism in adults is 1 in 86. \u00a0Ms Dawson is basing this estimate on a study published in 2006 -\nAll 56,946 individuals comprising the targeted population cohort in this study are, as of today, the last day in the decade, 18 years of age or older. They were born between July 1, 1990 and Dec 31, 1991 and they are now all adults.\u00a0Within this cohort, Baird et al. (2006) reported an autistic spectrum prevalence of ~116/10,000. That's 1 in 86, and all these autistics, originally assessed as such when 9 to 14yrs old, are now adults.Well, she is correct about at least one thing - all of these children in the study were born between 1990 and 1991 and would be now all be 18 or 19 years old. However, I am not at all sure that even if autism is at a certain rate in a specific population 18 year olds that the same rate would apply to adults of all other ages. \u00a0The available data points to an increasing rate of autism and that the rate is increasing with each passing year.\n\nBut even ignoring that point for a minute, what exactly was found in the study that she is referring to? \u00a0Given the fact that the study population was 56,946, did the researchers find 662 children with a diagnosis of autism? \n\nThe short answer is no, they didn't. \n\nWhat they found was 158 children who would fit the broadest possible definition of autism. \u00a0Using what would be a normal definition of autism used in studies, they only found 81 children. \n\nSo how did they get from from the 158 they identified to claiming that there were over four times that number and what exactly is the difference in the between the two groups? \u00a0The answer is complicated and has to do with the differences between actually counting the number of cases and using statistical techniques to estimate a number. \u00a0The difference also has to do with what you call autism - are you talking about what could clinical be diagnosed as autism or something who has some symptoms of autism.\n\nLets start with the basics, this study looked at 56,946 children born in South Thames, UK between July 1, 1990 and December 31, 1991. \u00a0When the study started, there were 255 children who had a diagnosis of autism. \u00a0If you look at what the historical rate of autism was thought to be when these children were 9 years old, it was about 1 in 250 (40 per 10,000). \u00a0The children in this group had slightly higher rate but were generally in line with the 1 in 250 number (45 per 10,000).\n\nFrom there the study identified all of the children who has a special education label (or the equivalent in the UK) or had an existing diagnosis of autism. \u00a0This narrowed the population to 1,770 children. \u00a0The authors assumed that all of the children with autism would be in this sub group. \u00a0I think this is a safe assumption - any 9 year old who had any diagnosable form of autism would likely need at least some extra help at school.\n\nI am going to stop here for a basic sanity check. \u00a0The study is asserting that there are about 662 children with autism in this population. \u00a0If you do the math you will see that they are saying that over 35% of the special ed population has autism. \u00a0Compare that to the number of existing cases (255) in the population and you will see that the rate of existing cases is about 15%. \u00a0If you consider the fact that the comparable percentage in the US for all children served under IDEA around the same time frame was about 17% you can see that the 35% is about double what would be expected. \u00a0Although to be fair, I am comparing two different countries so the comparison isn't strictly apple to apple.\n\nMoving along, the study then used the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) to help group the children. \u00a0The SCQ is a screening test that is designed to identify children with autism. \u00a0The idea is that if a child has a score above a certain level the should be further evaluated for a form of autism. \u00a0Out of the initial 1,770 there were 1,035 who returned the SCQ and consented to further evaluation.\n\nOut of this set of 1,035, a \"two-way stratified random\" sample of 363 children were selected for further evaluation. \u00a0In this group of 363 there were 141 children who already had a diagnosis of autism - a little over half of the known cases. \n\nOf the 363 only 255 were actually evaluated due to a variety of factors. \u00a0In this population of 255 there were 112 children who had an existing diagnosis of autism, which amounts to about 44% of the known population. \u00a0For each of these 255 children an ADOS and ADI-R was performed as well as assessments of IQ, language, and adaptive behaviors. \u00a0Information was collected (via the telephone interviews) from the children's teachers about their social, communicative, and other behaviors. \u00a0The children's health records were also collected.\n\nBefore I go into the specific numbers found, I wanted to talk about the \"two-way stratified random\" sample of 363 children. The groups (stratification) used a prior autism diagnosis and SCQ score range as the defining criteria for the groups and here lies one of the potential problems. \n\nRemember how I said that the SCQ was a screening tool? \u00a0That means above a certain score you have a certain likelihood that the test will accurately identify children with autism and will not identify children who don't have autism. \u00a0All of this means that above the cut-off score the SCQ will agree with another, presumable more accurate, test, such as \u00a0the ADOS, a certain percentage of the time but below that score we really have no idea how what it says.\n\nSo the validity of the screening test is always relative to another, more accurate, test - usually the ADOS or ADI-R. \u00a0So the validity of the test isn't really relative to having autism but rather the chance of\u00a0achieving\u00a0a score on another test. \u00a0As a result, if you don't use the other test, or worse ignore it, then you have no real idea whats the score on the test means. \u00a0These may seem like an academic points but, as you will see below, they lead to potential problem.\n\nTo give an example, assume that we have a group of 100 children, 20 of whom score an 10 on the SCQ which is under the normal cutoff \u00a0We further test 5 of these children using the ADOS and find that 2 of them have autism. \u00a0Can we then say that 8 ( 2/ 5 * 20) children out of the 20 should have a score on the ADOS that puts them into the realm of autism? \u00a0No, we cannot because the relation of this SCQ score to the ADOS score has not been established. \u00a0If we were talking about a score above the cutoff then we would be able to make the relation.\n\nFurthermore, if we gave the same group of children the ADOS but the, instead of giving 2 of them a label of autism, we decided to say that 4 of them did - even though that extra two did not score high enough on the ADOS to indicate autism - can we then say that 16 of the children have autism based on the SCQ scores? \u00a0Again the answer is no.\n\nGoing back to the 363 children, the stratification groups where based on prior autism diagnosis (yes, no) and range of score on the SCQ ( under 8, 8-14, 15-21, over 21 ) which gives us a total of 8 groups. \u00a0The normal cutoff of the SCQ is about 15, so I am not sure what is says when you have a score in the under 8 or 8-14 groups and you certainly can't (accurately) relate that back to other children who scored in those ranges.\n\u00a0\nNow lets consider the number of children that the study identified as having autism. \u00a0Three of the researchers involved in the study looked at all of the available information and arrived at what diagnosis, if any, that the children should have. \u00a0 I think it is important to note that the researchers did not interview the children themselves but rather relied on the data that was collected by others.\n\nLets first take a step back,\u00a0how do you know if a child has a form of autism? \n\nTypically what is done in research is to rely on one of the \"gold standard\" tests - the ADOS or ADI-R. \u00a0Some of the time you will see that the children met DSM-IV criteria and usually that means that one of the researchers evaluated the child themselves and determined that the met the criteria for a form of autism. \u00a0The important part here is that either a\u00a0standardized\u00a0test is used OR a\u00a0knowledgeable person examines the child and their history and comes to a conclusion.\u00a0\n\nIn this study, the DSM IV criteria were not used but rather a related set of criteria called the ICD-10 were used. \u00a0These criteria are similar to the DSM IV but label things differently.\n\nGoing back to the diagnosis in the subgroups, the researchers identified 53 children who met a strict (narrow) definition of autism. \u00a0This strict definition was that the ADOS and ADI-R both indicated that the child had autism. \u00a0These would be the most severe children, the ones who should be readily identifiable. \u00a0In this group 34 already had a diagnosis of autism and 19 did not.\n\nThe next group were a \"consensus\" group were all the three researchers agreed that it was likely that the children had autism. \u00a0This group had a total of 81 children, which included the 53 children from the strict group. \u00a0In this group there were 50 children who already had a diagnosis of autism. \u00a0For this consensus group it was not required that both of the\u00a0standardized\u00a0tests indicated autism and indeed, the ADOS indicated autism in only 64% of these children with a further 25% meeting the cutoff for a sub-threshold form of autism (think PDD-NOS). \u00a0The ADI-R showed better agreement with the group.\n\nIn the consensus group there were 7 who had no delay in language and no evidence of abnormal development before the age of 3. \u00a0I am not sure why these 7 would be labeled as having autism instead of a sub-threshold condition (see below). \u00a0The ICD-10 and the DSM IV both say that for a diagnosis of \"autism\" the symptoms must be present before the age of 3. \u00a0Under the DSM IV, these cases would likely be labeled as PDD-NOS and not autism. \u00a0I normally wouldn't think much of this, but this set makes up almost 10% of this set. \u00a0The researchers suggest that these 7 might have Asperger's but still label them as autism.\n\nThe consensus group (probably minus those 7) are likely to be what you would see included in other studies as the \"autism\" group since that is the group that the ADOS would have labeled as having autism. \u00a0This is also the group that the SCQ would have selected if the normal cutoff had been used.\n\nThe last group was the \"other asd\" group and was made up of 77 children, 18 of which had a prior diagnosis. \u00a0Six were in this group because of late onset (although how this 6 differ from the 7 above I don't know), 61 met the ICD-10 criteria for atypical autism (PDD-NOS on the DSM IV) because the severity wasn't there, 7 had an incomplete history (lack of early medical records), and 3 met criteria for other ICD-10 disorders. \u00a0I don't know why these last three were included in the \"other ASD\" group because, according to the data provided, they did't have autism.\n\nThat brings the total number of children with any possible (however questionable) diagnosable form of autism to 158, of which less than half (68) had an existing diagnosis. \u00a0Or to state that another way, 44 of the children who initially had a label of autism had the label revoked and 90 were added.\n\nNow here comes the funny part. \u00a0From these numbers the researchers estimated the prevalence of autism in the entire population and came up with the following (all per 10,000) : 24.8 have \"strict\" autism, 38.9 have \"consensus\" autism, and 77.2 have some other form for a grand total of \u00a0116.1 for all forms of autism.\n\nSo, how did the researchers get from the 158 number to a figure that was over four times that amount (662)? \u00a0Simple, they used their groupings and, after making some adjustments, extrapolated back to the original population of special education children. \u00a0They then assumed that all of the autism cases were in that subset and arrived at what they thought were the totals for the whole population.\n\nUnfortunately, the study does not detail the exact methods that they used to do this extrapolation nor does it give the breakdown of how many of each of the asd groups (narrow, consensus, other asd) fall into each stratification groups and without those figures it is difficult to duplicate their exact numbers. \u00a0If you remember, half of the stratification groups would not have a good path back to the population since it really isn't know how a score of below the cutoff would be related to a diagnosis of autism and we can't assume that there is no relation. \u00a0Furthermore, I don't know what an SCQ score would mean once you have ignored the ADOS or ADI-R score - which was done for a number of the children. \n\nBut here is the rub - no matter how they extrapolated from this subset of 255 back to the entire population, it is at best only a guess. \u00a0The underlying principle of doing this sort of analysis is that you have a known (and verified) path from your subset back to the original population. \u00a0You can't pick an subset using some non-arbitrary method and then expect to accurately relate it back to the whole. \n\nTo give you an example, assume I have a set of 100 men and women. \u00a0I select all of the people who have dark hair and find I have 10 men and 15 women. \u00a0Can I then say that, based on hair color, there are 40 (10 / (10+15) * 100) \u00a0men in the initial set of 100? \u00a0The answer is no - you would have to know what percentage of men had dark hair to start out with.\n\u00a0\nIf the researchers they had selected a completely random set of individuals from the initial population of 1,035, they would have then been able to relate it back to the whole as a simple percent because there would have been no relation between having autism and being in the selected group. \u00a0Or if they had used the SCQ as a screening test (as it was designed) and then tested all of those who scored over the cut off they would have found all of the \"likely\" cases of autism - remember, counting actual cases is much more accurate than estimating.\n\nAs a result, we have to treat their extrapolation from the subset back to the original population as questionable. \u00a0When you have a questionable result, you look to other sources to see if other studies have arrived at the similar results. \u00a0Well, if you look at other research done on the same age group / birth year, you will see that the prevalence numbers from this study are significantly higher than those from other studies - somewhere from about 1.5 to 4 times higher than other estimates.\n\nIf you further consider other research that was done in a subset of the population by the same researchers, you will see that they estimated, just 2 (age) years before, that the prevalence of all cases of autism in this was half (57.9 per 10,000) of what they are suggesting now.\n\nRemember the percentages of special ed statistics I listed above? \u00a0They also suggest that the proposed numbers are twice what they should be.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the goals of the researchers was to find cases of autism that had been missed by other sources and that goal was accomplished. \u00a0They identified 90 new cases that had been missed and, at the same time, they rejected the diagnosis of 46 children. \u00a0If you put those two numbers together, you are left with a number of cases that is 40% higher than the previously number. \u00a0If you extrapolated that back to the original 255 cases of autism, you would expect there to be a total of 360 cases of autism. \u00a0While that number is higher it certainly is much less than the proposed 662.\n\nAs a result, when you consider all of the above reasons, it is unlikely that the prevalence of autism in this population is \u00a0in 86.\n\nSo is Michelle Dawson's 1 in 86 adults overall accurate? \u00a0I don't think so.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/12/1-in-86-prevalence-of-autism-among.html", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16844490", "http://portal.wpspublish.com/portal/page?_pageid=53,70432&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/01/debunking-michelle-dawsons-1-in-86.html", "title": "\nDebunking Michelle Dawson's 1 in 86 adults with autism\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 8, 2010", "body": "\n\nvia Photobucket by chrissssy_xoLeft Brain Right Brain's habit of publishing content with questionable accuracy has come back to bite them again. \u00a0The problem this time was caused by one \"Evil Possum\" aka David N. Brown, when he accused Age of Autism of staging a hoax.\n\nThe incident started when Age of Autism ran a series of stories about a Danish researcher, Dr. Poul Thorsen, who allegedly absconded with a few million dollars from Aarhus University. \u00a0Dr. Thorsen also happened to be one of the authors of a study that \"disproves\" the notion that thimerosal and autism are linked. \u00a0As the study itself is badly flawed - even without this problem with an author so I didn't think much of the story at the time.\n\nBut, it seems the good folk at Left Brain Right Brain decided that Age of Autism was being less than truthful about the incident and ran a story with the heading \"Another Hoax from Age of Autism\". \u00a0In this story, the person calling themselves Evil Possum all but flat out accuses AoA of forging documents in an effort to create a story were there is none. \u00a0The original story is no longer available on the site nor is it available in Google's cache, so you will just have to take my word for it.\n\nOne of the authors from AoA took slight offense at the story and threatened legal action if the accusations of a hoax were not removed from the LBRB site. \u00a0LBRB caved to the demand, changed the title and wording of the story slightly, and posted an terse apology.\n\nIf that was the end of the story, there wouldn't be much to write about, just the standard nonsense from LBRB. \u00a0However, a few days later the misbehaving possum popped up again with another story, this time citing \"fresh evidence\" that the about how the facts from AoA were flat out wrong. This \"evidence\" included an analogy involving a spam email, a traveling friend, and a mugging, I kid you not. \u00a0This second post was quickly debunked, this time by friendly fire from LBRB's own resident groupies. \u00a0If the story was bad enough that the even the regulars were complaining, then it had to be really bad.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago when AoA ran a story about the incident. \u00a0This time they went on the offensive, calling out Kev personally (the owner of the LBRB site) for allowing the stories to be published on LBRB in the first place.\n\nLBRB, of course, responded with a Bush-esque \"mistakes were made\" sort of statement that partially admitted that there just might have been a problem while at the same time repeating the original allegations that the whole thing might have been a hoax. \u00a0And then of course, the post goes right back to denial land and says that \"Age of Autism regularly lies about those it sees as opponents\", thus proving that they have the authors have the collective mentality of a two year old (they did it first!).\n\nBut wait, it gets even better. \u00a0Apparently, the \"Evil Possum\" is unwilling to roll over and play dead, even when his arguments are completely debunked, and is now circulating an e-mail that accuses AoA of libel against him and threatening to sue. \u00a0Another blogger has posted the text of the e-mail with his comments here. \u00a0If you read nothing else from this entire exchange, I suggest you read this e-mail, it is priceless. \n\nI can't even begin to understand the thought process behind the idea that you have a right sue to when someone calls you on your own false statements. \u00a0It hurts my head just to think about it.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//2.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S71htpjUJ0I/AAAAAAAAAOA/yWCH45NlhT4/s1600/possum.jpg", "http://media.photobucket.com/image/recent/chrissssy_xo", "http://evilpossum.weebly.com/", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/danish-scientist-absconds-with-2-million-poul-thorsen-proved-vaccines-dont-cause-autism-.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/first-fraud-dr-poul-thorsen-and-the-original-danish-study.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/copenhagen-police-investigating-autism-vaccine-researcher-dr-poul-thorsen-for-fraud.html", "http://www.fourteenstudies.org/pdf/HG_2.pdf", "http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gEZX1_wKgSwJ:leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/03/update-dr-poul-thorsen-not-missing-not-suspected-in-theft/%3Futm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed%253A%2BLeftBrain%252FrightBrain%2B(Left%2BBrain%252FRight%2BBrain)+http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/03/update-dr-poul-thorsen-not-missing-not-suspected-in-theft&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/04/kevin-leitchs-leftbrainrightbrain-sees-conspiracies-left-and-right.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/04/a-clarification/", "http://my-socrates-note.blogspot.com/2010/04/humorous-threat-from-fiendish-rodent.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/04/misbehaving-possum-bites-left-brain.html", "title": "\nMisbehaving Possum Bites Left Brain Right Brain\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 2, 2009", "body": "\nI just wanted to quickly highlight one of major the problem with the so-called \"Neurodiversity\" movement.  For those who haven't seen this term there is a passable if skewed definition on Wikipedia - Neurodiversity is an idea which asserts that atypical (neurodivergent) neurological development is a normal human difference that is to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. or basically respect and acceptance for people on the autism spectrum.  Sounds good, right?  I wish it were that good it reality.  What starts out as acceptance leads to all sort of strange notions about how your shouldn't attempt to \"cure\" or change people with autism, you should rather focus on changing society to accept them.  While I could go into much more detail about this movement I wanted to highlight a specific example of why I believe that this concept is very harmful to people with autism.  The case in point will be a post on a blog called The Autism Crisis that is written by a women with autism named Michelle Dawson.  Ms Dawson is an active advocate in the field of autism and is a large supported of the neurodiversity movement. Ms Dawson believes that ABA therapy for child with autism is not a good thing and does not work.  In her most recent post on the subject she goes back to the very early days of research into ABA from 1949 and gives yet another slanted view of what modern ABA is about.  Well, actually, she isn't really talking about what ABA is like now any more than talking about using leeches is talking about the cutting edge of neurosurgery.  She is entitled to her opinion.  However, and this goes to the heart of what is so wrong about this movement, if you look at the comments on the above linked post, you come across this gem :I have been reading some of your very well-written work and am grateful to you for providing this perspective. I believe that my 28 month old son, who does not use words, is on the autism spectrum. While I wish to help him communicate effectively in whatever way suits him, my immediate response upon learning the basics of ABA/VB was repulsion and dread. Due to the overwhelming push in favour of ABA, however, I had begun to become resigned to it....I have no interest whatsoever in changing [him], all I want is to be able to communicate with him. Thank you again for this under-represented and important perspective.Ms Dawson responded in a subsequent comment :...In my view, everyone changes through development and learning and so on, but I'm concerned when it's assumed that autistic traits and abilities, the way we develop and learn, and so on, are simply wrong. I'm also concerned about the poor quality of research in the area of ABA-based autism interventions.(This is only a snippet of the full comment, I would suggest reading the entire original post and comment to get the full context.)There are a few interesting things in his little exchange.  Notice the mother saying she \"has no interest whatsoever in changing him\" and Ms Dawson's \"assumed that autistic traits and abilities ... are simply wrong\".  These are core ideas in the neurodiversity movement and quite wrong headed.  But I digress.The real problem I see with this exchange is the impression that readers of Ms Dawson's blog are left with about ABA.  ABA might not be for everyone and it certainly isn't a cure all but it is a widely accepted therapy to help young children with autism.  The science is in on this treatment and it can help.So, what we have here is a parent who is worried that their child has autism and what Ms Dawson has done is to convince her ABA is a bad thing before she even tries it or gets a true professional opinion about whether or not it would help her son. Ms Dawson has never met this person, never met the child in question and yet she has quite possibly changed the course of his life by convincing his mother to not pursue a therapy that could give him the skills he needs to live in the world.  I have no way of knowing whether any of this will actually happen or not.  It is possible that his mother will decide to give ABA a try after all and it won't help.

It finds that the mean that the zinc / copper ratio of the group is lower than it should be and suggests that this could be an indicator of \" heavy metal, particularly mercury, toxicity in children with ASDs\".I find this study interesting because my twins both show abnormally low levels of zinc and abnormally high levels of copper.  When we started down the path of treating autism a little over two years ago we had numerous blood tests done on both to look for a variety of factors.  We looked for fragile-x and other known genetic abnormalities, we looked at immune system function, and we looked at levels of nutrients.The results were interesting to say the least.  On the nutrient side one of the things that came up was that both girls had zinc levels that were half of the bottom lower limit of the scale and that both were at the top of the scale for copper.  What that means is that their zinc copper ratio was something like 0.3 which is half of the 0.6 level that is reported in the study.  Or in other words, their zinc / copper was badly out of wack.Since that time we have, under a doctors supervision, been supplementing both girls with zinc in at attempt to bring their zinc / copper levels back up to normal.  So far it is getting closer - their zinc levels have doubled so that they are now at the bottom of the scale and their copper levels have fallen.  But their ratio is still out of whack.  \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19280374?dopt=Abstract"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/03/study-watch-low-zinc-copper-ratio.html", "title": "\nStudy watch : Low Zinc / Copper Ratio\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 22, 2010", "body": "\nAs I talked about last time, another study on thimerosal was released last week. \u00a0Like some of the studies before it, this one found that not only was thimerosal not involved in causing autism but also that a higher exposure actually lowered the the odds of having autism. \u00a0Or in other words, being injected with a higher level of mercury actually greatly decreased your chances of having autism.\n\nIf that result seems a bit strange to you, you are not alone. \u00a0I don't think that many people would claim that this is actually a valid finding (although there are some) and the researchers acknowledged as much when they said that they \"are not aware of a biological mechanism that would lead to this result.\" \u00a0Although, to be slightly glib, it would be one of the great ironies in recent history if thimerosal actually did actually protect against autism.\n\nBut still, the result reached statistical significance which means that it is unlikely to have happened by chance, and this isn't some fly by night paper were the statistics were in doubt. \u00a0The data in this paper was the result of a seven year effort and the published paper and supplemental material reaches almost 400 pages.\n\nI think the answer to the puzzle is pretty obvious here and I am going to use another significant finding from the study to illustrate the point. \u00a0Buried on page 164 of Volume I of the supplemental material is the following statement -\n\n\"Use of prenatal vitamins containing folic acid was associated with a higher odds ratio of ASD\"\n\nThis is also a statistically significant relationship. \u00a0If you look on page 169 of the volume, you will see that, if the mother took prenatal vitamins while pregnant, her children were more than twice as likely to have autism. \u00a0This result is based on the data that 96% of the mothers of children who have autism took folic acid while only 91% of the mothers of \"typical\" children did. \u00a0When you put these numbers into the models with the rest of the data - the same models used to determine the main no relationship result - out pops this strange relationship.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, folic acid is essential to many bodily functions, is used to help synthesize and repair DNA, and helps determine which parts of the generic material is active. \u00a0Pregnant women have been taking folic acid during pregnancy since at least 1993 because it can mostly prevent neural tube defects\u00a0such as spina bifida. \n\nHere we have yet another improbable result from this study. \u00a0So, what could be going on?\n\nWhen you consider the facts that folic acid plays a role in maintaining and repairing genetic code and that autism seems to littered with many rare genetic mutations, it\u00a0might be possible that taking too much folic acid during pregnancy could increase the chances of a child having autism. \u00a0However, even though the timing (1993 onwards) might agree with rising autism rates and there might be some kind-of plausible mechanism for the relationship, I don't think that this is likely.\n\nWhich leads to another possibility. \u00a0I am sure that most of you have heard the oft-repeated phrase about how correlation does not imply causation - this would be a classic example of it. \u00a0It is possible that folic acid use is highly related to another factor and it is this other factor that is causing autism. \u00a0If I had to guess, folic acid use during pregnancy could be be correlated with affluence. \u00a0Meaning that mothers who are more well-off are more likely to wait until later in life to have children and are more likely to do the \"right\" things during pregnancy - such as take folic acid. \u00a0But it is equally likely that this relationship could be flipped and affluence, which has been linked elsewhere to a higher risk of autism, is the dependant factor and it folic acid use that is the causative factor. \u00a0That is the problem with these sorts of relatinships, you are never quite sure what is a cause and what is simply along for the ride.\n\nAnother explanation would be that the association would happen by simple dumb luck. \u00a0Even with all of the robust methodologies and fancy statistics that researchers use, it is still possible for a significant result to appear that is due to simple random chance. \u00a0This is why it is very important that all scientific findings be replicated by other researchers using a different set of data. \u00a0The fact that thimerosal is actually protective has been suggested by other studies but I am not aware of any others finding a relationship with folic acid use.\n\nRegardless, I\u00a0think the most likely explanation for what is going on is the simplest - there is a problem with the study's data. \u00a0I would have to say that a problem with the underlying data is one of the most overlooked and under-considered problems out there. \u00a0If the data that the analysis and conclusions of the study are based on is biased or does not properly represent what you trying to study, everything that the data is based on is flawed.\n\nSince this study found that a higher exposure to thimerosal decreases the chance of autism and that taking folic acid during pregnancy raises the chance of autism, I think it is safe to say that something is not\u00a0quite right with the data in this study.\n\nAs the saying goes -

{"date": "Wednesday, January 21, 2009", "body": "\nLet me just saw from the beginning here that I have historically found the autism blog at about.com to be worth reading.  However, as of late, Lisa Jo Rudy seems to going down, how shall we say it, a depressing path that seems to be leading up to giving up, or \"acceptance\" as some groups would call it.  Consider this recent string of posts:Do we expect too much from our autistic kids?Amazingly, I saw no concern on the part of their parents that these kids were not making eye contact. No one seemed to care that they were not conversing. There was no expectation that they'd make their own beds or meals - or even speak on their own behalf to a clerk or waitress.Yet children in autism support classes are expected, from a very young age, to make eye contact and learn to converse with their elders in a polite and civil manner. An autistic child caught playing on his own with a Gameboy is immediately pulled away from the activity and engaged in a social interaction. Children with autism are expected and taught to make eye contact, manage daily self-help activities, and generally participate in the adult world in a manner rarely dreamed of by typical children....Bottom line - do we expect too much from our children with autism? My sense is - in many cases - the answer is a resounding \"yes!\"So we are to believe that we are pushing our children too hard to learn the skills that they lack.  That \"normal\" children don't do the behaviors that we push our children with autism to do. The problem is here is that these skills that are mentioned such as eye contact, self help skills and participating in an adult world - these are skills that \"normal\" children will pick up on their own with just a little coaching.  Many children with autism simply won't learn these skills without help.Is independent living over-rated?I'm also finding myself increasing frustrated by the realization that the expectations placed on adults with autism (and, in fact, all adults) are, to a very large degree, the invention of the past 60 years of cultural evolution....In short, when it comes to adults with autism (or to families in general, really) - is independent living over-rated?This one leaves me flabbergasted.  Being able to live on your own is the invention of the past 60 years and it is over-rated to hope that your children will be to take care of themselves?  What happens when you are no longer around or are unable to take care of your children?Is it really possible to teach \"social skills?\"As parents of children with autism (or awkwardness, shyness, a preference for solitude, or a desire for uniqueness), how much can - or should - we press our children to learn skills that are, by their very nature, almost unteachable? If we press our children to participate in complex, subtle relationships when they're neither ready nor willing - are we doing them a favor?Once we've taught the social life skills and the basic social graces of etiquette - have we done enough?And we should only try to teach the basic social skills and not try for the harder skills?  If your child were \"normal\" would you stop trying?So, to summarize, we are expecting too much for our children for them to try and help them learn basic interpersonal skills, we shouldn't expect them to be able to live on their own, and if we somehow manage to teach them to the basics of social skills, you ask yourself \"have we done enough\".I think the answer is very simple.  Autism is very profound disorder which by its very nature puts your children at a huge disadvantage relative to other children.  Your job as a parent to teach them and help them as much as possible so they can become the best person they can be regardless of the issues like autism that they have to deal with.   You teach them so that when they are in a restaurant and a waitress hands them a plate, they know to take the plate.  Your \"normal\" child might not take the plate but at least they understand that is what is requested of them. You teach them so that when they are older they will have a chance to be able to support themselves, live indepenantly, and take care of themselves.  Most \"normal\" children will be able to do this.You teach them so that they will have a chance to form meaningful relationships with other people and have a chance to get married and have a family of their own someday - assuming that is what they want to do.  \"Normal\" kids do it all of the time.You do not stop trying to help your children.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.about.com/b/a/258376.htm", "http://autism.about.com/b/a/258382.htm", "http://autism.about.com/b/a/258385.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/01/when-you-expect-very-least.html", "title": "\nWhen you expect the very least\n"},

Lisa Jo Rudy, the blog author, starts out by expressing her doubts about the study and quotes the press release.  OK, fair enough. Questioning the new MIND study on prevalence of autismThe second post is published the next day on Saturday.  Lisa is noting an article in Scientific American about the new study.  She includes some of the text from the article and expresses her doubts about it again.What does the MIND study on autism prevelance really say?The third post is published on the Sunday.  In this post Lisa is comparing the press release and the abstract for the study and, surprise, expressing her doubts about the study again.   She goes on to compare and contrast the abstract of the study with the press release for the study and points out the inconsistencies between the two. Here is a thought.  If you are going to be reviewing a study and are going to be writing multiple blog posts on the subject, wouldn't it be worth the time and effort to actually read the study that you are writing about?When you consider the title of the third post we are getting into ironic territory. Notes from MIND researcher Dr. Irva Hertz-PicciottoFor the final post on this topic which comes on Tuesday, five days after she has started writing about the study.  To give Lisa credit she has finally done some more research on the study and talked to one of the authors of the study about what it says instead of reading press releases, news stories, and abstracts.However, it does not appear that she has actually read the study yet.

The authors discuss some of the research that others have done and discuss their own results with two sets of twins.I am sure that I will get some of the terminology wrong and am missing some of the nuances that are in the original text, but... Basically one of the two sets of identical twins differed in the degree of severity of autism and when they looked at the genetics of the twins they found very small differences.  The twin that exhibited more genetic variance was the more severe of the two.  The authors also note other studies that also show some differences in twin pairs.The questions I have, and maybe I am missing obvious, but given the fact that identical twins are basically identical - especially at very young ages when autism is thought to develop - what causes the genetic differences between the twins?  And how is it possible for the twins to have different levels of severity if autism is genetically determined?Anyone know?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121585347/abstract", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_(publishing)"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/02/study-watch-nuclear-and-mitochondrial.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genome Defects in Autisms\n"},

The open access study was published on Feb 16 on PLoS One and was entitled:Relation of DNA Methylation of 5\u2032-CpG Island of ACSL3 to Transplacental Exposure to Airborne Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Childhood AsthmaThat's a mouthful.  I think I prefer the title from a Science Daily summary of the study:Pollution-related Asthma May Start In The WombI am not as familiar with the terminology and current asthma research so I am sure that I am going to be getting some of the details wrong, but here goes.. This study seems to be talking about the impact that an environmental pollutant can have on unborn children.  Specifically the authors link polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to epigenetic changes in fetuses that are thought to impact some of the genetic pathways that are involved in asthma.From Wikipedia:The term epigenetics refers to heritable changes in phenotype (appearance) or gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence (hence the name epi - \"in addition to\" - genetics). These changes may remain through cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life and may also last for multiple generations. However, there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism;[1] instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or \"express themselves\") differentlyIn crude terms you can think of epigenetics as a dimmer light switch that can turn genes on and off.So, at the risk of oversimplifying the study it seems to be saying that an environmental factor causes epigenetic changes which can then lead to changes in gene expression which leads to asthma.I promised a point, so here it is.  If you remember I was recently talking about a study that demonstrated that identical twins could have genetic-like differences that were thought to account for the differences in the severity of their autism?  My question at the time was how these differences could happen since identical twins are, well, identical.  Based on the results from this study on asthma it seems possible that it could be the environment that is causing the changes.  Now why and how this could impact one twin but not the other is still a mystery to me especially considering the fact that most identical twins share resources in the womb.  But as illustrated here the environmental factors that the mother is exposed to while pregnant can result in changes in her children.Let me put this in simple terms:Environmental pollutant + epigenetics changes might = autismAnyone out there want to point out why I am wrong here?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004488", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090214082110.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/02/study-watch-asthma-and-epigenetics.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : Asthma and Epigenetics\n"},

Researchers examined the current recommendations of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology on 22 different cardiovascular topics. They graded the strength of the evidence supporting these recommendations from A to C, with A being the best evidence, and C being very little or weak evidence. Only 12% of the recommendations were in the A category. A staggering 45% earned a C.So even when treating cardiovascular problems evidenced based is only the goal not the rule. \u00a0So what does that mean when it comes to listening to your doctor?So should you ignore the majority of what your doctor says for lack of strong evidence? Not necessarily. Most doctors are simply working with the best information they have, even if the data supporting it is weak.Sounds reasonable to me. \u00a0In the absence of strong evidence proving that treatments work you go with the best information that you have. \u00a0I imagine that it helps if the person interpreting the information has a background in the area.So what does this mean when it comes to autism treatments? \u00a0The evidence is lacking for almost every treatment out there.\u00a0The only treatment that I am aware of that has any sort strong evidence behind it is ABA. \u00a0So what about all of the other alternative treatments?If you look organizations that attempt to track what treatments are used you will find a wide variety of thing that people will try, everything from vitamins to diet to therapies to drugs. \u00a0So not only is evidence lacking, there is no lack of options. \u00a0So what do to.\u00a0I think the answer is simple. \u00a0You go with the best information that you have. \u00a0You start with the treatments with the most evidence and branch out from there. \u00a0You keep in mind that not every treatment will help every child and keep going.\u00a0\u00a0If there is something that you want to try but there is no evidence at all that supports it then stay away from it until there is some level of evidence. \u00a0If you can find a medical professional who specializes in the field who you can work with so much the better.Treating autism is not a science as of yet, it is still of an art.\u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "http://brainblogger.com/2009/03/13/how-strong-is-your-evidence/", "http://www.iancommunity.org/cs/therapies_treatments/", "http://www.autism.com/treatable/form34qr.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/03/treating-autism-is-not-science.html", "title": "\nTreating autism is not a science\n"},

Children who were enrolled in an efficacy trial of pertussis vaccines in 1992\u20131993 were contacted in 2003. Two groups of children were identified, according to thimerosal content in vaccines assigned randomly in the first year of life (cumulative ethylmercury intake of 62.5 or 137.5 \u00b5g)From reading that excerpt you should understand that there were two groups that differed in their level of exposure to thimerosal.  Now, keep that in mind while I digress for a moment.  Apparently Dr. Lewis R. First, the new editor of Pediatrics, is writing a blog to summarize the current issue of the journal.  This is a good thing since increasing distribution of scientific research makes us all more educated.If we look at his summary of the February issue you will see what he wrote about the above article :Finally, we get to the heart of the immunization controversy with a study by Tozzi et al. on whether or not thimerosal can influence neuropsychological performance ten years after immunization in infancy (475-482).

If you look at the abstract it is very clear what the groups are, so what gives?  I first saw the discrepancy noted in an entry on the Age of Autism blog by David Kirby.  Go read the full post, it is interesting exchange.  The day after the post on Age of Autism, Dr. First posted a correction to his blog clarifying his position, for which I have to commend him.  From the series on e-mail of Age of Autism it did not initially look like he was going to.The question is what to make of all of this.  I would have thought that the editor of Pediatrics would have been more familiar with the contents of an article, especially if he was writing a summary of it.  So what I am left with is either that it was an honest mistake or, more likely, he took the someone else's spin on the study and ran with it.  Now, you may ask why any of this matters.Consider if you are the normal pediatrician who is very busy doing their job.  If you did not have a particular interest in this topic you would pick up the news reports that yet another study shows no link between thimerosal and autism.  You might pick up the short summary from the editor of the journal who you would assume would know of what they are writing.  Chances are you would not read the study itself let alone the abstract.  So you would be left with the impression that this study showed something that it did not.  If you are a normal parent the situation is worse.  At best you will see the headline and maybe, if you really care about the issue, you may read some other blog posts giving the white washed version of the study.  You will never read the abstract of the study let alone the study itself.So, does this really matter in the end?  Does this sort of misinformation do any harm?  I think it does.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/123/2/475", "http://pediatricsblog.blogspot.com/", "http://pediatricsblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-months-issue-of-pediatrics.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/01/il-mercurio-and-the-aap.html", "http://pediatricsblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/addendum-to-februarys-first-read.html", "//www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jp7ZD1RFVm7yOzgaB04Ra4dY_ZuQD95UKPPG0", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1807"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/01/so-whats-harm.html", "title": "\nSo what's the harm?\n"},

{"date": "Friday, January 16, 2009", "body": "\nA few studies came out at once.  I have yet to read any of the actual studies but they look interesting:Serum anti-nuclear antibodies as a marker of autoimmunity in egyptian autistic children.Autism may involve an autoimmune pathogenesis in a subgroup of patients. The frequency of anti-nuclear antibodies in 80 autistic children and their relationship to a family history of autoimmunity were studied, compared with 80 healthy, matched children. Children with autism had a significantly higher percent seropositivity of anti-nuclear antibodies (20%) than healthy children (2.5%; P < 0.01). Fifty percent of anti-nuclear antibody-seropositive autistic children had an anti-nuclear antibody titer of >/=1:640 (very high positive); 25%, >/=1:160 (high positive); and the remaining 25%, 1:80. All anti-nuclear antibody-seropositive healthy children had anti-nuclear antibody titers of 1:80. A family history of autoimmunity was significantly higher in autistic children (47.5%) than healthy controls (8.8%; P < 0.001). Anti-nuclear antibody seropositivity was significantly higher in autistic children with a family history of autoimmunity than those without such history (36.8% and 5%, respectively; P < 0.001). Anti-nuclear antibody seropositivity had significant positive associations with disease severity, mental retardation and electroencephalogram abnormalities. Autoimmunity may play a role in a subgroup of children with autism. Further studies are warranted to assess anti-nuclear antibody seropositivity, other markers of autoimmunity (e.g., brain-specific autoantibodies), and the role of immunotherapy in children with autism.Immune involvement in schizophrenia and autism: Etiology, pathology and animal models.There is increasing evidence of immune involvement in both schizophrenia and autism. Of particular interest are striking abnormalities in the expression of immune-related molecules such as cytokines in the brain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). It is proposed that this represents a permanent state of brain immune dysregulation, which begins during early development. One possibility is that maternal infection, a known risk factor for schizophrenia and autism, sets this immune activation in motion. Several animal models are being used to investigate this hypothesis. There is also recent evidence that, among schizophrenic subjects, those associated with maternal infection display a distinctive pathology, which suggests that diverse causes for this disorder may explain some of its heterogeneity. The human and animal results related to immune involvement suggest novel therapeutic avenues based on immune interventions.Increased IgG4 levels in children with autism disorder.Accumulating evidence indicates that immune dysfunction is associated with autism disorders in a significant subset of children. Previous reports have shown abnormal immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, including an increased presence of autoreactive antibodies in the circulation of individuals with autism. As IgG is the predominant antibody isotype in circulation, we expected that an altered immune response could result in an abnormal IgG subclass profile in children with autism. We examined circulating plasma levels of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 in 241 children from the CHARGE (Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment) study, a large epidemiologic case-control investigation, including 114 children who meet full criteria for autism disorder (AU), 96 typically developing control children (TD) from a randomly selected sample of the general population, and 31 children with developmental delays (DD). We report significantly increased levels of the IgG4 subclass in children with AU compared with TD control children (p=0.016) and compared with DD controls (p=0.041). These results may suggest an underlying immunological abnormality in AU subjects resulting in elevated IgG4 production. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate the relationship between immunological findings and behavioral impairments in autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19135624", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19136031?dopt=Abstract", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19136055?dopt=Abstract"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/01/study-watch-immune-to-studies.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : Immune to studies\n"},

Levine and the court ruled in favor of Levine and against Wyeth. \u00a0The issue before the court was whether federal law preempts relevant state law, specifically whether a Vermont state failure-to-warn law was preempted by the FDA approving the label for a drug. \u00a0In this case the label for the drug failed to link a method of delivery of the drug to a potentially serious side effect. \u00a0The Supreme Court ruled that the FDA approving the label did not shield the company from liability from a state law.\u00a0I am oversimplifying the case. \u00a0There is a good write up of the decision on ScotusBlog here and here.What I found interesting here was some of the comments by\u00a0Justice Stevens\u00a0in his opinion (via ScotusBlog) :Justice Stevens had fervent praise for the function that patients\u2019 lawsuits \u2014 based on state, not federal, law \u2014 may serve.  \u201cState tort suits,\u201d he wrote, \u201cuncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks promptly.  They also serve a distinct compensatory function that may motivate injured persons to come forward with information.\u201dWhen those lawsuits are based on claims (as in the Wyeth case) of manufacturers\u2019 failure to warn about risks, Stevens added, they \u201clend force to the promise [of federal law] that manufacturers, not the FDA, bear primary responsibility for their drug labeling at all times.\u201dSo apparently Justice Stevens feels that lawsuits are a valid mechanism to keep companies honest and that the manufacturers, not an agency of the government, should be responsibility for the safety and warnings attached to their products.Let's compare and contrast\u00a0against the the legal rights of someone who feels that they have been injured by a vaccine. \u00a0In these instances the case has to be brought before what is commonly called Vaccine Court\u00a0where different rules and procedures apply. \u00a0In this court it is not the manufacturer that bears the responsibility to defend their product, it is the federal government. \u00a0In this court it is not the manufacturer that bears responsibility for damages caused by their products, rather it is the consumers who use the product that pay the damages (by means of a surcharge on the product).The system may have been needed when it was created but it is possible that it has outlived its purpose now. \u00a0Especially considering the fact that the vaccines are increasingly becoming big business for the companies that make them - a recent Wall Street Journal article puts the size at 21.5 billion dollars\u00a0Anyone see a problem and potential for abuse here? \u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/court-allows-drug-label-lawsuit/", "http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/analysis-a-warning-to-the-fda/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court", "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123535050056344903.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/03/product-liability.html", "title": "\nProduct Liability\n"},
{"date": "Friday, March 6, 2009", "body": "\nI think that most rational people would agree that having autism is not desirable. \u00a0Most people would agree that if something like autism could be cured or prevented it would be a good thing.These people would not be ones that believe in neurodiversity. \u00a0There is a strong anti-cure theme in their preachings.\u00a0\u00a0Take for example two recent posts, one from Michelle Dawson who writes at The Autism Crisis\u00a0and one from Kev at Left Brian Right Brain.First up is a quote from Ms Dawsons post Smallpox, polio, and autism\u00a0:So parliament's power will be used to spread awareness--to inform schools, families, employers, communities, landlords, governments, and so on--that autism is as frightening and harmful, as dangerous to society and the public good, as smallpox and polio. And just like smallpox and polio, autism must be eliminated--regardless of science and ethics, regardless of the wishes of autistics and/or parents of autistics.I don't know why \"science\" has a problem with that and I think ethics is a city in ancient Greece. \u00a0 I am going to go out on a limb here and say that most parents of children with autism would gladly agree to it being eliminated. \u00a0And while we are visiting that ancient Greek city of ethics I wonder what they would say about an \"autistic\" in effect wishing autism on other people by opposing its elimination. \u00a0 \u00a0I think what she is really saying is that she has a problem with eliminating autism. \u00a0Next up is the fascinating\u00a0IACC Strategic Plan: Good for us?\u00a0\u00a0In this post Kev, who lives in the UK, is talking about what in the strategic plan of the\u00a0IACC, which is a part of the US government. \u00a0I am not sure why he feels the need to comment on a plan that he isn't part of. \u00a0Doesn't the UK have similar measures that he should be more concerned with?Regardless, he seems to be having issues similar to Ms Dawson:\u00a0I don\u2019t even really quibble at the \u2018reducing the degree of severity\u2019 phrase but prevention? Even researchers as established and august as Simon Baron-Cohen and Tony Attwood have suggested this is not such a great idea. I also don\u2019t believe its a great (or necessary) idea.(Ah yes, the august Simon Baron-Cohen, I wonder what his ideal\u00a0WHR\u00a0is.)\u00a0\u00a0There\u2019s lots of good talk about support and education for adults and the need to recognise that autism is not a childhood condition. Amazing that such talk is needed when adults clearly make up the larger percentage of the autism population.I\u2019m not sure this is a cure-based document. I do think its a define-autism-as-a-medical-condition document which is again not such an accurate idea.So just another prevention and cure is bad riff with an added autism-isn't-a-medical-condition zinger thrown in for good measure. \u00a0But other than the august WHR he doesn't really give a reason for the prevention of autism would be a bad thing. \u00a0For that we have to turn to a comment on his post by Joseph :Preventing autism is something that people outside of the autism communities see as a positive. It does nothing for those of us in the autism communities. I\u2019m sure even the anti-vaxers don\u2019t care a whole lot about prevention. For those of us in the autistic community it\u2019s even somewhat offensive.Of course no one would oppose prevention of viral-cased or chemically-caused brain damage with a phenotype that presents as autism, as RAJ\u2019s strawman attempts to suggest. I am, however, completely opposed to any type of \u201cprevention\u201d that involves genetic screening and abortion.Now we get getting closer to the heart of the matter. \u00a0The ND believe that autism is primarily genetic therefore to them prevention becomes \"genetic screening and abortion.\"Notice how Joseph excludes what he calls conditions that \"present as autism\". \u00a0As \u00a0I have written about before, autism is not defined as a cause but as behaviors. \u00a0 If you meet the criteria then you have autism. \u00a0So this sort of distinction is rather does not exist.It is a shame they are so locked into their views that they feel the need to take a stand against something like preventing autism. \u00a0I guess once you go far enough down a certain road you become more concerned about keeping your world view consistent than doing what would be right. \u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/03/smallpox-polio-and-autism.html", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1941", "http://iacc.hhs.gov/", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1941#comment-57399"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/03/neurodiversity-ounce-of-prevention-is.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity: An ounce of prevention is not welcome\n"},

{"date": "Monday, April 20, 2009", "body": "\nI take a break from paying attention to the autism world to catch up on some needed sleep and to spend more time with the children and wouldn't you know it, I miss something like this video -\"No Myths\" Public Service AnnouncementOf course this was covered by the usual cheerleaders such as Steve D at \"One Dad's Opinion\" who thinks this is a good example of positive awareness.  Then there is the usual neutral appearing yet highly slanted coverage at change.org.  And of course the \"Powerful Autism public service announcement\" post at Left Brain Right Brian.The list goes on and on but I think you get the idea.  It might be simpler for the ND folk to put out a press release and be done with it. There has not been much coverage of this by the \"other\" side.  Harold Doherty had a quick mention of if but he is really just pointing out a post by Jonathan Mitchell at Autism's Gadfly debunking the video.I can't speak to the specifics of the people involved the way that Jonathan did but I but I think that parents with children on the spectrum should watch the video and ask themselves a simple question.Do the people in this video act or carry themselves like your children?For me the answer is no.  My daughters look like and act much more like Hannah Poling did in some of her public appearances.I know it would the happiest day of my life if my daughters will be able to express themselves as well as the young boy when they are that age.  At this point I would be happy if they could express themselves using more than one word at a time.  They are making what is for them is rapid progress but they still have a very long way to go.  And my children are on the less severe end of the spectrum.  So the question that comes to my mind is do these people fairly represent the needs and requirements of children on the spectrum?  When people like Ari Nee'man speak out against a cure for autism and say that I should not try to \"cure\" my children's autism.  What gives him the right to make such a decision for my children? When someone like Michelle Dawson attempts to convince parents not to treat their children with medically accepted and recommended treatments whose benefit is that for? When Deena Gassner says in the video \"Autism is an integral part of who I am and how I see the world.  I've embraced it and it has made be stronger\" who is she trying to kid?   I would challenge her to point to the exact part of the DSM IV autism criteria that when \"embraced\" makes you stronger.  Do you think it is the disrupted communication or social skills?  Perhaps it is the stims or restricted or obsessive behaviors?  Oh wait, I know, it is the ability to have a complete and utter meltdown in public because you can't pick a flower - that makes your \"stronger\", by strengthening your vocal cords.  (Twin B has a bad habit of doing this)Give me a break.  If you think autism makes you stronger then what you have isn't autism.The title of the video is \"No Myths\" yet I think a better title would have been \"Our Myths\".   These people would have you believe that autism is just a \"difference\" something that you can live with and work around, with the right supports.  They may even be right, for a very small subset of people on spectrum who are able to work around the disorder and thrive in spite of it.But for the rest of the adults with autism and for the vast majority of children on the spectrum what they are doing is a public disservice.  They are attempting to create a false impression that autism is just a quirk and not the profound disorder that it is.So let me offer my two cents worth of advice to the people in the video.  You want a larger part in the \"national discussion of autism\" that is happening \"without you\" then you need to stop being part of the problem.  Get down off of your ideological horse and start being part of the solution.   \n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_dPZDcX_ck", "http://onedadsopinion.blogspot.com/2009/04/psa-i-can-support.html", "http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_myths_psa", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2155", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/04/autisms-gadfly-does-some-neurodiversity.html", "http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/04/more-mythology-from-neurodiversity.html", "http://autismmedia.org/media11.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/public-disservice-annoucement.html", "title": "\nPublic Disservice Annoucement\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 24, 2009", "body": "\nEarlier this month there was a study published in\u00a0BMC Pediatrics called \"Hyperbaric treatment for children with autism: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial\".  This study looked at whether Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can help treat autism. \u00a0The short answer is that it seems possible that it can.The study is a definite improvement from earlier studies as it a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. \u00a0However, it still isn't perfect and there are potential issues. \u00a0And most importantly, it needs to be replicated by other groups.There has been much written about the study itself, so I am not going to go rehash what has been covered elsewhere. \u00a0Rather I wanted to write about the reaction to the study, specifically the analysis that appeared on Left Brain Right Brain in the post\u00a0Autism, HBOT, and the new study by Rossignol et al.In this\u00a0post the blogger DoC attempts to argue that the pressure achieved at one of the study locations (Center for Autism Research and Education in Phoenix, Arizona) was not the full 1.3 ATA as was stated in the study but rather might only have been 1.24 ATA. \u00a0If you want the full detail about the math go read the original post but the thing that struck me is that when you look at the actual figures used DoC does not have accurate data for his criticism. \u00a0Specifically he is missing a key data \u00a0point about what the actual air pressure is at the study location. \u00a0If his assumed figure was off even 0.6% then his conclusion\u00a0is incorrect.I pointed out as much in the comments and\u00a0he conceded the point while at the same time saying that the study had the same problem.\u00a0Call me silly, but I am thinking that the people at the center in Phoenix would be aware of how to use their equipment properly to achieve the results desired. \u00a0And according to the information provided by DoC about the equipment is rated by the manufacturer for the 1.3 ATA quoted. \u00a0But set that aside for a minute and assume that DoC is correct and that the pressure wasn't as high as as reported; that it only got up to 120% instead of 130% of sea level pressure. \u00a0What would that mean? \u00a0To my mind it would only make the study stronger since the benefits of HBOT were achieved with a lower pressure than was stated. \u00a0So if that is the worst problem with the study then that isn't too bad. \u00a0But wait, there's more. \u00a0If you look at the comments you come across some, ahem, interesting additional theories about where the study went wrong. \u00a0Lets start with a comment from \"A Proud Father\":I\u2019m sorry, but all you have to do is look at the authors of this study: Rossignol, Neubrander, Mumper. Names just loaded with credibility. I\u2019ll read such a study when it comes from respected members of the research community.Ok, I guess the whole peer-reviewed journal doesn't mean too much when you instantly know that the authors faked the whole study. \u00a0Good catch there, good thing you weren't too proud to say anything.Joseph suggests that:Does Dr. Rossignol in particular or\u00a0HBOT\u00a0proponents in general recommend that children who live at high altitude should move to the coast? That would seem to be a straightforward conclusion of his hypothesis if it is true.Showing that he is completely missing the point of increased pressure (1 ATA = sea level). \u00a0Perhaps it would have been better to suggest that the families\u00a0go live underwater since that is where you found find pressure greater than that of sea level. \u00a0Or maybe they should dig a really big hole in the ground and live in that...Continuing on\u00a0Author\u00a0says that:\u00a0Despite the blinding attempt, it would have been trivial for someone inside the inflated \u201cnylon\u201d chamber to guess wether\u00a0(sic) it was inflated at 1.03 or 1.3 ATM, by touching the side of the chamber.I have to wonder if he has ever been inside a chamber and tried the theory out for himself. \u00a0I think not.Joesph jumps back in with :The statistics of the study also seem unconvincing. There\u2019s only 1 statistically significant between-groups effect among 9 measures taken using ATEC and ABC.And finally Sullivan jumps in with the knock-out punch:The diagnostic instruments (if I can call them that) are inadequate for drawing any real conclusions.So there you have it, the study has been demolished because of a lack of specified data, the authors are crooks, the chamber gave away the the pressure, the statistics were bad, and even if all the rest were fine the diagnostic tests weren't valid. \u00a0Therefore there is nothing to the study and no possible improvements from HBOT.If only the study's authors had not relied on their own professional experience and had asked this group of people they could have been spared the time and effort of actually performing the study.(In case you couldn't guess, that was sarcasm)The only point I keep wondering about is why a group of people who claim that they believe in hard cold facts feel the need to pontificate and come up with wild theories in an attempt to discredit a study. \u00a0Sounds to me like they are afraid of something.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/9/21/abstract", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbaric_medicine", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1987", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1987#comment-57760", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1987#comment-57761", "http://www.oxyhealth.com/pdfs/vitaeris-lowres2007-8.pdf", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1987#comment-57754", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1987#comment-57757", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1987#comment-57766", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1987#comment-57769", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1987#comment-57781"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/03/when-simply-ignoring-evidence-isnt-good.html", "title": "\nWhen simply ignoring the evidence isn't good enough\n"},

Prior to this study, the mechanism by which beta-amyloid protein caused synaptic damage to neurons in Alzheimer's disease was unknown.Alzheimer's is a truly terrible disease and it is a good thing that research is being done to determine the causes and what can be done to correct or prevent it.The second one was -Coming Face To Face With AutismSounds serious, right? \u00a0Wrong.In the first study of its kind researchers will use video clips of spontaneously produced facial expressions in a real life social context to explore emotion recognition in autism.This research, carried out at The University of Nottingham, will go beyond the more artificial emotion recognition tasks that have previously been used.Clearly these two studies are not in the same league. \u00a0I am not saying that it is not important to quantify emotion recognition in autism - OK, maybe I am saying that it is not important to quantity that. \u00a0We know that there can be impairments in that area, so this isn't going to lead to any new treatments or any hope of a cure.I know that this isn't that fair to compare these two articles, they clearly are being done with different purposes in mind. \u00a0But can we please move on from research that attempts to prove that vaccinations didn't do it, that looks for the non-existent genetic smoking gun, \u00a0or asks \"does this look sad to you\"?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090402143453.htm", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090401204203.htm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/mitochondial-damage-vs-smiley-faces.html", "title": "\nMitochondial Damage vs Smiley Faces\n"},

Lets put it to the judges and find out.  Each valid argument will be awarded up to 1 point, each bogus one will be awarded no points.Starting with the right corner -Generation Rescue\u2019s position is already represented on the IACC.That isn't really the point of representation, is it?  It you look at the roster for the IACC you will see that several government agencies not only have their position duplicated by other agencies but they also have multiple seats themselvesZero pointsJust because there are multiple organizations, doesn\u2019t mean that the IACC has to include them all.Yeah, uhm, isn't this the same as the first reason?Zero pointsThis would lead to even more wasted time.I have to agree that the more members on a committee the longer it takes for anything to get done.  But at the same time the point of the committee is to represent the various confliciting interests.Half pointGeneration Rescue has clearly demonstrated itself to be anti-science.This statement is just plain silly - Generation Rescue is very much a science based organization.  Just because you disagree with with their position doesn't mean that they are anti-science.Zero pointsThey don\u2019t want their voice heard, they want to be able to outvote the scientists.If they want to outvote the \"scientists\" doesn't that mean their opinion runs contrary to what these \"scientists\" believe.  And if that is the case wouldn't that mean that a vote against them would be making their voice heard?Zero pointsThey are rude.If we excluded everyone who could be rude then there wouldn't be anyone left talking.Zero pointsMoving on to the left corner -The combating autism act which the IACC grew out of was passed to prevent and cure autism.This is true but that doesn't mean that the entire purpose of the organization should be to cure autism.Half pointThey already have representation on the IACC.They do have Stephen Shore and Alison Tepper Singer who for some reason felt that she was entitled to keep the seat from Autism Speaks when she resigned.  And the new Autism Science Foundation does appear to be climbing into bed with the ND folks.One pointForeign non American taxpaying ND's are encouraged by the autism hub to write about the IACC.While this is true in general the author of this list (Sullivan) is a US resident so he is allowed to have an opinion, even if it expressed on a UK site.Half pointThey are anti-science in terms of promoting science that will cure and prevent autism.This is a good point - the ND movement is against finding a cure for autism and in some cases against looking at the genetics of autism.  If you take these two items away there isn't a whole lot that the IACC can focus on.One pointThey are rude.See above - Zero pointsThe final score is 0.5 to 3.0 - the winner of the better list contest is Autism's Gadfly.

There were no symptoms to support the hypothesis that ASD children had an enterocolitis.So this data is meant to contradict reports of GI issues being common in children with autism. \u00a0Indeed if you read the introduction of the paper it appears the purpose of the paper is to rebut other studies done that show a relation.\u00a0After reading the study the data appears to be on the inconclusive side for the purpose of drawing any meaningful conclusions. \u00a0But then again I am not as familiar with the symptoms of bowel disease nor that familiar with how these things are normally diagnosed.The number of children with autism was on the smaller side (76) and the data is from parental reports over a long time period so I have to wonder at how accurate it is. \u00a0On the flip side it is does disprove the commonly held belief that all children with autism have bowel issues from a young age. \u00a0So who knows, just food for thought.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/adc.2008.148866v1", "http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/", "http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/sci-com/quests/"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/study-watch-early-stool-patterns-of.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : The early stool patterns of young children with autistic spectrum disorder\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 28, 2009", "body": "\nThere is a limited amount of government funding that is available for autism services and Kristina Chew takes issue with how Pennsylvania spends its limited resources in a recent post at autism.change.org.Her concern is that PA allocates 185 million to providing medical assistance programs for children with autism yet has just started allocating only an addition 20 million for respite care and therapies for people older than 21. \u00a0Prior to this there was no funding for services after 21 so this is 20 million is additional funding.The medical assistance program in PA provides for all medical needs for children with autism, from ABA style therapies to speech therapies to basic medical care. \u00a0Ms Chew's beef with the new program is that the funding isn't even between the two areas -Something of an imbalance? Especially in light of the reality that (like all of us......) individuals on the autism spectrum are going to be adults for far longer than they are children.And that too much emphasis is put on trying to give children the best head start possible -\u00a0Has parents' fear of their children growing up and becoming adults with autism focused attention too much on doing \"everything one can\" to \"remediate\" autism in a child, rather than on thinking about the life-long needs of a child?What Ms Chew seems to forget, rather conveniently, is that the reason that all of the early intervention is done is because we are thinking about the life-long needs of a child. \u00a0Not too long ago the answer to an autism diagnosis was to give up hope and put the child into an institution where they would likely spend the rest of their life.Now we try to prevent that and give the children with autism the best help that we can so that they have a chance of overcoming their disability. \u00a0 Right now early intervention is the only evidence based, medically accepted treatment for autism and the earlier that you start the better then outcome for the child. \u00a0In some cases you are able to teach children to cope with their disability well enough that they can hope to have a \"normal\" life.In the case of my children early intervention has taught them h0w to communicate using sign language, PECS, and the beginnings of how to talk. \u00a0It has also taught them how to tune into the world around them so they can hope to understand it. \u00a0I am hopeful that given the right supports that they will\u00a0be able to overcome their disability.That is why early intervention exists and that is why the funding is set up the way that it is. \u00a0The earlier you start the less likely that services will be needed for the rest of the child's life. \u00a0And if there still is a need for services it is likely that not as much will be needed.Ms Chew is a bit hypocritical in talking about rebalancing funding since she took advantage of it when her son was younger \u00a0-\u00a0I'm not critiquing \"early intervention\"; certainly my own son benefited hugely from the teaching and care he received from the time he was 2 years old. But I hope we can find ways to think of autism as not simply, not only an \"issue of children's health\" but as why we need to allocate resources for individuals of autism of all ages, all through their lives.I am guessing that what she is saying is that while she isn't against early intervention she would rather cut back on the money that PA spends on that service and reallocate it for adult services.\u00a0So we should cut 85 million from the medical assistance program - cut the services provided to every child in the state - drop ABA hours, drop speech therapy, drop medical coverage and \u00a0reallocate it to the older individuals with autism?\u00a0How many adults are there in PA over 21 that have a diagnosis of autism compared to the number under 21? \u00a0Do we think these numbers are even close?Maybe instead of complaining about the imbalance in funding amount perhaps she should be talking about what a good first step this is in providing needed services for adults? \u00a0\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.change.org/blog/view/childhood_is_short_autism_is_lifelong"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/dont-look-gift-horse-in-mouth.html", "title": "\nDon't look a gift horse in the mouth\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, June 20, 2009", "body": "\nSome days it doesn't pay to read anything online.  I ran across this post written by Jonathan Mitchell at Autism's Gadly.  Mr. Mitchell is, for those of you who do not read his blog, at adult with autism who writes about issues surrounding autism and, while I do not agree with everything that he says, I do think that he makes a lot of good points and is worth reading.  But I digress.His post was a rebuttal to something posted at autistics.org that was targeted at him specifically.  I was intrigued so I went to read the original post here.  I wish I hadn't.The title of the thread is \"Autism Suck-ups\" and was written by someone calling themselves \"Sadderbutwisergirl\", it starts out with -Have you guys ever heard of curebie autistics? Personally, I hate it when they spread around the drivel of hate groups such as Autism Speaks and so I've put up a special place to complain about them and (the following is optional) put them in categories based on this criteria.  I'm going to start off by complaining about Jonathan Mitchell. It sickens me how he says...The post then continues in an attempt to dissect statements Mr. Mitchell has made with some, well, interesting results.  For example, on the problems living with autism?He blames his being autistic for all of his problems and doesn't consider that the problems may be due to discrimination rather than the fact that he is autistic. Self-injurious behaviors?I can come up with an easy answer for that one: If society is changed, people won't see the need to dope them up with behavioral meds and do all kinds of psychologically harmful things to them to get them to stop them from banging their heads. ... Whenever I catch her trying to headbang, I just turn her face so that she is looking towards me and tell her \"no.\" I then give her a hug to make her feel better...On wanting people with autism to be able to talk?There we go again with the disgusting crap about how only \"a normal speaking person\" deserves to be emulated. This destructive drivel has been the justification for the harm of so many autistic persons.On diagnosing long dead historical figures as having autism?While it is not possible to confirm that Einstein, Jefferson, and Newton were autistic after they ve been dead for so long, they do have some autistic traits and you can't really confirm that they were \"normal\" either, so shut your trap.The most disturbing statements come later in a later post in the thread by the same author -I find it to be really disturbing that he is spreading the idea that the autism community's problems are caused by the fact that they're autistic and you're right. He is wrongfully removing the blame from the neuromajority supremacists to fix the problems that they created. That would be like a Nazi Germany-era Jew obstructing any anti-Nazi resistances, saying that the Nazis are only trying to help the Jews by exterminating them, giving money to Nazis in the upper echelons because he considers them to be his friends, joyfully going to the concentration camps, and gleefully jumping into the crematorium. If there are any Holocaust survivors reading this and feeling appalled, I apologize, but I'm trying to prove a point here. The Nazis weren't trying to help the Jews at all. All they were doing was depriving them of their civil and human rights and ultimately their lives systematically. To me, an autistic person spewing this kind of crap out of their mouths is just as strange, disturbing, and sickening as the example of the Jew happily accepting the atrocities that the Nazis have done to him.I am sure that most people reading this can see the insanity of the statements above.  The problems experienced by individuals with autism are not due to a systematic discrimination in society but rather because autism is a profound disorder.  (Although society as a whole does need to learn to tolerate and accept what comes with autism).  If your child has self-injurious behaviors they most certainly don't stop just because you tell them \"no\".  Being able to talk or communicate effectively is not an optional skill for surviving in the world, especially if you want to be able to live independently.I don't think that anyone who lives with autism on a daily basis really cares whether Einstein had autism.And most importantly, people with autism are not a persecuted minority nor is there even the slightest relation to the horror that Jewish people experienced in Nazi Germany.Autism is not about civil rights, it is about treating a serious disorder.So who would such inane things and spout such nonsense?  If you click on profile for \"Sadderbutwisergirl\" you see that this person is a 15 year old girl.  Assuming that the profile is correct, these are some rather extreme views for someone so very young.  I have to wonder if her parents know what she is doing online.I think it is obvious that someone who is 15 is unlikely to come up with this stuff on their own; they have to be parroting what they have heard or read elsewhere.  I guess the new slogan for neurodiversity is to get 'em while they're young and hook 'em for life.So I guess I am a little confused, is neurodiversity about acceptance or is it a cult?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismgadfly.blogspot.com/2009/06/jonathan-mitchell-autistic-suck-up.html", "http://www.autistics.org/forum/index.php?topic=2427.0", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2988647.stm"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/06/neurodiversity-stop-hate.html", "title": "\nNeurodiversity : Stop the Hate\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, June 28, 2009", "body": "\nAt the risk of sticking my foot in my mouth I would like to say that having a diagnosis on the autism spectrum does give you the a license to purposely act in socially inappropriate ways.  Don't get me wrong, I do believe in accepting and accommodating behavior when a disability gets in the way of normal social functioning - especially if the person does not understand the social context or are otherwise unable to function in the social situation.  And I am not talking about the little social niceties, such as making eye contact, talking in an appropriate tone, or even responding when someone is talking to you.  I am talking about outright unacceptable behavior in people who know better.So, if you can understand the social situation and deliberately choose to act in a way that is outside the norm, you do not get to claim that a diagnosis of autism gives you a free pass.  Nor do you get to claim that it is your \"civil right\" to act outside of societal norms because you have autism.  Autism is a medical disorder, not a civil rights movement.If you have autism you do have the right to be treated equally and to ask for people to be accepting of the challenges that that you face.  You have  the right to be treated with respect.  This is nothing more or less than the \"rights\" that everyone is entitled to - regardless of who they are or any medical conditions that they have. Sadly, there are those who use autism as an excuse to behave badly.Take for example a recent series of posts on Autisable, starting with a post entitled Neurodiversity Bull that written by someone calling themselves LadyLibellule.   It was a well written critique of the neurodiversity movement that was not overly harsh or judgemental..Of course there were a number of comments from those who were not happy about the post.  I am going to point out the comments and actions of one person in particular - not because I have any particular beef with this person but rather because it is a prime example of someone behaving badly and claiming a free pass because of their autism.This person calls themselves Abiline_piper_lg and seems to be 22 year old high school math teacher (if you believe his profile).  He also claims to be an \"aspie\" although I am unsure of what specific diagnosis it is that he is claiming.  Lets look at some of the comments that he left of the post.  I am not going to include the entire text of the comment, just the relevant parts, so click on the links if you want the full context.So, starting with the initial comment -You know, this lady visited my blog recently. She's so full of it. She apparently doesn't understand that \"empathy\" is a trait we Aspies lack. Someone needs to go back to school I think. Not too bad yet, but it gets better in later comments -Take Lady with a grain of salt though. I do apologize such ignorance comes from my hometown of Abilene. I promise you not all of us Abilenians are this ignorant and bigoted. And better - I've been the victim of many of her attacks as well, on our local newspaper website. It pisses me off too. I've gotten into it with her. I don't see how she can live with herself honestly. \"Lady Libel\" is a good name for her too, with as slanderous as she is. Leading up to him calling the author what I believe was meant to be one of the seven dirty words I understand where you're coming from. As much as I hate to use this word, Lady Libel is a \"c.\" And with that we have gone completely beyond what is acceptable in any sort of civil conversations.  It is worth noting that the author of the post did not respond to any of these comments, this gentleman was responding to other people's comments and getting himself worked up. Now this is a bad enough, but if that was the worst of it I wouldn't be writing about it.  This gentleman apparently felt that his comments were not enough, so he wrote a post that was also posted on Autisable called Autisaphobia (Rebuttal To \"Neurodiversity Bull\") in which he likens disagreeing with the principles of neurodiversity to homophobia -Autisaphobics display an extreme dislike for Autistic-type people. So much in fact, that they want to force Autistics to conform to societal standards for personality traits. Autisaphobia is similar to homophobia (which involves the extreme hatred of homosexuals and trying to force homosexuals to be heterosexual) in that apparently people with Autism are viewed at as sub-human monsters.As a society we've become way too judgmental. We judge people by what they look like, what they wear, and still even by the color of their skin. Now we judge people by some sort of medical condition that through no fault of their own they have, yet they've come to accept it and are OK with having it and thus don't want treatment? How about you mind your own business (or, perhaps if that's not clear enough, BUTT OUT) and let us choose how to live our lives!!!!So this is me, being \"autisaphobic\" and telling this gentleman that he should be conforming to socially acceptable behavior because he clearly seems to know better.  While he certainly has the right to live his life how he wants he does not have the right to call someone vulgar names and suggest that they are \"bigoted\" or \"phobic\" or filled with \"extreme hatred\" because they don't share the same views. You do not have the right to call people names and accuse them of hate crimes simply they disagree with you and you happen to have a diagnosis of autism.

{"date": "Friday, September 25, 2009", "body": "\nPerhaps the most important question about autism that remains unanswered is whether we are currently in the midst of an autism epidemic.  Is autism more common today than it was ten, twenty, or fifty years ago, or are we just better at recognizing it?The most recent data available suggests that the current prevalence of autism in the United States is 1 in 100 while in the UK it is thought to be 1 in 84.  This stands in stark contrast to the prevalence of 4 in 10,000 that was the going rate for decades before.  The skeptics who don't believe that the autism is more common today than yesterday will tell you that there are a variety of reasons for this contrast.  They will tell you that the definition of what autism has become broader, that people with autism used to be given different diagnoses, that the greater awareness of autism leads to greater numbers, and that parents are jumping at the chance to have their children labeled as autistic to take advantage of all of the great services available.All of the reasons are true, to a point.  But I don't think that they can, even if combined, take account for more than half of the rise. Just for the sake of argument, assume for a minute that all of the reasons above are completely plausible and that one percent of the population has always had autism.  This leaves us with one rather large, unanswered question.Where are all of the adults with autism?If the estimate of 1 percent is correct, then there should be over 2 million adults living in the US with autism while in the UK there should be over four hundred thousand.  You would think that it would be easy to find a group that makes up one percent of the population, yet all attempts to locate this hidden horde have failed.That is until now.  Earlier this week the results of the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey were released and they purport to show that one percent of adults in the UK do in fact have autism.The BBC has an article on the survey that says, among other things, that ...the report suggests that, despite popular perceptions, rates of autism are not increasing, with prevalence among adults in line with that among children.It also suggests that, among adults, rates of autism remain broadly constant across age groups.The findings do not support suggestions of a link between the MMR vaccine and the development of this condition.So there you have it, this survey finally shows that the rate of autism is constant across age groups and that ... wait, what does this have to do with the MMR?  That doesn't sound, right.  Lets look at what the survey actually found, shall we?Hmm, they randomly selected households in England and came up with a group of 7,461 adults who agreed to take part in the survey.  These adults were screened using a modified version of the Autism Quotient, and 5,329 people where selected by the AQ to move onto the second phase.  Of this second set 630 people were selected to be given more comprehensive tests including the current gold standard, the ADOS.  Of this last group 19 were found to have an autism spectrum disorder.The survey estimates that had all of the 5,329 cases been tested using the ADOS that 77 cases would have been found, but that is based on a lot of statistical extrapolations that is hard to make head or tails of.  Actually, if you read the survey it is filled with a lot of talk about the methods and the statistics and how these numbers were estimated and how those numbers were made up, I mean estimated.So based on the 19 cases, the survey forecasts that a full one percent of the adult population of England has autism.   And, regardless of what is in the BBC, there is no mention of the MMR nor is there any data concerning it.The survey found 19 members of the hidden horde in the UK, that means there are only 399,981 more members to find.  How hard can that be?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/Srw_4dRVnRI/AAAAAAAAADU/EC1p-6IDw5A/s1600-h/UT5152.jpg", "http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/mental-health/mental-health-surveys/autism-spectrum-disorders-in-adults-living-in-households-throughout-england--report-from-the-adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey-2007", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8268302.stm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Spectrum_Quotient", "http://portal.wpspublish.com/pls/portal/url/page/wps/W-365"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/09/hidden-horde-of-adults-with-autism.html", "title": "\nThe Hidden Horde of Adults with Autism Found?\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, August 5, 2009", "body": "\nPhoto by EyalNow (flickr)In the August issues of Pediatrics there is a study that looks at how often gastrointestinal symptoms are seen in children with autism.Incidence of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Children With Autism: A Population-Based StudyThe authors looked at the medical records of children under 21 who had been patients of the Mayo Clinic between 1976 and 1997 -apparently this group covers 95% of the residents of Olmsed County, Minnesota - and identified the children who met the criteria DSM IV for autism.  There were a total of 124 children identified, 121 of which agreed to be included in this study.  Each of these children were then matched with two control subjects (242) who were matched on gender, age, as well as other factors.  The charts of these groups were examined to find gastrointestinal symptoms and diagnoses in five categories :ConstipationDiarrheaAbdominal bloating, discomfort or irritabilityGastroesphageal reflux or vomitingFeeding issues or food selectivityThe data was then analyzed to determine if children with autism were more likely to have these symptoms or diagnoses.  Out of the 121 children with autism, 87 had any reported problem on their charts while 167 of the 242 in the control group had issues.  The results show that children with autism were more likely to have constipation and feeding issues than typical children.  There were not more likely to have diarrhea, abdominal bloating, reflux or vomiting and overall had the same incidence of symptoms.The authors speculate that the constipation and feeding issues in the autism group are more likely to be related behavioral issues rather than any underlying biological reason.  So the overall conclusion of the study is that children with autism are not more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms.This is a good study, as far as it goes.  There is a lot of speculation and guessing in the study that is not supported by the data and there are some areas that I wish had been addressed better.For example, the authors assert  in the discussion section that children with autism are commonly treated with risperidone and that could potentially be responsible for constipation and selective eating.  Yet I have to wonder why this wasn't included in the analysis or the data - they had access to the medical records of the children so they should have been able to determine if this was a factor or not.Then there is the assumption that any gastrointestinal problem would be included in the medical records.  The authors note this as a possible limitation of the study but dismiss this concern because children with autism are \"subjected to increased medical scrutiny\".  I find this of line of reasoning very hard to shallow for a number of reasons but mostly because of my experiences with my own children.  My twin daughters had diarrhea, bloating and irritability, and feeding issues when they were infants before we placed them on a restricted diet.  After being put on the diet they have food selectivity. We did talk to our children's doctor about these issues at the time yet our concerns were largely dismissed.  I would be very surprised if there was any mention in their charts of these symptoms.Mostly I wish that the authors had collected data on which of the children with autism are on restricted diets and whether that impacted the results.  For example, were GI symptoms more common in children on a restricted diet or off?  But, as I said before, this is a decent study, if a bit limited.

{"date": "Wednesday, November 11, 2009", "body": "\n\nPhoto from berkeleylab (flickr)\nThis post is going to be somewhat off-topic from autism but this is something that I thought was interesting and could potentially one day have implications for some of the mysterious health problems like autism.\nThere is a study entitled \"Nanoparticles can cause DNA damage across a cellular barrier\" in the November 5th issue of Nature Nanotechnology that demonstrated that nanoparticles could, under\u00a0laboratory\u00a0conditions, cause damage to the DNA of cells that they couldn't touch. \n\nNow, if you are like me and have only a rudimentary understanding of molecular biology then most of what the this study says will be\u00a0indecipherable jargon. \u00a0Lucky for us, there is an article at The New Scientist that explains the results in easier to understand terms.\n\nIn simple terms, there were three items in a lab dish - a group of nanoparticles, a barrier made up of human cells that have been specialized for lab work, and a type of human cell (fibroblast) that is found in skin and connective tissue. \u00a0The nanoparticles were physically separated from the\u00a0fibroblast cells by the barrier cells.\n\nYet, after a day in the lab dish, the fibroblast cells had damage to their DNA, presumably from the nanoparticles. \u00a0The New Scientist explains what might have happened -\nThe nanoparticles directly influenced the nearest layer of barrier cells and disrupted their mitochondria \u2013 chambers where energy is generated and stored.\nThat released signalling molecules \u2013 mainly the energy-transport molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) \u2013 which in turn triggered a cascade of biochemical messages inside the cell. That signalling storm eventually reached the other side of the barrier cell, opening channels that spread the message to the next layer of barrier cells.\nThis Chinese-whispers process continued until signalling molecules reached the fibroblasts, somehow damaging their DNA \u2013 the researchers don't yet know how this happened.\nOr in a nutshell, the nanoparticles somehow disrupted the\u00a0mitochondria of the barrier cell which in turn caused \u00a0damage to the DNA of the other cells. \u00a0\u00a0The setup from this experiment is completely made-up and does not resemble anything that can occurs in the human body. \u00a0But at the same time, I did not realize that something like this was even possible. \u00a0\u00a0It will be interesting to see if this result can be confirmed by other groups.\n\nI don't think that this\u00a0scenario\u00a0in this experiment has anything directly to do with autism, nor do I think that nanoparticles have any sort of causal role in autism. \u00a0But, I have to wonder if there could be a mechanism similar to this that happening in some people with autism. \u00a0So far, studies that have looked for a genetic cause to autism have only found very small groups that share any sort of common genetic changes. \u00a0And the majority of these findings have failed to be replicated by other groups. \u00a0Perhaps the reason for this is that we have cause and effect wrong. \u00a0Perhaps these small genetic changes are not the cause of autism but rather the effect of another process that causes autism.\n\nJust food for thought.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3201/2961362103_5258f48902_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/berkeleylab/2961362103/", "http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nnano.2009.313.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoparticle", "http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18119-nanoparticle-dna-damage-study-what-you-should-know.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/11/damaging-dna-without-touching-it.html", "title": "\nDamaging DNA without touching it\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, October 4, 2009", "body": "\nThere must have been something in the air this past week because there have been strange things written in the past couple of days.  Perhaps it is being caused by the anticipation of the big announcement coming tomorrow (something like pre-wedding jitters).This brings us to the first absurdity of the day - tomorrow's big announcement.  If all of chatter is correct, the CDC is set to announce that rate of autism in the US has reached 1 in 100 (or possibly higher).  This is all due, of course, to the tireless work of the medical community.  They have been expanding diagnostic criteria, raising awareness, and getting better at finding autism in children everywhere. Without all of their hard work for the past twenty years, we wouldn't have as much autism as we do today.  So, if you happen to be talking to your child's pediatrician tomorrow, make sure you give them a pat on the back for a job well done.The second absurdity  of the day is Michelle Dawson.  Michelle Dawson wrote a post yesterday claiming that it is only due to her hard work that people with autism in Canada are recognized as people.  Well, actually, it was her suing her former employer for discrimination that she says did the trick.  Before that people with autism were apparently not \"human beings with human rights\".  Although, like most things in life, there is a catch - to qualify as human you have to meet Ms Dawson's definition of \"most autistics\" -By \"most autistics,\" I mean those of us, the majority of autistics in Canada, who have not received unlimited ABA-based interventions starting early in life. So, if you are a parent of a child with autism and want to make sure that your child is considered a person you will want to immediately move to Canada and stop any ABA interventions you are doing.(For a better treatment of this nonsense go see what Harold Doherty has to say on the subject, I can't bring myself to take such absurdities seriously).And since strangeness, like deaths or weddings, always come in threes, here is the last one.  Did you know that Hitler may have had autism?  Scientists and behaviorist have studied the life and mannerisms of Adolf Hitler, some believe he may have had Asperger's Syndrome, which is part of the Autism Spectrum. Michael Fitzgerald, an expert in the field, concludes that Hitler did indeed meet all the criteria set out by Hans Asperger.If the diagnosing of historical figures isn't absurd enough for you, the comments on the post take it to a whole new level.  The people who are normally so quick to agree with historical diagnosing seem to be distancing themselves from this one  -I have Asperger's diagnosis (in 2003) and I'm a mother of two children on the autistic spectrum. ...  I'm also ethnically Jewish and just the idea that someone who killed millions of Jews AND people with disabilities, including those on the autistic spectrum is claimed to be LIKE ME is preposterous!  Hitler was not autistic - he was psychotic and evil.Comparing Hitler's behaviour to that of autistic people will only further victimise us who are 'different' while giving the real abusers yet another excuse why their abuse of us is 'justified'.So remember, if you feel the need to diagnosis a famous historical figure with autism, make sure you pick someone who wasn't psychotic and/or evil.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/Ssi81ox8HoI/AAAAAAAAADc/aQV9_fCVnfQ/s1600-h/snipercat.jpg", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/10/autistic-people-are-persons-anniversary.html", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2009/10/michelle-dawsons-false-and-absurd-anti.html", "http://www.examiner.com/x-21398-Birmingham-Autism--Parenting-Examiner~y2009m9d30-Hitlers-skull-is-a-female--Did-he-have-Autism-Pictures--video"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/10/absurdities-of-day.html", "title": "\nAbsurdities of the day\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 24, 2009", "body": "\nPhoto by tedbassman (flickr)In the August 2009 issue of Pediatrics there is a study showing that some forms of air pollution can adversely affect a child's IQ if they are exposed early and often enough.Prenatal Airborne Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Exposure and Child IQ at Age 5 YearsPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of pollutants that are produced and released into the environment as a byproduct of burning fossil fuels, tobacco, and other such substances.  These substances are known to cause cancer (carcinogenic), genetic mutations (mutagenic),  and birth defects (teratogenic).  Newborns and fetuses children are thought to be especially susceptible to this form of pollution.  This study looked at the relationship between prenatal/early postnatal exposure to airborne PAHs and intelligence in a group of children in New York City.  To that end, a group of pregnant women was recruited from select area of New York City between 1998 and 2003.  These women were between 18 to 23 years old, non-smokers, non-drug users, and in good health.To measure prenatal exposure to PAHs the air quality in the women\u2019s home environment was sampled during the third trimester of the pregnancy.  The air was analyzed to determine the level of PAHs \u2013 the range of values was from 0.49 ng/m3 to 34.48 ng/m3 with the mean being 2.26 ng/m3.Since the level of air pollution in New York City is stable and does not vary seasonally this level of exposure was used as the exposure of the children to PAHs during early childhood as well.When the children reached their fifth birthday, they were given the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WPPSI-R) to determine their IQ.  There were 249 children still participating in the study at age 5 who had enough data to be included in the results.  The children were split into a low and high exposure group based on their mother's PAH exposure while pregnant. There were 140 children in the high exposure group (PAHs over 2.26 ng/m3) and 109 children in the low exposure group.The data was adjusted for the mother's intelligence, the quality of the home environment, other exposures to PAHs (i.e. second hand smoke, dietary sources), as well as other factors.The results indicate that the children in the high exposure group scored about 5 points lower on average on several measures of IQ than the low PAH group - this roughly translates to a 4% percent lower IQ.To put it another way, chronic exposure to pollutants like these could very well negatively affect a child\u2019s IQ in the same way that chronic exposure to low levels of lead does.So what does this study have to do with autism?  Well, the authors also included some of the other affects that PAHs are thought to have on fetuses and very young children :Epigenetic changesLower immune competenceMetabolic and neurological functional problemsDecreased ability to detoxify chemicalsDecreased ability to repair DNA damageEndocrine disruptionOxidative stressAny of these look familiar?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3200/3054073040_3d6d8cdc7d_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/tedbassman/3054073040/", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/", "//www.blogger.com/%3C/div%3Ehttp://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2008-3506v1", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/07/study-watch-prenatal-airborne.html", "title": "\nStudy Watch : Prenatal Airborne Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Exposure and Child IQ at Age 5 Years\n"},

I wrote earlier about how the first two parts of the series regurgitated the same old tired lines about their being no link between vaccinations and autism.  In the final part of his series Dr Karp changes his tone and spends most of his time talking about endrocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and how they might be related to autism.  These chemicals include things such as BPA, phtlates, and flame retardants.He believes that there is a \"rising tide of evidence\" that some or all of these chemicals could be \"a possible poison to our children's developing brains\".  No studies have been done that have established a link but Dr Karp thinks that \"our exposure to EDCs is no mere theoretical concern\" and that \"we urgently need more research to discover whether EDCs, or other chemicals, are linked to the worldwide rise in autism\".  One of the additional pieces of research that is just getting underway is the National Children's Study (NCS).  Dr. Karp has this to say about this study -The NCS may be our generation's best chance to solve the autism riddle. It is exactly the type of study needed to tease out the subtle relationships that may exist between autism and chemicals.I can only say one thing - its about time.This sort of approach is long overdue given how much more common autism is than 30 years ago and how little work has been done to look into environmental factors involved in autism.  I have to commend Dr Karp for writing about something so important and taking a break from chanting the \"its genetic\" party line. Now for the funny part of the article.  Tucked down at the bottom of the post Dr Karp listed three other areas that he believes need additional research. If you didn't read what I wrote about the two earlier parts of the series either go read that (link above) or, even better, the actual two articles.Here are the three items he lists:the autism risk in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated kidsthe metabolism of vaccine ingredients (like aluminum, added to make shots work better)more accurate determinations of the true incidence of autismSo you got that?

{"date": "Tuesday, September 22, 2009", "body": "\nFor those of you who missed the opening battle in the autism vaccine wars and wanted a cliff notes version there is a recent paper in Neurotoxicity Research that gives a good summary.  This paper is freely available, so I encourage everyone who is interested to read it for themselves.Are Neuropathological Conditions Relevant to Ethylmercury Exposure?As most of you know there are two forms of mercury at issue here.  The first is called methylmercury and is the type that makes up the majority of our exposure to mercury.  We are exposed to this type from the environment and the food that we eat.  Science has a good idea of how the body responds to this form of mercury and what its affects are.  Then you have the second type of mercury, known as ethylmercury.  Vaccines contained a substance called thimerosal that is metabolized by the body into ethylmercury.  We do not know as much about how this form of mercury acts in the body and therein lies the problem.  Around 1999 someone in the US looked at the vaccine schedule, did some basic math, and came to the conclusion that children were receiving far more ethylmercury than was realized.  Since there are no specific safety guidelines for ethylmercury, they used the next thing, the guidelines for methylmercury.  And according to these guidelines, the combined does that children were receiving was well over the safety limit.  As would be expected, panic ensued.  Two years later it was recommended that thimerosal be removed from vaccinations, and today most vaccines are thimerosal free. This was the first major battle in the autism-vaccine wars which continue to this day.  With that in mind, lets consider this paper.The authors start out by giving a brief history of mercury and its use in vaccinations. If you don't know the history then it is worth reading this paper for that alone. Just keep in mind where the authors are coming from and that they are glossing over some inconvenient details.The authors make the the point that the properties of ethylmercury were not understood in 2001 when the decision to remove it from vaccinations was made.  It was assumed that this form of mercury acted the same way that methlymercury.  However, subsequent research has shown that this assumption is not valid and that ethylmercury acts differently in the body than methylmercury.  As a result, our initial concerns were most likely unfounded and thimerosal in vaccines does not cause developmental disorders.The authors give three specific ways that ethylmercury differs from methlymercury :Ethylmercury clears from the body much faster than methylmercury.Ethylmercury does not deposit as much mercury in the brain as methylmercury.Ethylmercury decomposes much faster than methylmercury.The authors go into great detail for each reason, citing multiple studies and building a careful, rational argument for each of their points.  I am not going to talk about the underlying reasons as I think they are mostly correct - anyone who is interested can read the paper for themselves.I believe it likely that the paper is correct, ethylmercury acts differently in the body and is safer than methylmercury.  The available evidence does not support the idea that thimerosal alone can cause autism.However, at the same time, I don't think that the case is completely closed.  There are still unanswered questions and concerns that have not yet been addressed.First, even though it was recommended  in 2001 that thimerosal be removed from vaccinations, the existing stock of vaccinations were not recalled so were likely still used until exhausted.  This means that the exact removal date isn't know and that some children could have been still receiving these vaccinations in 2002 and maybe even early 2003.  Second, thimerosal is still used in some vaccinations, such as certain versions of the flu shot, so it has not been completely removed.  If you consider recent developments such as the swine flu shot, you will see it is still possible for a young child to get a sizable dose thimerosal (100 mcg over 30 days).Third, it is not enough to say that thimerosal is not as bad as another form of mercury.  It is still a form of mercury that has never had adequate safety testing (thimerosal vs placebo).  It should be completely removed from vaccines as it is still a toxic substance and there are safer alternatives available.Fourth, we don't yet have accurate data to tell us what is going on with the rate of autism in children born after thimerosal was removed.  The normal figures the CDC publishes looks at the prevalence of autism in 8 year old children.  This age was selected because it is thought that most children will be identified by this age and that the diagnosis is stable at this point.  The latest data available from the CDC is for children who were 8 in 2002.  So to be able to do an apples to apples comparison we are going to have to look at children who are 8 and have never received thimerosal.  If you look back to my first point, the first year we will be able to do this is 2009 (children born in 2001) although to be completely sure we will have to wait until 2011 or 2012 (children born in 2003 and later).  At the rate the CDC is publishing data we won't have enough information for another 6 years.Lastly, and most importantly, this research is talking about only one of the potential issues with vaccinations - thimerosal.  Even if you accept the fact that is isn't likely that thimerosal alone causes autism that does not automatically say that vaccines in general are safe or that there aren't other potential problems.  The bottom line is that there is still a lot of research to be done and until that research is done the autism vaccine wars will continue.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//1.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SrmRHcqkJ-I/AAAAAAAAADM/0cAcTUk5WG8/s1600-h/vac.png", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/121336", "http://www.springerlink.com/content/3398g44388158630/fulltext.pdf", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmercury", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylmercury", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal", "http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/07/business/fi-merck7"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/09/autism-vaccine-wars.html", "title": "\nThe Autism Vaccine Wars\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 22, 2010", "body": "\nThere must be something in the water or the stars must be out of alignment or some other cosmic shift happening this month, because it seems the closet elitists are coming out of the woodwork. \u00a0Last week it was Michael John Carley's I-don't-want-be-associated-with-people-who-wear-diapers as as well as a few\u00a0angry aspies rants against being labeled as having autism.\n\nThis week we have a less offense but still very wrong post by Dan Coulter. \u00a0Mr. Coulter is advocating for keeping the Aspergers label separate from autism, and while that might not be a bad idea, the reasons he is suggesting for doing so are not the best. \u00a0I have no reason to think that Mr. Coulter is being malicious or purposely inappropriate in what he is saying and yet he seems to have the some very wrong ideas.\n\nMr Coulter's reasons basically boil to down to the following two points -\nThe diagnosis can help determine whether or not individuals receive services -- and whether they receive the right services. For example, a broad diagnosis can encourage a school district to use a blanket approach for autistic children at very different levels of development. More specific diagnostic categories can help ensure we give each child the support he or she needs, such as intense social skills training, or speech therapy, or accommodations in a classroom.While he might be correct in general, he is really wrong on the details. \u00a0There is already a wide range of skills and abilities in just children with just an autism or PDD-NOS diagnosis. \u00a0They literally run the gamut from completely from children who are non-verbal, non-interactive (LFA) to one that can speak fluently and just have some social quirks (HFA) \u00a0- and everything in between. \u00a0As a result, most schools and service providers are already accustomed to\u00a0look at the skills of the individual and providing \u00a0the level of support that is needed.\n\nKeeping people with Aspergers where they are now - as part of the autism group - is not going to hurt. \u00a0And I suspect that if Aspergers because its own category, completely separate from autism, the available services would actually go down, not up. \n\nNo, I think that reason is a red herring and the real reason that\u00a0Mr. Coulter's objects is this one -\nAnd then there\u2019s the acceptance issue. We\u2019ve reached the point where society is becoming increasingly aware of Asperger Syndrome. That awareness has helped people explain their condition to families, friends and employers \u2013 and gain an acceptance many have yearned for all their lives. Before my wife and I went into business creating educational videos about Asperger Syndrome and autism, I worked in broadcasting and corporate public relations for more than 30 years. I know how hard it is to establish a brand and associate attributes to it. I\u2019d hate to give up the progress we\u2019ve made using the Asperger \u201cbrand.\u201d I\u2019d love to see other brands created that could help educate people about other forms of autism.To my mind, this is yet another way of saying that we shouldn't associated Aspergers with autism because it is a distinct condition - in Mr. Coulter's words a separate brand - and people with Aspergers don't want to be lumped in the same category as lower functioning people with autism. \u00a0Let them get their own brands, he suggests.\n\nWell, while Mr Coulter may feel it\u00a0would somehow be harmful to\u00a0dilute \"the brand\" by associating it with autism,\u00a0I would like to remind him that Aspergers is already considered a form of autism. \u00a0There might be an image that Aspergers means slightly quirky but super smart but that is just a myth (unless Mr. Coulter happens to believe his own marketing\u00a0propaganda). \u00a0People with Aspergers have autism as much as people with a label of autism or PDD-NOS (or Retts or CDD) do.\n\nBut don't take my word for it. \u00a0Go read what other people have to say about the difference between autism and Aspergers -\nAs simple background, according to the DSM-IV, the basic diagnostic distinction between autism and Asperger\u2019s disorder is absence of clinically significant delays in language, cognitive development, and adaptive functioning in the Asperger\u2019s group. The rest of the diagnostic criteria (impairments in social interactions, restricted repetitive and stereotype patterns of behaviors) between autism and Asperger\u2019s is identical.You may have the right idea, Mr. Coulter, but the way to help all people with autism is not to throw the lower functioning ones under the bus. \u00a0A medical disorder should never be viewed as a marketing brand.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.coultervideo.com/aspergerdiagnosischallenge.htm", "http://www.child-psych.org/2010/02/autism-and-aspergers-in-the-dsm-v-going-beyond-the-politics.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/another-week-another-rant-medical.html", "title": "\nAnother week, another rant - a medical condition is not a brand\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 31, 2010", "body": "\nIf you asked an expert today whether it is possible to recover from autism all you are going to get is a big fat question mark.  To date we have not been able to accurately determine exactly how many children and adults have autism let alone how many might have once had autism and recovered from it.\n\nBut maybe recovery from autism is more common that we thought.\n\nIf you remember, there was a big deal made out of what last summer's National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) had to say about autism.  According to that survey, autism was much more common that previously believed AND there were a significant number of children who once had a label of autism but no longer did.\n\nThe NSCH data was formalized in a paper in Pediatrics that said \"nearly 40% of those ever diagnosed with ASD did not currently have the condition\".\n\nResults from a survey can be misleading and the report in Pediatrics didn't draw any conclusions from the figure.  There was widespread talk on autism sites of what this figure meant with some people claiming that it showed recovery from autism while others were using it to show how flaky diagnosis could be.  I didn't really know what to make of it at the time.\n\nBut then a funny thing happened when I was looking at the data in the study I wrote about  yesterday.  This was a prevalence study done in the UK on a group of children that were born in 1990 and 1991 whose main point was that autism was much more common than previously thought.  As part of this study the researchers examined 112 children that had a diagnosis of autism and yet, after looking at their medical records and test results (ADOS, ADI-R, and others), 44 of the children had their label removed (this result was not stated directly but if you look at the data in the study you can arrive at the figure).  \n\nIn other words, 40% of the children in this second study had a confirmed medical diagnosis of autism but, years later, when the children were evaluated again, they no longer had a diagnosis.  \n\nThis study, published the year before the NSCH results, shows the same \"recovery\" rate (40%) and at the same time avoids the problems with the NSCH data.  The existing diagnosis for these children was confirmed and a new evaluation of the children was done by qualified professionals - this wasn't just a parent saying it was so like the NSCH survey.\n\nThe same result appearing in two different sets of children from two different countries using two different methods of discernment makes me wonder. \u00a0This result is also similar to the \"recover rate\" that has been demonstrated by ABA. \n\nI am starting to think that this figure is real and means something - I just don't know what.\n\nIt is completely possible that all this means is that a diagnosis of autism isn't reliable, that a huge number of children are given the label \"just in case\", or that the children receive the label just to access services (which don't exist in many areas).  Or it could just mean that I am misinterpreting the data from the second study.\n\nOr, just maybe, this result shows that it is possible for a child to recover from autism.\n\nJust food for thought.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh6.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SzquPxY0r7I/AAAAAAAAAJE/lIjQ9ZLdvZI/s1600/question.png", "http://www.nschdata.org/", "http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/124/5/1395"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/01/recovery-from-autism-40-two-sources.html", "title": "\nRecovery from autism 40% - two sources agree?\n"},
{"date": "Monday, July 12, 2010", "body": "\nOne thing that I am constantly reminded of when I read about autism is how very different autism looks in different people.  There are some at the extremely high end of the spectrum, who you would have a hard time telling apart from an average person, and then there are those are the extremely low functioning end, who have a hard time doing pretty much everything.  And then there is everybody in between.\n\nOne of the ways that we attempt to deal with this difference is by using functioning labels, as in that person is high-functioning or low-functioning.  Some people object to this use of labels but in general, it helps to give you an idea of what type of autism we are talking about.  I find it helps to remember that a person is not limited to being the label but rather is capable of functioning better (or worse) depending on the exact situation that we are talking about.\n\nThe important thing is that people who are high-functioning are very different from ones who are low-functioning and need very different things.  \n\nIt is my opinion that there are more children at the lower functioning side than the higher functioning side, and data from the CDC seems to bear this out.  According to the CDC, approximately 41% of children with autism have an IQ less than 70 which means that 41% of children with autism have an intellectual disability in addition to autism.  Also according to the CDC, about 40% of children with autism do not talk at all. There are other statistics available from a\u00a0variety of sources,\u00a0but as they are equally depressing, I am not going to point them out. \u00a0In general, children with an intellectual disability or who can't talk would be considered lower-functioning.\n\nOn the flip side you have adults with autism who are just slightly socially quirky and like to claim that autism gives them special intellectual gifts.  They also like to diagnosis important historical figures with autism and pretend it was their autism that made them important. \u00a0Or they like to serve on governmental committees and pontificate about what people with autism need.\n\nTo give a more concrete example, below is the difference between low and high functioning.\n\nFrom Astroturf, I mean \"The Thinking Person's Guide to Autism\" where \"informed decisions are made with love\", we have an adult talking about his Aspergers -\nWhen I was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome in 2003 at the age of 25, I had already pretty much given up hope of ever finding and getting a job that was right for me. All I had to show for my job skills was a high school diploma with a lousy grade average, and a few exams which I barely passed when I tried studying to become a school teacher and when I tried getting a bachelor degree in English at the university, neither of which I finished.You can read the rest at the link above.  It is pretty standard stuff from someone who didn't find out until they had a form of autism until later in life and whose main issues are social.\n\nOn the other side, we have this piece from the Center for Autism & Related Disorders (CARD), that talks about attempting to teach children how to deal with an unknown question - \nIn a recent study, Ingvarsson and Hollobaugh effectively taught four children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to use the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t know, please tell me\u201d in response to unknown questions. ...Two of the participants quickly learned the verbal response and were able to generalize the response across various questions. The other two participants required implementation of individualized behavioral techniques in order to learn and generalize the response.You are reading it right, there are children with autism who don't know what to do when asked an unknown question and have to be taught (and those are the ones that can talk). \u00a0Some researchers have figured out a way to teach children who would otherwise have no response to an unknown question what to do. \u00a0If you are\u00a0unfamiliar\u00a0with ABA and how it is used to teach children with autism, let me just say that this is a little bit of a feat. \n\nThe thing that jumps out at me is the difference between these two scenarios.  One one hand, we have someone who was able to function well enough to graduate high school and make an attempt at college but needed assistance finding and holding a job (which is, sadly, a common problem for a lot of high school graduates in this country). \u00a0But on the other hand\u00a0we have children who don't know how to respond to a simple question and need to be taught a canned response.\n\nBoth would have autism but both are extremely different from each other.\n\nAnd yet, one of these groups feels the need to speak on the behalf of the other and say what they do and don't need.  One of these groups feels they have the right to challenge what parents are attempting to do to help their children.  \n\nSo the next time you read something about autism, just remember - we aren't all talking about the same autism.  Your form of autism and what you need might be quite different than what my children need.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://lh6.ggpht.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/S1aCdtzVK9I/AAAAAAAAAJ8/uFCG5aajvfw/s1600/justice_scales.png", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html", "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/having-aspergers-does-not-make-me-less-of-a-person", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2010/06/being-employed-with-aspergers-syndrome.html", "http://centerforautism.blogspot.com/2010/06/teaching-children-with-autism-spectrum.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/07/autism-spectrum-dichotomy.html", "title": "\nThe Autism Spectrum Dichotomy\n"},

Surely the aspie pride movement, otherwise known as neurodiversity, is not so bad. They are not really advocating against treating or curing something that causes such hardships in children. \u00a0Sadly, I believe that there truly is a anti-treatment anti-cure mentality embedded in the whole notion of autism pride.  Here is a prime example that I ran across this afternoon.\n\nIn the Times Online yesterday there was an article yesterday that talked about a small, open label study of an oxytocin nasal spray that shows promise for treating autism.  After the 13 participants where given the nasal spray they \"rapidly became more open\", sociable, and trusting.   It will take many years and many studies to know whether this treatment will live up to the hype.  But, if it does, it will one of the first treatments that will directly address one of the three core problems of autism.\n\nThis would be a good thing.\n\nHowever, if you look in the comment section under the story, you run into this stinker -\nAs an individual with aspergers who has learned to cope well with the condition i doubt the need for a spray to conform individuals to societies standards. Many great thinkers (philosophers, mathematicians, chemists etc ..) have had autism spectrum disorders and their abilities may have been part of that same \"disorder\". you may try to fix autism, but i'd not want a cure...Statements like these are at the heart of the problem with aspie pride.  This is the attitude that causes someone to complain when Asperger's may be merged into the general autism category.  This gentleman claims the label of Asperger's but then he wants to change its meaning from the medical definition into a label that means he is a philosopher, mathematician, or chemist - possibly even the next Einstein.  He wants you to believe that he speaks for all people with autism when he claims that a treatment is not needed.\n\nYet it is clear that he and I are speaking of two very different autisms.  I am talking about the development disorder that causes children to fall drastically behind their peers in schools, takes away their ability to communicate and to socialize, and even causes them to hurt themselves.  He is using Asperger's as a shorthand way of saying \"I'm smarter than you are\".\n\nI can understand taking pride in yourself (it is called self-esteem).  I can understand taking pride in your accomplishments and overcoming difficulties.  I can even understand taking pride in being your own person and being \"different\" than other people around you. \u00a0But I cannot understand taking pride in a disorder that causes so many problems for so many people and at the same time dismissing the needs of those who are most profoundly affected.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article7026369.ece"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/dont-treat-me-bro.html", "title": "\nDon't treat me bro\n"},

I had thought that it would be some press release type of thing or some reiteration of what the foundation hoped to accomplish.   Or maybe even something about the first and only event that the foundation has sponsored.I was so very wrong.The first post on this new blog is an attack on Sharl Attkisson who is a reporter from CBS.  Ms Attkisson had recently reported on some of the potential problems with Risperal when it is used in the treatment of autism.  From the opening sentences of the post - Reporter Sharyl Attkisson has had some outrageous pieces on the CBS Evening News, but her story Sunday night about risperdal has to be the most desperate. Apparently ridiculing the life-saving value of vaccines is not enough, and she has now moved on to poo poo the only drug FDA approved for children with autism, because, tragically, a handful of children experienced a well known, but highly unfortunate side effect; increased level of the hormone prolactin.it was clear that this was going to be a fair, balanced, and most importantly, scientific retort to the information in the CBS report.  After all, isn't part of the mission of the foundation that they will adhere \"to rigorous scientific standards and values\"?  And what is a higher scientific value than calling a journalist names and calling their reporting \"desperate\" and \"outrageous\"?Oh wait, that doesn't sound right.I have to wonder if this post should be taken as an official statement from the ASF since they appear to have sanctioned this blog by linking to it from their site?  Or is this what it appears to be on its face - a personal rant written by Alison Singer, the founder of ASF.  Either way you slice it the ASF has PR problem in the making.

About 30 percent of Americans have the variant.\nSo there you have it, the new toys have been used and have decreed that people with this particular genetic variant are worse drivers. \u00a0It isn't something they can help, after all, its genetic. \n\nOnly, I have to wonder, can this really be the case? \u00a0I went and found the study that this article was based on but since I refuse to pay 36 dollars for something like this I am only going what the abstract says and the article on Science Daily.\n\nSo I ask myself, what does this gene\u00a0supposedly\u00a0do?\nThis gene variant limits the availability of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor during activity. BDNF keeps memory strong by supporting communication among brain cells and keeping them functioning optimally. When a person is engaged in a particular task, BDNF is secreted in the brain area connected with that activity to help the body respond.\nGot that? \u00a0A protein plays a role in in keeping memories strong by\u00a0strengthening the connections between brain cells. \u00a0This genetic variant is \"limits the availability\" of the protein which in turn might have an affect on memory which somehow translated into worse driving skills. \u00a0This result is already two thirds of the way to Kevin Bacon\n\nI have to wonder if the\u00a0researchers\u00a0have ever heard of the concept of confounding factors. \u00a0In a sample of 29 people, isn't it more likely that some (or maybe even most) of group are simply bad drivers?\n\nBut wait, it gets even better. The researchers even got to use one of the coolest new toys around, an\u00a0fMRI\u00a0\u00a0-\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning during right index finger movement (n = 24) identified activation in a broad sensorimotor network. However, subjects with the polymorphism showed smaller activation volume within several brain regions as compared with subjects without the polymorphism.\nSo remember, if your brain doesn't light up as much when you twitch your finger, you might have a genetic variant that makes you a bad driver. It couldn't be that being a bad driver makes you a bad driver, there always has to be a genetic reason nowadays.\n\nKids and their toys.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3197/3010563525_e0672f78eb_m_d.jpg", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/chemheritage/3010563525/", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091028134637.htm", "http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/bhp189", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/11/bad-science-might-be-genetic.html", "title": "\nBad science might be genetic\n"},

Asperger's is already considered to be part of the \"autism spectrum\" as it is listed in the DSM IV under the \"Pervasive developmental disorder\" category.  All the massive change in the proposed DSM V does is eliminate the individual labels (PDD-NOS, autism, childhood disintegrative disorder, asperger syndrome) and lump them all together into the \"autism\" category. \u00a0The only people who don't consider Asperger's to be autism are the very people who are the people who are complaining about it being put there.\n\n\u00a0Did I mention that these are the same people who like to pretend that they speak for all people with autism?\n\nHypocrites.\n\nOver in neurodiversity land, the revelation that some (cough, most, cough) of their congregation of aspies feel this way about the \"low functioning\" people with autism (aka the majority of people with a diagnosis of autism) has resulted in a \"oh shit\" moment.\u00a0 \n\nKev over at Left Brain Right Brain put it nicely -\nThere really were, I realised to my dawning amazement, people with an Aspergers diagnosis who were upset at the possibility of the DSM (V) placing them inside an overall category of \u2018autism\u2019.

It isn't just that your child can misbehave or have meltdowns (as can any child) but rather the constant looks that you get as your child stims or does other things that are out of the ordinary.\u00a0\u00a0Even on the good days, it can be very wearing to have your parenting skills constantly called into question by looks and words.\n\nThen there are the days that aren't so good.  Days where, despite your (and your child's) best efforts, things don't go as well as you would like.  If you are lucky, you will find yourself in a situation that you can exit quickly.  If you are not lucky, well, it can get very ugly.  \n\nBut as I said, if you have a child who has autism, you already know and understand this very well.  And chances are, if you see another child doing something strange in public, you are not as quick to judge.\n\nUnfortunately, most people are not quite so understanding.  There have been many examples latest such as mothers getting kicked off planes or being ordered out of restaurants that demonstrate that even moderate behaviors are not well tolerated by the general public.\n\nThese are not isolated incidents.  But more importantly, if you look at the sort of comments that these stories gather, they are mostly of the \"bad parent\" sort where the children's misbehavior is not blamed on the autism but rather is blamed on bad parenting skills.\n\nBut such is life when your children have autism.  Most people are simply not going to be able to understand what it is like until they have experienced autism first hand.  The good (and bad) news is that, at the rate autism is growing, there is going to be a lot of understanding going around in the decades to come.\n\nWhat is completed unexpected, at least to me, is when the people who should know better don't get the point and join the general chorus in blaming the parents.  I am talked about the \"aspies\" who claim to have a form of autism and yet seem to be unable to understand the difficulties that it can cause.\n\nTake for example this thread on wrong planet where the poster is complaining about the actions of a father -\nSome Dad came back with his son, and asked if we could refill his cup of ice cream cause he dropped it.Now, actually we have to, or else they'll complain, but we gotta push the illusion that we won't, or they'll all be irresponsible...at least more so than they already are.Anyway, the guy said \"sorry about that; my son's Autistic\".Right there...I wanted to smack both him and his son. His son looked to be about 12 years old; and no, for those wondering, he was in no way low functioning; he was at the functioning level I was at age 12; definitely HFA.Now, I know we have lousy coordination skills, but geez....he couldn't hold a freakin' cup of ice cream? And he had to use Autism as the reason for it?I found that very insulting; and no, I didn't say \"so am I\"..it wouldn't have been professional.\u00a0Now, does any parent out there have a problem picturing what happened?  \n\nThe child knocked over his ice cream cone - most likely due to some restricted pattern that they do - and the father, who has had to endure countless dirty looks, decides to skip all of the verbal jabs and says flat out, \"sorry about that, my son's autistic\".  \n\nMost people on the other end of that comment will realize that the father is basically acknowledging that he doesn't want to be asking for another ice cream cone and the situation isn't what he would like.  Most people would realize that this is a short way of saying that there are other issues here and that he is doing the best he can to deal with a bad situation.\n\nIf you have children with autism you know how these things happen.  \n\nMy children are (almost) always well behaved in public.  But if we run across a store that sells rubber ducks or flowers or if a cup of water gets spilled, look out, it can get ugly (if we ever go into a flower shop that sells rubber ducks and a bucket of water spills on the floor the world just might come to an end).  \n\nWe know that our children don't want to act out in this way but that they can't always help it.  So we go out of our way to avoid these situations.  But sometimes, things happen that are out of our control and then there are issues.  This is where it would be nice for there to be some acceptance and understanding that there are are issues that we are trying to work through - issues that are directly caused by autism.\n\nBut this gentleman on wrong planet, an adult who says he has a form of autism, he has no understanding nor any acceptance.  He takes one look at the situation and judges that the problem isn't the child's autism.  He seems to feel that autism is being unfairly blamed to cover the father's poor parenting skills.  And for that matter, most of the other people commenting on the thread seem to feel the same way.  There are a few voices of reason, but for the most part the comments are hostile to the father.\n\nWhere is the understanding of the problems that autism can cause?  Where is the acceptance?  \n\nI am used to \"typical\" people jumping to these sorts of conclusion as they simply don't understand but I would have thought that \"aspies\" would know better.\n\nI guess I was wrong.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_julieshealthclub/2008/06/autistic-toddle.html", "http://www.wistv.com/Global/story.asp?S=8663266", "http://www.wrongplanet.net/postxf120520-0-30.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/03/do-aspies-understand-autism.html", "title": "\nDo aspies understand autism?\n"},

Brian Deer might be holding onto the names, medical records, and family histories for the 12 children involved in Dr Wakefield's now-retracted study.\n\nIf you look at the \"rapid responses\" left to an opinion article published in the BMJ, you will see a response left by an individual calling themselves Brian Deer that says (in part) - \nI know the names and family backgrounds of all 12 of the children enrolled in the study, including the child enrolled from the United States.I think it likely that this comment was left by the real Brian Deer as he does leave comments in random places and a story about Dr Wakefield is sure to attract his attention.  Furthermore, if you happened to read some of the stories\u00a0written by Mr Deer about a year ago for the Times Online, you would be able to see that he does seem to have details of at least some of the participants in the study.\n\nSo, assuming the claim is true and Brian Deer has the names, medical charts, and family histories for all of the children in the study, what does that mean?\n\nIf it was my child whose privacy had been violated, I would not be happy. \u00a0I would be even less happy that it was a journalist like Brian Deer that had my child's records.\n\nI know that in the US, it would be illegal for Mr Deer to have, much less retain, the information unless it was given directly to him by the families or the families agreed to release it to him.

Mr Doherty asked the following question -\nMr. Robison do you feel that as a very high functioning person with an Asperger\u2019s diagnosis you have any particular insight to offer on behalf of very low functioning persons with severe Autistic Disorder or should the persons who actually care for them and have legal guardianship speak on their behalf?Mt Robison responded with  - \nI guess I\u2019d counter with a question of my own. What makes you think a person who cares for a disabled autistic person is better qualified to speak on their behalf than me, a high functioning autistic individual?Caretakers all too often have their own agendas at odds with the people they supposedly care for. They want to read a paper; their charge wants to keep practicing. There is always the temptation to do what\u2019s easiest for the caretaker rather than what\u2019s best for the care-taken person.There are so many cases of caretakers abusing or neglecting their charges and forcing unwanted therapies on disabled people that I would not be so quick to assume caregivers should have the exclusive right to speak on behalf of the disabled.That said, I know there are many loving caretakers out there who are truly in tune with what their disabled charges want and need. I would give considerable weight to their opinions if I were in a situation where that was appropriate.There was more to the exchange, click on the links above to read the full comments.\n\nMr Doherty has responded to the comment on his site, but since the comment was directed at parents in general, I thought I would add in my two cents worth. \u00a0I posted the following response on the Autism Speaks blog but, as I don't expect them to actually publish it, I am including it below.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nMr Robison,\n\nI think you mean well but your statements concerning caretakers of children with autism are completely out of line.  As the father of three daughters who have to deal with autism, I can assure you that I am far better equipped to speak for their needs than you are.  \n\nI have spent untold hours working with them and helping them learn to communicate with the world around them.  I have worked with their doctors and therapists to tailor their treatments to meet their specific needs.  I have spent many sleepless nights reading the latest research on autism, searching for information that might help me better understand them or might suggest a new treatment that would help them better cope with the world.  \n\nI know many parents who do the same.\n\nAutism is a disorder that encompasses a large range of functioning.  From watching my twin daughters, I know that even identical twins can have different challenges from autism and the symptoms of their autism can be quite different.  No two people with autism are the same, so the issues you have may or may not be relevant to all people with autism.\n\nYou don't know my children's name or any details about what their specific difficulties are.  Yet you think that you, a complete stranger, might be better able to speak for my daughters needs that I would? \n\nI find your assumptions that we caretakers \"often have our own agendas\" and the implication that we are selfish and take the easy way out to be insulting in the extreme.  As most parents would tell you, we as a group will go to almost any length to help our children.  Many of us completely rearrange and refocus our lives in an attempt to provide a better environment and future for our children.  I don't think that we parents deserve any special thanks because this is what every parent should be expected to do for any child of theirs.  \n\nBut we most certainly do not deserve to be called selfish or told that we don't do what is in the best interest of our children.  I think you owe parents an apology.  I suggest that you raise your awareness of exactly what parents do for their children because you do not seem to understand.  If you did you would be working with us rather than calling us names.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/03/09/robison/", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2010/03/autism-speaks-welcomes-to-its-board.html", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/03/09/robison/comment-page-1/#comment-1828", "http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2010/03/09/robison/comment-page-1/#comment-1879", "http://autisminnb.blogspot.com/2010/03/autism-speaks-welcomes-to-its-board.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/03/john-elder-robison-owes-parents-apology.html", "title": "\nJohn Elder Robison owes parents an apology\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, February 21, 2010", "body": "\nOne of the many unanswered questions about autism is whether autism is something that a person is born with or whether it is something that happens or develops later.  There are currently a few theories about how autism is thought to develop -\n\nEarly onset - A child is born with autism and shows subtle signs of it almost from birth.  These differences grow over time until the child is noticeably different from \"typical\" children.  It is thought that most people with autism fall into this category.\n\nRegression - A child appears to be developing normally for the first year or two but then has a period where they regress and lose previously acquired skills and become different from other children.\n\nPlateau - A child develops normally, without any early signs of autism or regressions, until they hit a certain point.  After this point, they simply simply fail to develop new skills and stop developing normally (i.e. hits a plateau in their development)\n\nThat's where a new study, published online this month in the Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, comes in.  This is one of the first studies to follow children and watch which ones develop autism rather than look at which ones developed autism after the fact.  \n\nThe text of the study is freely available, so if you are interested in the topic I suggest you read it for yourself.\n\nThe children included in this study were selected from a larger, ongoing study of infant siblings of children with autism.  For this study, researchers selected 25 children who developed autism and 25 that did not.  These children came either from a high risk group (sibling had autism) or a low risk group (no siblings with any developmental disorders).  Of the 25 children with autism, 22 came from from the high risk group.\n\nEach of these children was evaluated at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months using a variety of tests.  The results of the tests were compared to each other and found to be in agreement.  Overall, the researchers did a good job getting an accurate picture of how these children developed and what skills they had at each point in time.\n\nThe results of the study were interesting, to say the least.  \n\nThe most important finding was that the children who went on to develop autism were no different from the other children at 6 months.  And even more than that, these children seemed to be slightly more social than the other children at 6 months (although this result is not scientifically significant).\n\nFor the next 12+ months, the development of children in the autism group slowed down and they failed to keep up with the development of their peers.  But more importantly, most of the children showed loss of skills - as in they regressed.  In what could be considered a silver lining, the children did not show losses of cognitive ability or language skills as the losses appeared to be of social communication skills area.  \n\nThe second important part of this study is that most of the parents (83%) did not pick up on these regressions.  Keep in mind that these are mostly parent who already had a child with autism and, as such, would be familiar with what autism looks like.  It is likely that they would be watching very closely for signs of autism in their younger children.  This finding, if confirmed, means that parents frequently miss subtle regressions and signs of autism in their children.\n\nThe result of these findings is that our models of how autism develop may be wrong.  Autism may not be present from birth in the majority of cases and might start developing sooner than we think and involve more regressions.\n\nThe researchers proposed a new theory whereby the symptoms of autism are not prevent at birth but rather appear over a length of time.  Under this theory, most children have regressions but it is the timing and severity of the regressions that give the impressions of different models of onset.  If the regressions happen early enough they are much harder do detect and make it seem like the symptoms have always been there.  If they happen late enough, the results are much more drastic and noticeable and make it seem like it appeared out of the blue.  \n\nI think it is important to remember that this is just one study, and a smaller one at that.  While the researchers appear to have been very careful these results are still going to need to be confirmed.\n\nBut, if the researchers are correct, autism may develop differently than we think.\n\nA Prospective Study of the Emergence of Early Behavioral Signs of Autism\nSally Ozonoff, Ana-Maria Iosif, Fam Baguio, Ian C.

{"date": "Monday, October 26, 2009", "body": "\n\nJabberwocky (noun)\nNonsensical speech or writing\n\nI think this one word sums up quite nicely where the once interesting site Left Brain Right Brain is heading. \u00a0I may not have agreed with much of what they have said but at least they were able make their points clearly and intelligently.  But lately, clarity and intelligence seem to be heading out the window to be replaced with dogma, nonsense, and mean-spiritedness.\n\nConsider the recent\u00a0anonymous\u00a0stalking of the mother whose child has autism. \u00a0I don't like to resort to name calling but I have no other words to describe this post where some pathetic person calling themselves \"Guest Blogger\"\u00a0vomited\u00a0years worth of hatred towards a mother simply because she was trying everything she could to help her child. \u00a0You may agree or disagree with what this mother did but you do not do what this \"Guest Blogger\". \u00a0You do not stalk a person online for years and then publish their correspondence to e-mail lists on a blog, out of context, and then hold them up for public ridicule. \n\nThis post represents mean-spiritedness at its worst and illustrates quite clearly the divide in the autism community. \u00a0I think it also shows how far Left Brain Right Brain has sunk. \n\nMoving out of the slime pit, we come to a series of posts that are an attempt to analyze the recent\u00a0NSCH data. \u00a0If you want a case study in how to do a poor job analyzing data, these posts are it. \u00a0In them we are treated to direct comparisons of prevalence to incidence,\u00a0miss use\u00a0of survey data, and a distortion of the meaning of time. \u00a0I took the time to\u00a0debunk one of the posts but I didn't bother to address the others; it was too much like playing whac-a-mole\u00a0(but without the fun). \n\nBut, I have to say that my favorite was the last one that looked at the \"recovered\" group in the NSCH data. \u00a0The group refers to the children who once had a label of autism but no longer do. \u00a0If you look at the number of this group compared to the total number of children who had autism and you end up with a controversial figure that has been dubbed the \"recovery rate\". \u00a0Some groups claim that is shows that children can be recovered from autism while others, like LBRB, say that the whole thing is just nonsense.\n\nHowever, the only\u00a0definitive\u00a0nonsense is the analysis on LBRB. \u00a0Here the writers on LBRB apparently seem unable to\u00a0distinguish\u00a0between a child's birth year and the linear progression of time. \u00a0The result is a claim that this \"recovery rate\" is going down \"with time\". \u00a0Yet, if you look at the helpful graph on the page what you will see if that this \"recovery rate\" isn't going down with time, it is going down with the child's age. \u00a0Or to put it another way, the older the child, the higher the chance that they will be \"recovered\". \u00a0Since children tend to age from younger to older and since a hypothetical recovery would take time, I would have to conclude that the data actually says the opposite of what the writers claim.\n\nGood thing LBRB didn't let a little thing like reality get in the way of a good story.\n\nAnyway, moving forward in time (real time, not child birth years), we come to the latest of the absurdities, the posts about the IACC.\n\nFirst up, we have the top seven mistakes\u00a0that were made in the\u00a0Dr. Landis issue. \u00a0Strangely absent from this list of mistakes is\u00a0Dr. Landis writing down inappropriate comments in the first place. \u00a0Call me silly, but I think that was the first, largest, and most important mistake made in the whole mess. \u00a0If you are going to write trash about someone, you really should make sure that the trashee doesn't find out about it or read it online.\n\nBut, apparently writing the comments down was just fine with the rational people at LBRB. \u00a0According to them, the problem was that Dr. Landis was careless with her notes AND she should have stood up for her right to imply that her committee college was distorting the work of the IACC for their own personal ends.\n\nThat would have been a great way to rebuild the missing trust in the autism community.\n\nThe other beef that LBRB had?\u00a0\u00a0That \"Age of Autism decided that a surprise attack was more important that gathering all the facts and published the blog piece without comment from Dr. Landis.\"\n\nI have to wonder if they gave the mother that they attacked the same courtesy?\n\nNext, we have a call to \"stop the intimidation tactics towards the IACC\". \u00a0The arguments in this post get a little strange, but I think the main point is that\u00a0criticizing\u00a0the actions of members of the IACC should not be allowed. \u00a0I am not sure how this is intimidation, as far as I can see their are are threats or midnight visits to peoples houses. \u00a0No one has been kidnapped nor is their any blackmail. \u00a0But there has been (gasp) calls for a congressional investigation, a lawsuit, disagreements about research, and calls for committee members to resign. \n\nIn other words, politics as usual for this country. \n\nThe primary target of the post, here again, is Age of Autism. \u00a0Did you know that Age of Autism is apparently a cabal that represent all of those \"anti-vaccine\" groups. \u00a0Don't they know that they lost the autism omnibus and that less families are filing claims in vaccine court? \n\nWait, that didn't make any sense, but then again, neither did the post.\n\nFinally, we have the declaration of war that has apparently been made against Tom Insel and the IACC by those \"anti-vaccine\" groups. \u00a0You know, the \"anti-vaccine\" cabal headed by Age of Autism. \u00a0They have their \"friendly forces\" which must mean it is an all out war against the IACC (no, the original post didn't make any sense either). \n\nSo, how was the war started, what was the shot heard around the world? \u00a0Simple, Age of Autism ran a post that called for Dr Insel to resign.\n\nYou know, there ought to be a law preventing just anyone from voicing their opinion about their government. \u00a0Maybe at the very least a\u00a0questionnaire\u00a0that asks something like \"have you, or anyone you know, ever questioned the safety and effectiveness of vaccines\". \u00a0If they answer yes, then by all means, prevent them from speaking or writing anything online, they could be dangerous.\n\nI have to wonder when it became unacceptable to question the status quo. \u00a0I also have to wonder why anyone who questions the party lines of \"autism is genetic\" and \"there is no epidemic of autism\" suddenly gets labeled as \"anti-vaccine\". \u00a0It must be all of the open mindedness.\n\nAnyway, it took just two days in LBRB time \u00a0for the \"intimidation\" to become an all-out \"war\" against the IACC. \u00a0I know that time moves faster on the internet, but I would have at least thought there might have been some posturing, chest thumping, or skirmishes between the two groups. \n\nThen again, is\u00a0it even possible for a small group of private citizens to intimidate a government committee, let alone declare war on it? \u00a0I think the only war here is Left Brain Right Brain's war on reality.\n\nBut seriously, Left Brain Right Brain used to be a good site, even if only to act as a counter point in the ever-present autism-vaccines debate. \u00a0You can never get any closer to the understanding something if all you have to compare notes against are people who agree with you.\n\nLeft Brain Right Brain, may it rest in peace.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//4.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/SuZliAO_XGI/AAAAAAAAAFc/slKqD7F3ZGc/s1600-h/jabberwocky.jpg", "http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=3144",

{"date": "Monday, May 25, 2009", "body": "\nAccording to an article at Science Daily children who receive the flu shot might have up to three times the risk of hospitalization for the flu.  The article talks about a cohort study of influenza performed at the Mayo Clinic that looked at 263 children who were seen at the clinic with laboratory-confirmed influenza between 1996 and 2006.   The study verified who had received the flu vaccine and who had not and determined that children who received the flu vaccine had three times the risk of hospitalization when compared to those who had not.I have not been able to find the original source of the study but it was supposed to be presented at the 105th International Conference of the American Thoracic Society.  After reading this article I started to wonder at how well the flu shot works in general, so I went looking for some information.  What I found made me wonder at why it is pushed so much.First a little background - there are currently two styles of flu vaccines on the market now.  The first is a the flu \"shot\" made from inactivated (killed) virus that you get via an injection at a doctors office or some other clinic.  The second is a nasal spray that contains an attenuated (live weakened) viruses.  This second form is a more recent development that is not as widespread yet.I am going to be talking about the first form only - the traditional flu shot.So lets start with the first problem - the flu shot is one of the few types of vaccinations that still contains thimerosal (ie mercury).  If you don't know why that could be a problem just google autism and mercury and prepare to wade into a holy war.  The short version is that this preservative isn't a good idea and while there are no \"proven\" health problems associated with it there is no reason for it to still be there.  The good news is that thimerosal free versions are available but you have to ask for them.The second problem is that the flu shot isn't that good at preventing the flu.  According to the (most likely over-optimistic) CDC the flu vaccine can prevent 66% of cases of influenza in young children.  But the effectiveness of the shot can vary from year to year based on how well the the shot is matched to the strains of flu that are active that year.I also looked for published research detailing how well the flu vaccine worked in children and found a mixed bag.  Some research agrees with the 66% that the CDC says while some does not.  I was particularly struck by this meta study published in Lancet in 2005 that found that the effectiveness of the vaccine in children older than 2 was about 38% but in children under two performed no better than a placebo.So at worst the shot may have no little or no real effect and may lead to a greater risk of hospitalization but at best could have a better than 66% chance of preventing the flu.As I have written about before I am a little leery about this shot because the one time that my twins received this shot they seemed to develop the flu shortly afterwards closing followed by their regression into autism.So, is the flu shot a good idea for kids?  I think the answer is a definite maybe.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090519172045.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/FLU/protect/keyfacts.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/FLU/PROFESSIONALS/VACCINATION/effectivenessqa.htm", "http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivity.htm", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081103084111.htm", "http://journals.lww.com/pidj/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2007&issue=02000&article=00002&type=abstract", "http://journals.lww.com/pidj/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2007&issue=02000&article=00002&type=abstract"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/05/is-flu-shot-good-idea-for-kids.html", "title": "\nIs the Flu Shot a good idea for kids?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, June 24, 2009", "body": "\nEarlier this week on the Huffington Post there was an the second in a series of articles written by Dr. Harvey Karp about vaccinations.  The good doctor's basic point is that that vaccines are \"very safe - and super important\" and that there is no need to do more research into the subject.Unfortunately the posts are filled with the same old arguments, the same old misinformation, and the same old \"we know what is best\" attitude.Take for example the tired old line that just because some children regress into autism immediately following being vaccinated that doesn't mean the shot had anything to do with it.  It is certainly true that just because autism follows a shot that doesn't necessarily mean that there is a relation BUT that doesn't mean by default that any relation is \"just a coincidence\".    As a matter of fact, some injuries are assumed to be caused by shots if they happen within a certain amount of time after the shot is given - at least according to the Vaccine Injury Table from the vaccine court.Maybe instead of trying to find a relation in the entire population the approach should be to start with the subgroup who regress immediately following a shot and see if there is anything different about this group ?Then there is the \"asked and answered\" style argument that says that \"to date, dozens of studies -- examining over 1 million children -- have failed to find any credible association between shots and autism...none!\".  This line of reasoning completely ignores the fact that there has been no large scale study that compares vaccinated to unvaccinated children to see if there is a greater risk of problems such as autism in vaccinated children - and if you are looking to see if one thing (vaccines) are causing another (autism) you really need to compare the rates between the groups exposed (vaccinated) and unexposed (unvaccinated).  It would be like saying smoking can't cause cancer because you compared people who smoking 1 pack a day against those who smoke 3 packs and found no difference in cancel between the two groups.  Yet when you compare smokers to non-smokers the relation becomes apparent.  If we applied this same argument to other aspects of autism research then we should also stop searching for genetic causes of autism because hundreds of studies examining a huge number of children have failed to turn up any significant association.  Yet, because \"science\" is convinced there is a relation (mostly on the basis of twin studies), the investigation continues. Finally there is the misinformation and failure to mention certain uncomfortable facts.  For instance, Dr. Karp makes a point of how much better the shots of today are when compared to earlier shots -For example, in 1980, the DPT shot (Diphtheria/Pertussis/Tetanus) was made from a soup of blendarized bacteria (over 1000 different illness particles - antigens - all mixed together). And, the polio vaccine had live virus that actually protected children by triggering a minute case of...polio! Today, our modern DPT vaccine is highly purified, containing only 3-5 bacterial antigens and the polio shot has absolutely no live virus.But he seems to forget to the mention that the DPT shot of the 1980s had some unfortunate and all to common side-effects, such as seizures and death, and was the reason that the Vaccine Court was created.  If you look at the statics published by the court you can see this shot (listed under the heading DTP) has more claims awarded than all of the other vaccines combined.And the live virus polio vaccine?  It is still used in other countries and is actually responsible for outbreaks of polio.  As for the scary \"live virus\" part - the most recent (and most effective) version of the flu shot is the same thing, a live virus.So if these two shots are the basis for comparison then Dr. Karp is right - the modern cousins to these two look pretty good in relation - but that is only because the point of comparison is so bad.However, I think the most disturbing idea that Dr. Karp puts forth that is that shots are a civic duty - that you have a obligation to inject your child because it is your responsibility to your neighbors children and society as a whole.  This concept that we have to force the most vulnerable members of our society to undergo precautionary medical treatments that have the very real chance of causing them permanent injury just to possibly protect our neighbor's children is just plain scary.What's next, trying to throw parents in jail for not vaccinating?  Oh wait, that already happened.As I have said before, the core of the current problem is a lack of trust.  There are an increasing number of parents who do not trust the medical community when they talk about vaccinations and articles like these by Dr Karp are part of the reason.    It is long past time for this issue to be put to bed.  We know that there are some small number of  children who regress after getting vaccinations so the question isn't can this happen but why it happens.  Answering this question is not going to be easy but if the medical community wants to regain the lost trust, they are going to have to find the answer.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harvey-karp/cracking-the-autism-riddl_b_219160.html", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harvey-karp/cracking-the-autism-riddl_b_213730.html", "http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/table.htm", "http://www.albionmonitor.com/free2/dpt.html", "http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/statistics_report.htm#claims_filed", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine#Iatrogenic_.28vaccine-induced.29_polio", "http://www.naturalnews.com/022242.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2009/05/contradictory-rulings-in-vaccine-court.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/06/repeating-something-does-not-make-it.html", "title": "\nRepeating something does not make it true\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2009", "body": "\nThere was an article that was published Monday on Salon by Elizabeth Svoboda that deals with neurodiverity. \u00a0All in all if was mostly balanced account presenting an accurate view of what the some of the debates \u00a0and issue surrounding this concept are about. \u00a0I think it was a little too kind to the neurodiverse side but I don't think that will come as a surprise to anyone who has read some of my prior posts.The article is well enough written that I can't really add anything to it - not unless I wanted to highlight how poor my writing skills are in comparison.Definitely\u00a0worth reading so go read it.If you paid attention while you were reading you came across the name\u00a0Michelle Dawson. \u00a0You may have missed it if you blinked, so here is the part that refers to her -If autistic-rights advocates win their court battles, many treatment programs could stop receiving government money. In 2004, for instance, autistic-rights crusader Michelle Dawson convinced the Canadian Supreme Court to overturn an appeal that would have provided state funding for ABA therapy.There is approximately one line in there that references her directly - a little over 20 words. \u00a0Ms Dawson apparently found this statement to be offensive and\u00a0written a rebuttal letter that is posted on her blog. \u00a0To rebut 20 words she has written, well I stopped counting after the first page.She starts with a \"falsely characterized\" followed by a \"I was never interviewed' and \"I am not a crusader\". \u00a0She goes on to review what she feels her role in the Canadian court case was and to reiterate that she is not part of neurodiversity or any other movement - she is apparently a movement all of her own. \u00a0She then goes on to describe her moment in three simple points - those point are a topic for another day.In closing she ends with -The standards currently applied to autistics are such that you are free to misrepresent me, and major legal decisions and issues, and so on, all you want. There's nothing I can do except put accurate information on the record, again, even though it has been here all along, for anyone who takes autism seriously. I am not sure what autism has to do with the feeling that a journalist has misrepresented you - I thought that could \u00a0pretty much happen to everyone. \u00a0I am also not sure why she felt the need to write a lengthy letter over one sentence. \u00a0Perhaps she was feeling left out of the debate since she views herself as a side of her own. \u00a0But since the article was about neurodiversity, a movement she proclaimers herself to not be part of, I don't see what the problem is. \u00a0I was not interviewed for the article nor was I quoted (not that I have any reason to think I should have been or anything to add to the discussion) so should I be upset about that?\u00a0I think the real problem here is that Ms Dawson really, really doesn't like to be called a crusader and tends to overreact when that word is used.\u00a0The truth can do that to a person.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/27/autistic_culture/print.html", "http://autismcrisis.blogspot.com/2009/04/elizabeth-svobodas-autism-culture.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/04/pssst-she-doesnt-like-being-called.html", "title": "\nPssst - she doesn't like being called a \"crusader\"\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 24, 2010", "body": "\nThere is a common line of thought in some quarters that children with autism will improve naturally on their own, with or without treatment, and that parents have an unfortunate\u00a0tendency\u00a0to credit improvements to treatments when it is really just the child's natural growth. \u00a0Take for example this\u00a0instant classic -\nMost likely, your child has improved, because autistic children will learn and grow anyway, just as other children learn and grow, though on their own schedule. You might even credit the treatment you've chosen, and write a glowing testimonial to persuade other parents. This will give you the satisfaction of having found \"the answer\", and assuage the sinking feeling in the back of your mind that you've just been played for a sucker.In one sense, this idea is true. \u00a0A child with autism, like every other child, will continue to grow and learn on their own, with or without help. \u00a0The problem is that while these children will grow on their own, they are starting off at huge disadvantage when compared to their peers. \u00a0Even if they naturally grow at the same pace as other children they are going to continue to be behind where they should be.\n\nBut the problem runs deeper than that. \u00a0Children with autism don't grow and learn as fast as their peers. \n\nAs I wrote about a few days ago, children with autism show a slower rate of growth then their peers. \u00a0When you combine this slower growth with the fact that children with autism start out at a disadvantage what you are left with is a child that can fall further and further behind their peers and will need extra help to narrow the gap.\n\nOr in other words, it is unlikely that a child with autism will grow far enough, fast enough to catch up to where they need to be, even under ideal circumstances. \u00a0Autism is, after all, a disorder of normal development. \n\nYou then have to ask yourself - do you want to help children with autism catch up or not? \n\nI am not talking about the quirky behaviors of older people with autism or accepting the differences that autism causes or correcting the biological imbalances that children with autism show. \u00a0All of that is important,\u00a0but I am talking about the basic skills that every child needs to know. \u00a0Skills such as listening, talking, dressing, counting, reading, and understanding directions - all of these basic skills (and many more) can be -and typically are - impaired in children with autism.\n\nIf you decide to help teach these children the skills that they need to learn\u00a0(and you should)\u00a0, you are going to needs a set of tools to use and plan for how to use them. \u00a0Right now, some of the best tools that we have for teaching children with autism are speech therapy, OT, and behavioral analysis based treatments (ABA). \u00a0 \u00a0Research has consistently shown that these tools are generally an effective way of of helping children acquire the skills that they lack and hopeful help them to catch up to their peers.\n\nBut how do we know that a specific treatment is responsible for the improvements rather than natural learning and growth? \u00a0The simple answer is that you can't know - either way you slice it. \u00a0If our children were perfect little lab experiments we could repeat the early years with or without the therapy and compare the results. \u00a0But they aren't and so there are no do-overs - you have to make the best choice you can with the limited information that is available.\n\nThe good news is that this is the sort of question that evidence based medicine is equipped to answer. \u00a0And while the question of what autism is or how it can be best treated is still up in the air, there is a large body of work that suggests that these therapies for autism are effective at teaching children with autism and improving their outcome.\n\nBut don't take my word for it. \u00a0Perhaps you should go see what the CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Institute of Health, Autism Speaks, and the Autism Science Foundation have to say about it (just to name a few).\n\nBe a good parent and don't listen to people like the one I quoted above. \u00a0Give\u00a0your child with autism the help they need to reach their potential, they are going to need all of the help they can get if they are to get past the\u00a0debilitating effects of autism.\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://cometscorner-clay.blogspot.com/2010/02/uncharted-territory-of-autism.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/treatment.html", "http://www.aap.org/healthtopics/autism.cfm", "http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/asd.cfm", "http://www.autismspeaks.org/treatment/index.php", "http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org/aboutautism.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2010/02/children-with-autism-can-and-should-be.html", "title": "\nChildren with autism can (and should) be helped\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 21, 2009", "body": "\n\nPhoto Courtesy of U.S. Army\nDr. Thomas Insel is the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health as well as the chair of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC). \u00a0These two roles put him in a key position \u00a0to dictate the direction of autism research for the\u00a0foreseeable\u00a0future and to determine how federal funds are spent in this country. \u00a0Given what the success he has achieved, I have to assume that he is an intelligent person and is\u00a0knowledgeable about mental health issues.\n\nBut I have to wonder at some his actions relating to autism. \u00a0Consider the following.\n\nFirst is the matter of the public members of the IACC. \u00a0The IACC holds\u00a0tremendous\u00a0power to set the agenda for autism research for the\u00a0foreseeable\u00a0future. \u00a0It is composed of 12 representative from federal agencies and six members for the public at large. \u00a0Because of what is at stake, every autism organization, large and small, \u00a0 wanted a seat on this committee. \u00a0Or to put it in a nutshell, these seats are very important as such should be given to those who are extremely\u00a0knowledgeable about autism and would be able to make a strong\u00a0contribution.\n\nYet, if you look at the public members, one of them stands out -\u00a0Christine McKee. \u00a0Now, I do not have any first hand knowledge of this person or their qualifications but she does not appear to be associated with any major autism organization. \u00a0The only things I know about her comes from\u00a0the IACC press release\u00a0announcing the committee members -\nChristine McKee, J.D., has developed and manages an in-home therapy for her autistic child, creating and/or assembling all of the therapy related materials. \u00a0Ms. McKee participates in monthly consultations with a Board Certified Behavior Analyst/Speech Pathologist. \u00a0She applies the therapeutic measures in her daily parenting and childcare routines.\nThis sounds like a description of every parent whose child has autism. \u00a0While I know first hand that this is not an easy job to do, how does this qualify her for a seat of the IACC? \u00a0Is she supposed to represent the view of the \"typical\" parent-advocate, if there even is such a thing? \u00a0How was Ms. McKee selected for this seat?\n\nI believe the answer is that Ms McKee is Dr. Insel's neighbor. \u00a0I would like to think that Ms. McKee has more qualifications than just being a parent and choice of house but I can't imagine that she would be on the committee if she didn't live next door to Dr. Insel.\n\nWhy would Dr. Insel put his neighbor on the IACC?\n\nMoving on, we come to the matter of the early\u00a0adjournment\u00a0of an IACC meeting that happened a few months ago. \u00a0At the end of this particular meeting, there was time allocated for public comments. \u00a0In order to make a comment you had to submit your questions, in advance, so they could be pre-approved. \u00a0One mother did just this - she submitted, in advance, questions that her son, who has autism, would be asking at the meeting. \u00a0The questions were approved and she was told that the comment time was at 3:30 on the day of the meeting. \n\nThe mother went through all of the preparations that were required to help her son get ready to ask the committee his questions. \u00a0Given the nature of autism and the nature of the event, I can imagine that the family had to do significant prep work.\n\nOn the day of the meeting, the mother decides to skip most of the meeting and to arrive at the scheduled time for comments. \u00a0I think we can all agree that\u00a0sitting through a long meeting with a child with autism would not be anyone's idea of a good time (especially for the child). \u00a0So they arrive at the meeting at the proper time only to find that the meeting had been prematurely ended over an hour before. \u00a0The poor kid was left giving his comments to an empty room. \n\nNeedless to say, the mother was not pleased by this turn of events. \u00a0If it were me, I would be equally upset.\n\nTo be fair, Dr. Insel did call and \u00a0apologize to the mother afterwards. \u00a0But at the same time, I am not sure that makes much of a difference. \u00a0The people commenting were pre-approved, so the committee knew that they were coming. \u00a0Given what the committee is responsible for and the fact that it was a child speaking, I have to think that they would at least guess that the child had a form of autism. \u00a0You would think that the members of the committee would understand the challenges that a child with autism would have with this experience and do everything they could to make the experience a successful one for the child. \u00a0In this case all that would have meant was sticking to the published schedule and not leaving early.\n\nWhy did Dr. Insel let the meeting be\u00a0adjourned\u00a0early? \u00a0Did he simply not think it through or did he not care enough?\n\nWhich leads me to what is potentially the most\u00a0disturbing\u00a0item. \u00a0Let me just first say that I do not like reporting what is basically gossip and normally I don't give much credence to\u00a0unsubstantiated stories. \u00a0However, in this case, the person reporting this story tends to be reputable and, even if the story below is only partially true, it would be a still be\u00a0disturbing.\n\nWith that said, an allegation has been made that Did Dr. Insel refused to ride in an elevator with a child who had autism. \u00a0From the Adventures in Autism blog -\nOn April 17, 2007, Holly Bortfeld attended an autism hearing in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee run by Senator Tom Harkin. At that hearing Dr. Thomas Insel, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, now current head of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, was there to testify.\nBeforehand, Ms. Bortfeld, was waiting with her 11 year old son Max, who has autism, at an elevator on the way up to the hearing. When the doors opened they got on. \u00a0After they did, Thomas Insel and a female companion approached and entered the elevator just before the doors closed. Ms. Bortfeld reports that once they were on the elevator together...\n\"...Max stimmed. Insel looked at him, looked at me (yes, he had his little name tag on, so he knew that I knew he was) then he hit the open door button and ushered his coworker off. As the doors were closing, he said \"I'm not riding up with them\", looking at my son.\"\nI initially had a hard time believing that anyone would do this, especially a trained medical professional. \n\nBut then I remembered all of the looks and comments that my family has received while out in public. \u00a0And the sorts of comments on stories like these\u00a0that show the complete lack of understanding that the public at large has of autism. \u00a0And then I look at incidences like the above two items and the other\u00a0controversies\u00a0that Dr. Insel has been involved in as part of his tenure at the IACC.\n\nAnd suddenly parts of the above story become more believable. \u00a0I still can't bring myself to believe that Dr. Insel would say \"I'm not ridding up with them\" but I could see him getting out of the elevator and even doing that small thing would say volumes about his character.\n\nSo I have to wonder, how much does Dr. Insel care about children with autism and is he the right person to be leading the IACC?\n\n", "outgoing_links": ["//3.bp.blogspot.com/_WoSi1HFMqsc/St_F15DqxlI/AAAAAAAAAFU/Ei5QGFkSBXI/s1600-h/drinsel.jpg", "http://www.army.mil/-images/2009/07/17/45155/army.mil-45155-2009-07-17-080721.jpg", "http://iacc.hhs.gov/about/member-roster.shtml", "http://www.dhhs.gov/news/press/2007pres/11/20071127b.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/07/the-not-combating-autism-act-in-action.html", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/07/autism-families-shut-out-at-iacc.html", "http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2009/10/autism-chair-thomas-insel-refuses-to.html", "http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/features_julieshealthclub/2008/06/autistic-toddle.html"], "link": "https://autismjabberwocky.blogspot.com/2009/10/what-about-dr-thomas-insel.html", "title": "\nWhat about Dr. Thomas Insel?\n"}
