{"date": "2014/03/17", "body": "There are times when you have to just stop everything. Adam has required it\u2026his school has required it. A focus on Adam\u2019s typing and adaptations in school have alas been paying him dividends. Despite his want for escape, screaming and bolting, Adam has been in cognitive behavioural therapy and we\u2019ve been working on his accommodations in school so much so, he is literally whipping through his academics \u2013 I know this is the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Sensory breaks every 20 minutes enable Adam to focus and he has an array of self-help tools he can now choose for himself to calm \u2013 from stretchy therabands (his fave), to signals that he can verbalize \u201cthe body needs to move.\u201d His penchant for routine and doors is akin to panic attacks. It is important to give Adam concrete options to move from one thing to the next. His will is strong as is his intelligence and everyone who knows Adam must try to help him by staying two steps ahead of him at all times in order to respond. Or, as I do now, I also ask him what he needs: Me: Adam, what I can do to help you around when you have the impulse to go through doors? \nAdam: You can help by staying calm. \nMe: What do you need? \nAdam: Hard to move forward. Really hard to tell. So we will work on it and Adam is beginning to communicate his more complex needs. Here in Florida (for Adam\u2019s March Break), the building security guard came by and noted when he saw Adam in a moment going through doors with his \u201chelp,\u201d he could recognize it as a panic attack right away because as a young person he too had panic attacks. This is what is like for Adam when it\u2019s happening. For now, I ask him to sit down and try hard to get him to focus by typing. When he is able to think and redirect his thoughts to communicate, we can better negotiate our next steps. It takes time, so when we have an agenda, it just won\u2019t work. We need to be prepared to spend an extra 20 or 30 minutes helping Adam to the next step because he could be literally \u201cstuck\u201d in his loop/OCD and tics, or needs that long to get his words out. But when he does, it\u2019s so glorious to see him gleam with pride. It\u2019s so wonderful to be able to negotiate now with my son! Our days are more rigid than they used to be; Adam needs his routine. And I am finding the balance, and keep asking him for knowledge on how to help him. It\u2019s a team effort. And as for that building security guard? Well, not everything has stopped\u2026I began the  thank you-note project  \u2013 a new form of advocacy for Adam and autism. Every time someone helps in a positive way \u2013 by standing back and letting us be, to a nice gesture or comment, and letting us be a part of the community despite challenges, they receive a thank you note from Adam and I. People need to know they are doing the right thing by letting us be a part of our communities and advocating for what we need. It may not be a big glitzy campaign, but it\u2019s something that we feel good about\u2026 reaching one person at a time.

{"date": "2014/09/15", "body": " Adam on the move[/caption] And so we moved again. It has been lots of hard work to prepare Adam for another (and final) move to our now permanent home in downtown Toronto. I decided to put everything aside to prepare him (and our new home) for the transition. This involved many social stories, visitations to the renovation site, weekly pictures and a reassurance that this was going to be a happy move. Our last move was a consequence of divorce and took its toll on both of us.  Adam had lots of positive support and a smooth summer at camp. I prepared calendars, reviewed them, we typed (talked) about moving all the time. I also made a calendar countdown to prepare with a symbolic punctuation to indicate our last day at our house; this involved letting go of four red balloons into the sky. On them I wrote:  Mommy and Adam ,  Hope and Dreams ,  Bye Bye (address) , and  New Home .  Before the bus came to pick up Adam early on August 14th, we stood on the driveway on the sunny  morning and discussed each balloon then let them go one by one. We watched them float high in the sky \u2013 the sun in our eyes \u2013 until they disappeared. Adam\u2019s grin was wide and he jumped up and down a few times; my heart was heavy as it was giddy to see how well this was going. Adam seemed to be coping so well\u2026 not tearful or anxious as I expected him to be. In fact, I was floored when he typed about the move, \u201cyou are home to me.\u201d Now that\u2019s putting things into perspective! Soon I would let Adam get on the bus and say goodbye for two weeks. Later that day he would go to his dad\u2019s house  while I prepared our new home for his arrival. The movers would be there on the heels of his camp bus, gutting our memories \u2013 of becoming a new kind of family from the new pictures on our mantel to Adam\u2019s art that would make it our home. I wonder if I had made such earnest preparations to avoid the severe spasms Adam encountered during the divorce move; to avoid the heartbreak we worked so hard to overcome\u2026and succeeded.  I recalled when we made another happy move \u2013 when Adam\u2019s father and I built a new house and Adam participated in his weekly construction with frequent visitation to the site. There was one object I had left back in our, what I will call, \u201cRosemary House\u201d (to do with the location) that I had to return to obtain. I was pregnant with Adam in that house. We had found out Adam was autistic in that house and endured hours of \u201ctherapy.\u201d I was becoming the mother I was meant to be. It was old and rickety but it had cradled precious memories that are heritage to me (sadly the house was not and has since been torn down). The object I returned for was Adam\u2019s bassinet which was mine as an infant. My mother worked hard to refurbish it for Adam and it was hand-made by my grandmother. Heritage was at least maintained in this. A light summer storm was brewing in the late afternoon as I pulled into the driveway and Adam, only a toddler, was asleep in the back seat. I left him in the car to quickly run in and grab the bassinet to put in the back of my van. But it was hard to leave the warm inside. There is a compulsion to stay in an old empty house full of memories even when it is stripped bare except for the dust bunnies that appeared like tumbleweeds in the desert. I remember standing in our bedroom, where Adam spent most nights with us, trying to review all the memories in fast-forward. I had to pull myself away to return to Adam, still unaware and fast asleep. Perhaps we\u2019ve now had too many of those moments ever since. As Adam\u2019s bus turned the corner, the movers pulled in. They worked quickly removing boxes and our house was empty again. I vacuumed and cleaned it for the new owners but also because of gratitude and the love we built in that house. I felt the pull again to linger and remember how Adam and I learned to become our own family unit; how friends became our family there and how my parents Adam and I have become closer than ever. Adam and I did it \u2013 we pulled it together in that house. As I felt the tears begin, I abruptly left.  It is time to move on\u2026go,  I said aloud. Time to move to our happy house, close to public transit and bustling life on the streets\u2026 and down the hall from my parents. It was part of my plan for Adam and his future being in the heart of transit and the city for his quality of life. It was fortuitous that it all worked out. So instead of preaching, I decided to lead by example: to leave quickly and look forward while paying respect to our past. Remember the red balloon that read:  Adam and Mommy \u2026 Hopes and Dreams. A month later I can write about it. There is more to follow.\n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2014/09/15/a-new-beginning/", "title": "A New Beginning"},
{"date": "2014/01/07", "body": "We begin 2014 anew. I have applied for a leave of absence from my PhD study to focus entirely on Adam\u2019s program. In so doing, I recognize I need time to energize myself and have some free time; this is not possible as a single parent of an autistic child if I don\u2019t cut back. So, at the end of 2013, I made the empowering decision to become a communications specialist and educator of my son. I\u2019m making field notes along the way. I don\u2019t do this alone of course; it takes others to assist us. But in Canada where there is a lack of trained specialists in supported communication, this is up to me now. Thankfully I have other supporters and success stories including our own. With the ice storm, a sudden move to a hotel due to the massive power outages in Toronto, the holidays and general upset at the end of this year, I may have fallen into one of my darkest places. I hate to see my son so upset, so less able to handle transitions. I realize I hate holidays too \u2013 there was too much expectation despite the fact that I know that this a sure way to fail. No way, no how next year. One modest dinner and one present\u2026that\u2019s enough and that\u2019s lovely. Of course, much of this has to do with my own resilience and preparedness. Sometimes, Adam requires more preparation than usual \u2013 more social stories, lists, repetition of what we are going to do next. He can be the kind of kid that seems to be rolling along quite well and then he needs exceptional support. Let\u2019s just say this past December he needed way more than I provided. School had exhausted me as well which didn\u2019t help. Writing about the philosophy of language and disability takes a lot of of one when a child\u2019s scream replaces words; they are more commanding. As soon as I turned my attention to helping Adam, he calmed down. His school assisted with what we call \u201coperation calm down\u201d and his environment, demands and work were all reassessed. For Adam, he requires proactive breaks every twenty minutes to return to his desk. His school has been most accommodating in helping to provide these breaks. Eventually, kids who are accommodated are often able to increase their level and time of focus as they mature. If there\u2019s one thing I never stop learning is that changing expectations means that you always have to reassess them. Adam then had a long break (albeit the first half was stressful with the storm). When he returned Sunday, we had another cold weather, namely the \u201cpolar vortex.\u201d Schools were cancelled so I planned the day: a walk before it got too cold to go outside, art, reading and typing (I made a program for that), sensory swing, and computer. In between such a good day, Adam decided he wanted some pretend play so we went with that (lots of language there). There was only one incident when his grandfather popped by and then Adam thought he was going to \u201cgramma\u2019s house.\u201d Adam will tend to want to do things that are routinized and when he found out he wasn\u2019t going, he screamed. I left the room and asked him to read a book to calm down. He did so in less than five minutes, which I thought was pretty good. When he was quiet, I returned to ask if he was feeling better, ready for another scream. None came, but it might have. I told Adam I\u2019d check on him again in a few minutes. When I did, Adam went through his lists when he knew \u201cgramma\u2019s house\u201d wasn\u2019t an option: \u201cBrunos\u201d(which is a grocery store), \u201cHero Burger\u2026Burger King\u2026Shoppers Drug Mart\u2026\u201d \u201cAdam, mom needs a break. I\u2019m going to have a cup of tea,\u201d I said. I decided that bargaining wasn\u2019t going to get me anywhere and I\u2019m trying hard to build Adam\u2019s \u201cno\u201d muscle. I sat quietly on the couch drinking my tea, expecting the whole while that another scream was possible. None came. Soon, Adam made his way up the stairs from where he was in the rec room, and lay flat in the hallway. I said nothing and kept drinking my tea. Eventually, Adam brought a book to the couch and sat with me. We got to the point where I could ask him what he wanted for dinner. If he would scream, I would have sent him quietly to his room not as a punishment, but so he learns about self-calm and what I expect from him. There, he has more books to read, which I feel is a positive way to self-regulate intense emotions and which seems to work for Adam.  \u201cTeachable moments\u201d like these make me feel like a competent parent and teacher, and I think we all need to feel that way. I had prepared, I have been studying to make Adam\u2019s programs comprehensive, and I\u2019m becoming more prepared and working on the more difficult behaviours such as bolting, opening doors, and the so-called willfulness of puberty while recognizing that Adam might be confused and sometimes fearful \u2013  helplessly resorting to routinous behaviour in order to self-regulate or find order. It is my job to help him. This is what makes my days feel gratifying rather than worried about him while I sink my head in Barthes and Derrida. While I\u2019m not going to stop reading and writing, I just am going to use what I\u2019ve learned in theory and turn it into a practice.  Yesterday and this morning, Adam was beaming. He was happy to go back to school this morning. Starting next week, I get to teach Adam more communication, typing and literacy, life and social skills. I have begun my leave to do this work. I hope we both have a wonderful 2014. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2014/01/07/parentteacher/", "title": "Parent/Teacher"},
{"date": "2014/06/29", "body": "I came by your article in Canada\u2019s  The Globe and Mail ,  The Hunt for Humanity , printed on June 21st, 2014, a little late. To recap for readers, you suggest that your project, Brainspan Atlas research at Toronto\u2019s Sick Kids Hospital (Dr. Sherer works in Toronto and Brainspan Atlas is located in Seattle) explores the exons \u2013 the series of \u201csegments\u201d (including intons) that make up the human genome, are involved in human evolution. In this exploration, Dr. Uddin, a computational biologist and geneticist, sits to author the computer code comparing the relationship between \u201csequenced exons from thousands of apparently healthy individuals\u201d (Semeniuk, Globe Article) and those with \u201cmutations.\u201d Dr. Uddin looked to Brainspan Atlas data on exons \u201cthat were rarely mutated but highly expressed during brain development\u201d and \u201cfiltered out\u201d to  distill  the genes suspected of having a connection to ASD candidates \u2013 finding some speculated connection between exons and these genes which both Uddin and Scherer now study.  Without delving into the \u201cscience\u201d of their work, let us consider the premise, for few science writers will begin any article with a discussion of ethics and disability. Interesting because when we read articles in the Globe and other news sources, one can\u2019t write an article about autism or disability and ethics, without getting some remark from a neuroscientist or geneticist (I am leaving the rest of this sentence for the reader to fill). No\u2026Dr. Scherer believes in  natural selection.  He says, \u201cnatural selection has sculpted these genes by tweaking their expression in the brain\u201d (Globe). Darwin\u2019s theory, adopted by Sir Francis Galton in 1883 laid the groundwork for an entire movement that institutionalized and segregated many from society and was the basis for the eugenics movement which separated people by their supposed \u201cgenetic soundness.\u201d This was also the premise by which the Nazi\u2019s killed the sick, mentally handicapped, and the elderly (before the Jewish population). One need only a lesson in history, picking up original text from the period to compare the language used by Semeniuk, Scherer and Uddin to see that the people involved in this project may be treading too close to a history we must not repeat. Terms used throughout the article such as comparing autism as a mutation \u2013  using the binary of health versus mutation or worse not human (this was implied throughout) \u2013  are dangerous in that they sway, with their power of position, the general public to believe that autistic people are less than human. The entire article does more than insinuate that autistic people are not human. Says another doctor cited in the article, Dr. Varki,  \u201c\u2026the children of a mating between humans and Neanderthals may have been physically healthy but \u2018cognitively sterile.\u2019 The disadvantage of losing the uniquely human genetic package, even to a small degree, would have conveyed a tremendous cost in terms of social interaction and reduced their chances of reproductive success\u201d (Globe article).  The language throughout the entire article (if you can get your hands on it as  The Globe and Mail  now has a subscription service online), it is rife with dangerous language. Autistic people are compared to \u201cnon human\u201d species. But worse, as I find with many neurologists and \u201cautism experts,\u201d there is a gross lack of knowledge about autism from autistic people and the people who live every day with the label, and the challenges of being different than what is supposed to be \u201cnormal.\u201d This was very apparent throughout and also at the end of the article when Semeniuk writes: \u201cFor Dr. Uddin, who has grown increasingly aware of the burden carried by those with ASD since coming to Sick Kids, the payoff comes from watching his ideas and his number-crunching materialize into something that may improve lives\u2026\u2019These kids often don\u2019t talk to anyone, or have any way to express their concerns,\u2019 he says. \u2018As a researcher, I want to help if I can. It\u2019s us, as a society that has to come up with our own understanding of how to approach this.\u2019  \n Along the way, the bonus prize may be the ability to see what it is that compels us to connect \u2013 to get inside each other\u2019s heads \u2013 in a way that no other creatures seem to do\u201d (Globe article).\n I\u2019ll assume, Ivan Semeniuk, you are meaning that only humans communicate, and those who do not are not human? Have you met autistic people?  Have you talked with them? Have you connected with any of them or have you avoided contact (or insisted that it only happen on your own terms)?  I\u2019m asking questions here that must be asked of everyone involved in this field. I\u2019m often surprised at how experts haven\u2019t met many autistic adults, or read their work. This seems to me to be a prerequisite if you state you are going to work in a field, that you get to everyone who has a stake in the outcomes of your work. Can you see how my son is very social and just this past week, despite his struggle in forming words, has gone with his friends to the Science Centre, the farm, out to restaurants and has been happy in being with his mates? Have you seen an autistic person, Dr. Uddin, not be able to forms words well, but can express themselves with alternate communication? Have you seen an autistic person type cogent sentences at the same time making supposed inarticulate utterances? Have you investigated the actual fact that the two occur simultaneously? How important is rhythm and support to the ability to communicate and what must we all do to appreciate the many ways of being human (certainly not a natural selection theory). Mr. Semeniuk, I\u2019d love to talk with you about research and critical theory on linguistic theory and what I call the  language prejudice . This prejudice assumes that if you can\u2019t speak, you don\u2019t think or don\u2019t understand, which of course is not true. It might provide a more well-rounded article on autism, ethics and the prejudice in society about autism that we all must avoid. This, by the way, is a first draft, unedited. I am writing from my mind and most importantly, my heart as both a scholar in the field of critical disability studies and a mother. I look forward to dissecting genetic science (and your work) and the  premise of discrimination.  If you want to read the article,  The Globe now makes you pay for it.

{"date": "2013/12/03", "body": "Adam has been reading words since he\u2019s been 11 months old. When he reads aloud, it sounds as if Adam has weaker reading skills, but his typing is always better than reading out loud. Yet there is a difference in how we come to language, and I suppose I\u2019m more inclined these days to post-structuralism in the way words relate to other words when I think of relativism and how, as we hear about some autistic folks, that words can have an associational meaning. For many people, words relate to an event, a sound, an occurrence. They are associational; sometimes they are sensory where metaphor works best. The point is, language is just a system. It limits experience that can not always be translated into words. For Adam, words are very important. They can mean life and death since most people would not bother to understand Adam\u2019s language outside of \u201cbehavioural\u201d contexts. As David Abram says, we are conditioned to speech. We miss the sensory properties and ways of knowing outside of speech and language; it is very hard for Adam and other people who come to language differently (if they can at all), to translate experience into words. Decoding and reading words can be different than feeling. I think that we have to view language more creatively and recognize that language does not denote intelligence  \u2013 although we live in a society that still believes it does. Language is a half-formed tool, and in a political sense, it excludes many folks who do not come to the dominant, or ordinary, language as easily as some. Adam and I were reading last night. I asked him to read out loud, but unless he uses words in the way he uses them (which is why typing is useful in many ways), it\u2019s difficult to know what he knows about a word. So, as we were reading, I quickly ripped off strips of paper and we not only spelled words (which he can do well), but we made them come alive. The word around when literally around Adam\u2019s head. The word \u201cthrough\u201d went through his fingers. \u201cWind\u201d moved violently (fanned by me with a large book) and a pictorial leaf \u201cspinned\u201d and \u201ctumbled\u201d to the ground. \u201cWhisper\u201d came close to his ear and whispered \u201cI love you,\u201d and the \u201cbreeze\u201d gentle moved the word on the strip of paper in the air. Adam wanted to read more. He grabbed book after book off the shelf as he read out loud, while we both made the words come alive for hours. This is akin to when we hear parents labeling items all around the house which makes words \u201cfunctional.\u201d Yet words are more than that. How can we make words sensory? How do we make them experiential? How can we role-reverse the word? God may have breathed the word into Adam, but he forgot that we have to also breathe life into words. And still, words are never enough. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2013/12/03/breathing-life-into-words/", "title": "Breathing Life into Words"},

{"date": "2013/12/13", "body": "It\u2019s the end of the term\u2026I need a long break and so does Adam. His anxiety went up as soon as the clocks turned back. The darkness brought about a new mood, Adam\u2019s ticking went off the charts and he started a new tick \u2013 a screaming tick. He wasn\u2019t happy \u2013 he couldn\u2019t stop it as the pressure mounted on him to stop. I felt pressure in trying to help him, because let\u2019s face it, screaming disturbs the peace. It\u2019s alarming. With it, Adam\u2019s flight-fight prompts him to bolt when he sees pathways and stairwells. These are all the signs that  Operation Calm Down  had to be put into effect. By virtue of naming it so, it\u2019s not the first time we have implemented it. Dad took Adam on a short vacation and this allowed me to have one too. On my yoga vacay, I met another dad with an Asperger\u2019s son. He too mentioned that his son ticks and these anxiety attacks, let\u2019s call them for now, make it difficult to get back to schoolwork. His son\u2019s grades are going down, he said.  So too, autistic autobiography reiterates the length of  time  it requires to self-regulate\u2026sometimes days. Although I\u2019ve been busy with PhD study, I realize the patterns of Adam\u2019s distress tends to be at regular intervals during the year,  and  after sickness. Now that his body is changing as well as his needs, I am considering a leave-of-absence to help him, but also to help myself in so doing. In thinking of Adam\u2019s life and the very complex anxiety he has, his motor-planning difficulties, his frustration so apparent as he tries so hard to talk (the other day he got so frustrated, he picked up a pencil and in his chicken scratch wrote that he wanted to go to \u201cgramma\u2019s house\u201d), we can\u2019t always expect a learner like Adam to spend day-after-day exactly the same. The seasons change, there are new anxieties in life and we all need breaks. This is one of the most fundamental obstacle I can think of in how we teach children in general \u2013 in chairs for too long, in small rooms, with little outdoor exercise because of liability issues. It\u2019s not one person\u2019s fault, per se. It\u2019s how we\u2019ve built our society. We live in cars, in buildings and we don\u2019t get out much. If Adam had an outdoor learning environment as a major part of his learning experience, I think he would be able to take in much more (outdoor education is decreasing but can be made accessible to people with disabilities). In the summer with lots of activity, for instance, he can talk more \u2013 and this is a feat for someone like Adam. It is therefore very difficult to be talking grades, assessments, intelligence and so forth without recognizing that, living in the settings that are the way they are, that my autistic son will be delayed in his learning. The focus is far to much on intelligence (or ideas about intelligence) rather than somatic knowledge, difficulty and other ways that we can learn. I know this because when Adam is \u201con,\u201d and there are adaptations to his learning, he can learn. I am writing in these terms because when looking at sites or articles about autism, the terms and ways of thinking about intelligence and learning are so \u201cmatter-of-fact\u201d or normalized that we forget about how other kinds of learning can take place. This makes so many people, the forgotten ones. In essence, I\u2019m trying to move away from a linear model of development and learning which doesn\u2019t work for many people. When the body has to spend so much time readjusting and becoming comfortable, the rest of the school work (at a desk in a chair\u2026) has to be put aside. It would be wonderful for schools and educators to think about this a little more \u2013 to integrate movement into every aspect of the day including field trips and outdoor activities \u2013 even in inclement weather (my parents never protected me from it). I fear with our autistic children in Canada, that we are growing more back towards re-institutionalization in a different costume; we segregate and we isolate in order for our kids to be \u201csafe.\u201d In this, I appreciated mother and author of the book  Spark , on her autistic son, namely, her \u201cphilosophy of muchness.\u201d Never stop exposing (even with ticks, flaps and screaming) autistic children from many things \u2013 theatre, music, the outdoors, and accept the difficulties and make room for them. We need to change the way we look at the length of education \u2013 since not all bodies cannot finish high school by the age of 18 (or 21). What other modes of education might we employ? Considering this is not as much an \u201cintelligence\u201d issue (I hesitate because I do not like to promote intellectualism which I find further separates people) as much as a somatic one. Which leads me to some new revelations for me as a mom: that Adam\u2019s \u201cvoice\u201d is a part of his growth. It\u2019s hard on me to watch him in a kind of pain from which he can\u2019t escape (sometimes the ticks are a loop he can\u2019t stop and sometimes they are willful \u2013 one \u201cbehaviour\u201d can serve many different purposes) but also, I want so badly to give him the tools he needs so he can gain some latitude in his life. His life is so restricted with people always watching his every move \u2013 and this is, as I mentioned, for safety reasons. I often wonder, if given a great expanse of land to explore, could he feel better? What will his choices be for how he needs and wants to live his life? How can we support that? How do we stop protecting (or at least let up a little) in a dangerous world? I am certain some of Adam\u2019s stress comes from having very little autonomy, and although he is strong and willful (which I believe will bode him well), if you can\u2019t communicate fluently in our society, or you can\u2019t cross the street by yourself, your autonomy is limited. This, of course, is where the concept of supported-decision making and assistance comes in, but assistants (and parents) really need to understand this and how to be good listeners (for some reading, look to Val Williams\u2019 conversational analyses between caregivers and non-verbal individuals). Think of the life-skills training in addition to the education that our children also deserve. This takes more time than the allotment prescribed during the Industrial Revolution. I mean, it\u2019s time to move on. Then there is the need to reconsider how we look at behaviour from the outside. This is a problematic approach because we cannot know how Adam feels on the inside, yet we have lots of autistic autobiography to help us.  When we tried redirecting Adam with a behavioural approach, this enraged him \u2013 he smashed himself into the couch and crumpled the paper from his Zeotrope in his little fists and threw them to the ground. The basis of this was to get Adam to stop screaming, but it did not account for the fact that he perhaps could not stop. This is the same for Tourettes (which I think Adam \u201chas\u201d) in that if you call more attention to the action, it will increase it. Instead, deflecting to relaxing activities seems to help more in addition to the sensory (deep pressure) that Adam needs. An and calming approach worked much better than a behavioural one \u2013 this is what has to be done before we can teach any lessons \u2013 social and academic. Social stories and cognitive behavioural training are now a part of Adam\u2019s week in addition to us seeking more adventure for him \u2013 rock climbing, circus arts and swimming. For CBT, another boy character is inserted into social stories to take the attention away from Adam. This way, Adam can relate to the character without feeling targeted. I gleaned this from reading Donna Williams\u2019  Exposure Anxiety , which makes a lot of sense where Adam is concerned. I fully believe after 12 years of being with Adam that seeking cooperation through engagement is our obligation, not his because he is still learning. He is a child who wants to learn, but we can\u2019t do that by mere compliance. He complies when he is respected and engaged and also knows the rules (teaching boundaries respectfully will be our new challenge).  I\u2019ve started teaching three key concepts in various formats and in daily life to Adam \u2013 cooperation, patience and gratitude. In teaching Adam these concepts and ways to enact them in daily life, I also have to do so towards him. I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.  Puberty will be challenging for Adam and for me. I am protective mother noticing the need and beginnings of separation. On the one hand it seems that Adam needs his structure and certain environments especially when he is feeling uncertain. On the other hand, he is truly becoming a teenager who is showing more signs of frustration and wanting to expand his world (this is different than bolting or escape but could be  sometimes  related). These may always be competing impulses in him, I don\u2019t know. All I can tell is that they both exist within him. How do I give Adam boundaries and his own need for control over his own life now  and  ensure his safety? I\u2019ll keep you posted on how this goes too.

{"date": "2015/02/05", "body": "Adam is learning to become an independent typist so quickly now. While it makes me proud and happy for him because he wants to be independent (he has written so many times), it is really important to know that independence, for all of us, is an illusion.  First, Adam has been typing since he has been around 4-5 years old. Most teachers and therapists aren\u2019t all familiar with how support can enable a non-speaking person to type (and possibly become independent). While we began early, we didn\u2019t obtain the commitment from teachers who would not learn how to support him, in my view, because they didn\u2019t understand the meaning of support. When a person has many motor planning issues associated with their movement and speech, it can be very difficult to feel grounded enough to type. The purpose of support is to enable the body and the mind to ground (if you will allow me a metaphor). A support person also offers the emotional security in a task that is so challenging when the body and mind coordinate many different stimuli and tasks. We take for granted how we multitask, and how our bodies coordinate speech and bodily movements effortlessly. For Adam, he has expressed numerous times how he has required help.  The important addition in Adam\u2019s life has been the support we had been looking for all these years; this means daily use of typing in all settings, almost all of the time. Adam now has access and support every day. As such, he has moved so swiftly in his ability and language expression that we are all confident that he is moving to more consistent independence.  However, I want to caution everyone here, for the emotional support of others may be needed, as well as patient and gracious listeners. Just because Adam can often type without physical support does not mean that he might now need another person nearby giving him the confidence he needs. Also, while the level of support may fade, some people may always require some level of support throughout their lifetime. In my own research, I\u2019ve found that a generous and encouraging  co-presence  \u2013  of love and a presumption that Adam is intelligent and curious, has encouraged him. He has been very frustrated for how he has been treated over the years as a boy who hasn\u2019t understood what is being said, and is eager to learn even though his day-to-day life may be challenging. While the iPad has markedly changed the reception of Adam by others \u2013  providing Adam\u2019s voice and enabling friendships and school work through text-to-speech technology (we use Proloquo2go) \u2013  technology is not a panacea. Too often, we make the grave mistake of thinking that if we push our children hard enough, they will learn how to speak or type, etc. \u201cJust as long as he can communicate\u201d thinking will not erase the experience of being autistic. Our modern notions of independence are skewed by a market-economy that demands that we, as parents, produce the most efficient workers. This is also proving to be a big issue as our autistic children turn 21.  The ABA movement, when it was nascent here in Canada in the 1990\u2019s-present, presented itself as an early-intervention treatment to recover the autistic child. The idea that earlier (and quicker) is better, fuels parental desperation and fosters an inauspicious environment for learning. These therapies also promised parents that remediation was a passage to full inclusion in our society; that the only way to participate and contribute was to be cured of autism. Many a rights-based/legal argument constellates around the notion that to be remediated is a right; to be cured is a right in order to assure this passage to normality. All of these notions are based on a modern concept of an abstract citizen as it was formed by way of the Social Contract. In this,  none  of us are citizens precisely because  none  of us can pull our own way; we are all dependent upon one another for every cycle of the market, and for the function of our daily lives. Every rich man or woman has an army of support that enables him/her to earn that living \u2013  or production; as such one can deduce that all participants of production should be \u201cowners.\u201d It\u2019s about  who  has the power over that capital, of course, that is called into question and is part of the discourse regarding social support. What would it mean to think of autistic contribution  and  the desire to be autistic? Adding to this, can we think outside the box of productivity as we currently conceive it in modern economic terms? We have seen autistic contribution  proved  many times, in speaking and non-speaking ways, and perhaps it is this aspect, as having to prove oneself as normal (as possible), that troubles me. I want to call into question about how we all markate and market autistic contribution.  My interests are on how society expects autistic people to speak in \u201cnormal\u201d ways as a passage to citizenship. As displayed in the film,  Wretches & Jabberers , for instance, even when autistic people achieve communication, they are not considered full citizens; they are not included into schools or considered for employment. Here too we must acknowledge that in our society, there will be some bodies who have more material needs than others (Erevelles, 2011). How does the notion of achieving one\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cequal\u201d share leave out many people with significant disabilities? And what are we doing (positively and negatively) in terms of elimination of those bodies in the name of \u201cequal\u201d distribution?  Our questioning about autism and technology should be not just how it can make autistic people independent, but how we can change our views towards autistic people; and the right to support and education past the age of 21. Education is another system that supports economic output, of course, and needs to be reconsidered. Certainly we also know that for  all  of us, time-plus-experience enables knowledge. We need to provide education past that hurried (and hallowed) age of 21 and to grapple with the very troubling issues that confront us within our current system. All of these considerations may help us rethink our systems of support. Just because we have new enabling technology doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we accept autism. There are many contributions we all make to one another that are not counted as capital; that exist (and are valuable) outside the ledger. The ledger, after all, is a mere frame. We know there is always something left outside of it, and in this case, I am referring to a class of marginalized autistic individuals who are not considered equal because of economic potential. We need to think first about accepting autism while we consider how to educate and support autistic people with technology. Reference: Nirmala Erevelles, 2011.

After given the chance to type about why he was upset, he was talking about the news and of justice. He is beginning to learn about Martin Luther King.

We hear of terrorism, killings in our own city, many injustices. It is hard to watch your own child be pained by it all. I told him about how I think we don\u2019t understand joy unless we experience struggle and also that we cope everyday by thinking about the people we love and the things we love to do. It\u2019s all I could come up with as he listened intently while noshing on rice snacks after school today. Then I commented on all that bad news we hear and rhetorically asked why that is. I would ask any other grade seven student the same question, so why not Adam? I commented that some people only watch the news when it\u2019s bad news. Then I grabbed my copy of the Sunday  New York Times  and we looked for some good news stories. Dismayed that I could not find anything in the front section, I leaped to the arts section and we found a story about inspiration. I thought we could go with that. Adam leaned in and I started talking about how we need good news journalists. This is what he wrote and with his permission, he does want this published on my blog: Then  Proloquo  (the program he uses to type) jammed so we moved to a notes section and he continued: It\u2019s hard to read from the screen shot so here it is again: \u201cIt sells because people want to see bad things.

For many reasons, this seems like the safe space he can communicate and Adam and I will be presenting at our first conference together this fall. We have also started our new school, which we are very excited to say more about later.  There are times when advocacy needs to take different forms, where the current form isn\u2019t serving as well and where, I feel, certain binary arguments continue to perpetuate the cycle of exclusion we are experiencing today. I also feel there are so many autistic self-advocates that write important blogs, and these are important resources.

{"date": "2015/01/19", "body": "Again, the suggestion that mental illness \u2013 an umbrella term under which autism has also been thrust \u2013 is discussed in terms of biological disease. Says the  Globe & Mail  this morning: \u201cIt probably brings us closer to hammering in the idea that mental illness is a disease\u2026 It\u2019s a disease we don\u2019t fully understand.\u201d  You can link to the full article here by clicking this sentence.  Let us put aside for the moment that our medical journalism lacks any critical thinking or understanding of a now broad oeuvre of disability theory and literature. A critique of the media is indeed part of this blog post. Journalism has become as cheap as reality-TV \u2013 let\u2019s make something out of nothing. Sure, I\u2019m a cynic, and I tire of news reports on autism and the discourse of mental illness as disease. They are indeed a big obstacle to much of Adam\u2019s progress in terms of how people accept and view him. The \u201cgreat\u201d modernist project has been built around not only biology, but  revolutionary  biology. This includes environmental \u2013 internal and external biological causes for \u201cmental illness.\u201d There are two components to that sentence to unpack; the first being that the modernist age has been defined by production and individualism. The notion of autonomy is conflated with the working citizen who fulfills the Social Contract by virtue of pulling oneself up by one\u2019s own boot-straps.  Simply put, it stands to reason in this view that our biological goals have largely been built on supporting what is a statistically \u201cnormal\u201d \u201cgood\u201d-working body. This was indeed a part of the Eugenics Project. Any  body  that falls beyond the bell curve, continues to be deemed a financial burden and a cost to society. Therefore, the creation of a dependent body is morally judged and biologically defined. This is typically what is constituted as a social construction under which we have created institutions, special education, early intervention and the like.  I am tending to envision (as do others) our present age not simply a post-modern age  \u2013 although I prefer post-modern theory to redefine the human and extend to other ways of knowing  outside of the medical model \u2013  but a bizarre hyper-modern period (Umberto Eco used this term in hyper-reality, aesthetic, theory). Briefly, this means that we have extended the Enlightenment project \u2013 the one that created modernity in search of normality \u2013 into overdrive, seeking to land the first man not on the moon, but to create his or her \u201ctheory of everything\u201d to define disease \u2013 or the right or wrong kind of human. The first discoverer wins the big financial and reputational prize. Disability theorists do not  en masse  agree or disagree with the implications of biological alterations, and the use of technology has indeed proven to change the lives of many. I do not have the space herein to discuss all of these aspects. Instead, let me point to a belief that every research project must create a cure as good as it was for polio. I mention this as an example of the drive to cure diseases of all man-made kinds as well (meaning the socially constructed ones). This raises all kinds of important questions about illness and pain itself including the right to live, die, moral judgements about illness, and so on. I am not mentioning polio for these reasons here, but as an example of how a drive for any cure or human improvement has taken on hyper-funded business investment in research and competition. As such, I am citing the profit incentive for medical research. The two tied are not necessarily wrong until or unless we examine our motives. I challenge and disagree with many theorists (or bioethicists) who may purport that it is better to separate any linkage of today\u2019s genome and biological research with early twentieth century eugenics. I believe (as Rembis, 2009; Hubbard and Wald, 1999) that we continue to link behavior with biology and have hybridized these into \u201cmental illness/health.\u201d This umbrella term seeks to broaden medical diagnostics from which many industries may profit, namely pharmaceutical and therapeutic occupations.  The  DSM V  is nearly big enough to take a bullet, and it  will  continue to expand so long as we rely upon a medical model as our only source of knowledge. As such, autism numbers will continue to increase within this model, not because of something environmental or biological, but because of how we imagine and create discourses. It\u2019s not looking good for autism from where I sit under this rubric, I realize this. We all know that autism, like many other cognitive disabilities, are diagnosed by observation for which we have created an extensive lexicon of disease and abnormality. Bio-markers become a shared lexicon infused with moral implication. Yet, we also know that there are many other ways of knowing and a plethora of disability theory is ignored in most discussions driven by journalists or medical communities.  Also, let us not ignore the criminalization of behaviour (an example of moral judgement stirred and shaken with biology) as a reason to create new research business. In this, please test my theory \u2013 there will not be one news report of a criminal act that is not linked to mental illness today. I\u2019m not trying to create a conspiracy theory, but there is a definitive financial drive for ameliorating many bodies, and we all take a part in creating the discourse. (Reinforcing discourses is another blog post). I will agree with Rembis when he states,  \u201cAny informed discussion of the limits of behavioral genetics research must take into account the historically contingent socially situated nature of impairment itself. Such an argument would not deny the existence of impairment. Instead, it would begin with a critical analysis of the social, medical, scientific and juridical discourse at the root of taken for granted classifications of impairment. This type of critical analysis is already taking place in some of the arguments concerning mental \u201cillness\u201d and mental health services \u2026as well as those concerning the social applicability and general reliability of the results of intelligence tests \u201c(Rembis, 2009, 592). \n He also bluntly states, \u201cThe recent emphasis on genes stems in large part from experts\u2019 drive to tap into the hundreds of millions of dollars made available primarily through NIH Human Genome Project, as well as through huge multinational pharmaceutical companies. There remains, however, a much deeper desire among scientists of the world to bring the vagaries of human reproduction and development under scientific control that continues to drive much of genetic research. Only when we begin to think critically about taken for granted categories of impairment and examine the history of eugenics in a new light will we be able to assess the implications inherent in current and future efforts to control human reproduction and behavior.\u201d (594). Genetic discrimination (Hubbard and Wald 1999) is already in our midst as the \u201cagents of truth\u201d \u2013 a term used to describe how we take the words of medical researchers and how we view them (Rose and Rainbow, 2006)  \u2013 have already defined autism as a genetic abnormality.  Note, that I don\u2019t agree with Rose and Rainbow, however, when they state that biopolitics is not about eugenics as much as capitalism and liberalism (211).  Contrary to their position that we need to develop new conceptual tools for critically analysing how biopolitics plays out, I believe that it is impossible to untangle modernity, capitalism and our propinquity to find biological causes for aberrant behaviour and mental illness \u2013 morally judged designations with supposed (bad) economic implications. This blog post does not do all of these concepts and arguments justice; however, parents and professionals must all challenge the reasons for the propensity for researching biological causes for autism and/or mental illness.  Without doing so, we risk losing opportunities for creating a vibrant future where autism is accepted and where our children may live in peace with education, friendship and family. It is a point of fact that charities such as Autism $peaks spends less than 4% of its budget on services for autistic people ( services  is another blog post too). Far from being utopian, this thought represents a need for examining social mores in order to overcome the obstacles that prevent social inclusion\u2026for every  body . Also, I will agree that the body is under great transformation in terms of identity politics in the way we imagine it, and the other ways of knowing and imagining it can and does exist outside of medicine.   Recently, I am interested, as a woman, theorist and mother, in the lovely intimacy I share with my son as caregiving can be a very physical act. Touted as a burden by many charities and the like \u2013 including fellow parents who yearn to have an independent child \u2013 I have been grateful to be put into a situation where my expectations have been radically altered; where caring has become an important part of my treasured (ever-changing) identity. This has been created by the reality of caring and the mutually negotiated relationship I share with my son.  Therefore, reading accounts of genetically ameliorating autism, or relentless and repeated suggestions that disability (often shoved under the \u201cmental illness\u201d umbrella) is biologically caused or wrong, is troubling for my son and I on many fronts, some of which I have outlined here. Perhaps the  Globe & Mail  writer Wency Leung may take some of these points into consideration. We need to imagine otherwise. References: Hubbard, Ruth. Wald, Elijah. 1999.

I suppose I chose it for my blog as Adam takes the train everyday to school and I try to take in all the sounds and stimuli with him. I try to imagine. As for this site, I recommend supporting the artists.  The Autism Acceptance Project  brought art by autistic artists in an online gallery back in 2005-2007, with exhibitions in Toronto and online participatory space. As our mandate always has been to ask autistic people first what kinds of supports they want and need, the organization has (and continues) to seek autistic-person guidance and governance. When the site was maliciously hacked about two years ago, we lost much data and records, some of which is now stored at  Brock University Library Archives . I must admit that I really enjoyed those days of curating artwork and today, Adam\u2019s poetry and other endeavours, and nourishing them as best I can, is keeping me busy. I am so grateful for the work by autistic people. My background as a curator of art (my first profession prior to my disability studies work) started my journey in looking at disability differently and began the whole blogging process back in 2005.

This site has such a wide array. This is work we saw much too little of prior to the Internet so it would be an interesting topic for many of us to explore (and a paper about online spaces I am writing at the moment). May we also spread encouragement and support directly to the artists when we think about creating websites. I believe that the artists, if they are not directly reimbursed because of budget constraints, should at least be directly credited for their work with a link back to their galleries or websites may enable a generation of income and accolades. Also, it would be wonderful to promote not an \u201cawareness\u201d of autism \u2013 we certainly have that awareness out there.

{"date": "2015/04/20", "body": "I rarely write a piece to save my son\u2019s school, so hear me out: Due to dwindling enrollment, the Merle Levine Academy (MLA) is shutting its doors \u2013 unless more students attend. For autism and other learning disabilities, MLA has graduated students and 90% have gone off to college and university. The school has allowed myself and Adam\u2019s super team to assist and support him where needed and Adam is also included into the classroom. In the past 2 years, Adam has become a speedy typist, communicates his feelings, writes essays, talks with his friends by typing, is above grade in language arts and studies grade-level academics. All he needed was this opportunity. These are some of the most important gifts that MLA has enabled. The other is the priceless smile and pride that Adam wears on his sleeve.  When math was tricky to learn to teach, his teacher stuck with it and now Adam finishes his own math sheets and learns practical math. MLA is not specifically an autism school \u2013 there are many different kinds of learners there. In fact, of the schools available for kids like my son who are non-speaking with lots of challenges, there are basically none except for the ABA (or IBI) autism school here in Ontario. When it comes to the public schools, Adam would have been relegated to the lowest functioning class and given IBI as a treatment of intervention. Of the schools that do say they accept autistic children, they usually are the cherry-picking kind, preferring the ones who fit neatly into the class structure; in other words, less costly to manage. It is ironic that MLA, once a school where kids were farmed if they couldn\u2019t do school, has become the closest to an all-inclusive one (although I wish to be diligent here that we need to produce more schools with the principles of diversity and social justice/egalitarianism. These would educate all children with an enriched disability studies curriculum where teachers learn to teach courses on deaf sign language, autism sensory experience, and so on. At the moment, our imagining of autism or special needs and education seems to be located in the margins of real education which must be changed).  The Applied Behavioural Therapy that has now anchored itself as the treatment of choice has become government-sanctioned segregation. As I predicted in 2005 on my  Joy of Autism  blog, parents now have little choice where children are to be managed rather than educated. As there is no inclusion because the government only funds ABA treatment here in Ontario \u2013 this is based on the principle that people must be remediated before the right to inclusion \u2013  parents feel compelled to go where their kids receive funding with the promise to normalize for the purposes of inclusion. To move outside of that framework requires substantial parental time and other resources. What I have learned in the past 13 years is that parents who have learned that autism schools will never provide all the answers, and no one person will solve all your perceived problems, that MLA will stick with you to make it work for your child. As I wish to follow what our Canadian legislation mandates, which is access and inclusion no matter what the disability, I follow this social justice principle rather than paying lip-service to it. For us, our entry into MLA was the chance that I was waiting for, and that has clearly benefited Adam.  I\u2019m doing my bit here to possibly save the school that gives kids the opportunity to learn about the world they want to learn about, while allowing for the other accommodations that children need. I know that all of us want our children to feel great about themselves, to be happy and most of all, to feel accepted as they are. I know there are kids who wanted to graduate high school at MLA next year after having invested so much time. Please consider helping these kids and this school. I feel MLA has given us the chance to know that this set-up works. What many parents want for children is choice and opportunity. My choice for Adam, and Adam\u2019s own choice, has never been segregation. It has been education, inclusion, and acceptance for being autistic\u2026 all the way!

Adam is in grade seven but will jump a grade. Some might say this is Ironic, no, for a child who some therapists said couldn\u2019t understand, let alone speak fluently?  But it won\u2019t all be in school. In thinking about the schools, policies and systems that are currently in place for autistic people in Canada, I came across the following:  \u201cHeidegger says we are accustomed to having conditions given so that we can plan out definite results. We are used to being able to plan, to calculate, and when we cannot do so, we feel out of our depth\u2026\u201d I fell onto this while reading \u201cOur Dissertations, Ourselves\u201d (2014) but it has another meaning for me. I have promised Adam (and myself) that I would never put Adam into an institutionalized setting/school or group home. The IBI program that I strongly critique is anchored in calculations and definite results or outcomes, even when they are built on false promises because of false assumptions/premises. We want to depend on others to much of this for us\u2026 to solve a \u201cproblem.\u201d  In this, I like what Carol Bacchi asks \u201cWhat is the problem represented to be?\u201d This is the core of how systems and autism policies are built. I think of it this way, we really shouldn\u2019t launch into parent-hood without recognizing that no matter who the child will be, there will be challenges, systemic and otherwise. The neoliberal system also in which we all live works against children by suggesting that everyone can work (and this is also disguised as fulfillment and leisure which often creates a tension with domestic work). I admit I resent this tension. Parenthood requires all of me. It requires that I work outside of existing conditions neither serve Adam nor our values. It is not easy to work outside of systems, or meander in and out of them as we see fit. But right now, we feel it\u2019s necessary.

{"date": "2014/11/07", "body": "I\u2019ve been thinking of writing about the faith I often have in daily encounters with people on our subway also known as the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). In addition to the autism label, Adam also has tics known as Tourettes Syndrome. His manifest in a loud \u201cow.\u201d This will turn many heads, mostly to see if everything is okay. Sometimes Adam can get stuck in his  ow.  It will attract attention and I have tried to help him cultivate a tool box of things where he can help himself get unstuck, but he still requires support in this.  I know so well about the feeling of being stared at, and I know that Adam feels it more. The more people raise the tension in the room, the more Adam will tic. It is stress-based or triggered by various thoughts and emotions, largely negative ones. I think that most people are very forgiving which makes me (mostly) proud to live here in Toronto. Sometimes people will give us more room and smile at us. I like to believe that others see how I positively interact with Adam and witness our loving relationship, and this also eases the situation.  Rarely do we get an irritated stare, but it does happen once in a while. Sometimes I will find myself just wrapping my arm around Adam, or just going on with our activity and ignoring it. I like to lead by example, and I do think this is what we parents have to do in these situations. As my father continues to tell me, don\u2019t give a shit about what anyone else thinks. Yes, sometimes easier said than done, but considering the circumstances, it really helps.  Although a lot of my writing is fed up with disgraceful behaviour and assumptions from a society that seems so restrictive in terms of where Adam can be and how he is allowed to participate in his community, I spend an inordinate amount of time trying to find the good in everyone.  I suppose it\u2019s the counterbalance to an often tough situation.  I\u2019m doing it now. I want to thank all those people (who will never read this) for their acceptance on the subway \u2013 or maybe it\u2019s just not wanting to bother. At any rate, non-interference really helps.  At the same time, I want to also mention the two young men who walked in front of me the other day talking \u201cabout this guy with Tourettes who dropped a tray and said fuck fuck fuck fuck\u2026\u201d Of course the guys were laughing out loud and I so wanted to say \u201cExcuse me guys, but my son has Tourettes and he can\u2019t help it. It would be great if you could be more gracious about it \u2013 yada yada.\u201d The same thing happened today when an autistic man was on the subway and wanted to talk to people. He approached two young black men \u2013  and I will describe them because it is an example of how an acceptance of racial diversity doesn\u2019t automatically relate to an acceptance of  ability diversity  (or disability). The autistic man approached them and was talking to them \u2013 it surprised the two young men. They looked at the autistic man oddly and began to laugh at him. I realize that they were surprised and didn\u2019t know what to do, and oftentimes nervousness manifests in a cruel laughter. Then, I thought that the right thing to do would have been just to say hello to him \u2013 that he was just trying to be friendly even if his way wasn\u2019t typical. This too caught me by surprise today \u2013 I was reading a book and thought, if my timing was right, I would have walked down and just said, \u201chey guys, maybe you could have just said hello. He looked like he was trying to be friendly. There are a lot of autistic people\u2026yada yada.\u201d  If we could stand up for others in history, isn\u2019t it also time we stand up for disabled people when the situation warrants?

{"date": "2014/11/11", "body": "We at  The Autism Acceptance Project  will be addressing the following: We need to discuss problems with autism programs, our communities (including schools) and inclusion. There is continued segregation and fissure within the autism community over the notion of recovery and independence. Our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 15, states: Equality Rights \n Marginal note:Equality before and under law and equal protection and benefit of law \n 15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. \nMarginal note:Affirmative action programs \n (2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. (84) It is, therefore, everyone\u2019s duty to accommodate \u2013 equal rights means the right to be included. While Section 15 and other instruments exist and rights are stated, they are still not enacted. There are a lot of conditions for the participation in many programs, many of them made for the autistic population, and of course in our community-at-large. A recent court case cited this issue ( Moore vs. British Columbia ) whereby it was noted that remediation  before  the right to inclusion is  not  inclusion; this is in effect, discrimination. In fact, the term is  adverse effect discrimination whereby the concept of remediation is a barrier to participation and inclusion. We can point to many autism services that segregate, punish, or attempt to normalize the autistic citizen as such.    In Moore, this statement was made although not highlighted enough.  The disability community must be involved in shaping the meaning of accommodation, and they are missing from the discourse in cases like  Moore v. British Columbia, 2012.  In short, remediation is not accommodation; the former can be viewed as a disciplinary term and the latter must be created in accompaniment with disabled people to enable disabled people.  The case of  Moore  can be scrutinized in more depth regarding the ontological constructions in policy and law that continue to exclude people with disabilities in the school system and in other programs. Problematic is our notion of independence as a criteria for participation and enabled (or supported) participation in the community. As a result, many autism programs, and of course universities and schools,  maintain  this barrier to participation. It happens when human assistants (appointed and/or approved by the autistic person) are not allowed to accompany autistic citizens; when children are segregated into autism classrooms; and when many folks who have significant challenges are not provided access under the assumption that they are not able  because  they are in need of support. Such assistance is akin to the deaf requiring an interpreter, however, our notions and associations around independence remain the foundation under which exclusion still occurs; such notions require our demolition. These  conditions  to participation are neither accommodation nor equality. This is also supported by Rioux and Frazee: \u201cEquality under s. 15 entails much more than simply \u2018accommodating\u2019 persons with disabilities into existing societal norms and structures leaving unscrutinized those norms and structures themselves. Substantive equality challenges the very existence of mainstream structural and institutional barriers, including the socially constructed notions of disability which inform them. For persons with disabilities, equality means the right to participate in an inclusive society. It does not mean the right to participate in mainstream society through the adoption of non-disabled norms.\u201d  (Rioux and Frazee, 1999). If you attended the talks and film screenings in Toronto with the film\u2019s subjects Larry and Tracy ( Wretches & Jabberers ) \u2013 autistic people who type to communicate and require assistance \u2013 it becomes clear(er) that most autistic individuals who are given access to assistance and communication devices with support can participate. It also becomes clear the levels of injustice that take place everyday for citizens who struggle with speech and physical differences. However, most of our therapies are built to make the individual as independent or non-autistic as possible. We require a standard (and law) by which service and assistance supports the rights of the autistic agent to be included. We know that many people will never \u201cmeasure up\u201d (as we like to think that they can be normalized through isolating intensive interventions) to become fully independent, but can enjoy life and participate given opportunity and access. By segregating autistic people and putting these conditions on their participation, we as a Canadian society are devaluing the autistic citizen.  We will be discussing ways and means to address this barrier, and call into question organizations (many of them autism organizations themselves who claim to provide services that are funded by the public purse) who provide a  qualified  inclusion \u2013 to those people whose bodies appear and behave as \u201cnormal\u201d as possible. There will be thousands of autistic Canadians who will, as such, never achieve the quality of life that the Charter states, is their entitlement.

I have offered to post the letter created by my colleauge, Tracy Mack: September 1st, 2014 marked the 35th year of the Mimico Lunatic Asylum/Lakeshore psychiatric hospital, now Humber College, closing their doors. In 2008 or 2009, Toronto psychiatric survivors were outraged that Humber was leading ghost tours on Halloween through the tunnels of the historic asylum for a fundraiser for Sick Kids\u2026they were able to stop this event from occurring. Last year, on Halloween they had ghost and tunnel tours. This year they have renamed the tour to the Lakeshore Campus Tunnel Tour. This has to stop. And the connection between Halloween and Lakeshore must be severed. The tour was done at the end of September this year as well , and it was rife with ghost stories. Whether the campus is Haunted or not is another matter, but the facts presented in this article are skewed and at times even totally inaccurate. I\u2019d like to share with you a few quotes from an article online, it is written by someone who took the tour this past September: \n\u201cBefore the tour began, Bang told the group to look out for an orb. Apparently, the orb people see in the tunnels is actually the nurse who hung herself after being caught for having an affair with a patient.\u201d This is made up folklore, made up stories. Absolutely. \u201cAbout halfway down the hallway, we stopped to look at the foundation of the walls. Built with different materials, Bang told the group that management at the psychiatric hospital had the patients build the tunnels themselves in order to keep them occupied and to keep their minds off being institutionalized.\u201d Right\u2026TO KEEP THEIR MINDS OFF BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED!\u2026this was unpaid patient labour and a form of \u2018therapy\u2019. It took patients 8 years of hard manual labour to build the buildings and the tunnels. After inmates built the buildings and tunnels, they also repaired the buildings, transported coal into the asylum, washed and mended their own clothing, worked on the farms, and gardened all in the name of work therapy, if it can seriously be so named, goes beyond the limits of justice and is instead an outright exploitation of patients\u2019 labor. There are, less than a mile away, 1511 mostly unmarked graves, all inmates who died while institutionalized. Yet, this is not ghostly enough to speak about \u201cUpon seeing a series of indents above the walls, someone asked what they were. Bang explained that the indents were once windows. The hallways were only lit by candle at night and natural sunlight by day. In fact, the working patients often sat and ate their lunch while basking in the sunlight from above.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, but I doubt there was much \u201cbasking in the sunlight\u201d. \u201cFurther down the hallway, we came across many rusted bolts in the wall. \u201cThose bolts used to be for shackles,\u201d said Bang. Patients were shackled to the wall when they were having an \u201cepisode\u201d \u2013 as Bang put it. Basically, men and women sat with their hands banded together by shackles while they screamed in the glow of the candle-lit hallways.\u201d What is an \u201cepisode\u201d ? And the institution was separated by gender: men and women would not have been \u201cbanded together by shackles while they screamed in the glow of the candle-lit hallways\u201d. Conjecture and folklore, combined with bullshit. \u201cNext we saw a couple of caged cells in the walls. Bang said the rumour is that the jail cells were for naughty patients. Secured with thick beams from ceiling to floor, the jail cell is said to have held patrons that got into many physical fights.\u201d What is a \u2018naughty\u2019 patient? And this is rumour and conjecture. \u201d Despite not seeing any dead nurse orbs, I was intrigued by the stories of the people who lived and worked here. Imagining how they suffered, abandoned from society, most of them dying unnamed.\u201d Well, at least they do get one thing right \u201cIf you are interested in taking the tour, Bang will be guiding groups down into the tunnels on Halloween night. You might be in for a treat! Bang said the tour groups that come at night frequently experience the so-called orbs. In other words, a dead nurse is waiting for you to walk her hallway.\u201d Folklore, made up ghost stories, and unfounded rumors which are then presented as historical facts. \nThe outrage that is being felt throughout the psychiatric community, again, is premised on the connection between Halloween and the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital. That connection is wrong. It\u2019s wrong on any day to perpetuate these ghost stories but on Halloween, the people who take the tours are looking to be scared and for ghost stories. This year they have downplayed the theme of the tour\u2026 naming it as Lakeshore Campus Tunnel Tour, which is impeding our ability to have it cancelled. However, the name does not make a difference, whether it is framed publicly as a ghost tour (as it was last year) or as a tunnel tour\u2026 This Halloween \u2018event\u2019 is a sad reminder that, despite changes in public attitudes, stigma and discrimination are still alive and kicking, is based on the myth that people who are diagnosed with a psychiatric diagnosis are \u2018scary\u2019. We all enjoy a joke, but when they come at the expense of those within the psychiatric community, who struggle everyday with the sanism/stigma, discrimination, and oppression, it does real harm. Halloween attractions based around \u2018mental patients\u2019 or \u2018asylums\u2019, fuel the deep rooted misconceptions that still surround psychiatric diagnoses. \u201cImagine how you\u2019d feel if you, or a member of your family, had just been in a psychiatric hospital and were enjoying a fun day out, only to be faced with this type of \u2018entertainment\u2019? \u201d Hundreds of people died in there, people were tortured with ECT, lobotomies, and shock therapy\u2026 35 years ago\u2026 some people who were inmates there could still be alive and for others their children or other family members could be. These events, erase the history of the inmates, the history that fuels how this community still have their rights taken away by being forced to take mind altering drugs and involuntarily commitment. Ghost tours would never ever be done in a residential school, yet in terms of psychiatric patients, our histories of abuse and torture are not valuable or deserving of the respect that other marginalized communities do. The history needs to preserved and the untold stories embedded within those walls need to be respectfully heard, the real stories. How do we respect and memorialize a past such as this? Algoma University is one example. Algoma University in Sault Ste. Marie Ontario, the main building, was the Shingwauk Residential School that closed in 1970. The university runs an archive on residential schools, they have gathered the records of many people who were incarcerated there and in other residential schools. The university offers not only courses but a degree program in Anishinaabe studies. In every class, in every department, Native Studies are intertwined within the courses\u2026 as a former student of Algoma\u2026 I left not only with a degree in my respective area.. but a wealth of invaluable knowledge in regards to Aboriginal issues\u2026.this is how histories filled with abuse and torture should be memorialized\u2026 What this highlights is that as Humber had to cancel this one year due to the outcry of the community\u2026 that the exploitation of that history for publicity and capitalist gains is more important than respecting people deemed as having a psychiatric diagnosis. We would like to encourage you to challenge this event, to challenge how it serves to reinforce negative views of those who experience psychiatric diagnosis while concurrently erasing the history of psychiatric inmates, by complaining directly to the Principal of Humber College, Wanda Buote, through e-mails, through phone calls and lastly, if we cannot have it halted\u2026 to join us at Humber College for a protest on Halloween night.

{"date": "2014/11/05", "body": "Adam is typing a deluge of sentences, feelings, anger at being ignored by certain people; upset by some people in his life that still do not \u201csee his mind,\u201d as he puts it. As Adam\u2019s parent and protector, I know there is good reason to share our journey and good reason to protect Adam\u2019s growth by not sharing too much. I am cognizant of his consent so I will make hints and speak generally.  We all know that there are people who like to doubt and target the autistic child or adult.  Adam has a cadre of supporters around him as he is learning to assert his rights and self-advocate now as a more fluent typist. The flood gates are opening and hopefully the people in his life will pay attention. Despite his prolific writing, there are many who don\u2019t. I was disappointed to read that an autism school, after having seen the movie  Wretches & Jabberers , ream off reasons why it is so necessary for autistic people to become independent. We have a huge problem as we still cite autism as a problem in our society (mostly because of a lack of independence) and this makes it hard for many to live good lives. A blog post is not enough space to qualify what makes a good life, or how the notion of freedom and individualism is also a part of the disability rights movement itself. I will just go on briefly about the state we are in without those qualifications. Instead of talking about rights to access, inclusion and support, our communities continue to discuss ways to make people independent before the right to inclusion and participation in society. There is a major flaw with this premise in that for most, this will result in permanent exclusion and segregation into special schools and disability centres. One method to reverse this may be to make it mandatory for acceptance and support to enable the right to be included, but of course we need a value system to buttress this. Until we understand how autistic people can be enabled, and how they wish to be supported, we usually set the stage for an inequitable and unjust relationships whereby the people who \u201cteach\u201d autistic people put themselves in a superior role of remediator (therapist, teacher, etc). This means that we believe that the normal body and behaviour is considered the \u201cright\u201d way to be in society. We have to understand the necessity of support before we go further, and seek counsel from autistic people in how they wish to be supported.This happens in our everyday interactions, as every behaviour is a mode of communication. Good support that is grounded in understanding rights, the theory behind that, and more pointedly, the movement differences of many folks with disabilities helps us to understand the need for support (there are more points to be made but I just wrote these to be a starting point for discussion). However, we also have to remember that the supports are not universal because there is no monolithic autism. It is this tension about competing needs in the service industry that makes this complicated. Not every autistic person requires the same support, but everyone does require the same access and rights. Rights requires a more detailed discussion too, but again, I am writing from a basic premise that our rights in society are established even though they not always acknowledged or enacted. Sometimes support can enable people to become independent. Other times, it can enable that much more independence than before, but not absolute independence. Of course, this is a fractured notion since none of us are independent. We can think of a myriad of examples of how we are all connected despite our heralded idea of individualism and the notion of freedom associated with this. By way of  philosopher Charles Taylor , I quite agree that our modern notions individualism and freedom are tied in with  instrumental reason , that is, a means to an end. In ordinary terms that relate to autism and independence, this means that the heralded modern ideal makes it incumbent to be independent to be included and to work (the means, to be independent, becomes the end, a person who costs less and is efficient to producing goods in a market economy as it is today). As such, the  ideal  is exclusive and does not work for the majority of autistic people. What we will have left after the misguided premise will be more need for adult services which continue to segregate and have done nothing to enable communication, choice, and participation. The film  Wretches & Jabberers   certainly promotes the idea of the independent mind \u2013 but that mind is enabled by support. It refutes the assumption that a cogent mind and a fluent body must co-exist. We learn that the body will often not do what the mind is thinking, and that the body also has its own unique ways of knowing through movements we call \u201cinappropriate\u201d (the term \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d should be reserved for people who inflict ill will to another). Without support, many autistic people who have movement difficulties, inability to speak, and other difficulties, would never gain access to any communication whatsoever. In turn, it is equally unjust to take an autistic person\u2019s voice away when a therapist or a support worker wishes to be successful in helping the autistic person to the point that it enables the therapist\u2019s own career. For example, in many therapeutic settings, a therapist will do certain things to over prompt the autistic person to gain a positive outcome or may falsify data results. This happens with supported communication just has much as it happens in ABA and with other methods. A \u201cbest practice\u201d seems to me to take all of the above into account to ensure that the checks and balances are there to test the support worker more than the autistic person \u2013 which requires a rights-based approach. Supported communication\u2019s time has come as more and more autistic children gain access with support and later do become independent. Maybe this is more so than in the 1990\u2019s because many have matured from childhood to become regular and mostly independent (through typing) communicators.(For the time being I am not going into the problems of a positivist to this). It is this  burden of proof , incumbent on the autistic body, that has sadly been necessary as a result of a doubting public on the intelligence of individuals who cannot speak, or who make \u201cinarticulate\u201d sounds and effusive bodily movements. However, let us not withdraw support for those who require the assistant or aide worker to contribute, work and communicate. For many, this interdependency will be vital to life. In this sense,  plenty of proofs  (as quoted from the film) are not enough. We need a proof of commitment from every person in society; we need the proof that autistic rights/disability rights mean something in Canada. We need to be able to enforce those rights.  So this obviously, I hope, points to something I think we all need to discuss: ourselves. What is it about society that keeps autistic people from participating as autistic people? What assumptions do we make about disability and belonging and why is most of it lip service and not action? What is a rights based approach to helping autistic people? Why are we avoiding helping people to use devices? One thing I have learned is that we learn to include by including. Adam is severely autistic and intelligent and has so much he wants to offer. He has friends. He complains about being ignored by some people who likely assume that he doesn\u2019t understand. These complaints suggest something very wrong with our assumptions that despite the work of autistic people for us to hear and see them, continue to be ignored. Why? What more proof do we need? Now I come to the  who benefits  question. I\u2019ve written about this before, as have many writers and theorists. Perhaps we have to take a look at the industry we have created from the vulnerabilities of others. Who is getting paid? Who is getting attention or even celebrity in the autism world and why? I\u2019m fed up with an expert culture feeding upon parent\u2019s imaginations and pocket books.  As I see and do in our own autism lives here in Toronto, education and access can work. We are living and breathing examples of it. But ours is a hard-work story. It\u2019s not a cure story, and not one that feeds into celebrity culture. Every day I work to figure out why and who this can be made accessible to the many families who are in need of support, but either are drained financially or must be subservient to a program that they must take or get nothing else. You may think at this point that it costs too much. Indeed, that\u2019s the economic cost to society argument that comes at a great cost to many. It is inhumane. The great cost is continue to promote a method of therapy fueled by an attitude that continues to segregate.  We tend to concur with an argument that abuse perpetrated by aide workers happens because of economic reasons \u2013  that the worker is being paid too little. I realize this could be a topic of its own, but I can\u2019t resist inserting it here. How can we accept this low standard for disabled people?  We would not accept this for children, but over and over again we hear it happens to disabled people and write off the story instead of talking about our collective ethical responsibility to improve our attitudes and values towards the disabled in our society. And this needs to happen among people who are not touched by disability as much as within disabled families. The only way we can make it happen is together. The only way we can improve our lives is to change the way we discuss autism and society. I would love to have a voice loud enough to make a call to all schools and autism organizations, parents and autistic people, to include these discussions in the autism agenda; perhaps I can only hope some people will take what they need from this and many other posts written by autistic people. We need to come together to create this collective voice! Very often these policy documents are centred around therapy and services. Ethics, value, inclusion are sidelined by discussions about how to make the autistic person independent through therapy. I believe that a person-centred approach could be focussed more on these autistic rights and ethics discussions. The question is, why hasn\u2019t it?  Rights is not necessarily (and most definitely not exclusively) about the right to therapy but the right to be autistic and included. In the meantime, since these rights are established (although not acknowledged for autistic people in Canada as we can see by our public institutions) we must do everything to provide access to communication tools beyond a PECS system. Autistic people are intelligent and the spectrum notion is highly misguided in terms of our understanding of people, yet it satisfies the need for a quick summary of autistic people for non-autistic people. We must also urge people to  rid the notion that the autistic person will miraculously one day type clear thoughts or speak \u2013 it is unfair for the autistic people and supporters who toil to communicate. This is not to say that an autistic person will not come to speech later in life. Indeed Adam can talk the more he types but talking is different than typing. You can read up on that yourself. Not all autistic people will ever be able to talk even though they will be able to type (notice my assertion). As many will attest who have learned to type, it\u2019s a long and arduous process for both the typist and the supporter. Adam is now 12 and is just beginning to really express complicated things. We\u2019ve been at it since he was 4, and we still have a ways to go. This is the kind of patience, perseverance and belief that all of us require to support the autistic person into adulthood. I know that Adam will go on in his education, so long as we can fight for the right for him to be classroom at either college or university. As Adam grows and learns now that he is out of autism classrooms, I can say safely that it\u2019s not a matter of  if , it\u2019s a matter of  when . This is also the case for his speaking up to the people in his life and about his own experiences as a person who has had to live with this autism label and all that it comes with. I am not underestimating the ongoing challenges that he will have to contend with, and how I will have to support him in this. I am often enraged by our culture that perpetuates despair for families instead of supporting them in making all of our \u201cautistic lives\u201d good and contented ones. It takes a fight to avoid the pull of \u201cexperts\u201d who will insist that your child has the \u201cintelligence of a 5 year old,\u201d or from the doctor who, after an 18 second observation will tell you that your child\u2019s tics require psychotropic medication (the list goes on). For certain, every person\u2019s situation is different and will require different supports, but the point is that too often we let the medical profession and the medicalized therapeutic professions do this to us and we all need more empowerment and support to critically think about what it is that prevents our children from being in a classroom to being out in the community with all kinds of people \u2013 not just fellow autistic ones.  It is better to find someone who will spend time and listen with us, start with conservative approaches, and of course, put the rights of the child first.  We must find each other for support along the way. While I get fed up with the barrage of public  opinion  (indeed another flaw of modern culture that insists that individualism is associated with this free opinion) that suggest that independence is of utmost importance and the underlying prejudice (and thus barrier)  that exists within that statement, I think that we have a lot more work to do. Sometimes we have to be brave in this and say it like it is.\n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(philosopher)", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_rationality", "http://wretches&jabberers.org"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2014/11/05/a-rights-base-approach-for-autism/", "title": "A Rights-Base Approach for Autism"},

The vocal component began about a year and a half ago with grunting \u2013 I wrote a piece to be published about my perception and response to it for a peer-reviewed journal. As it was accepted with an editing requirement, Adam\u2019s grunting turned to full-on screams and my attention turned to that as my role became to help him emotionally, but also amp up his accommodations and preserve his spot in school. This accompanied an angst at school which was swiftly resolved thanks to a number of people committed to him. As Adam\u2019s communication by typing has concurrently advanced, it is an important conflation  \u2013 between an expressive burst and the body\u2019s struggle to produce it not only verbally, but also to coordinate every aspect of the body to produce it by typing. Part of Adam\u2019s tics are evidently language and emotion related \u2013 charged and urgent expressions and also impulsive and involuntary. Both can occur. This is how I understand it so far and how Adam has expressed his experience to me. You can imagine that struggling to verbally communicate, involuntary body movement, motor issues are challenging for him \u2013 a fellow who is bright, eager and intelligent. It is equally frustrating for him to be called on it or deemed behaviorally inappropriate or asked to be quiet; he was more often assumed to be not listening, learning or paying attention as he soaked up knowledge.

The denial and sensationalism of the wrong-doing here is disturbing. The response (see below) appears to dismiss the disabled and psychiatric survivor experience and seems counterpoint to the recent admission of wrong-doing by the province and a $35 million class action lawsuit won by the victims of the  Huronia Regional Centre , otherwise known as the Orillia Asylum. The letter below from the College also does not have a sense of this gravity and does nothing to dignify the memory of those who lived there which we consider an uncritical approach. Please help write and stop these tours as they are in order to respect those who passed there, and what they endured. Here is the video promotion of their \u201ctours\u201d: And here is the response (form letter) that many of us who are trying to stop the tours received from Wanda Buote: One of your classmates also emailed me today. Our intent is not to be degrading but a vehicle to allow  our students into the tunnels to hear more about the history of our grounds. Many students have asked for assess to the tunnels as they are fascinated with it and want to learn more. We only open the tunnels during Doors Open Toronto and Culture Days. Yes, there is some folklore associated with the grounds but it not something we focus on. The Lakeshore Campus has a much more interesting story to tell\u2013one which surpasses illusion and fantasy. The event is called the Lakeshore Tunnel Tours and focused on the architectural and history of the hospital. Steve Bang volunteered his time, so that money raised could be given to the United Way. United Way is an amazing charity as it supports so many disadvantaged populations \u2013 such as youth, seniors, addictions and others that are facing barriers including the mentally ill. Humber is working hard to reduce the stigma around mental illness. We have come a long way since the 1800s but we recognize that work still needs to be done. \n As a part of the tour, participants are provided with information about the original buildings, which would become our Lakeshore Campus, were once part of the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital. When the hospital opened in the late 1800\u2019s, it was considered a progressive institution with advancements in moral therapy; patients were actively tending to the grounds, working on an on-site farm, and assisting in operating the facility. The apple orchard which many of the patients attended is still growing  at Lakeshore.  \n As the hospital moved into the mid-1900s, insulin shock therapy was introduced as a form of treatment (Barc, 2005). As we continue to filter through archival materials associated with the hospital, we cannot ignore the conflicting perspectives of medical treatments and human rights.  Without the technologies and knowledge that we have today, patients were often diagnosed and institutionalized for conditions as rudimentary as sun stroke. They were referred to by doctors as \u2018stupid\u2019 and other derogatory terms which are stamped on patients\u2019 formal records.  This history is not unique to the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital; it was commonplace language and practice which saw parallels at many other psychiatric institutions across Canada at the time.   \n Aside from these tensions, the hospital held a strong place in the surrounding community. Jem Cain, Humber staff member and local resident, grew up while the hospital was still operational. She says, \u201cThe hospital was part of the community, people were never afraid of the hospital or patients. Everyone felt that their kids were safe playing in the grounds since it was a beautiful park that integrated the hospital with the public\u201d. When the hospital closed in 1979, the community respected these grounds and advocated to government to preserve its heritage.  \n Although the hospital was considered progressive for its time, we now exist in a very different context. This new context does not see this campus as the backdrop to horror stories, but thinks critically about the stigma and stereotype of mental illness. The Lakeshore Campus will open a new Welcome Centre in 2016, which will host an interpretive space about the campus history. It will be a place which does not hide, misrepresent or glamorize the past, but instead uses our history to create a broader community consciousness. It will look at not only the past, but be a place of active engagement where visitors can reflect on the present and envision the future.  \n Wanda \n Wanda Buote, B.

Like the birth of the asylum, these autism and disability centres are often coined as wonderful and peaceful places for people to socialize, develop vocational skills and reintegrate into society \u2013 as  forward-thinking by the non-autistic and  non-disabled communities. When we forget  what  institutions were, the principles and values that gave birth to them, and the real abuses that occurred behind their walls, we forget the people who lived in them. It appears the Humber College Campus cares more about the flattened accounts of the people who lived without the institutional walls which counts as an act of erasure. As such, we will continue to see institutional rebirth in different forms and language (i.e. like the word \u201ccampus\u201d to replace \u201cinstitution\u201d which can manifest in the same outcome).  By doing this, we not only risk stigmatization, segregation and criminalization of people with cognitive and other disabilities and \u201cmental health\u201d issues, but we can guarantee it. Institutions are not just places, they are attitudes. In this sense, they exist when one person exerts their power and privilege over another; where disabled people are grouped together without choice; and where, behind closed doors many abuses can be obvious or subtle \u2013 some under the guise of \u201cintervention\u201d and \u201cremediation.\u201d We live in a time when autistic and other disabled people still struggle for inclusion and acceptance. There are many barriers to overcome, and to many of us, they feel like iron mountains. Sensational approaches help to proliferate very dire consequences for disabled people and we are witnessing  continued  segregation that just gets easier with making people with differences \u201cthe other.\u201d  It is important that Humber College reach out to the people who not only survived these experiences for their input, but also to the people working to restore the memory of these people and these places  \u2013  like  Huronia ,  The Burton Blatt Institute  and our very own  Geoffrey Reaume in Toronto  with an expertise in the history of institutions in Toronto \u2013 just so we never forget.

The letter, signed by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (IL-9), Rep. Tammy Duckworth (IL-8), Rep. Kathy Castor (FL-14), Rep. Jackie Speier (CA-14) and Rep. Paul Tonko (NY-20), expressed concern with lack of representation of autistic people in programs funded by the Autism CARES Act, recently passed legislation governing federal autism programs. \n The letter  notes the severe underrepresentation of autistic people on the Inter-Agency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC), which is responsible for overseeing all federal funds used on autism research, and in federally-funded programs on autism and other intellectual and developmental disabilities. The letter also expresses concern over the disproportionately small percentage of research funding that focuses on quality of services (2.4%) and adults on the autism spectrum (1.5%). \n \u201cHHS should take the opportunity posed by the Autism CARES legislation to address long-standing inequities in federal autism policy,\u201d said Ari Ne\u2019eman, President of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. \u201cWe applaud Rep. Schakowsky and the other signatories to this letter for their leadership in urging real inclusion of autistic people in federal autism policymaking.\u201d \n The signatories to  the letter  recommended increasing representation of autistic people and organizations run by them on the IACC, ensuring that autistic people participate in training programs funded through the law and other measures designed to enhance participation of autistic people in programs designed to serve them. \n The Autistic Self Advocacy Network is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization run by and for Autistic people. ASAN\u2019s supporters include Autistic adults and youth, cross-disability advocates, and non-autistic family members, professionals, educators and friends. Its activities include public policy advocacy, community engagement to encourage inclusion and respect for neurodiversity, leadership trainings, cross-disability advocacy, and the development of Autistic cultural activities.\n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10.28.14-Autism-CARES-Implementation-Letter.pdf", "http://http://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10.28.14-Autism-CARES-Implementation-Letter.pdf"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2014/10/29/asans-letter-regarding-under-representation-of-autistic-people-on-iacc/", "title": "ASAN\u2019s letter regarding under-representation of autistic people on IACC:"},

{"date": "2014/10/31", "body": "We got up a little earlier today to rush to get Adam\u2019s makeup on for Halloween here in Toronto. Adam decided to be a happy bear, so we came up with Happy Panda \u2013 it\u2019s also a story about mindfulness that we sometimes read.  It just feels right to show a happy little autistic guy, a preteen no less, who types to talk and gets excited like every other kid about Halloween. Adam is part of the whole process in deciding what he wants to be. Since Adam started typing at the age of 4, and is now 12, he has become more able to self-advocate and tell us a lot of what it is like to be Adam.  Here he is (below) inspecting my make up job\u2026 I must admit I wasn\u2019t sure if he liked it when it was all done\u2026 and I didn\u2019t have time to discuss it with him as we were rushing out the door. But he seems to be thinking about it here: Alas, in this next shot, Adam is a Happy Panda posing for the camera. Today at his (inclusive) school he will go trick and treating around to each classroom. It\u2019s raining in Toronto, so it is unlikely he will go out tonight with his dad\u2026 I\u2019ll miss Halloween with Adam this year. It\u2019s the first year  ever  I\u2019ll miss it with him.  I hope all autistic families will enjoy their Halloweens if they want to. I never believe in forcing our kids to do things that are expected, but at the same time, I also believe in inclusion and participation in ways that the kids can and want to participate. I always tried not to expect too much when Adam was little. We stayed in one Halloween when he preferred to hand out candies rather than going door-to-door. That remains a really fond memory because Adam chose to do this and he enjoyed it so much. Before he could self-advocate with words, I gave Adam an array of choices,  making costumes that reflected his interests. Since Adam was deemed hyperlexic and loved numbers and letters ,  I stitched letters and numbers to his clothes and named him \u201cAlphabet Boy\u201d \u2013 indeed my kind of superhero.  This year, it helps a lot in all activities to make up our own social stories so that Adam knows what is expected, and I have him participate in writing them by making choices before decisions are made. This can involve all the steps that are made from ringing a door bell to what to say, to how many doors Adam can knock on so he feels a little more secure about how the evening is constructed. It\u2019s also part of why I like the process of making Halloween costumes (although I\u2019m not that talented at it, I still enjoy it) because it gets him involved and a chance to anticipate and be a part of any given event. Two years ago, he wanted to be a ghost, and we managed to make together a Tim Burtonesque version\u2026 he loved that one; in fact I think he\u2019s channeling Tim Burton again this year! Here\u2019s a photo of that costume: And another year, he fell in love with a cowboy costume from the store \u2013 he wore that one two years in a row: It\u2019s been a joy to watch Adam grow and develop over the years. Having an autistic child is wonderful to me, the challenges included as they have encouraged me to think outside of the box. Let\u2019s all make our Halloweens what we want or need them to be, and find our contentment with that!

{"date": "2014/12/29", "body": "This is a short post to wish all of you a happy holiday and New Year. Adam and I have had such a wonderful year \u2013 his wish now to write a book and all that progress with his typing. Finally out of the clutches of autism schools that haven\u2019t realized Adam\u2019s abilities, Adam is now doing his grade seven curriculum. Thanks to everyone who has supported us this year! It has been a joy for all of Adam\u2019s family and closest support staff to witness Adam\u2019s happiness and self-esteem that is noticeably changed since he talks more with friends and family by typing.  That said, despite proof, I am dismayed with \u201cautism programs\u201d here in Canada and the lack of activism we engage in as families. Compliance and normality still propel autism programs here, and rape a family\u2019s emotional and financial well-being with the empty promise of recovery, cure and a semblance of \u201cnormality.\u201d  I ache for families and more so for autistic children \u2013 many forced behind closed doors for hours a day in \u201ctherapy.\u201d This is no quality of life, no joy. This is child-abuse and unless we begin to identify the violence of these programs, little will change. When I think of a New Year, I spend most of my time thinking about the work that needs to get done. I think about what my obligation is as Adam\u2019s parent and it\u2019s not about therapy. It is our obligation as parents to understand the autistic community that is comprised of other autistic people. We are much more obliged to read and try to understand the experiences of autistic people for the positive development and growth of our children. The autism agenda (that is research and policy) is set by non-autistic people who are telling parents that is their obligation to do everything and anything to cure their autistic child \u2013 this spans from starving them from certain foods so they appear less autistic to forcing normalizing therapies. Even if in a situation (because true inclusion and acceptance is far from achieved in our country) where there  seems  to be little choice at  but to put a child in an autism school (typically with ABA therapy), a parent must do everything to find a learning and social situation that supports difference (and I realize that using that term risks totalizing) without the propensity and impulse to normalize. Sure, these are loaded sentences that I\u2019ve spent since 2004 working through (you can read them in the blog), but they need to be because the situation is not as black and white as most media outlets (I need to write that letter to the CBC!) and research outfits will have you believe. As a parent, I also have to pick my battles because there are so many to be had every single day. It is the reason why we can\u2019t write about every injustice everyday here on this blog (although I think about it). Instead, I am working with Adam and his team on delightful things \u2013 his words, his thoughts, and yes, his pain that he cites within a society that doesn\u2019t accept him. Even though that incites me, Adam is so full of love and acceptance for that very world in which he wants to belong. I\u2019d like to think that maybe I\u2019ve had a bit to do with that. Exposing Adam to autism conferences where most autistic people go (as opposed to the ones where researchers and parents go), has changed Adam in profound ways. I consider these to be in part, my parental obligation to him. But speaking of battles, at the moment, I\u2019m challenging a ski program here in Ontario that seems to be practicing a qualified inclusion.  Qualified inclusion  means that an autistic person needs to be independent before the right to participate. I\u2019m trying to explain to these folks the meaning of what I call for now, \u201cenabled participation.\u201d This suggests that many folks require their own chosen support staff (chosen and employed by the autistic person) in order to participate in ways also chosen  by them. This process takes time. Consent and choice is a multi-faceted process \u2013 not necessarily a  yes or no  answer. When someone is challenged with verbal communication, they require many opportunities to respond to how they want to live their lives. They require people who believe in them and who know how to support their movements and communication. When I mentioned to this ski program that excluding autistic people from autism programs is discrimination because it is qualified on the concept of normality, I received an email that Adam would be accepted on the ski hill. Since then, however, I\u2019ve received an email that Adam will \u201cbe assessed.\u201d At the moment, those criteria for assessment remain invisible to me; they have not disclosed their terms and I may only assume that independence is top of their list, even though they have accepted him with his assistant on the hill.  Such assessments need to be fully transparent.  When they are, we have the right to critique them (because we know that all assessments are based on discrimination and bias \u2013 that only verbal, normalized ways of participation and response are acceptable). I am not only a parent, but a scholar in this field being talked down to and to some extent, manipulated. One would think that many-a-program, to avoid human rights complaints in the future, would tap  my knowledge of policy and law and how to better \u201cthe autism program.\u201d Autistic folks and some folks working in Critical Disability Studies are able to provide this input for policy-making and this needs to be harnessed.  But\u2026 This is the struggle that we all face as parents and we have to understand that the rules are set by non-autistic people that want to make systems that befit them, not the autistic person. Remediation, cure, recovery, normality, independence \u2013 these are NOT criteria for inclusion. This is not substantive equality in the legal sense. Substantive equality enables the disabled person in their disability to participate as they are. So, I\u2019ve targeted a battle, a struggle. It is a frustrating process to trouble such organizational policies, but this is are real job as parents. Don\u2019t buy into the rubbish that autistic people are trouble and the \u201cproblem\u201d of autism must be eradicated. That\u2019s a backwards way to look at the issue. Instead, as parents who have long-supported damaging policies and educational/therapeutic models that autistic people have long been critiquing (as they have been hurt by them), it is time we turn our minds and our hearts to supporting our children, no matter what age, to change the rules that have long excluded them.  To that, I want to end by reiterating Adam\u2019s Christmas wish that he typed on Christmas eve: \u201cI wish for love and open hearts.\u201d  One must also believe that open hearts may open doors too. Wishing EVERYONE some joy admist these continued struggles.\n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2014/12/29/tidings-struggles-joy/", "title": "With Tidings of Struggles and Joy"},
{"date": "2013/12/18", "body": "There are days when I feel so grateful for the support Adam and I receive from the team, friends and family. My university is so supportive of our needs as well, allowing me a leave so I can lesson-plan for Adam and train him more in language and typing. With support since he was around five years old, Adam is now somewhat independent when conversations are not that open-ended and unclear. I can hand him a keyboard anytime and he can type his feelings or what he needs sometimes faster than he can speak the words.  I also learned that animating words makes them meaningful and is better than rote vocabulary instruction.  Adam, as a hyperlexic individual since we could hear him speak at 11 months of age, loves letters and words. I am going to work with my son\u2019s strengths. In so doing, I am training others in the process. Others watch how I do this with Adam and also learn to do it with him. I have no formal training other than personal study and my PhD work which focuses on semiotics and language and disability. This is my passion because of my son. Adam is heading into puberty and has issues with anxiety, but seems most frustrated at not being able to say what he wants to say. When he gets the words out, he says them forcefully, looking into my eyes and saying the phrases again and again until I say it back. He knows I\u2019ve understood him. I think it\u2019s the way he\u2019s been treated all of his life by us jabberers (dominant ordinary language users) in that we tend to repeat ourselves to autistic people who have trouble with ordinary language because we think they don\u2019t understand us. Adam is doing what we have been doing to him. When I say the words back, echo him, he is satisfied that his message is understood.  Phrases like, \u201cI can\u2019t wait anymore!\u201d can be met by me with an acknowledgement and a timer which settles his need to know how much longer he must wait for his desired activity or item. Also,  operation calm down  has worked. Adam is happier, the screaming tics abated. Following the stress and episode, Adam always emerges with more sentences (communication). I\u2019ve yet to hear anything from the neurologists on it, but we keep trying just in case. This is not to \u201ccure\u201d the autism as much as it is to ensure that Adam\u2019s health is attended to well; that we are not missing something. The health of the autistic person must be attended to as much as the non-disabled person. (Another topic about how to regard the autistic person might be better sought from autistic people themselves).  It was as if Adam was saying \u201cplease listen to me!\u201d and we have. Some of it was because he didn\u2019t enjoy a transition and the team and I will be working on this all year. That said, Adam is fairly flexible all things considered. We haul him on our travels, and I plan on taking him on many no matter what. I believe in respecting his difference and limitations while also helping him through without pushing too hard some days and knowing when to push because those days are so apparent. He loves to be with other people and to see new things. He loves being out in the world and engaged. It\u2019s in the manner we engage him that is important to expand his horizons. I want to thank my university for supporting us in making this the best year for Adam and I. Without the understanding of schools and universities, we might never be able to do this important work that does effect so many people with disabilities in that not every year can be a consistent, machine-like operation. Sometimes we need to step back and focus on our children, or our own disabilities. I am overwhelmed by my school\u2019s support. Thank you York University! I look forward to sharing my copious notes and experiences from the journey this year. As for Adam this year, my mantra has nothing to do with compliance. It is about cooperation, engagement, respect, \u201cmuchness,\u201d connection and yes, joy. Adam\u2019s learning can\u2019t happen without these principles.

{"date": "2014/04/08", "body": "I\u2019ve been sitting back and watching. While not all things are perfect, I have to recall what it was like in Ontario 12 years ago when I was first introduced to this social phenomenon called autism. CNN had numerous reports on the \u201cepidemic\u201d of autism; the MMR vaccine was blamed; there were numerous reports of questionable remedies that put autistic children in harms way; there were hate blogs written about autistic people and parents who wanted to love and support their children. \u00a0The blogesphere was not yet syndicated and contained burgeoning home-made blogs by people labeled with autism and we learned a lot from autistics who wrote them \u2013 about activism, identity, the right to be who we are in every neurological way. Indeed, neurology is a term of the times which has redefined difference (neurodiversity). Although this is critiqued by many of those belonging to the disabled community as the new normalizing term ( Lennard Davis,  The End of Normal: Identity in a Biocultural Er a, 2013 ) thereby losing its utility, \u00a0I suppose I belong to a group who believes that we might not have gotten to this place of questioning, and beyond an institutional disabled identity (i.e. segregated and isolated), without this renaming and reconceptualization.\u00a0To further highlight Davis\u2019 important question: \u201cIf we are now living in an identity-culture  eshatron  in which people are asking whether we are \u2018beyond identity,\u2019 then could this development be related in some significant way to the demise of the concept of \u2018normality? Is it possible that normal, in its largest sense, which has done such heavy lifting in the area of eugenics, scientific racism, ableism, gender bias, homophobia, and so on, is playing itself out and losing its utility as a driving force in culture in general and academic culture in particular? And if normal is being decommissioned as a discursive organizer, what replaces it?'\u201d (Davis, 1). Davis argues that diversity has become the new normal.He also makes an important point that there are some people who do not have a choice of identity, which, in my words, may dampen the concept of diversity for our community. In particular, disabled identities are not chosen. Perhaps we now have to think beyond identity and challenge the concepts of acceptance and community in a world where these lines are always expanding and contracting.  That said, I remember what my introduction was to autism. Mothers and fathers before me remember institutionalization. Parents advocate for a world where autistic children are accepted,  even if  in a neoliberal paradigm (in other words, while we can see its shortcomings, we still do many unpleasant things to survive). It seems the \u201cstrengths\u201d of autism at least are earning a place at the employment line, which then perhaps allows our children to get an education and better services. Perhaps our kids will be understood for their sensory, communication and social issues and not be reprimanded or judged for them. All these seem like good things. I would like to imagine a world where we  never forget  \u2013 where many of the younger generation of ABA therapists and teachers have no recollection of \u201cdifferent\u201d kids in their neighborhood suddenly disappearing. There is work to be done to educate people working in the field on the history of disability and institutionalization and how close we always seem to be to doing that again. Must we continue to ask why this is happening despite the advocacy for autism acceptance? And finally, in Davis\u2019 words: \u201cThere is a built-in contradiction to the idea of diversity in neoliberal ideology, which holds first and foremost each person to be a unique individual. Individualism does no meld easily into the idea of group identity. And yet for neoliberalism it is a must. In a diverse world, one must be part of a \u2018different\u2019 group \u2013 ethnic, gendered, raced, sexual. It is considered boring if not limiting, under the diversity aegis, to be part of the nondiverse (usually dominant) group. So diversity demands difference so it can claim sameness. In effect, the paradoxical logic is: we are all different; therefore we are all the same.  \n The problem with diversity is that it really needs two things in order to survive as a concept. It needs to imagine a utopia in which difference will disappear, while living in a present that is obsessed with difference. And it needs to suppress everything that confounds that vision. What is suppressed from the imaginary of diversity, a suppression that actually puts neoliberal diversity into play, are various forms of inequality, notably economic inequality, as the question of power. The power and wealth difference is nowhere to be found in this neoliberal view of diversity\u2026. Ultimately what I am arguing is that disability is an identity that is unlike all the others in that it resists change and cure\u2026disability is the ultimate modifier of identity, holding identity to its original meaning of being one with oneself. Which after all is the foundation of difference. \u201d (Davis, 13-14).\n While I acknowledge Davis, I find myself thrust into an acceptance paradigm that allows Adam to be in a classroom and in the community, however imperfect (requiring time, exhaustive and emotional effort, Adam\u2019s emotional effort and his \u2018trooper\u2019 ability among it all)  \u2013 and all of this based on proof of competence and ability as he counts money so fast that the adults in the room have to check to see if he\u2019s right (he is). I think it is great if we can enable others to see autism as a way of being in the world \u2013 sensory difference as not behavioral belligerence; non-verbal disability as not an unwillingness to speak or non-intelligence. To go on:  not looking at someone when they are speaking doesn\u2019t mean that the autistic person doesn\u2019t understand what is being said; not wanting or able to be social should not be isolating or a reason to segregate nor a reason to push one to be social just like everyone else. (So what I\u2019m saying is that as activists and/or advocates, we are still at this place). There are still so many misunderstandings in a moment with an autistic person, and one hopes that this marketing will help. I mean, we all have to survive, right? Adam\u2019s survival is no different than mine except that he is at a clear disadvantage despite \u201cneurodiversity.\u201d While recent autism advocacy is far better than I can remember 12 years ago, it remains services and employment based (and I am not at all suggesting we don\u2019t need to do this important work to discuss services and accommodations past the age of 21\u2026but we need to discuss this also in a much larger context). A discussion of the inequalities about which Davis and others speak must also be a topic to discuss the bigger picture of what we mean when we talk about inequality. Another part of this discussion might be to discuss all the the proofs that an autistic person has to demonstrate before earning a place at the school desk and in the boardroom \u2013 and a discussion why these suggest human value. These may not acquire the immediate services that people need but they are important to our evolution. We can do this while continuing to mine the various meanings of purpose.

{"date": "2014/03/21", "body": "I think many parents will agree that one of the most challenging things for families with autistic children are outings. \u00a0Adam\u2019s anxiety and repetitive activities increase over his perceived threats and fear of change; he will need to check out the bathroom in every restaurant; know where every door leads. This of course makes outings difficult, and it has a lot to do with impulse. At this point in our lives, Adam has been exceptionally tense \u2013 and I want to add that this coincides with his development, awareness and abilities too. This is a really important point to make up front in order not to treat behaviors by redirecting them in meaningless ways (such as touching your nose to replace a hair-raising scream\u2026this will just piss Adam off). One of the dangers with partially-verbal of non-verbal people, as we know, is that when behaviors start, there is a propensity to exclude or treat the autistic person as if they are not aware of what they need, or what they are doing. This is where adaptive communication has become very helpful for us since November. Adam has been typing for many years, but most ABA schools will not support supported typing \u2013 this is so problematic for folks with movement issues which Adam expresses \u2013 Tourettes tics, seizure-like episodes (and seizures are much more complex than one initially thinks), and \u201cstuckness\u201d which is catatonia. These are some of the reasons for speech impairments in many folks \u2013 similar to aphasia. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t think or understand or even \u201chear\u201dwhat we say but rather the word-finding and expressive capabilities through speech are not available. However with typing, Adam becomes more fluent in his speech. With support, he becomes, eventually, a more independent typist. In the meantime, he writes, \u201cmy body is like an engine that doesn\u2019t run continually,\u201dand despite that he can type some things independently he has asked for our support. To not give it to him is seen by many as immoral\u2026something to think about in terms of our own learning in how to support people to communicate in order to hopefully become more fluent and independent. (While I have issues with this latter notion as a neo-liberal concept, I acknowledge we are swimming against a tide here and in order to survive, Adam has to work hard to prove himself\u2026something else to think about in terms of how we treat the disabled). So, to go out when a person has frequent anxious or bolting episodes (the fight/flight response as we know it), now requires perseverance, patience and planning, and a respect for Adam\u2019s ability to participate in his daily planning. It also requires our time in letting him assemble himself if he begins to meltdown. For example, while on our March Break at the beach, Adam needed to go the bathroom. If there is a loud hand-drying in the bathroom, he will become anxious and turn right around. This anxiety lingered after the visit, and he began to flop his body on the beach. I told him to keep walking and tried to distract him, but at this point, it wasn\u2019t working. I asked Adam to sit down until he was ready again to walk. As we did, we began to feed the birds. This made Adam happy and then able, after 20 minutes, to walk again. Similarly, a week before on the same beach boardwalk, something triggered Adam and he wanted to urgently turn around. I could not understand what Adam wanted or needed so I asked him to sit down and type with me. This was difficult and he wanted to get up and bolt. I said he could not get up until we knew what he wanted. As he began to type, he was able to say what he wanted faster -\u201chot air balloon.\u201d At that point, I realized that there was a water tower that looked like a hot-air balloon far down the beach, however, I miscalculated just how far. As we began to walk, it was occurring to me that we wouldn\u2019t get there on foot. But Adam was so happy and relieved to be understood, and skipped merrily alongside his grandfather and I. I began to say to Adam that \u00a0I didn\u2019t think we would get there on foot, so at this point I was able to negotiate with him that we would go to dinner first and then drive by the \u201chot-air balloon.\u201d Adam was able to have a nice dinner and also get to see his hot-air balloon on the drive home. Today, my team are helping Adam on his outings with lots of preparation and photos and are working with me to practice outings with Adam in many places so Adam himself can feel more competent and less anxious. Every day while we were away, I insisted on taking Adam out, with someone with me for safety, because I fear that isolation is deadly. \u00a0This is where mall therapy begins but also has to end \u2013 so often, we only see autistic kids in places where therapists feels safe, and this sadly restricts the lives of many autistic folks. Some parents might be afraid to be stared at in public. This is when it\u2019s better to have a card to hand out to people indicating that your child is autistic and you are working on outings. Or, if someone is exceptionally helpful, as I\u2019ve experienced lately, send a thank you note if you can to support inclusion. While we may begin with mall therapy, we must move on quickly. As I was preparing Adam to see the animals today in the park, he typed, \u201cseeing animals is getting very tiring,\u201dand he asked to walk and take the subway instead. \u00a0This part of negotiation is also key to success for outings as people like Adam have a hard time advocating for themselves (although they do communicate with their behavior, which is largely viewed as maladaptive, sadly). I also have asked Adam how to support him in moments of need or meltdown where he wrote, \u201cplease be calm\u2026\u201d and indicated that these moments are also very embarrassing for him. \u00a0In addition to a bag of tools he has to help himself and cognitive behavioral therapy (which, by the way, is typically used on people who are verbal and are deemed \u201chigh functioning\u201d\u2018\u2026 Adam\u2019s ability to learn the concepts and techniques quickly rules out theories on HFA and verbal ability and the ruling out of such therapy for non-verbal people\u2026I hope a researcher who presents at IMFAR will pick up on this as most of the people  used  in research study tend to be from the HFA/verbal group due to cost and time constraints\u2026something to think about in terms of who we service, who we value, and how we treat autistic people). So the question is whether the mall is used to simply used to truly help autistic people be included in the world, a step towards many outings and environments, or if it excludes people from being in the world. Yes, it\u2019s a challenge for folks, and in the end, a person decides for themselves where they want to be. But if Adam doesn\u2019t learn now as well as being able to advocate his choices while learning to negotiate with others, our lives will remain behind closed doors. While I know this is hard for Adam, I also know that he doesn\u2019t want this. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2014/03/21/beyond-mall-therapy/", "title": "Beyond Mall Therapy"},

{"date": "2008/12/17", "body": "I\u2019ve decided to do some re-posts from my Joy of Autism blog which didn\u2019t get uploaded into the PDF version of the blog: Does Autism Research Support Humanity or Human Deviance for Profit? McMaster University is doing autism research. Autism Speaks raises a lot of money. Much of the money goes towards research to detect autism early or towards preventing or curing autism. The purpose of early detection is for early intervention. The concept of early intervention is derived from a medical model where the earlier diseases like cancer are detected, the better the chances of living. As a person recently diagnosed with early ovarian cancer, I can attest that in the case of mortality, I am thankful for early detection. However, in autism, the premise of early intervention isn\u2019t that much different \u2013 children begin to undergo a rigorous process of \u201cbecoming normal,\u201d and are taken out of regular daily life, because they are not deemed \u201cregular.\u201d They are viewed as sick. So it is with skepticism and partial interest for me to read of the recent research done at McMaster University of eye tracking as seen in The Globe and Mail today. The idea is that at nine months of age, we might be able to detect autism because it is assumed that autistic babies do not follow changes in eye direction. The early diagnosis is to find those children at \u201chigh risk\u201d for autism. I didn\u2019t know my son Adam was such a risk. A risk to whom? I have to assume he must be seen as a risk to society, even though our friends quite enjoy him and he is living quite well. If living well means to receive an aide to assist and a teacher who understands so an autistic person can learn, then I feel that that is where the money should be spent. I also can\u2019t say that he would have passed or failed that eye-tracking test and it\u2019s my guess that with the ranges of autistic people out there, the test will not be very reliable because there is not one general assumption in autism that is universal for every autistic person. Adam\u2019s eye contact seemed okay, maybe a little inconsistent. It was his play and interests that were different \u2013 the ones that also gave him an exceptional ability to read and correct his classmate\u2019s work because of his ability to SEE the things they cannot. Further, \u201cthe probability of a baby developing autism,\u201d would not apply to us. While individuals may develop autistic-like behaviours, it\u2019s not necessarily autism. I can attest that dear Adam has been autistic since birth and probably in vitro. His wide almond eyes were curious and clever from the moment he was born. His surroundings were already an assault on his senses. So where does this leave us? All this money being spent on finding earlier interventions to make our children less autistic? All this money being spent on tests that do nothing afterwards \u2013 they do not advance inclusion or eradicate fear of human difference so that our children receive fair and equal education and opportunity. No one is really working to understand and respect how autistic people learn so that our kids can become part of the world. No, early detection is still eerily angled at eradicating human difference. In her essay Age, Race, Class and Sex: Women Redefining Difference, Audre Lorde writes: \u201cMuch or Western European history conditions us to see human differences in simplistic opposition to each other: dominant/subordinate, good/bad, up/down, superior/inferior. In a society where the good is defined in terms of profit rather than in terms of human need, there must always be some group of people who, through systematized oppression, can be made to feel surplus, to occupy the place of the dehumanized inferior. Within this society, that group is made up of Black and Third World people, working class people, [autistic and other disabled people], older people, and women.\u201d [Brackets mine] She notes how it is the underclass, or oppressed groups, which autistic individuals have described themselves, that are expected to bridge the gap, change, be cured, act normal, rather than society who also makes a concerted effort to understand, accommodate and accept difference: \u201cAs a forty-nine-year-old Back lesbian feminist socialist mother of two, including one boy, and a member of an interracial couple, I usually find myself part of some group defined as other, deviant, inferior, or just plain wrong. Traditionally, in American society, it is the members of the oppressed, objectified groups who are expected to stretch out and bridge the gap between the actualities of our lives and the consciousness of our oppressor. For in order to survive, those of us for whom oppression is as American as apple pie have always had to be watchers, to become familiar with the language and manners of the oppressor, even sometimes adopting them for some illusion of protection. Whenever the need for some pretense of communication arises, those who profit from our oppression call upon us to chare our knowledge with them. In other words, it is the responsibility of the oppressed to teach the oppressors their mistakes. I am responsible for educating teachers who dismiss my children\u2019s culture in school. Black and Third World people [and autistic people] are expected to educate white people as to our humanity. Women are expected to educate men. Lesbians and gay men are expected to educate the heterosexual world. The oppressors maintain their position and evade responsibility for their own actions. There is a constant drain of energy which might be better used in redefining ourselves and devising realistic scenarios for altering the present and constructing the future.\u201d (P.p. 114-115 Audre Lorde, Sister Outsider, from her essay Age, Race, Class and Sex: Women Redefining Difference) Rather than focusing research on eradicating difference, it should serve to examine the way we come to base our research on human deviance and the way we include autistic people in participating in research and on boards of directors. (Must I mention that no school board here in Ontario has an autistic person on it??) \u201cToo often, we pour the energy needed for recognizing and exploring difference into pretending those differences are insurmountable barriers, or that they do not exist at all. This results in false and treacherous connections. Either way, we do not develop tools for using human difference as a springboard for creative change within our lives. We speak not of human difference, but of human deviance.\u201d (P.p. 115-116) We do not wish to refuse to see the challenges that face autistic individuals, but to re-imagine disability and autism. We spend so much of our energy mourning, eradicating, detecting and in the meantime, our children get locked out of schools, even \u201cspecial ed\u201d schools, or they can\u2019t go to camps with shadows. They are not allowed to go to school with aide dogs or devices. They are viewed as a disruption to the classroom. The barriers that exist do not lie within the autistic individual, the barriers lies in attitude.\u00a0 We spend so much money to re-affirm that autistic people are less valuable and more deviant and yet more prevalent than ever before. Autism Canada has mimicked the Autism Speak\u2019s style commercial to make autism appear like a horrible epidemic. They shamefully have objectified the autistic individual in order to raise money. Adam and every other autistic individual need not be objectified in order to be viewed as society\u2019s surplus, or an object for research funds. So far, I\u2019ve found little research that has actually shaped the lives of autistic individuals for the better. Adam is the best. He works hard, he is smart, and he can type now. He is human. He is different AND equal and once our autism research is developed on that premise, maybe, just maybe our children will no longer be used for profit as the \u201csurplus members of society,\u201d bur rather, be viewed as valuable and able to contribute to it.

We come into the world as the result of others\u2019 actions. We survive here in dependence on others. Whether we like it or not, there is hardly a moment of our lives when we do not benefit from others\u2019 activities. So it is hardly surprising that most of our happiness arises in the context of relationships with others. Nor is it so remarkable that our greatest joy should come when we are motivated by concern for others. But that is not all. We find that not only do altruistic actions bring about happiness, but they also lessen our experience of suffering. Becuase every action has a universal dimension, a potential impact on others\u2019 happiness, ethics are necessary as a means to ensure we do not harm others.\u201d I want to take this opportunity to thank all of my fellow Autism Hub bloggers, writers, friends and an online community that threads us all together.

{"date": "2008/12/15", "body": "A Post From The Joy of Autism, July 2008. Diversity training has begun on the popular airwaves. CNN\u2019s Black in America, with Soledad O\u2019Brian, aims to express the\u00a0 many sides of living as a black or bi-racial person in North America. Watching it, I see a similar theme that may be helpful for parents with autistic children. It is the comparison of being black and having a white child or vica versa. It is the experience of a parent without any disability or experience of it, who has a disabled child. If our children are \u201cnot like us,\u201d then who are they? To which community do they belong? I believe it is one of the major sources of tension out there \u2013 why the \u201crecovery\u201d movement is so strong, why acceptance is so difficult. While not accepting the status quo is great in terms of pushing for acceptance and inclusion of disabled individuals, it is not that helpful when the movement takes a turn to fundamentally change the individual\u2019s genetic make-up \u2014 to say, in essence, there\u2019s something ill, or wrong with you. You are sick and we have to fix and heal you. If we don\u2019t, your life will be hard. We\u2019ve heard it many times \u2014 there is a strong movement against calling\u00a0 disabled people ill. The medical model doesn\u2019t fit the human model. While medicine can help us feel better, it can\u2019t take human difference away. If it tries, it can\u2019t be successful. I\u2019m one who believes that any \u201cprogress\u201d in science will see its regression too. In other words, not only will there be ethical problems, but with every seeming \u201cadvance,\u201d there is also an antithesis. With the advent of our lives being extended, for instance, we have more disability \u2014 this is not to say that disability is wrong, however, with the extension of our lives, it is natural. If you are religious or believe in God, one might say that only God knows why he creates what he does. If you are secular, you might believe that there is meaning, value and importance in the grand scheme of things, and that is still, perhaps like God, ineffable. I believe that some of my family members have strong autistic traits. My father did not speak until he was six years old, for instance. He became an engineer and has exceptional eye for technological detail to the point of losing others when he talks about it. It is his obsession (sorry dad, but I think you are a brilliant). I crave alone-time and privacy and am much less social than my husband to the point that I think others may not understand me (I prefer to communicate more in writing and am not as reserved when I do so). As a child I used to play alone for hours and would twirl until I passed out (Adam does not twirl). I found idle chatter highly uncomfortable yet as I\u2019ve become older, I\u2019ve become better at persevering small talk. Like Adam, my obsessions have been words and letters. I invest in art with words in them or art that looks like it has been written upon. I am a big fan of Cy Twombly. I collect scrabble letters and typewriters. Because of Adam, my interests and habits have become more obvious to me. So, I guess Adam, who is autistic in a non autistic family, really does belong. We share the same physical features. We even share personality attributes. Yet, he has a label and I don\u2019t (which may suggest the nature of labeling and why so many people cringe with labels \u2014 they can help AND hinder). He is \u201cautistic,\u201d while the rest of his family \u201cis not autistic.\u201d He has a community that organizes conferences for and by autistic people. I cherish that for him. Maybe in a way, I even envy him. For the communities who must really stand and stay together become the strongest. I do not fully belong save for being his strongest ally. Some people get offended when they hear \u201cautistic person.\u201d Some prefer \u201cI am a person with autism.\u201d Without re-hashing this debate too much about person-first language, I don\u2019t think it matters how we put it. It\u2019s the manner in which we put it \u2013 the tone of our voice, and the way that that tone reflects how we feel about people, the words we put alongside autism. It matters that we all recognize that we are all the same despite our differences. We are all equal, even though our contribution and output may manifest differently. We all have the same rights, even if one person is less independent than another. It doesn\u2019t all fit into a nice convenient box, that may be true. As such, I like the comment made on the CNN blog about pride. Autistic pride, gay pride, we all know why those movements have had to spring into action: because there has been too much medicalization and stigma of both, and a need for society to become familiar with the paradox of difference and same-ness. There is no \u201cother.\u201d There are only variations of ourselves. So I found the hundreds of comments on this series really interesting in the context of diversity, pride, but most of all this sense of which culture do we become loyal to or do we identify with? In my view, why can\u2019t we belong to more than one?: Lynn Whitfield \nActress \nMy daughter Grace and I watched the premier of CNN\u2019s \ngroundbreaking \u201cBlack in America.\u201d I thought we would have \nlively discussions around many of the themes concerning black \nwomen in this country. However, when she saw the segments on \ninterracial marriage and the children of those relationships, she \nhad a visceral response. I saw an activist being born. Grace seemed ready to adapt James Brown\u2019s black anthem to \nher cause: \u201cSay it loud, I\u2019m blended and proud!\u201d I saw my \ndaughter stand up for the equality of blended people like herself \nin all her olive-complexioned, big curly afro-like glory. She went \nimmediately to the computer with dignity, passion and \neverything but a fist in the air\u2026 \n\u2014 \nAs a parent of biracial children, it feels really good to read such \nan article. That\u2019s exactly the way I want my children to be about \ntheir heritage: proud of both! It is definitely unfortunate that you have to make a choice \nbetween different races. There are still a lot of administrative \npapers which do not have an \u201cOther\u201d section. Very confusing for \nthe parents and children. But after all, aren\u2019t we all from Africa anyway? \n\u2014\u2013 \nI am proud of having a child with autism/an autistic child. I believe that being autistic forms an important part of his experience with the world around him \u2014 both from a sensory point of view as well\u00a0 as how he will be treated and regarded by others. He will grow a natural sensitivity to this and his ideas will be shaped by it. It is why I say that he is an autistic person. Jenny McCarthy, because she thinks autism is a disease, and is afraid of it like cancer, is appalled a the notion of calling a child autistic. I see her view as a denial of our children\u2019s right to be who they are and accepted for that. I personally think it is wrong for a parent to think disability, or autism, is a bad word. I think the disability community, much like race, do not identify with the cancer comparison in the sense of being ill, however, it is interesting to me, after being through a \nstage one cancer experience myself this year, that people with cancer will identify themselves as being \u201ccancer survivors\u201d in order to explain who they are by virtue of their experience with \ncancer. Going through cancer, as my mother and I can attest, indeed shifts something within you. The experience forms who you are. And I don\u2019t see the problem with that. I want Adam to be proud of himself as he is. He is part of a family who shares very many of his traits \u2013inward and outward \u2014 yet he also appears different in the way he expresses himself and moves. Autism may be similar to the experience of being bi-racial or \u201cblended,\u201d if you will. Autism is a part of all of us. Yesterday, Adam sat through the entire movie, E.T. Watching with him made me either believe Steven Spielberg is really autistic, or that the man really gets it. Usually, Adam can get into 30 minutes of a movie, and he\u2019s off doing something else. Yesterday, he would watch, then giggle, then roll around the couch, then snuggle with me \u2014 enough antics to make many adults think that he couldn\u2019t have been really paying attention, but I could tell he was. There were also moments when he would repeat the lines. He would watch the screen and be still. Therapists tend to use the same stories over and over again to assess an autistic person\u2019s comprehension of a story. And yet, when Adam sees something new, or more complex than people \nthinks he will understand, he really gets the gist of things. This typed conversation I had with him yesterday illustrates this: Me: \u201cAdam, I really enjoyed watching the movie with you today. Adam: i like toad. Me: what was the alien\u2019s name? Adam: et Me: E.T. had lots of feeling and a very big heart. E.T. had lots of \nlove for others. Adam: Et was the guy yes Me: E.T. could hardly speak. In a way, E.T. is like you. He \nunderstands but finds it hard to talk. Adam: E.T. was question Me: Do you think you and E.T. are similar? Adam: E.T. was the want Me: What is want? Adam: E.T. was the want to speak. Me: E.T. wanted to be able to communicate. What else did E.T. \nwant? Adam: et wanted to go away. Me: Where did he want to go? Adam: home. Me: yes, we all want to be home and be with people who are like \nus. Adam: i people.\u201d \n \nIndeed he is people, a person. Adam is Adam and he is all of us.

Handley (of Generation Rescue)  \u2014 yet again in the \u201cname of autism\u201d or to \u201cwage a war\u201d on it as it were, are STILL purporting their vaccine hypothesis \u2014 which, really,  is no longer deserving of being in  that  category, since it has been disproven over and over again. The \u201cbulking\u201d of vaccines or the \u201cschedule\u201d \u2014 all of it \u2014 are,  according to science, not the cause of autism.   Yet science doesn\u2019t seem to matter in all of this. People do not matter in all of this. Not the people who matter, anyway.  Jerry Lewis was recently heralded at the Academy Awards regarding his work \u201cfor\u201d people with disabilities \u2014 a man who used these words in a recent response to criticism of his annual Muscular Dystrophy Telethon: \u201cIf it\u2019s pity we\u2019ll get money. . . . Pity? You don\u2019t want to be pitied because you\u2019re a cripple in a wheelchair? Stay in your house!\u201d    Yes, a man who continuously spoke in derogatory terms about people with disabilities and dehumanized them stood proudly receiving his Oscar amidst the beautiful people at the awards.  There was no mention on how the disability community for years has protested Mr. Lewis and his telethons.  There was no reference to the pain and harm he has caused them.  The fact that Lewis used the kids (they went from being \u201cJerry\u2019s kids\u201d to adults who turned up for those protests and were kicked out by Jerry) was veneered and forgotten with smiles and gowns.    Celebrity trumps the hard work of science (when it works hard), dialogue, debate, justice  and intellect. Celebrity fails to question more often than not as exhibited yet again by Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey. I was somewhat relieved for a moment to see  Carly, the fourteen-year-old non verbal autistic Toronto girl who types.  She should have had more time on the the show along with other autistic individuals like her.  I am always much more interested in hearing the perspectives about simply \u201cbeing wired differently,\u201d because it is in learning how people are wired differently where we can appreciate that people can take in the world and learn on many different planes. And if that can happen, people can also  contribute  to the world in different and more rewarding ways as well. CNN has not yet taken the bull by the horn the way the CBC did in its show  \u201cPositively Autistic,\u201d (see it on the side bar in this blog).  CBC did not want non-autistic doctors talking or journalistic narration in order to trump what autistic people had to say about themselves because that was the point and it is too often overshadowed. CNN ought to take its cue, at least from the perspective of that particular documentary, from the CBC and from autistic people. I have been thinking for so long now that as much as we have medical and health components dominating the news, we should have a show on how society views difference (which would include disability) and has medicalized people who are different from whatever norm has been established at any particular point in our history. What\u2019s the purpose of information if we do not look at it through a variety of lenses? What\u2019s the point of medical research if we do not apply any ethical standards or reflect continuously on what it means to be human? I meandered the  Autism Hub  to see if anyone else has yet written anything on the torrid experience of watching these shameless celebrities sounding really idiotic, trying substantiate their claims with quacks who call themselves doctors, namely, the infamous Dr. Jerry Kartiznel who calls our children \u201csoul-less.\u201d Again, such programs revolving around \u201cAutism Awareness Month\u201d make me afraid.  But it\u2019s a nervous kind of laughter. Autism Awareness Month simply reminds me every year that no matter what we do, no matter hard hard we work in trying to make people aware that autistic people are simply people, that IGNORANCE still SPEAKS loudly attempting to drown the real voices of autism. While I am not autistic, I am a parent who will remain relentless in positioning myself against such ignorance.

{"date": "2009/06/02", "body": "It is no secret that divorce is overwhelming. Add to that being ill, moving, or receiving that \u201cautism diagnosis\u201d about five years ago has made my recent life path rather bumpy \u2014 a list of to-do\u2019s and goals and I\u2019m getting tired. If living our lives \u201cauthentically\u201d (a popular word used so much today) is a goal, I might suggest that the way we live is anything but. As a mother of a special needs child, there is more work as our children depend on us for longer periods of time. I\u2019ve devoted my life to Adam, and maybe even garnered some of my identity from that. Yet, how can parents, especially those of us who strive to seek acceptance and advancement for our children in society create a balance? How can I still give to Adam all that I can, be the good parent, AND take care of my own needs, AND contribute to the world? I may have found part of the answer in the bigger picture. The self-help books are okay, but they all seem a little saccharine. Sure, there are some good tid-bits of advice here and there \u2014 perhaps we all need to read them when we are in moments when the waters are just too deep. As friendships dissolve (a natural consequence in divorce is losing \u201ccouples friends\u201d), and I think I\u2019ve gone as lonely as I can go, the insights and work of others have held me up.\u00a0 It keeps me steady. It enables me to think about the future that is greater than my own issues, but also not whole without them, and that beckons me to become more  a part of it. \n As any parent \u2014 special needs or not \u2014 we are all familiar with the daily to-do lists and tasks that keep us running but make us feel empty. What have we achieved? Do we do our daily tasks with a level of intention that keeps us engaged in life and with others or are we just racing through? What is the goal for Adam and I, if not for all of us? That is the challenge we all face and I believe the answer is in slowing down and doing things with greater deliberation. Also,\u00a0 part of the answer lies in the communities we build \u2014 not from raping the land and a town with money-making developments, but in perhaps  growing a little less  and creating environments where humanity thrives.\u00a0 Were we to have beautiful towns, places to walk to get our groceries from local farmers, events nearby we didn\u2019t have to drive to, and neighbourhoods of children gathering to play again, rather than establishing \u201cplay-dates\u201d weeks in advance, I believe we would all be less lonely and we would fulfill many goals we have as an autistic community.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t this what we want for our autistic children most of all? To be included, happy and less lonely? To be contributing members in our communities? How can we create this if we barely get to know our neighbours? We all have that nagging feeling, don\u2019t we, that we are all less connected to each other than we want to be? Fine, we in the autism community have connected globally via the Internet, but where do we go in our own towns?\u00a0 Facebook, among other sites, tries in allowing people to advertise events. But what of just going out\u2026 unplanned? How many calls do I receive of parents with autistic children (now adults) who are desperately trying to find a group to belong to? And what must I do? I have to think of all the organizations that have formally created groups with specific meeting times that individuals must drive to. By the time we get this far, it already sounds like too much effort. As I look at the work of Edward Burtynsky in   Manufactured Landscapes , I was taken aback by the scale of growth and efficiency at the cost of humanity. His photographs of urban and industrial landscapes, he seeks not to judge our economic growth and efficiency, for he captures a sublime and repetitive beauty in that which we would otherwise call ugly, but he tries to raise our consciousness in how we are living \u2014 tenuously and on the brink. It\u2019s as if he is saying, \u201cokay, we\u2019ve reached this point and now we have to change,\u201d not as punitive, but as an empowering statement. We have created manufactured landscapes of such scope and scale that surpasses the building of the pyramids. For that we must recognize what we are capable of!!\u00a0 Now, he asks through his work, where or what is the humanity of our economy? In  The Geography of Bliss  and  Deep Economy , both authors use the study to point out that \u201cgrowth is no longer making us happy\u2026Though our economy has been growing, most of us have relatively little to show for it.\u201d (Deep Economy, p. 11). If every action in our economy burns fossil fuel, it also burns human energy. And the costs are apparent in the desolate backgrounds of Chinese culture, and the faces of a tired Chinese people \u2014 the fastest growing population and nation in the world. So you might ask: What does economics have to do with raising children and marriage? Absolutely everything. \u201cIn 1946, the United States was the happiest country among four advanced economies; thirty years later, it was eighth among eleven advanced countries; a decade after that it ranked tenth among twenty-three nations, many of them from the third world. There have been steady decreases in the percentage of Americans who say that their marriages are happy, that they are satisfied with their jobs, that they find a great deal of pleasure in the way they live.\u201d  ( Deep Economy , p. 35) As I digest my life up to this point, and the general dissatisfaction of our society, I must consider how connected all of this is, like Indra\u2019s Web. Divorce may be overwhelming, as are all the current problems in our world, but perhaps the answer in building a greater sense of satisfaction in our lives by creating more simplicity \u2014 shedding the complexity and just being honest with ourselves that we can no longer do things the same way as we used to. It involves, as in divorce, letting go. It is no surprise to me that there is a strong resurgence of farmer\u2019s markets \u2014 there is one I discovered in a nearby artist colony that I now take Adam to on Saturday mornings and it has become a real gathering place.Adam and I like to go out, ride the bike, pick up groceries on foot as much as we can, and we can be more aware of the energy we burn. The more attention and care we bring into our lives at every level, our quality of life improves. So this not only stands for the average family or person, but also for the special needs family, for what we need most is connection with others. I think about the Supermom I was called to become when I was a young girl (I went to a Catholic all-girls school which further pressed me):\u00a0  \u201cYou can bring home the bacon; fry it up in a pan; and never, never, never let him forget he\u2019s a man.\u201d  That commercial tune rings in my head and makes me want to go back to bed!!\u00a0 It\u2019s not about pleasing everybody. We cannot, lest we displease ourselves. It\u2019s about how we live and do we go to bed every night knowing that we lived our day well, without the frazzle and anxiety of what we must produce tomorrow. For perhaps to live life simply is not to do too much, but to do a few things well, including putting the intention back into the simple things we must do. I have come to think that being proficient at one or just a couple of things is better than being the most efficient mother \u2014 the autism mom who advocates, \u201cfights,\u201d for her child\u2019s rights, organizes events, sits on boards, writes articles, and barely has time enough to cook a good meal. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m going to necessarily stop all of these things, but I can\u2019t do it all  at the same time.  The time has come to shed and to rebuild, to de-commit and commit, and to teach my son how to live a life well. I am sad to say that divorce has made me view life this way. But this is what happens when life hits you over the head. I may have still come to the exact same conclusions if I were still married, but I believe a marriage is a reflection of all the systems we build. And it too needs the commitment of simplicity.

{"date": "2009/07/03", "body": "If \u201cto be a writer is to violate a trust\u201d \u2013 be it in friendship or with family, then, says Claudia Mills, \u201ca writer must be ready to violate it.\u201d ( Friendship, Fiction and Memoir: Trust and Betrayal in Writing From One\u2019s Own Life ,  The Ethics of Life Writing , Edited by Paul John Eakin, pp.101-120). I must admit, as a newly separated person and a mother of an exceptional child who is growing older by the minute, I\u2019ve been terrified of writing about the nitty gritty details of my, and my family\u2019s personal life. Let me be honest here, for the purpose of life-writing is to tell the truth; I\u2019ve considered what to tell and how to tell it. Now that many lives are important in an of themselves, and also fodder for my writing, I\u2019ve hesitated. And for good reason. I\u2019ve started a series of posts about writing about children. Many of us who read these blogs are also writers. Many readers are also parents of autistic children. There is obviously a reason why we read each other\u2019s work. Be it at the local caf\u00e9 or online, in order to share our stories, we have to tell them. What benefit does this bring? In order to begin writing, I\u2019ve had to consider the following questions: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What does writing about our children give us? \n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When is \u201ctelling the truth\u201d too much telling? 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why do we become uncomfortable with writing about our lives? 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why is the cost/benefit of life-writing? 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do we appropriate or impose an identity upon our children when we write about them and they later\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 read about themselves? 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why do we tell stories? 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How and what kind of life-writing has contributed to positive change and, \n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is life-writing necessary? I think the first question,  \u201cwhat does writing about our children give us?  is worthy of conversation here on this blog, I hope. In 2005, my then husband encouraged me to start my blog which I called  The Joy of Autism , because at that time, no one dared to put the words together in the same phrase or sentence. Already a writer, he thought that I would flourish by using this kind of an outlet. And he was right. I haven\u2019t stopped writing about autism and my life since. I had already been writing a book about autism for two years prior to even starting the blog. While Adam was in therapy sessions or at nursery school, I would grab my two or three hours, study-up on autism and then writing about our experiences with the new frontier of therapists was an outlet for me. It enabled me to express my discontent for how a system was set for autistic children. It fuelled my impulse to work to have Adam treated as a person, not a client \u2013 to be viewed in all his human glory instead of a person with impairments and deifiencies who had to be made better than he already was. For Adam was my joy. He remains so. I still feel that the best thing I ever did in my life was give birth to him. So in effect, writing for me became a way of finding myself in a mirage of \u201csuffering.\u201d According to the experts, I  had  to be suffering. I certainly was, but not because of Adam. I believe I was suffering with the disconnect between how I felt about Adam and how others tried to influence me in the way I ought to feel about him. If it hadn\u2019t been for writing through the process, I may not reached the level of clarity I\u2019ve reached today. I\u2019ve made new friends and alienated other people with my determined stance not to succumb to misery and pity regarding autism. The stories I told between 2005-2008 were extremely important for me to write. I needed to respond to how others responded to Adam and to us. As Victor Frankl said in  Man\u2019s Search for Meaning , suffering becomes more bearable when it has some meaning. We can only derive meaning when we tell our stories. As for my readers, I\u2019ve received many emails tha the reason why people read my blog is because they relate to my viewpoint and they do not feel alone. Feeling as if we are \u201cnot the only ones\u201d is an important part of writing and reading. Others have expressed that they too are frustrated in a system of dooms-dayers regarding disabled children. While we have many challenges, most of the people who write to me are united in feeling that there is more to life than just complaining and that we are determined to live good lives no matter if others say we must live otherwise. Are we nonetheless united in challenges? Most certainly. I believe the craft of writing with compassion, as I\u2019ve lived and learned about disability and many views over the past five years has helped me to realize that we can align ourselves with other\u2019s experiences even if we also disagree. In other words, while I may not enjoy Dr. Phil\u2019s renditions of families and disability (in fact, his sensationalism makes me cringe), I can also relate to the challenge that families have when they have special needs children. I suppose I also write when I get this kind of feedback. As a writer or an artist, or any contributor to the world, the most important aspect of creating art, or in telling our stories is in the sharing and continued dialogue that writing and sharing promotes. What does writing, or reading, of life-stories give you? Please contribute to the discussion in the comments section. Next Post: Question Number 2.

And I\u2019ve made new ones too through my work in autism and writing. And so I feel a bit of like a divorced cliche \u2014 I\u2019m checking in with my past to re-discover who I am. Please don\u2019t blame me \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like my marathon running these days \u2014 no matter what we do when we get divorced, pretty much  everything  we do becomes a cliche.

I\u2019m simply moving on, very philosophical and looking at where I\u2019ve been and thinking of where I\u2019m going, now, with my little guy.\u00a0 These posts since I\u2019ve archived the older  Joy of Autism  blog (see side margin) are much about growth and moving on. It\u2019s why I\u2019ll be starting a second blog in this site soon \u2014 so I can keep the focus on autism for those of you who just want to read about that, and then another blog which is just more of what I love to do, which is to write about pretty much everything. Facebook has been a great tool for advancing  The Autism Acceptance Project  (I\u2019m also working on changing this site), and keeping in touch. I\u2019ve actually had a real-life, face-to-face conversation with some of my old friends who have reconnected with me through Facebook. Imagine that? Coming out from behind the screen! As long as the tool enables communication but also connection beyond the screen, I like it, but I admit to \u201cchecking in\u201d with people on Facebook and Twitter just to  feel  connected.\u00a0 My blackberry just went down today, and I can imagine how many messages I am missing!! I\u2019m not connected!\u00a0 A girlfriend actually CALLED me yesterday (remember that old fashioned telephone thing?) instead of emailing me, ON PURPOSE. Some of us are recognizing that it\u2019s pretty important to hear that other voice on the end of the line.\u00a0 But for every complaint, there is a blessing. Mine is reconnecting with old friends where the phonebook became out-of-date and  Canada411  couldn\u2019t find them for their changed names. One of my high school girlfriends sent me these today ON FACEBOOK\u2026more photos of the Estee-gone-by\u2026 as  Hodel  from  Fiddler on The Roof  (might that have been a prediction of Catholic girl turning into stubborn Jewish girl?) and  Ethel Tofflemeyer  in  The Music Man . These were classic high school days where I spent nearly all my days rehearsing and performing. It was my real passion back in the day and where the enduring friendships were made.\u00a0 And I look at that really young girl and realize that she was whole back then and she didn\u2019t know it. She knew what she wanted and she went for it, even though she thought she wanted more. Before boyfriends and husbands, she did what she really wanted to do. And today, it is the girl I admire the most and the fondest of all my memories, with the exception of Adam\u2019s birth.\u00a0 The girl who makes me remember what\u2019s really important for her.\u00a0 When I look at Adam, and even many adults, I also remember just how precious a young heart is. It also reminds me to encourage Adam to follow his own heart. There is a reason, I suppose, for having memories.

{"date": "2009/04/06", "body": "In the seventeenth century Spanish and Dutch ships came ashore to the new land and killed natives because they were perceived as \u201cpests.\u201d  In 1828, The British Captain Robert Fitzroy arrived on a survey mission for the Royal Navy. Fitzroy took four natives as captive back to England to transform them into \u201ccivilized\u201d people. \u201cAfter nine months of religious schooling, [the natives] were summoned to appear at the court of King William IV and Queen Adelaide, where Fuegia Basket [a name ascribed to one of the native girls in England] was presented with a lace bonnet, a ring and a small dowry. To fulfill his goal of bringing Christianity to Tierra del Fuego, Fitzroy set sail on December 27th, 1831 on the 240-ton bark HMS Beagle with seventy-four crew members, and Anglican catechist who would establish a mission with his three converts, and a recent graduate of Cambridge, the young naturalist Charles Darwin.\u201d (p. 90  Blessed Unrest ). As Paul Hawken writes, Darwin had only seen natives clad in \u201ccivilized\u201d clothing up until the time he reached the New World. He did not expect to see, I imagine, Fuegians clad in seal blubber. He could barely accept that the Fuegians were members of the human race. He said, \u201cI could not believe how wide was the difference between a savage and a civilized man: it is greater than between a domesticated and wild animal, in as much as in man there is a greater power of improvement.\u201d (Charles Darwin, T he Voyage of the Beagle: Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology of the Countries Visited During the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle Round the World , New York: Modern Library, 2001. p.122). Like most of us, Darwin\u2019s powers of observation failed him. Darwin was, Hawken notes, surprised by the Fuegian\u2019s ability to mimic \u2014 they could do so with language, right down to entire sentences, coughs, facial expressions. Yet, \u201cbecause he could not easily distinguish words in their own native language, [Darwin] concluded that they were merely repeating a few simple phrases and thus had a very small vocabulary.\u201d (p.91). Darwin said, \u201cTheir language does not deserve to be called articulate: Capt Cook says it is like a man clearing his throat; to which may be added another very hoarse man trying to shout & a third encouraging a horse with that peculiar noise which is made in one side of the mouth\u2026I believe if the world was searched, no lower grade of man could be found.\u201d Because Darwin didn\u2019t understand the Fuegian language, because they were not like him, he deemed them barbaric. Little did he know that Fuegian culture was ripe with \u201canimated and nuanced conversation.\u201d Thomas Bridges, an orphan adopted by a missionary family, \u201cspent twenty-one years compiling a dictionary of 32,430 words and inflections [of the Fuegians], a number that was comparable to Japanese vocabulary, before accounting for Chinese and English influences. Because Bridges died in  1898, before the dictionary was completed, we are left to imagine the sum of the Yamana vocabulary. [Yamana is the Fuegian language]. \u201cAs you turn the pages of this remarkable document, you realize that there seems to be a precise word to describe every moment in their life. To appreciate the intelligence required to understand and use 32,430 words, consider that  Samuel Johnson\u2019s Dictionary of the English Language , published in 1755, contained 42,773 words. Shakespeare is credited with having used 29,066 different text words in his complete works, but in terms of truly distinct words, and disregarding overlapping usages, there are fewer than 20,000 words but will use no more than 1,500 to 2,000 over the course of the week. Half of the conversational vocabulary of an American teenager consists of fewer than forty words.\u201d (Hawken, p.92) Hawken\u2019s book  Blessed Unrest  is about the loss of indigenous cultures, abuse of the environment, free-market fundamentalism and social justice. He notes that with the loss of a language comes the extermination of a culture.  Autistic people and the disabled community call themselves a culture, to which there has been vitriolic response from non disabled communities, namely parents and caregivers. I have to question, then, what constitutes a culture and why the self-appropriation of \u201cautistic culture\u201d by autistic self-advocates has become so offensive to some care-giving groups. One automatically assumes that anger is generated by a fear of loss \u2014 services, empathy, pity, perhaps. This has been the assumption by disability rights activists, after all. Yet why the contest? I personally see no reason why thousands of people who come together and self-appropriate \u201cculture\u201d is not just as valid for autistic people as it is with Native people, Black people, Asian people, Jewish people and so forth. I am herein beginning to make a case for autistic culture. I am pointing out that our autistic children, privy to the same, potentially harmful assumptions that they are of lower value because they are not understood by society-at-large, are not Darwin\u2019s children,  yet, they are treated no differently in most cases than Darwin treated and referred to the Fuegians. This will not be my complete essay on the topic. I am only suggesting that a culture, by virtue of the following definitions we\u2019ve used to ascribe a people as a culture are: \u201d \u2013 a particular society at a particular time and place; \u2018early Mayan civilization\u2019 \n \u2013 the tastes in art and manners that are favored by a social group \n \u2013 acculturation: all the knowledge and values shared by a society \n \u2013  (biology) the growing of microorganisms in a nutrient medium (such as gelatin or agar); \u2018the culture  of cells in a Petri dish\u2019 \n\u2013 the attitudes and behavior that are characteristic of a particular social group or organization; \u2018the developing drug culture; \u201cthe reason that the agency is doomed to inaction has something to do with the FBI culture\u2019 \n \u2013 grow in a special preparation; \u2018the biologist grows microorganisms\u2019 \n \u2013 the raising of plants or animals; \u2018the culture of oysters\u2019 \u201c(Source: Wordnet) It seems to me that autistic people, or people within the autistic culture, share these attributes. The most highly disrespected aspect to autistic culture, and perhaps the least investigated from a point of validity, is autistic language \u2014 an \u201cagent\u201d of autistic culture.  That is, as long as we view autistic behaviour and actions as irrelevant and deviant, much like Darwin did to the Feugians, we are potentially missing a rich dynamic system and people. In a world where English is used everywhere and we are homogenizing world-wide mostly in the name of business, we will kill off indigenous cultures by the thousands. Hawken\u2019s writes \u201cA language dies when it is not spoken to a new generation of children. At the rate of decline we are now experiencing, half of our living cultural heritage will disappear in a single generation.\u201d Language, many linguists state, is a distinct way of experiencing and sharing dreams, ideals, visions of life itself. \u201cA Western bias about belonging to a superior culture is valid only if we use selective yardsticks,\u201d writes Hawken. \u201cRather than assuming people want to surrender to Western values we would be wiser to consider the loss of language as yet another indicator of worldwide collapse of ecosystems\u2026\u201d (Hawken, p.95). Can we define, narrow down, or record a distinctive autistic \u201clanguage?\u201d Is autistic language and modes of expression systematized? It seems to me we have  absolutely  recorded many of the nuances of autistic language and behaviour \u2014  the latter which of course is a form of language. Just look at the DSM (Diagnostic Statistical Manual). Like Darwin who put on a set of glasses with a view to calling native culture \u201cinferior,\u201d the DSM uses similar terms of inferiority to define what autistic people and their language are  not , rather than what they are. If we can observe and categorize a group of people as \u201cdeficient,\u201d then the opposite can be true. Autistic people, like other indigenous peoples, are in and of themselves distinct \u2014  a group with their own language, behaviours, modes of expression, art and for the most part, values. Adam\u2019s language contains thousands of nuances, combinations and permutations  \u2014 gesture, noises, words, typing, singing, and more, which I have come to understand quite well. I have not yet sat down to describe every single utterance, but as you note on this blog, I sometimes do try to record things for the sake of suggesting that his language is just as valid as mine. I would strongly encourage everyone to consider that autistic culture is something we should cherish, not perish. Darwin\u2019s view was that there were \u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower\u201d kinds of people, something that autistic people can attest still exists when others define them. We don\u2019t have to put on rose-coloured glasses to see autistic culture, we just have to consider changing the lens.

{"date": "2009/08/02", "body": "What\u2019s a life anyway? A series of decisions, forks in the road, relationships, children.\u00a0 I consider that sometimes, people are afraid to make decisions and many let others make decisions for them. I do not want to live that life.\u00a0 Life is that proverbial struggle, that uphill climb, like my recent bicycle ride. I wouldn\u2019t give up then, and I don\u2019t give up now. Kristina Chew\u2019s recent post,  Ave Atque Vale ,\u00a0 reflected what I\u2019ve been writing for nine months now but less forthrightly. She too recognizes that as Charlie grows, the need to blog and write has shifted focus to disability rights instead of vaccines, therapies and the like. I think it\u2019s really interesting to see how many of our lives are parallel, and this is viewable by following bloggers who began writing in and around the same time (most of them are on The Autism Hub). I look back at my early writing even two years before I began blogging \u2014 some two hundred pages of our experiences with different therapies and therapists, supervisors, media and the emotional wrangling that went with it all. I remember being somewhat rebellious to what the experts had to say and was stubborn enough to want to follow our own path. I remember the parents with older autistic kids \u2014 there were two camps really \u2014 those who said that I was too early on in the autism process mill that \u201cAdam is a cute little pischer now, but wait until he grows up,\u201d to parents of even older autistic adults who quietly observed me and acknowledged the stage I as at, knowing full well that autism is something that will be forever a part of our children and our lives. I think I saw in there eyes some strain as well as some peace \u2014 the strain of being burned by autism politics, the strain of raising a child in a world that did everything to fit them like square pegs into a round hole. But also behind the strain was an aura of peace, of time leveling it all, of what we call acceptance for things that just are and will be. This is a part of acceptance that interests me \u2014 how people make different decisions and how time weathers us all. I do not know what lies ahead now for Adam and I. I was a woman who was married and felt some refuge. Now I stand with Adam on my own, no less resolute but having to step back and take some quiet time for his sake and mine.\u00a0 I made the decision to put Adam at the top of my list of priorities. For better or for worse, here I am.\u00a0 I am proud of our lives. I am proud of how I\u2019ve lived mine so far. I have no regrets. I cannot change the kind of person I am. I cannot change the decisions I made. We can\u2019t make our husbands, wives or partners want to join us on the ride. Some of us move out into the world and try to make a change. I imagine this isn\u2019t easy on all partnerships. Maybe I\u2019d rather be that woman who makes decisions instead of letting life make them for her. Maybe women like me do not always fit into the world as it stands. Maybe the sense of \u201cnot belonging\u201d is deep within me and has given me that will to fight for Adam\u2019s inclusion in this world. You see, no matter what side of the fence we are on, no matter what happens, this life we all live is so interesting. It is not interesting if we sit on the side-lines and take no stand at all, have no convictions or beliefs. I am baffled when humans get pounded on the head and then cower away (by the way, I took a recent post down on Autism and Laughter study not to cower but because what I wrote was not thorough nor thoughtful and will be the first in line to admit it). I am perplexed when people criticize us and we decide we are too tired to go on. Sure, life beats us down and we need to gather ourselves and that takes time. But this autism mom, woman, writer, little girl, friend, dreamer, someone\u2019s ex, daughter, cousin \u2014 and all the other things that make up who I am \u2014 will never, ever, ever give up. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in my DNA and maybe, I wonder, this is why I have been blessed with Adam. Adam, who has taught me so many things and keeps making me a better, more thoughtful person. Adam will know that life not defined by taking the safe and easy road, but by having the courage to make decisions. My life is changing and therefore, so is Adam\u2019s. His life will change and therefore, so will mine.\u00a0 I am in the fog of the dust not yet settled, but am keeping a close eye on the pulse. For some of you, my blog may now be a bit boring because of my life change, for others, it may offer some place where we can share some common ground. For this is why we write. This is why we share our stories. When major things happen in our lives, even if we are beaten down, it is how we rise to the occasion\u00a0 that matters. In the words of Bob Dylan: The Times They Are A-Changin\u2019 Come gather \u2019round people \nWherever you roam \nAnd admit that the waters \nAround you have grown \nAnd accept it that soon \nYou\u2019ll be drenched to the bone. \nIf your time to you \nIs worth savin\u2019 \nThen you better start swimmin\u2019 \nOr you\u2019ll sink like a stone \nFor the times they are a-changin\u2019.

{"date": "2009/10/13", "body": "There are a few good lines mulling about out there. I particularly like \u201cyou know when you\u2019re happy when you are no longer looking for happiness.\u201d\u00a0 Ever notice that when you\u2019re happy, you didn\u2019t really notice at all? It was sort of, well, effortless? In this autism world, or any matter of the human spirit, we are really involved with the meaning of things and what will bring us joy and happiness.\u00a0 Every time we write our lists and ponder our life\u2019s purpose, we can feel overwhelmed. While I\u2019m certainly for lists, I think they are simply like little messages we have to write, put out there and then tuck in the wall. Once the intent is made, then leave it, move on and begin the work. While intention is how we wish to live our lives everything else can happen. And it will. As I\u2019m re-reading Viktor Frankl\u2019s  Man\u2019s Search for Meaning  this week, I\u2019m reminded of some very important things. First, is that like the name of this blog and it\u2019s consecutive mantra about \u201cstruggle,\u201d I suppose I was also brought up with the idea that struggle will always be a part of my life and that happiness happens when we aren\u2019t paying attention. It can even happen during the most catastrophic of circumstances. Frankl had cited Nietzsche\u2019s ideas that we all have to have a \u201cwhy\u201d in life to get us through. He said if we have a \u201cwhy\u201d then we will certainly have a \u201chow.\u201d For those in the concentration camps during the Holocaust, Frankl of course ponders the meaning of life during one of times most horrible of human travesties. Frankl understands life\u2019s inherent blessings among tragedy. He sees goodness in the group that has done him harm: \u201cHuman kindness can be found in all groups, even those which as a whole it would be easy to condemn. The boundaries between groups overlapped and we must not try to simplify matters by saying that these men were angels and those were devils.\u201d He refers specifically to the Germans and notes that groupings of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad,\u201d does not fully explain or accept the expanse of humanity. For when one condemns one group, they are also denying that they are also capable of the same atrocity, for we are all made equal. Once we are able to understand that we all carry the same capabilities of good and evil within us, we can become compassionate. The modern saying is \u201cfor every finger we point, there are three pointing back.\u201d Perhaps it would serve us all well to practice a little reflection when we debate the \u201crights\u201d and \u201cwrongs\u201d in autism politics. It would serve us well in every aspect of our lives. Some of us in this world hold on so firmly to our beliefs that we don\u2019t see many other realities. Musician John Mayer writes: Belief is a beautiful armor \nBut makes for the heaviest sword \nLike punching under water \nYou never can hit who you\u2019re trying for Some need the exhibition \nAnd some have to know they tried \nIt\u2019s the chemical weapon \nFor the war that\u2019s raging on inside Everyone believes \nFrom emptiness to everything \nEveryone believes \nAnd no one\u2019s going quietly There\u2019s a lot of autism \u201cbelief\u201d out there and it\u2019s important to have science to assist us in proving many things. Also, it\u2019s important to  know . To know that my son, without proof, is a worthy, valuable, lovely human being who has made contributions in ways he is too young to understand.\u00a0 It sometimes disturbs me that as much as science is important to prove harmful beliefs incorrect, it is similarly exhausting to have to prove one\u2019s value through scientific or any other means. In this world of human difference, belief, disability I would like to take a moment to defer to Frankl who says, \u201d What [is] needed [is] a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves, and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that  it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.  We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead think of ourselves as those were were being questioned by life \u2014 daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual\u2026 and each differs from man to man\u2026.When a man finds it his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task.\u201d (Simon and Schuster edition, 1963, pp. 122-23). And so perhaps it is not really worth our time to discuss what makes us happy and brings us joy as much as it is to accept the responsibilities and events that enter our lives, and move on with them with an open and willing heart. Hmm, just that simple thought makes me happy.

{"date": "2010/02/02", "body": "  We are moving, Adam and I. Thirteen days and counting. Leaving the home I built with Adam\u2019s father (literally \u2014 I\u2019ve uncovered stacks of my working notes while building the house I am moving out of) and I ache. My back aches from moving boxes, my feet ache from running up and down stairs, and well, the heart is complicated. Houses are more than what they contain. They are more than walls. If they weren\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t drive back to the homes we grew up in, or show our boyfriends and girlfriends where we went to school. We wouldn\u2019t go back to tree where we carved our names, or try to find the homes our grandparents lived in to imagine what history had happened to bring us to this very moment. We traverse  back  all of the time. We try hard to conjure up the memories, the conversations, Fred Flintstone and Campbells Tomato Soup, or maybe the sounds of children running in for lunch. Even though we can\u2019t relive them in actual time, the moments live within us. I remember when we started planning to build the house I will say goodbye to next week \u2014 the first day we ripped down the old structure that stood on this land before we built; Adam was a baby then and I had taken a walk from the other white home we lived in  \u2014 the one I\u2019ve written about in  The Perfect Child,  with black shutters and a huge maple tree, to witness the first dent the demolition crew made. We were building something and I was exhilarated. It took us eighteen months to build this house we lived in since 2005. Every week, I\u2019d walk Adam over in his stroller \u2014 getting him used to the new place; already worried about that thing I always talk about: \u201ctransitioning.\u201d We walked by. Then we walked in. Then we could walk up a ladder that took the place of stairs. Then we could walk up stairs until finally, we played ball in the kitchen that was still being built. My mother accuses me (in the nicest possible way) of living in the future since I was a very young child. As Adam\u2019s mother I imagined all the games we would play in this house, the guests we would have. I don\u2019t knock imagination in the age of the  Power of Now . We can breathe life into things! When Adam was three, we moved in. Leaving Rosemary (the white house), was difficult too. It was the home Adam\u2019s father and I began to build our family life and where I became a stepmother. It was the place where I brought Adam home two days after he was born \u2014 April 13, 2002. I will never forget how it began to rain and that strange feeling \u2014  that the house I left was not the same house to which I returned. Adam, of course, changed all of that. The moment I put him down in his car seat in that front hall and I was overcome with the new life that I  now cannot imagine living without. I returned to Rosemary with toddler-Adam asleep in the back of my van soon after we had moved into this home which I am about to leave. I had to run in to fetch the bassinet my mother had refurbished for him \u2014 the one I also slept in thirty-some years earlier. It was \u201cheaven\u2019s bed,\u201d or a \u201cHimmelbett,\u201d as they say in German. My German grandmother made it by hand just for me. Adam also deserved to lie under the same protection of the heavens and the angels. As I walked into Rosemary it was about to storm \u2014 still so quiet and dark. I stood lingering and silent in each room. I had to think about everything that had happened in those rooms and all of those conversations.  Although it was empty, the walls seemed to be whispering among the dust balls \u2014  remember when, remember when\u2026. \n \n When I was ready, I wrapped my arms around the bassinet and put it quietly in the back of my van, Adam still sleeping soundly, the thunder just beginning to gently roll towards us. I sat in the car and looked one last time. It was hard, but I had to say goodbye. I put the car in reverse and decided not to go back for awhile. A couple of years later, the new owners demolished  that  house and built a new one. I still drive by. Saying goodbye to homes and a life I shared with someone is an important ritual. Just because some things don\u2019t last does not mean we must abandon them in our hearts, our minds or with sour words. We must honour an ending as much as a beginning, for all our stories have them. I believe we have to approach such goodbyes with gentle regard for all of those days, nights, hours and years. All of those words spoken; all of those hopes and dreams. We build. We move. We demolish. We build again. I have created a new home and it\u2019s also lovely. Adam loves his new room, and I have created another piece of  Himmel  over his reading nook, where he has only visited but looks about curiously and tries to find his comfort.  Like everything else I do, I will get this done. I will say my prayers and my goodbyes as I stand in each room listening to what the walls say.  Then I will take a rock from the backyard that Adam loves so dearly \u2014  where Adam\u2019s father brought home his first big trampoline; where the grandfathers worked so hard to put it together. Our backyard was Adam\u2019s haven and we spent many summer afternoons swimming and playing. At first, that rock will be difficult to look at, so I may put it away. I have a feeling, however, it will later become something I will need to look at. Something to cherish. I have to remember. For all those years were worth it. They are my story and, while it may come with some ache, I am proud of everything that was created over the past thirteen years. While my imagination is already working on my new home (and yes, my future as well as Adam\u2019s), this is my way of saying goodbye.

It\u2019s a little more than the weight and size of the limited edition of  Jeanette Winterson\u2019s  Dog Days  when I hold it.  I can hear \u201cready, set go,\u201d \u2014 that phrase we taught Adam to plunge him into a game or an activity, and I don\u2019t forget the sound. Time, people, events happen so quickly and memory is fragile. Over the past ten years, I\u2019ve written two books, both incomplete and yearning to come together. At the Humber College for Writers and The University of Toronto, where I\u2019ve attended writer\u2019s conferences in the past, I was told that one\u2019s first book takes about seven years to accomplish. Other writers have told me ten to fifteen years, which had me scratching my head at the John Grishams of the world and how on earth could they churn books out so fast.  With my extraordinary impatience and harsh self-judgment, a difficult year has introduced me to some gentilit\u00e9 with myself and with others.  So please \u201cGod,\u201d this just  has  to be my year. Thanks,  John Baxter ,\u00a0 and his punctual rendezvous  avec moi  in front of  Les Deux Magots , and  avec  Flannerie  along Rue de Bonaparte and Rue Jacob, taught me a little bit more of the Paris that once belonged to Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Joyce, Miller and Gertrude Stein, among some other great literary figures. Thank you for also letting me hold  a letter from  Anais Nin to Jean Fanchette.  I have come to realize why I became a curator but to understand the importance of preservation and memory. I would recommend anyone out there to read John\u2019s memoirs from Paris.  He has written a series of that help describe the underbelly of and life in Paris. It was not difficult to be alone in Paris and John\u2019s paragraph caught my eye when I ran across it:  \u201cFor a woman, Paris is a good city to be alone\u2026Most of the expatriate writers who, since the turn of the century, created our image of the city \u2014 Edith Wharton, Jean Rhys, Janet Flanner, Nancy Mitford, Mavis Gallant, Dianne Johnson \u2014 were laureates of loneliness, who, even though sometimes married, preferred to live and work by themselves.\u201d  (page 137, Harper-Perrenial edition, 2005.) So here I was, a \u201cready, set go\u201d decision to go to Paris, meet John, Leda and write. Another \u201claureate of loneliness,\u201d but with no complaints. Which leads me to also thank profusely, my long-time friend and  pianiste extraordinaire , Leda Perac, who is another laureate living in Paris. I studied and became great friends with Leda in Germany fifteen years ago in colder, hungrier circumstances, nevertheless playing and singing our way through it all with Tori Amos. This time, having dinner in  Le Ch\u00e2teaubriand  with my face, she noted, visibily drawn from flight-fatigue, and undoubtedly the weight of a difficult year,\u00a0she presented all of the letters I had sent to her in German when I returned to Canada in 1995 and 1996. Reading them between courses of  poisson  and some flirtatious chitter-chatter between myself and our exceptionally handsome waiter with the beautiful smile, I required her to translate the some of the very words I had written fifteen years later, to my chagrin.  Leda, you helped bring back memories that remind me of who I was, who I am, and maybe more importantly, why I am. And thank you, Paris. You gave me Adam, love, and fifty-two good pages.

{"date": "2009/12/09", "body": "Every time I watch a new episode on autism from CNN, I\u2019m ready to turn off all phones. For certain, I\u2019ll get a call about ABA,\u00a0 and that maybe Adam \u201cshould have had more of it,\u201d and then there is all that dark talk about autism and \u201csieges\u201d and gosh, it\u2019s no wonder I want to write about other things. All we want to do is live our lives in peace! Why can\u2019t autistic people be permitted to do so without constant references that they are not good enough with pithy reports by CNN? Heck, why isn\u2019t inclusion, autism and disability (all in the same sentence) headline news? Giving the benefit of the doubt to Karen Siff-Ekorn and her family,\u00a0 I wonder how CNN edited this piece as it so neatly angled to support the recent Geraldine Dawson study on Early Intervention . The CNN piece, with Siff-Ekkorn, described how ABA recovered her son Jake. The implication here is that ABA is the Early Intervention in question by association. Yet, no parent can claim that one particular kind of therapy can \u201crecover\u201d all autistic people. No one parent or clinician can speak for all individuals and all families. In all fairness it might be more accurate to say that every autistic person responds to different teaching methods, well, differently. \u201cEvidence\u201d abounds, but the discussion of study-design is conveniently left out. In every statement or claim, context is everything When Adam had a rigorous ABA program for the first two years after his diagnosis, his anxiety got in the way of his learning. All of those M&M\u2019s and \u201clook at me\u2019s\u201d sent him through the\u00a0 roof. One therapist even tried to physically wrestle him into submission (there is one thing that is certain \u2014 like his mother, Adam will not be wrestled with). It is definitely not a successful way to teach Adam.\u00a0 It seems like so long ago now, but remembering actually gives me a lot of pain. I definitely see that Adam has benefited by early play therapies, occupational therapy, visual supports, keyboards, computers,\u00a0 and recently we restarted speech language therapy because it didn\u2019t make much sense to do SLP on a child who couldn\u2019t talk well enough and got extremely anxious when he tried. Once ready to \u201carticulate,\u201d he is now responding very well to SLP.\u00a0 In other words, you can\u2019t fight mother nature, but you can support her. We\u2019ve all got to try and figure out the best approach for our unique children and understand when certain autistic children are ready for certain approaches. In our case, ABA would have created anxiety in Adam that would likely have been irreparable. And let\u2019s face it, every year, there are better therapists emerging, integrating a variety of methodologies and eager to understand how an autistic person learns well. Adam today is a happy little boy (still with some sensory and anxiety issues that are being managed) who has begun to draw, who speaks more this year than last year, who types now independently, who is learning his life skills well, and who can do more with his body than he could a few years ago. These achievements can never be taken for granted.\u00a0 It saddens me if people do not acknowledge his marvelous successes (because he remains autistic) for he really does work very hard. But that is not, thankfully, our experience here on the blog. I hate to think that there is an autism archetype he must measure up to \u2014 that paradigm of recovery. What if he doesn\u2019t talk fluently or require an assistant in his future to live?\u00a0 I mean, the boy must continue to learn and feel successful and gratified in his life!\u00a0 Does being fully independent matter? I know we all want it, if not covet it, but is it that important under the circumstances? If an assistant or a visual aide or a keyboard is what he needs to be in the world, then isn\u2019t that enough? Being a parent of an autistic child in this day and age requires constant internal dialogue and discipline. I would also like to refer readers to  Kristina\u2019s Chew\u2019s blog  and others who do not on any account suggest that their children have \u201cfully recovered because of ABA,\u201d but who discuss ABA and autism thoughtfully.\u00a0 Few\u00a0 parents of autistic children will dispute that engaging an autistic child is important, and all of us do this in one way or another and for lack of proof (mainly in our very own living rooms) have tried a variety of approaches.\u00a0 Also very important living with autism is idiosyncratic rest and play,\u00a0 (I say this because autistic play is deemed abnormal by our society and many, not all, ABA proponents, while autistic adults have discussed how vital and important that play can be to their development and understanding of their environment), and being with family and friends, even if \u201cbeing with\u201d looks a little different. So is living within one\u2019s community as a respected human being. So is acceptance and support of children past those ABA years into adulthood. If autistic people have to recover, then what of those adult years? I cannot crystal ball gaze, but I am grateful for what Adam has been given in life so far, and as all parents, I fret about middle school and high school lest someone tries to attempt to beat him once again into submission, or turn him away.\u00a0 I guess mom is still wrestling with the issues that CNN creates when it presents one-sided recovery reports \u2014 lack of acceptance, lack of supports, lack of employment opportunities and the like. The \u201cfull recovery\u201d tales are dangerous without balance and without discussing what can happen by suggesting that normalcy, the way we have come to understand it in our society,\u00a0 is the Holy Grail of being, or in this case \u201cbecoming\u201d human. CNN once again only tells half a story.\u00a0 They also stigmatize families like my own where we are accused, by insinuation, of not doing enough for our children when we are doing absolutely everything humanly possible to create the best future for our kids. Actually, in autism politics, we are living in a Catch-22 nightmare where we can hardly speak a word about a success or a word about a challenge. No matter which way we all turn as autistic families, we are criticized, which is why I want to give Karen the benefit of the doubt and congratulate Jake on his wonderful achievements \u2014 not because he \u201clost his autism diagnosis.\u201d I congratulate all the autistic families and all of their achievements too, not that I matter so much in all of this except for in Adam\u2019s life, but isn\u2019t this what we should all be doing? CNN does not like seem to cover stories often enough about autistic people living in adulthood who require supports, assistants, and who, living as autistic people, or \u201cpeople with autism,\u201d live \u201csuccessfully,\u201d (or perhaps they may feel they do not, which also warrants fair discussion). It is once again the hero-story or story of some triumph and autism  must  be the enemy. Naturally, I disagree with that kind of manipulation.\u00a0 CNN especially doesn\u2019t like to pick autistic people who would take issue with the angle of that recovery report in order that the complex issues really get covered.\u00a0 CNN does not report stories\u00a0 like ours often enough, where families work so hard to provide the love and supports our children require to communicate, learn and,  if physically possible , talk more, while leaving out \u201cthe siege\u201d angle and uncovering more complex notes that joy does exist with intense struggle as simple as is the metaphor of life. I would like Adam to talk more, and he is every year. But if he does not talk consistently in his future, I will not judge him nor myself. I made that deal with myself a couple of years ago every time I gasp for air in some fleeting moment of panic.\u00a0 I will not say our trials at \u201crecovery \u201cwere unsuccessful for that word is not\u00a0in my vocabulary in the way that we typically refer to it.\u00a0 Let\u2019s face it, our definitions of \u201csuccess\u201d need some serious rethinking. So like the Brittany Spears song goes, CNN, \u201coops [you] did it again.\u201d You told the world (again) that recovery is possible and thereby suggested that this is what all autistic people and their families  must  do at all costs, and yet our families remain unsupported in all stages of life.\u00a0 You run the risk of sending millions of parents and families into despair if their children do not \u201crecover\u201d in the manner you show and suggest. You endanger about eighty million disabled people in North America with the suggestion that disability is not an acceptable state of being human (not that all disabled people understand autism, this is true, or that all disabled people are in agreement about disability issues). You tell half a story, and it is  not  the story of so many families. There are many stories of great happiness in families out there living with autism as there are stories of \u201csieges,\u201d and much of life\u2019s success comes from how we regard and deal with things. Stories like this one do not help with the need to be positive when there are many pressures beating upon us. And believe me, even with all of this, the joy does exist with autism too.

{"date": "2010/02/10", "body": "This post will be brief as I am living in the moment of moving homes. Adam came to our new home today before he goes on a mid-winter break with his dad. His body-jerks have returned and he cries in his new room. \u201cAre you scared,\u201d I ask. \u201cAre you scared?\u201d he echoes back with then a slight delay. \u201cScared,\u201d he says forcefully. We have made numerous visits to the home, but because Adam can understand what he cannot express fluidly with words, he is reacting. It is strange. He knows the move is now imminent. He is experiencing the stress that other children experience. He has experienced so much.  It brings me back to the time when I was six years old and my parents moved homes. I remember when they looked at it, when they purchased it \u2014 my dad and I put the \u201csold\u201d sign on the front yard. So new was the house, the lawn was not yet in and we perched the sign in the dirt. Dad made a big deal out of it, I remember that much. He was proud. It\u2019s amazing what impressions we retain from out childhoods. It wasn\u2019t much longer after that \u2014 I returned from a weekend with my grandparents to sleep (all of a sudden) in my new home. I believe there was even a stuffed animal waiting for me in a newly erected brass mailbox by the front door. It was summer. The \u201cwelcome committee\u201d was ready to do its job and make me feel right at home. That committee was my parents. I remember that arrival and how strange it was, but I\u2019ve lost the memory of sleeping there my first night. I\u2019m certain my extremely attentive and loving mother did everything she could to make me feel I was at home. Yet, it didn\u2019t feel quite right. I couldn\u2019t ride my bike around the house in my old neighbourhood where a garden was planted and grass was laid and my good pals were gone (I was particularly close to the  boys I punched in the stomach  \u2014 it wasn\u2019t my idea\u2026 it was my father\u2019s. He tried to make me into a tough girl and STILL relays that story proudly to anyone who will listen\u2026kind of embarrassing at my age). Nope, they were all gone and all I had was the bike and the dirt for my early introduction. The plumbing still wasn\u2019t working in the block so new, that we had to use the model home down the street to take a pee. Indeed,  that  was a strange feeling. My parents are still around and are extremely loving grandparents to my son, not to mention incredibly supportive of their daughter who is now not only a single mother, but also their only-child having another life \u201cadjustment.\u201d Let\u2019s just say that they mean the world to me and I\u2019m certain to Adam. On Monday, when Adam returns home from his break with his dad, those same grandparents will be the welcoming committee to his new home that he will settle into with mom.  Adam is only a year or so older than I was when I made the major move. I try to appreciate how strange this all feels on top of parents who are no longer together. I think of how confusing that must be; how stressful sometimes, and because Adam is autistic, he manifests that stress in physical behaviour. It is the only outlet he has. Even though we are all doing our best to help him along, Adam has been expressing how he feels about the matter. Expressing boldly without words.  I now play a video I made with Adam\u2019s grand-dad a few years ago. I love the little guy more than words can say. This is a look backwards with gratitude while also hoping the future will bring us both peace.

It manifests in his senses.  I think his body jerks and desire to be in tight dark places have a lot to do with  change  and his parent\u2019s separation.

{"date": "2010/02/15", "body": "I am awaiting Adam\u2019s arrival home from his midwinter break with his dad. If you\u2019ve been following my blog, the short story is that today, Adam will sleep for the first time in his new home as his mom and dad have separated. On Family Day, I eagerly await him. On Valentines Day, I felt his absence, but knowing that he would be away, I arranged my first dinner party with family and friends who have been like family to me. Today, Adam\u2019s grandparents and I will welcome him in a way that I have ritualized home and family for myself. The year of adjusting to single parenthood has been interesting. I find myself brooding sometimes over stigmas that I have inherited. Things like encoded beliefs that we are more valued if someone finds us valuable, or that perhaps I\u2019m not giving everything Adam deserves by being a single parent \u2014 that by being single our children feel the empty hole in their existence and it\u2019s somehow our fault. Of course the emotional sides of these questions can be torture (and I\u2019m sorry to say that I think they are unavoidable at first). Yet since these and other questions have caused me a great amount of pain, I am decoding the stereotypes that society has embedded into me that somehow I am incomplete; that to be a \u201ccomplete family\u201d means a mother, a father and a brood of children.  Religion can be cited as a root cause of such beliefs. In order to protect the \u201ctribe,\u201d the history of the Hebrews  \u2013 as one example \u2013 thought it was important to have many children, and  Monty Python  , well, they had a comment or two about the Catholics and breeding \u2014 but this is not to finger point in any way shape or form. It\u2019s just that religion once had much to do with the way people made families and thought about them. War and the costs of having children also contributed to the decline of birth-rates in addition to families without fathers and brothers. Many events have changed our views about the constitution of the family. Yet in this \u201cday and age,\u201d there are many kinds of families. In fact about 16% of Canadian children are raised by their mothers alone. While the couple stat is still the largest  according to Stats Canada , the numbers are rising for \u201cdifferently configured\u201d families: Since 2001, there has been a large increase in one-person households. During this time, the number of one-person households increased 11.8%, more than twice as fast as the 5.3% increase for the total population in private households. At the same time, the number of households consisting of couples without children aged 24 years and under increased 11.2% since 2001. The households with the slowest growth between 2001 and 2006 were those comprised of couples and children aged 24 years and under; these households edged up only 0.4%. Between 2001 and 2006, the number of private households increased 7.6%, while the population in private households rose 5.3%. The census counted more than three times as many one-person households as households with five or more persons in 2006. Of the 12,437,470 private households, 26.8% were one-person households, while 8.7% were households of five or more persons.  Classroom course-packs are created to explain the different configurations of the family.  \u201cLearners will explore how Canadian families have changed over time and examine the factors that contribute to changing family and household structures. They will then create written or illustrated profiles of families and households to describe key trends and changes,\u201d it reads. I\u2019m thinking about Family Day awaiting Adam to come home, but of also the many friends I have who are single parents now. I think of all the friends I have as well who are only-children (do we attract one another or is it really the sign of the times?). So I walk and I\u2019m thinking about being an only-child, how my dad is an only, adopted child, and how Adam is more or less an only-child. Like my mother, Adam\u2019s half-siblings are so much older than he that my mother can attest that her life was very much  like  that of an only child.  As an only child and as a person who has had to adapt many times over the course of her life, I became more flexible about the people in my life and how I regard  them  as family. For me, the family is an act of daily creation and that of my own making.  I\u2019m quite certain my yearning to belong made me gravitate to people bigger families, but I can also say it\u2019s an alien experience being there.  People in big families don\u2019t always understand that people in small families have to work hard to fit in and we don\u2019t necessarily want to, entirely. We need to be accepted for who we are.  While we, in small families, may escape the drudge of the family-guilt trip, the feuds or the politics, I suspect people in larger families don\u2019t understand loneliness (another word that is a taboo and way over-stigmatized, thank you very much) and the need to be alone, while also the special skill we have at creating very close friendships. And yes, we need to be social too. As a quick aside, research into loneliness and solitude notes that people who are only children want and need solitude,  and  are sometimes lonely. Solitude and loneliness are not the same.  If you  don\u2019t  come from a large family, you just don\u2019t  get it  completely. Having had the experience, it\u2019s sort of like Christmas and all the presents at the beginning,  but there exists an overall lack of understanding by both parties \u2014 the big family and the lone ranger \u2014 on how to co-exist. The lone-ranger, understanding that nothing in life is forever and certain, doesn\u2019t quite comprehend how the big family member can take it all for granted (and sometimes even envies that!).  The lone ranger needs to get close and sometimes big families just don\u2019t have that kind of time. It is only at the point where things fall apart can the lone ranger really use her skills and hold people afloat. The big family is created. The small one keeps creating. One is not better than the other. They just are. I am very close to my parents and to some of my extended family members. My shape of family may not be traditional, but it exists. The act of creating families is an active experience not exclusive to a couple and procreation. Let\u2019s just say that I don\u2019t take my version of family for granted, and I highly appreciated the bigger one I once belonged to (and of course who are still there and who I still love in my lone-ranger kind of way). I watch the other single people today as I go on my walk on this chilly February day in Toronto \u2014 some are eating alone at restaurant tables as I pass by. I imagine some of them are without children and others are older who perhaps have lost their families, and I think about how most of us are trying to do the best we can, and some of us can feel particularly lonely on a Family Day. Yet I bet that most of these people have friends (who are with their families) and are chit-chatting with the people who have to work today, or maybe with the person at the table next to them.  Some other families might be taking great advantage of the holiday and may be spending it together, hopefully not pitying those who are without families (remember, pity stands perilously on the ledge of fear). Like Christmas, contrived holidays can make a lot of people who do not belong to a traditional family, feel like they are missing something. No one should have to feel as if they are missing something! What I\u2019m happy to see is that all kinds of families are beginning to become more accepted, but we need to discuss the nature of the family even more so that we can support all kinds of families \u2014 gay, single, common law, married, separated, extended, and the groups of friends that really, can be more like family than the families we\u2019re born to. Because really, none of us are alone. We are one big family and an important member of mine is about to join me in his new home.

{"date": "2010/02/14", "body": "It is Valentines Day. Aside from the red commercial hearts and roses we will buy only because the storefront displays will beckon, I wonder if people will remember fragility. The red hearts may be plastic but the real human ones bear no resemblance. Today is my official final day in my old home \u2014 the home I built with Adam\u2019s father.  I did move from it a few days ago \u2014 I don\u2019t think leaving precisely on Valentine\u2019s Day would have been easy because my mind tends to brood over such Hallmark things, despite my keen awareness of plasticity. As I said I would in a previous post, I ritualized in my own way.  I said goodbye to the rooms, picked out a stone from the backyard. But I couldn\u2019t stay long. It was just too painful once all of my things were gone. My memories are still too recent \u2014 Adam and I there snuggling just a few days earlier. \u201cSomeone else lives in the house I thought I\u2019d never leave. And the life I\u2019ve lived in that house, I now speak of in the past tense\u2026.The keys now belong to someone else. I can\u2019t open that door anymore, and the place beyond it is now as inaccessible to me as all the life I\u2019ve lived there, retrievable only in photographs, story and memory. Still, while I lived in that house it seemed that my life would continue there forever, that it was as substantial as the sofa I settled into in my study with a cup of tea at the end of each day.\u201d  (Excerpted from Louise DeSalvo\u2019s  On Moving: a Writer\u2019s Meditation on New Houses, Old Haunts And Finding Home Again. )  I created The Autism Acceptance Project in that study. Now, I\u2019ve created a new study where you see me sitting now. I am moving on. Aside from organizing a few things, I am trying to settle in my new home. I feel like maybe I can get back to deadlines,  TAAProject  and my writing. This evening, my friends and family will gather in my new dining room to help me toast a another new journey in another new home. Again, I believe rituals are so important. I await Adam to return on Monday afternoon from his mid-winter break so I can help him adjust here. We saw the neurologist last week who believes his spasms have more to do with transitions than anything else. Yet, to be prudent, he must still have the EEG to ensure this isn\u2019t something biological. My suspicion, however, is that Adam has been just as stressed as I have been. According to that infamous \u201ctop-life stresses\u201d list, moving and divorce are right up there. Dash in a few other things over the past two years and the plate, as they say, has been pretty full. Being in the new house and taking it in for a few days on my own helps me calm with it, and I need to be calm for Adam. He feels and takes on every emotion I have. As his mother, it\u2019s hard not to feel guilty, but I try to fend that off as it is such a waste of precious energy. I have to teach Adam many things two of which; 1) I am human and,  2) that the only reason we are here is to make the best of what we have. I believe these are good things to teach autistic children \u2014 the children we so often say need consistency and structure. While I believe that to be so true, it\u2019s not always the way life goes.  Saying that, I\u2019ve also learned an important lesson on the fragility of the heart and of the roots we think we build. In fact, I think the lesson I was meant to learn was that of impermanence. We all want our children to feel stable as it is an important factor in healthy growth, but I\u2019m beginning to believe that an important gift we can give to our children is to also teach about how things change. \u201cPaint peels, plaster cracks, and gardens, of course, are the most ephemeral constructions of all.\u201d (Louse DeSalvo p. 149). I know we are supposed to keep structure in our children\u2019s lives \u2014 particularly autistic children who are so prone to anxiety \u2014  but the fact of the matter is that all of life is outside of our control. We take what we are given and polish it. And it\u2019s definitely okay to cherish it too.  \u201cThe gleam of a loved house lasts only as long as he who loves it can keep polishing.\u201d (p.149) This goes for all the people we love too.

{"date": "2010/02/17", "body": "\nI\u2019m filing. Yes, it sounds tedious but I\u2019m trying to approach this with a new zeal. Moving into a new home is one thing. Moving into a new life after a separation where all of a sudden I have to learn things like personal finance among many other nitty gritty things once shared with a spouse can be a little overwhelming at first.  There are no secretaries to do the filing for me. No one to make that call or file that paper. I am taking care, for the first time in my life (believe it or not) of everything. I mean, I am a capable human being, but what is it about suddenly being on one\u2019s own to encourage this level of emotional stress? Ah, right. It was loving someone. It was remembering when someone used to make me a cup of tea and when I helped that someone with other tasks. It was sharing. Now, it feels like all I have are to-do lists for Adam, the house, for me\u2026 for EVERYTHING that it resembles Santa\u2019s Wish List from all children around the globe. I have to admit I am getting cranky. I felt guilty about that until I read (in a Toronto service for divorced people) a check-list for stress. One of them is being irritable and easy to set-off.  The stress is pretty heavy. I\u2019m trying to transition Adam and forgot that I am also still transitioning myself. I\u2019ve gained weight (I am the kind who puts on weight when stressed out). I haven\u2019t been looking after  me  \u2014 something that most moms of special needs kids talk about a lot, never mind adding divorce stress on top of it.  Maybe it\u2019s a little feminist of me to suggest that maybe I let other people take care of me a little too much.  I resemble the capable, intelligent woman who deferred many of these tasks to a man. Yet I also don\u2019t believe that sharing the tasks is a bad thing at all. It\u2019s not learning and not knowing  how  that can be dangerous. When confronted now with sorting new things out in life,  it feels foreign and I need to map it out. To my surprise, Adam was very happy last night exploring the new house and making quite a mess of it \u2014 opening doors, taking things out of cupboards and I figured that as long as he was safe this was important for him to do. Like discovering routes (yes, intended pun), my little Autie is making himself feel at home. Who am I to tell him to put everything away when I\u2019m trying to make him as comfortable as possible? He needs to know what\u2019s behind all those doors. He needs to sort out his new environment. Many an autistic person will attest, like Adam, that routes and familiarity are very important.  So the house was in shambles this morning. I tidied up after Adam left. Putting things away leaves me with a sense of order and peace that I\u2019m looking for in my transition right now. I\u2019m trying hard to slow down instead of rushing forward. I have decided today to take breaks which is something new for me \u2014 the kind of person who always always ate lunch at her desk.  And yes, I\u2019m filing. It is helping me think.  Everything has a place and there\u2019s a place for everything, as the saying goes.  My life is out of the boxes, but it\u2019s going in files.

I have to admit that his hugs and grins are like Valium \u2014 the moment he does that my entire body relaxes. As his mother, I am happy when Adam is happy. Adam is happy when I am happy.  One thing is for sure as I watched his face searching mine this morning and on his way out the door to school is that for Adam,  I  am home. This is home because I am here. For all the worrying I\u2019ve been doing, it dawns that I am the most important person in Adam\u2019s life. I am the most constant, the most present, although, of course he has many people who also love and support him. Below is a little snapshot of Adam when he came home from school as I let him relax. It doesn\u2019t show the exuberance that came afterward \u2014 and the searching for mommy in order that he could snuggle in the crook of my arm for me to read him his favorite books ( Little Ms. Shy  and  Mr. Quiet , no less). As I watch what Adam does and how he does it; as I pay attention to the books he brings me, he is telling me a whole lot. I say this as I am also skeptically  reading about a cuddle drug for autism  (Adam is the  best  cuddler and most affectionate child). It can be frustrating when I am worried about Adam and he cannot communicate everything that\u2019s on his mind.  Considering all the issues with autism and communication, it is those moments when I step back and pay attention that I can really appreciate Adam and  the many things he has to say.  Thank goodness for autistic behaviours  for they are telling me so much! Adam is telling me how much he needs me and my support. He is telling me how much he loves me! We are home.

{"date": "2010/02/20", "body": " We\u2019ve had some encouraging messages lately, haven\u2019t we? The  HBO production of Temple Grandin  played by Claire Danes shows that while (and many of us have read Temple\u2019s books already) the world caused her anxiety, she could \u201csee details other people are blind to,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a gift.\u201d Certainly the idea of giftedness, which happens in non autistic and autistic persons, can be yet another stereotype in assessing autistic people. Perception, on the other hand, is something to think about deeply. When Adam was very young, we had these water blocks that were dyed different colours. Adam was mesmerized by these blocks watching the water swish and swoosh. Then all of a sudden, my wobbly toddler took them up to the window and peered through them.  Ah, I thought. If only we could all stare at the world through coloured water blocks. How beautiful it would be.  I know was also in part a cooing mother of a young autistic boy, so anything he did like this made me hyper-aware. But still. When he got his \u201clegs\u201d and we began walking around the neighbourhood, Adam memorized his routes. To this day, if we take him to his old house and walk from there or the park nearby, he will remember how to get to that park or get back through the old \u201csecret pathway\u201d to the old house \u2014 which has even since been torn down and rebuilt! Remember, that was his two-three year old brain. In April, he will be eight-years-old. Coming out soon will be a new version of Lewis Carroll\u2019s  Alice in Wonderland , directed by Tim Burton. Many people suspect that Carrol was himself autistic with his different perceptual abilities. He is often cited as a person who \u201csuffered\u201d from micropsia and macropsia, which is a neurological condition that changes the way the brain perceives the size of objects. When Alice falls down that rabbit hole, we get a look into Carroll\u2019s mind.  Scientific American Mind published Extraordinary Perception by Wray Herbert  this month. It discusses how  psychologists at University College London  \u201cthink that it might be a mistake to consider [autistic] distractability as simply a deficit. To the contrary, Anna Remington and John Swettenham and their colleagues speculate that people with ASD might have  greater  than normal capacity for perception, so that what appears as irrelevant distraction is really a cognitive bonus.\u201d I added  autistic  to  distractability  as many therapies for autism as well as medications are geared at lessening it.  The test, the article shows, was for subjects to \u201crapidly determine if the letters N or X were present in the ring\u201d on a computer screen. Participants had to then \u201chit the corresponding key on the keyboard. Some of the circles \u2014 those with more letters \u2014 were more difficult to process than others. There were also other letters floating outside the circle, but the subjects were specifically instructed to ignore those letters. Those floating letters were the laboratory equivalent of an irrelevant distraction in the real world.\u201d In measuring perceptual capacity, researchers saw that \u201ceveryone was slower at the task when the ring contained more letters. The researchers were also measuring distractibility. When a letter outside the ring was one of the target letters (N or X), the subjects often took a longer time finding the N or X in the ring \u2014 indicating they were distracted by the presence of a target letter in the location that they were supposed to ignore.\u201d  The researchers reasoned \u201cthat as long as the subjects\u2019 total perceptual capacity was not exhausted, they would also process the irrelevant, distracting letters within their visual field.  Once they had surpassed their perceptual capacity \u2014 once the ring of letters was sufficiently complex \u2014 irrelevant processing would stop  [bold mine]. So if ASD subjects in fact have greater processing capacity, then they should process more distracting information even as the main task becomes increasingly complex.\u201d In conclusion, \u201calthough there was no difference among subjects in either reaction time or accuracy on the main task, those with ASD processed the irrelevant letters while solving much more complex problems.. .Put another way, they weren\u2019t ignoring the main task, nor were they distracted away from it. Instead they were completing their work and moving on, using their untapped capacity \u201d [bold mine]. This article also concludes that while this is a benefit, it also does have \u201creal-life consequences.\u201d They begin and end the article citing  Tim Page, an author with Aspergers from his book, Parallel Play: Growing Up With Undiagnosed Asperger\u2019s.  Page recounts his time in school who failed an essay about his field trip which was quite detailed in terms of his way of perceiving it, and how he was scolded for writing in that particular way. \u201cI had noticed the wrong things,\u201d he writes. As a parent of an autistic child who has difficulties with verbal communication, I have to ask the question: \u201cwhose  problem  is this anyway?\u201d Certainly I have been dealing with issues, at least issues for me as Adam cannot comment here yet, so I am fully aware that I need to be fair. He has very real sensory and perceptual differences, so I set up a basement full of equipment for him to self-soothe. He has even learned to \u201cself-regulate\u201d by going to read his own books, and I never had to teach him that. His body will completely quiet as he flips through pages of encyclopedias, dictionaries, cookbooks, among many other subjects. He may even appear to layperson as not really paying attention and just flipping pages, but I know it\u2019s more than that. His body-jerking almost always stops, which is how I conclude that he is soothed by his books. I am imagining him looking at those books over and over again, and what he may be gleaning from them. Still, when it comes to getting the responses WE need, he using a \u201cspecial\u201d reading program at school. Indeed it is really helping with his expressive reading ability, and maybe even with his vocabulary.  So I need to let him do both. He needs to learn to respond in a world that doesn\u2019t yet understand the way he learns. He also needs to flip through pages and pages on his own. I can sit beside him sometimes also and talk about the books he is reading. We can type about what he is reading, we can draw stories and make more conclusions or assumptions about what he is reading. When we do things together calmly, we are having lots of fun. When we teach him a new communication device, it may appear to the person who is teaching that Adam is not focused enough \u2014 indeed he appears to be \u201chighly distracted.\u201d On an AAC device (we are still awaiting one from a service-provider here in Toronto) his finger will go to the right picture, letter, or answer, and then he will quickly go to another one to check out what it will do. A keyguard helps him direct his finger more quickly to the correct response. He may have trouble finishing sentences (when he types) and then be reminded to \u201cstay on task.\u201d This is in large part what Facilitated Communication attempts to assist with if done correctly \u2014 to remind and assist with the focus. To a person who cannot detect that Adam was about to give the \u201cright\u201d answer (or rather the answer that was requested of him), he would receive a failing grade. Adam is very young and I believe he is not given the benefit of the doubt enough, although his team members are good with this.  It is only fair to say that we do not KNOW everything he knows. We do not fully understand how he takes all this knowledge in and we are the ones that deem his versions of knowledge as irrelevant. We have not developed sufficient ways to measure his responses or his way of learning and seeing, except for the ways we measure responses and knowledge from people who are not autistic. This brings me back to the old ABA adage, \u201cif we can measure it, we can deal with it.\u201d Unfortunately, the way we have historically dealt with autism is by eliminating the behaviours and learning patterns that are essential to an autistic person\u2019s existence. Perhaps continuing to fund this research more heavily is important because as we understand how autistic people learn, we can not only develop better learning tools, but come to better appreciate our children.  Trying to understand this is a first step. As Adam\u2019s parent, I see many of the so-called \u201cissues\u201d being mine, and yes, I become just as frustrated as many other parents out there. It\u2019s really hard to see Adam in distress and it\u2019s even harder to always be guessing what may be causing anxiety or body-jerking (Lack of calcium? Trouble at school? New self-awareness of difference? Trouble with transitioning from task to task? Lack of sleep? Seizures? A very long winter? Lack of exercise? Another neurological issue?\u2026The guess work list is too long).  Since Adam appears to be in discomfort since late last fall, I am really working hard at figuring this out (wait-lists are long here in Toronto). Sleep issues, anxiety issues \u2014 I know when I have a level head, there is more that I can do for him to ease the situation. We need science now to figure out many of our questions.  Sometimes it feels that makeshift solutions only lead to more issues.  Sure, we all want things to be a little easier, but Adam requires more consideration in order to achieve that balance between helping him through discomfort as well as accommodating his needs. As I have been through a difficult year, like many of you out there, I completely understand the reasoning, but I have to keep a level head and look at what Adam has also gone through with a \u201cbroken\u201d family.  I have needed my sleep, but if Adam cannot, I have to find safe ways of letting him stay up until his body will sleep naturally. I know what I\u2019m saying isn\u2019t easy and there are still days I will resort to the Melatonin, even though, because of the guesswork involved, it pains me to do so. Yet I also know it\u2019s important to stop and slow down and think about how Adam feels and perceives. When I do, everything seems a little easier. As a parent, I can even become proud of myself (it\u2019s important) that I\u2019ve not only managed well, but have helped Adam out too. We are still on that path to finding out if we can help Adam, but I am always wondering excessively about how I perceive the \u201cproblem.\u201d I\u2019m interested in what people in science think about this Perception study.  I think we have to spend a lot more time imagining what it feels like to be in Wonderland. \u2014\u2014- Excerpts from:   \u201cExtraordinary Perception\u201d by Wray Herbert in March/April 2010 issue of Scientific American Mind, pp. 68-69.

{"date": "2010/02/23", "body": "We are confronted with new challenges in our new home. Adam seemed to transition well at first, but now it is difficult again. As mentioned in the previous post, we do not know if Adam\u2019s spasms are seizures or are spurned by tumultuous transition.  On my end, all I want to do is get back on track with Adam. I for certain want my sleep as I function horribly without it.  I want him to get over the hump as smoothly as possible until he can have his tests and/or become comfortable in his new home and situation. But there\u2019s another problem. It could be me. I need to re-learn my ABC\u2019s. Remember those:  Antecedent, Behaviour, Consequence? We put an autistic child under our neurotypical microscope (as if  that  doesn\u2019t cause distress), and evaluate the antecedent (or cause) of a behaviour so that we can seek to change (or eliminate) it. The Consequence in behavioural-speak is what happens after the behaviour. I\u2019m not saying that these tools are not useful to us. They can be if we learn how to assist autistic children cope. I\u2019m not a fan of eliminating behaviour. But there\u2019s another side to this story. When I worry I am studying Adam. I watch for every little sign. Then I realize that I\u2019m not watching myself. How am I feeling? How has my anxiety triggered a course of events? Adam just wants to explore, and yes, he cannot sleep like most autistic people who, as they become adults, learn to cope on very little.  In his new home, Adam is very \u201cdisorganized\u201d in his body (for those unfamiliar with this language, it means that Adam is moving his body in unfamiliar ways or hyperactive ways and it can appear distressing), and I still do not know for sure if it\u2019s medical. Yet, I also am thinking he is learning about every nook and cranny of the house as he used to memorize routes on road trips from school to home or from his old house to the park.  While he didn\u2019t get upset if we changed the route, he certainly memorized it. I\u2019m thinking of Dawn Prince Hughes, author (and new friend of mine since I met her in Toronto a couple of years ago \u2014 little did she know that I was a HUGE fan of her book beforehand) of  Songs of A Gorilla Nation: My Journey Through Autism  and the excerpt on herself as a child running around in the same circle in her house. Experiencing this first hand, it\u2019s exhausting for a parent who wants their child to \u201cbehave\u201d or settle. Then I have to think again. \u201cThe way I said \u2018siiiilllverrr doooollllaaarrr\u2019 was only the start of a profound pattern I had throughout childhood saying words and phrases in peculiar, experimental ways and having a complete fascination for words. When I was young, my parents and I often stayed at my mother\u2019s new house, and my favorite uncle lived there also. A hallway ran around the perimeter of the house, past the dining room, the bedrooms, the bathroom, the front door, and through the living room back to the dining room, in a big circle. My favorite game (to the exclusion of all others) was to wait in the dining room for the adults to come up with a word \u2014 the more difficult the better \u2014 and then I would speed off down the hallway, in the same direction every time, either on my tricycle or on foot, repeating the word over and over.\u201d  (pp. 17-18). Hughes describes then running to each of the rooms saying the word \u201cwhere the word would absorb the comfort of my grandparent\u2019s bed, their clothing, the beauty of the vanity table, and the smell of cedar drawers\u2026\u201d (p. 18) Not only have I found Adam enclosed in drawers, but under the bed, and in the deep dark crawl space in our new basement. It takes a lot of effort for me to stay awake and keep an eye on him, as his safety always comes first. His body jerks, he lays on his back and holds his legs. He opens every cupboard, closet and drawer and is still absorbing them \u2014 and maybe he can do this better when he can enter them.\u00a0 Save for the things that he knows \u2014 books, his computer that still has the same \u201cAlligator King\u201d from Sesame Street on it, and a cupboard full of crackers and goodies he now knows is his own, he is still disorganized here but is working so hard himself on trying to get organized and calm. Indeed, my boy is making gargantuan efforts. To this Hughes writes,  \u201cI also wanted to keep as many of my own accoutrements as possible the same. This meant that I did not want a new toothbrush, new clothes, new shoes\u2026When I went shopping for clothes with my mother [Hughes describes being afraid of mannequins]\u2026My strategy for survival was to hide inside the clothing racks\u2026the lack of light would calm me down. Hiding was yet another thing that later connected me to my gorilla family \u2014 when they went behind the hills to sit or seek out the little caves in the underbrush or rock to be by themselves, I would understand.\u201d  (p.21). Similarly, Adam has gone to the books that were the same from his old house. He is not interested yet in new things. Adam\u2019s grandparents have been around a lot to support him. I believe his grandparents are two of his favorite people (and most consistent). Again this relates so closely to Hughes: \u201cWhen I was young I stayed with my grandparents on the weekends, and those were among my favorite times. I did feel safe there.\u201d (pp. 21-22). Ask my parents and they\u2019ll likely say that their condo is his \u201cturf.\u201d They have been helpful to Adam and I during this time. Adam craves lemons during this year of transition. To this, Hughes writes,  \u201cI craved salt and would eat it straight from the shaker. I craved burnt matchheads and would suck on them whenever I could find them. I craved Alka Seltzer for its taste and feel\u2026.A sound like the thrum of a tumbler full of milkshake when is was tapped [Adam does this all the time] by a spoon or the Westminster chime of the clock would fill me with rapture.\u201d So I give Adam his lemons. Right now, I\u2019ll buy him a bucketfull, although other people will tell him to \u201cstop eating lemons,\u201d or, \u201cstop doing that.\u201d Sure, I worry about his teeth, or of Adam\u2019s safety in potentially dangerous situations. I\u2019m not saying that we have to allow our kids to do everything, but I have to let him do more than usual and I have to change my behaviour to accommodate it right now, for this is an exceptional situation. I\u2019m always trying to stay one step ahead of Adam to figure out how he can explore safely. \n \u201cMost autistic people need order and ritual and will find ways to make order where they feel chaos. So much stimulation streams in, rushing into one\u2019s body without ever being processed: the filters that other people have simply aren\u2019t there. Swimming through the din of the fractured and the unexpected, one feels as if one were drowning in an ocean without predictability, without markers, without a shore. It is like being blinded in the brightness of a keener sight. Autistic people will instinctively reach for order and symmetry; they arrange the spoons on the table, they line up matchsticks, or they rock back and forth, cutting a deluge of stimulation into smaller bits with repetition of their bodies\u2019 movements.\u201d  (p. 25). This is quite an overwhelming statement for me on how Adam may be experiencing his new life situation. It is quite a disability and a sensory overload.  My point is, Adam is adapting as naturally as he can in a home that is entirely new to him. He will thrust his body upside down, will spin, will seek those dark tight spaces and not be able to sleep in his new bed precisely because he has not yet created his order. But he is doing what he needs to do. I, on the other hand, despite knowing this, am having difficulties of my own in managing it. Watching my son in distress distresses  me . While this may be natural for Adam, it was re-reading some of Dawn\u2019s excerpts this morning that helped me realize what I\u2019ve learned in the past, but am now experiencing first-hand in a larger way. I realize that I too am adjusting to my new surroundings as I listen to the house and figure out how I\u2019m supposed to live in it. Things break down and I get frustrated because I am not yet calm and oriented, and this is difficult on both Adam and I.\u00a0 While I feel guilty much of the time that my own anxiety is not helping Adam, I know too that we are not in control of everything that happens to us.  Life happens. We are dealing with it. Like Adam, I am human. So I was thinking about going back to the ABC\u2019s and I thought of using it as a pun on behavioural-speak because what most of us want to try and do is \u201cfix\u201d the situation or behaviour. Today, I am reminding myself that this needs exploration and time \u2014 we\u2019ve only been in our new house for a week!  Not only does the alphabet, which Adam loves, stay constant in a world that is always changing, but re-reading Dawn\u2019s book has helped me realize what tumultuous change feels like to an autistic child. It may require more effort on my part now to help him adapt by creating safe ways for him to do so. Adam will reach for his ABC books that always stay the same and he\u2019s doing his part, and I am having this feeling he will eventually make lemonade out of lemons.

{"date": "2010/02/28", "body": "This study sent a little shiver through my body.  Remember the story of the big bad  \u201cRefrigerater Mother?\u201d  She was the mother who was blamed for causing autism in her child in the 1960\u2019s.  Many mothers during that period were tormented for being pushed to believe they were the cause of their child\u2019s autism. I wonder if the legend survives. From a peripheral read of the following study, this mom had a maternal \u201cfirst response:\u201d  A new study by researchers from the University of Miami shows that maternal sensitivity may influence language development among children who go on to develop autism. Although parenting styles are not considered as a cause for autism, this report examines how early parenting can promote resiliency in this population. The study entitled, \u201cA Pilot Study of Maternal Sensitivity in the Context of Emergent Autism,\u201d is published online this month and will appear in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders . I am not commenting on how the study was conducted nor the value of \u201cresiliency.\u201d I am commenting on the inference. I am a sensitive mother. Some say I\u2019m pretty good at mothering. I\u2019m extremely sensitive to my son, and he is  non verbal . He can manage a word or phrase now and again, but at nearly eight years of age, it\u2019s pretty difficult. I engaged Adam. I did everything (and still do everything) I can think of. He is a wonderful child who is anxious and has some sleep issues. I\u2019m not sure I could have been even more sensitive than I was to make him more resilient. While he\u2019s pretty good at moving around the community, going to school (with an aide), traveling, he does have extremely difficult days too and we are going through some of them RIGHT NOW during a major transition in our lives. Because of Adam I continue to grow and learn how to work  with  him, and there is always something new for me to learn.   With this study, I fail to see an acknowledgment (in the links I could find tonight, I have to qualify this) that for many autistic individuals the inability to speak fluently, or at all, is neurological, not just dependent on the sensitive mother. The term \u201cre-wiring\u201d is used a lot for individuals with brain injury and just as often by gurus selling therapies for curing autism.  I will never argue that, as parents, we all want to try and help our children in a world that is often confusing and frustrating for them. Yet, I also wonder if teaching autistic children how to communicate is something very different than re-wiring, for that implies that we are fixing something to make it better. Adam communicates all the time. Like the two-year-old who may have warbled speech indecipherable to many but the parent, some of us close to Adam know what he is communicating \u2014 and quite boldly.  Perhaps we might consider that working with autistic children is like figuring out the intricate wiring that already exists. Like the ill-suited American plug to the European outlet, maybe we aren\u2019t meant to re-wire the autistic brain into a neurotypical one. \u201cIn this study, maternal sensitivity (and primarily, sensitive structuring) was more predictive of language growth among toddlers developing autism than among children who did not go on to an autism diagnosis. One possible explanation is that children with autism may be more dependent on their environment to learn certain skills that seem to come more naturally to other children.\u201d I would agree that our children need our support, and this does take extra effort on our part. \u201cParenting may matter even more for children with developmental problems such as autism because certain things that tend to develop easily in children with typical neurological development, like social communication, don\u2019t come as naturally for kids with autism, so these skills need to be taught,\u201d says Jason K. Baker, a postdoctoral fellow at the Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison, who conducted the study with Messinger while at UM.\u201d I don\u2019t disagree with the idea that autistic children require more support and accommodation in a confusing environment,  and that \u201cbeing sensitive\u201d is especially important.  Many of this know this. I tend to see this as part of the autism and NT (neurotypical) equation, for the key is that we as parents learn how our children learn and how they see the world. I don\u2019t see it as a tugging into \u201cour world,\u201d but a sharing. It\u2019s the manner in which we, as parents, figure out  how  to be with the child who is already with us, with challenges in a world that has such difficulty understanding autism, but also with many strengths and attributes.  Acceptance is a daily exercise and the idea will challenge us day in and day out \u2014 some days (and nights) more than others. Every day Adam works so hard to accept me, to accept this world and the people around him, and I wonder if that\u2019s all we seem to ask him to do. The least we can do is to accommodate him and what he needs and wants from this world. This article ends with a shallow disclaimer: \u201cWe know that parenting doesn\u2019t cause autism. The message here is that parents can make a difference in helping their children fight against autism.\u201d  Okay, it doesn\u2019t  cause  autism, but the implication is that the sensitive mother can improve language acquisition and resiliency skills. The results may have been one hundred percent true according to the study design, but the key piece of accepting autism is missing.  While it is certainly advantageous to have a sensitive parent to ANY child, I would hate to think that one might judge me as being an insensitive one if my son is not able to speak. Further, the focus on mothers specifically has reminded me of times I thought had long gone by. Maybe the  Refrigerator Mother  still lurks in the dark recesses of some minds. To conclude from my peripheral read and no reading of scientific critique on how the study was conducted, I sniff not only an omission or two, but a little bias.\n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://autism.about.com/od/causesofautism/p/refrigerator.htm", "http://www.physorg.com/news186318343.html"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2010/02/28/a-mothers-first-reponse-to-the-maternal-sensitivity-study/", "title": "A Mother\u2019s First Reponse to the \u201cMaternal Sensitivity\u201d Study"},

We\u2019ve had a difficult weekend with anxiety so I\u2019m taking a moment to permit myself to daydream a bit. Writing the book is a challenge with Adam\u2019s needs. I haven\u2019t showered since Thursday. I have to admit I\u2019m dreaming of a little white cottage on the beach by the sea. For some reason, I think I\u2019ll just be pumping out the writing there.

{"date": "2010/02/25", "body": " Tilikum is the \u201ckiller\u201d whale confined at Seaworld with an apparently demanding entertainment schedule.  Listening to Naomi Rose, head of the American Humane Society and a mammal scientist on CBC News at Noon today, she noted that Tilikum is not meant to \u201cbe a clown,\u201d and that this puts a great deal of stress on the animal, explaining reasons for its aggressive behaviour. She spoke about Orca Whales as \u201cindividuals,\u201d  and discussed them and their families, as well as their social networks, and that when in their natural environment, do not attack humans. In the media, the debate rages as to whether the whale should be put down, kept at Seaworld to remain an entertainer, or be sent to a Sea Tank in Iceland \u2014 a choice which Rose recommends. Transcribing her statements on CBC today, she noted that Tilikum has a history of this behaviour and should not be kept under the same conditions. In other words,  get the message! \u201cHe could be trained to adjust to going out into the open ocean to exercise and get more choices and then maybe his stress would be reduced,\u201d she said, suggesting Tilikum may have simply been trying to play with his trainer. \u201cIf they keep him in isolation the way they do, they keep him in that small tank that he\u2019s in, this is going to happen again.\u201d  There sure is a lot of attention for this beautiful creature. All the talk about how the animal is under stress and how that animal communicates that stress naturally got me thinking about Adam, autism and methods of communication and how many of us do the same things over and over again to no avail. Working against nature doesn\u2019t  work  for very long. It has real consequences. We are calmer on the home-front again and Adam seems to have found his place here in the house that has been understandably strange. I expect that while he is calm now, we will have a few more bouts of stress. Like Tilikum, we cannot demand that he perform like nothing has happened to him, or not react to this kind of change.  Adam will communicate his true nature and it is up to me to listen. Now if autism advocates would advocate for autism they way Naomi Rose does for Tilikum\u2026 In keeping with the theme of this story is a post by Clay I would urge readers to visit:  \u201cViolated for Having Autism.\u201d \u00a0  ", "outgoing_links": ["http://cometscorner-clay.blogspot.com/2010/02/violated-for-having-autism.html"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2010/02/25/autism-and-the-whale/", "title": "Autism And The Whale"},
{"date": "2009/12/15", "body": "Well, we attempted the EEG with zero success. Adam is an antsy kind of guy and even chlorohydrate does not put him to sleep as hospital staff had hoped. From past dental surgeries, I knew it would not, but I was hoping it would make him drowsy enough to stay still.  It has, as I have seen in previous dental surgeries, lessened Adam\u2019s fight, but as I\u2019ve learned from doing an EEG, one cannot move\u2026 AT ALL. Every movement records and Adam, even with sedation, is up and down on the gurney like a yo-yo, sort of drunk but not inebriated enough by medication  to have a happy drunkard\u2019s sleep.  It\u2019s sort of like watching a person who wants to rest, but his body won\u2019t allow it. And I\u2019m wondering if he needs to move more, now that we live in a city where children don\u2019t really go out to play much, but are over-scheduled instead with instruction and programs. It makes me want to say,  fly little bird fly , and in about an hour, that\u2019s just what I\u2019m going to let him do at the park. He needs exercise, some sun, yes, that might do some good too. I\u2019ve done about everything I can do now. Now we have to wait to see the neurologist and for other subsequent appointments I\u2019ve lined up to, hopefully, cross all more serious suspicions off the list.  We did had a good day yesterday and so far so good today (Adam did not get upset by going back to the hospital and was back to his funny, affable self). And I\u2019m hoping that after we do what we must to rule out or find some facts, Adam might just have his issues resolved when he heads down to Florida to his favorite spot \u2014 the beach.  In the meantime, this mom is still clutching to her anxiety, which is sort of the aftershock of being in hospital and orchestrating many people to have made this EEG happen today. It should be understandable why I\u2019m disappointed and still concerned. I certainly do relate to many of you out there these past few days when times have been tougher for you too.

Adam is in a state of pain that seems uncontrollable.  It began over a month ago, longer perhaps, when Adam began jaw clenching which moved into whole body spasms. Usually, when Adam is ill, or is getting a cold, he can\u2019t stop moving his body and manifests his physical discomfort in body jerks and movement so much so, I feel his pain. If his ears hurt, or his mouth hurts, he has come to tell me so. But not this time. So I\u2019ve reached out to a few of my autistic friends to ask about myclonic seizures or other types of seizures that appear like body spasms and occur while a person is still conscious. It\u2019s the kind of thing that I can\u2019t tell is a bladder infection, growing pains, stress, or something more serious.

{"date": "2009/12/13", "body": "When I wrote  The Joy of Autism  blog, I wrote a mantra with one line that said \u201cbecause joy doesn\u2019t come without struggle.\u201d  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s part of the way I think about things, something about me, but my friends certainly share the struggle part.  I am lucky to be able support some friends in some difficult times right now as my friends are supporting me. I have to think long and hard these days about joy and struggle and still, I am so convinced that if people understood autism a little more, we would not have necessarily had insult added to injury in the emergency ward. Adam and I returned from the hospital yesterday after observation Friday night. We did not go to our usual hospital, and the benefits of not going to it may have been some extra attention in the end. But attending emergency was a bit of a nightmare as everyone who registered after us, got admitted before us, even though they didn\u2019t look that ill at all (and consequently they all got discharged while we were still sitting in emerg). After having asked the triage nurse \u201chow much longer, can\u2019t you see he\u2019s in pain writhing over there,\u201d in a relative calm voice, she told me not to yell at her (are they trained in saying that even though someone is not yelling?). I had to do my part in managing her the way she was, I suppose, trained in managing me.  It took some, let\u2019s just say, urging after that to get Adam in (she had been lying about the crowds in the hallways inside because once we got in, it was relatively empty) or else we would have likely spent another three hours just sitting there without any help or attention. There was absolutely no visibly known/obvious reason for this after we were admitted. Many families can imagine a child screaming so much til they are red in the face. In addition to whatever is happening with Adam, going to the hospital and waiting is one of his number one stressors. \u201cCan he at least have a sedative?\u201d I asked after waiting six hours like this, Adam\u2019s face apple red, his lips quivering, his whole body shaking and contorting into a letter C. Nothing. Thankfully, from my trip to Paris, my bag was full of goodies. I found melatonin strips buried deep at the bottom and after six hours of waiting for any kind of help, gave him a strip. By the time Adam\u2019s dad and grandfather arrived, the edge was gone and Adam was lying on top of me on a gurney. The doctor was prudent enough to want to observe Adam overnight and I got to sleep with him in the pediatric ward. Later arrived his bag from home with DVD\u2019s, some food, his P.J\u2019s so I could try an emulate the comforts of home. Bloodwork was then taken with little trouble due to the melatonin and the hours of previous crying which had completely exhausted Adam. My mother went to the nurses station. \u201cYou are the talk of the station,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know melatonin worked for autistic kids.\u201d YIKES , I thought. Melatonin may not work for all autistic kids. In fact, some families have told me melatonin stops working. While I am grateful for the female doctor (not from Canada), for her soft bedside manner and her prudence with regards to his body jerks and spasms, I am still very concerned that hospitals do not understand the needs of autistic people and the stress levels that going to hospitals can create. I mean, as Adam was screaming, one staff in emerg said \u201cOh you mean he isn\u2019t always like this?\u201d And readers of this blog and my Facebook will know that uh, no, he is not \u201calways like this.\u201d Adam does not always spasm, contort, and melt-down. He has some anxiety but he is a very happy little guy. In addition, what would have happened if I did not have that melatonin on me?\u00a0 I mean, his heart was beating so fast I was concerned he\u2019d go into cardiac arrest. When they witnessed the calming effect they said, \u201cCan you give him another 3 mg before we give him his bloodwork?\u201d Folks, as \u201cautism parents\u201d we have to advocate for our children, and carry our \u201cbag of goodies,\u201d every day. Some days it seems that there is no one out there to help us when the times get tough. When there is one good person, they shine like the rays of light in an otherwise dark day. It is a universal truth, I believe, that every single one of us finds the \u201cadvocacy\u201d part exhausting as our children our lumped into the autism stereotype. And it\u2019s not helping, that stereotype, and this is what I hope to stress here in this post. It just seems to mean that Adam gets ignored because of it. Well, at least in the emergency ward (which needs a complete systemic overhaul in my opinion). While we await an EEG this week to hopefully rule out epilepsy, I am rudely awakened, despite all exhaustion today,  that we still have lots of work to do. There is joy, there is struggle. There is paradox. As my grandfather always told me, \u201cthat\u2019s life.\u201d My friend Leda sent me this piece of music today (see below). It calms me after the \u201cstorm.\u201d I think Adam will love it because it is calm.  It\u2019s sad and beautiful and just a piece of music for the moment because I am worried and a little \u201cspent.\u201d  Yet, even in this struggle, Adam is my joy and my life. He is the joy in our autism and for and because of him, we keep on going despite all with which we must deal.  In the words of Goethe:  \u201cDer Zweck des Lebens ist das Leben selbst,\u201d  I believe life is not just how \u201cgood\u201d we live it (that has been filtered down in our society to mean something quite trite) but in accepting and living with its struggles. Afterall, we just don\u2019t seem to have a choice.

{"date": "2009/12/16", "body": "All of us have encountered ongoing misunderstandings about our autistic children. Adam, going through something at the moment, could also very well be going through stress. Perhaps delayed, perhaps not, what really worries me is the assumption that just because he appears happy, that he must be happy and as such, because of his autism he is neither affected by nor registers the new people in his life and the separation itself. To borrow a recent post by  A Life Less Ordinary , Emily writes of this regarding the autistic child and school and it resonated with me in these days of Adam\u2019s apparent stress levels: \u2013An autistic child can often be\u201dlow arousal\u201d in certain ways. That means that even a brutal and ill-intended pummeling may not elicit a visible or detectable response. Never assume that such behavior is being taken in good part just because the autistic child isn\u2019t crying or complaining about it. \n\u2013An autistic child may not tell an adult about physical and emotional bullying unless they are very close to and comfortable with that adult. \n\u2013An autistic child may not respond to repeated insults until some unclear breaking point is reached. The autistic child may then respond. Just because the autistic child made no previous mention of the bullying doesn\u2019t somehow make the bullying OK or negate the fact that the child\u2019s response was provoked. \n\u2013An autistic child may not express the emotion you expect. An autistic child in great pain\u2013emotional or physical\u2013may smile or even laugh right through it. I can assure you that the laughter does not mean the autistic child is actually having a good time. \n\u2013An autistic child does not express himself or herself the way a neurotypical child or adult might. Try not to judge an autistic child\u2019s facial or emotional expressions through a neurotypical filter or from a neurotypical viewpoint. You\u2019ll never have the correct understanding of the autistic child if you do. \n\u2013An autistic child may look like s/he is having a great time. If that child is, however, in the midst of a scrum of running, pushing, verbally sparring children, that child likely has no idea what is really going on. And that child is also likely a target of under-the-radar bullying that you\u2019ll never hear about. \n\u2013An autistic child in an unstructured, chaotic social situation is a child who is likely completely at sea and who is likely the target of bullying, both subtle and overt, both physical and emotional. Don\u2019t ever lapse into thinking otherwise. \n\u2013An autistic child in the midst of more than a couple of neurotypical peers in an unstructured situation is never fully armed, never as completely socially able, never truly interacting on a level playing field as the neurotypical peers. Never. To assume otherwise is not to understand the autistic child. Like everyone, Adam responds well to a good vacation and in addition to some upcoming necessary tests, I\u2019m glad he will have one soon and hope for a resolution so that I really know what I\u2019m dealing with. He appears to be doing well in school, and accompanied by an aide, I am assured he is not being bullied. Yet I also wonder how he views himself now that he is maturing, next to his \u201ctypical\u201d peers and indeed, we are in a completely new phase of our lives. So a vacation is needed and mom needs to think. Unlike previous years, he will first go with his dad and then be rejoined with his mom in Florida.\u00a0 I am definitely concerned as his mom with all the transitions he has had to endure (as an autistic person they are far more stressful than for an average child) and the assumption that this separation has not effected him deeply, even though as parents, we are doing the best we can.

{"date": "2009/12/15", "body": "I always knew Adam was a tough little egg. As I had written earlier today, he defied the sleep aid in the hospital that would knock, likely, a typical kid on their back. Not my Adam; he was fighting this sleep. Maybe he was determined to defy any hospital hand after the weekend. No electrode would be placed on his adorable little autie head this morning.  I have to admit, this single mom is pooped. A couple of canceled events \u2014 of course I was going to cancel them and do everything and anything for the little man \u2014 all the worry, sleepless nights and all that social deprivation!  We met with unknowledgable Emergency Room staff (Did I say that? I really wanted to use the word  graceless ), I slept beside him in the pediatric ward for the first time since he was born, I orchestrated (felt more like moving mountains) to get this EEG  this week , instead of in February. And NADA. Anyone have a Grey Goose on ice?  Yet, just as it always goes when life seems to feel a little dark (it is December after all), I decide tonight that Adam, who has of late not been sitting very still or sleeping very much, will watch  E.T.  with me this evening. Movie watching can be a little precarious with Adam. He has been known to leave dark, hushed theatres mid-performance. I think the movies he has sat through from start-to-finish, so far, have been  Happy Feet ,  WALL-E , surprisingly,  Charlotte\u2019s Web  and that silly one with the hamsters playing 007 in 3-D, whatever  that  was. At home where he is allowed to roam freely to the kitchen, get his toys, his books, movie-watching can be next to impossible. So sleep deprived? Too bad. There is usually no rest in this house even when we are weary. I am happy to report that tonight, I managed to keep him with me on the couch \u2014 many a wriggle and a wrestle, a salty cracker or two. Okay, maybe three. When he saw  E.T.  and that typing device, I told him to look. He was, even though he would also wriggle, look at a book, eat a cracker, a banana, a glass of water, and peek often in between. \u201cLook at Elliot,\u201d I would urge, pointing my finger hoping for that good old joint attention. \u201cLook, look at E.T.! Isn\u2019t he  cute ,\u201d Adam looked at me with a smile, which, if you really had seen Adam\u2019s pain the past few days was lovely, relieving and made me appreciate every moment like this we\u2019ve EVER had. His cheeks seemed fuller, maybe because his colour came back. As he rubbed his soft head into my face, I could still detect the whiff of medicinal smell from the gel they had placed on his scalp. He rubbed his cheeks back and forth against mine for the feel of it, like Eskimo kisses and I laughed.  It felt like a bucket of soft feathers pouring over me, but really, it was love. He seemed to enjoy my antics more than the movie, or maybe he just liked it when mom sat there with him on the couch, eating crackers, drinking water, and fun-wrestling in my arms.  \u201cHome, home, home,\u201d he said at that point in the movie when the music billows, the volume rises, and the story ends.

{"date": "2009/12/29", "body": "\u201cYou didn\u2019t see me.\u201d That must be the most popular line of relationship distress we\u2019ve all ever heard and the reason for much heartache. With those who are closest to us, we yearn to be seen meaning, we want to be seen for who we really are \u2014 all that vulnerable, squishy stuff inside of us that we want others to take in their arms and hold gently. What does it mean to \u201cbe seen?\u201d I mean, out here in Miami there is no lack of men and woman stripping nude, or nearly nude, wanting to be seen. Hair coiffed just so, a pair of trendy sun glasses and a spray-on tan, and off they go into the public to show off with their heads held just so \u2014\u00a0 pretending as if they are not aware that others are staring. These people may want to be seen all right, but they want us to pay attention to what they want us to see. It is a far cry from being seen. If you think this post is about relationships it certainly could be. This is the meaty stuff of what makes or breaks many of them and why life is so hard sometimes. In his book  Double Take: A Memoir , Kevin Michael Connolly travels to more than seventeen countries and captured 33,000 photographs along the way about the way people see him. Born without legs, \u201cbeing seen\u201d takes on a whole new meaning. The photos in his book titled  The Rolling Exhibition  (named after his rolling around on a skateboard: \u201cThis Is A Legless Guy\u2019s Skateboard. Please Please, Don\u2019t Steal\u201d he writes upon it), have been featured at museums and galleries around the world. They are taken from his perspective, low to the ground, (he is lying on his back when he takes some of them) with people staring down at him, which of course has a pent-up meaning in itself when talking about disability and the way people stare. They are passer\u2019s by, whisking past him and he has caught their fleeting yet loaded glances. How could one describe them? Curiousity? Fear? What does it mean to be a subject of a stare when you have not intentionally invited it, unlike those plastic Miami boobs? (Interesting to go off on a tangent here to recognize that those fake boobies are in the same sense  a prosthesis  that we admire rather than fear. Of course, we have the same curiousity and sometimes repugnance at the fake boobie because we understand that some person has intentionally gone under the knife and altered herself to make her more attractive for sex and they don\u2019t look quite real. So we stare to make up our minds, or stare because we are just so darn curious.  Aimiee Mullins , who has designed for herself a series of gorgeous looking prosthetic legs that can make her various heights has also noted the lack of difference between her legs and the many prosthetics men and women now use by choice in order to alter their appearance). Like the performance artist  Petra Kuppers , who with her disability stages performances that also investigate the stare, in fact invite it, Connolly has invited it by his being born with bilateral amelia (meaning born without limbs). It\u2019s an unintended invitation, like being born into royalty with paparazzi following your every move. You don\u2019t ask for it; it\u2019s just sort of a birthright and a burden, whichever way you look at it \u2014 they seem to go hand-in-hand. What I love about the camera is that it\u2019s like staring back.\u00a0 Being a photographer means you are like a voyeur, capturing other\u2019s most private moments. One simple glance or expression, as they saying goes, captures a thousand words. Connolly has taken the stranger\u2019s stare and turned it back on them. It\u2019s rather empowering to turn the investigated into the investigator.\u00a0 If I were Petra Kuppers, I\u2019d be performing. If I were Estee Klar, I\u2019d be writing. It\u2019s what people who need to express a point, do. The camera captures private moments the way people stare at many disabled people who cannot fend off the stare. Often, we are intrepid lenses unwelcome in private moments. Yet Connolly, like all people who put their expressions out into the world has a conscience as he reflects in Sarajevo: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d [Beth] asked softly, her hand on my back. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can shoot this anymore.\u201d \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d \n\u201cI think I\u2019m hurting people.\u201d \n\u201cHow?\u201d \n\u201cPeople think I\u2019m a beggar of someone who was hurt here.\u201d \n\u201cWell, yeah. Maybe some people. But that doesn\u2019t make you any more of a beggar than you were a month ago. You and I know who you are, so don\u2019t let it get to you.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m using them for the photos.\u201d \n\u201cSo? It\u2019s not as if their entire day is ruined or anything. You\u2019re getting too wrapped up in everything. If you stop shooting and just quit, you\u2019re going to hate yourself forever.\u201d  (p. 198) It\u2019s a question of art to a certain extent \u2014 this idea of truth-telling and who and what moments we use as subjects. When we take our personal experiences and use others to reflect a truth, are we doing unto others as they do unto us?  The discussion about staring at people who look different or disabled is a sensitive one, and the more others can see themselves, the more we all can understand the effects of what we do everyday \u2014 those things we think are harmless like taking about an autistic person like they are not present, or criticizing the family, the parent, or autistic individual who needs to fight for things that come automatically to other families like access to education, services, and just acceptance into our communities without having to talk about autism, acceptance and the like. From a personal point of view, although I have to end up talking about it, I don\u2019t want to talk about it everyday. We want (and deserve) to live our lives with autism as does any other person who wants to live their lives in peace, without having to justify the reason why they deserve to be here \u2014 why they \u201chave\u201d autism, where it \u201ccomes\u201d from, or  why  they should have access to that school or that aide. As a writer who likes to write about certain instances in our day-to-day lives \u2014 from the person who stares at Adam\u2019s wildly flapping hands, to the friend whose account I once used about, when I was new to autism writing and the idea of \u201cnormal,\u201d  her  desire to change the appearance of her child\u2019s ears (I used the story about our quest to make our children appear indistinguishable and in Adam\u2019s case, it\u2019s simply impossible) \u2014 it\u2019s really difficult to write about these real-life events. Yet there is a need for many of us to write, or make photographs and art, about them.  It seems that everyone is sensitive, but the context in which these accounts are written are important. The consciousness of\u00a0 not wanting to hurt other people, seems to me, is a must in the making of art, not that the hurt won\u2019t be there. In the world of black-and-white autism politiking,\u00a0 there is a need for education through thoughtful literature, memoir, art projects like Connolly\u2019s. These projects help us understand life from a different perspective, and because it has been \u201cdone to him,\u201d Connolly has a need to state his sensitivity. The outcome of his work is worth it. Like art and writing, the poignant point is made when it is evident that the artist has weighed the cost and the benefit of telling true stories. In his  Epilogue , Connolly reflects how the looks, no matter how experienced or hardened we become, still effect him: \u201cAs these pages show, my lack of legs has generated a lot of strange looks. Those stares still get to me sometimes. Sometimes I wonder if I should explain myself to the people who shoot a sad direction in my direction. Maybe, if it would relieve that moment of guilt or pity from their lives, it would be worth it. But most of the time, I let those stares slide off my back. A lot of times, I don\u2019t want to talk about my lacking legs.  Maybe it\u2019s because dialogue has a tough time blooming when it\u2019s about negative space. There\u2019s only so much you can discuss about something that isn\u2019t there, and isn\u2019t forthcoming. And rather than try to make a bad riff on a Beckett play, I\u2019d prefer to end this page with what I do have\u2026 So maybe the reason I\u2019ve been so frustrated at times by the question What the hell happened to you?  [what caused your son\u2019s autism? \u2014 my interjection here]  is because it\u2019s simply the wrong one to pose. It focuses too much on a physical circumstance based on a singular point in time, rather than on all of the influences and characters that followed. Perhaps Where the hell did you come from? is what we all should be asking.\u201d  (pp.226-27) I would agree. It would be nice to be asked that question rather than \u201cwhat happened\u201d to us, even though autism is certainly a part of our lives. The question is,  Do you see me?  For Adam and I, and Kevin Michael Connolly, it seems, it means the whole package.  \u2014- Kevin Michael Connolly,  Double Take: A Memoir , New York: Harper Collins, 2009.

{"date": "2010/01/04", "body": "I feel manipulated.  Not by a person, but by the many messages I am getting about autism and high divorce rates. Imagine me now looking through new eyes. Adam\u2019s dad and I have been separated for little over a year now. Last night on TVO aired  Autism The Musical  and the BBC production of  The Autism Puzzle  (the latter which I found to be a good documentary\u2026it is the second time I\u2019ve watched it) and today on CNN (again) I am confronted with a deluge of autism media and I am sitting in my bed, alone, weeping, laughing at myself \u2014 weeping again. I might look to an outsider like Meg Ryan in some Hollywood romantic comedy. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t appreciate  Autism The Musical . It\u2019s just that I have to think critically of how a general public might view some of the very real comments \u2014 so real they made me weep. Take a look at this story before continuing to read: Lisa Jo Rudy of About.com on all things autism (an autism mom herself) also recollects about Adam\u2019s dad (from the movie \u2014 not my Adam): \u201cAdam\u2019s dad, now estranged from his mom, is bitter because of his wife\u2019s obsession with Adam\u2019s autism. Mom, meanwhile, spins out of control when she thinks her son\u2019s cello solo will be cut from the final musical production.\u201d Adam\u2019s dad (in the film) suggests that he believes all autism moms suffer divorce because they are scrounging every ounce of information for the benefit of the child. Adam\u2019s mom and dad are still together during the filming and the mom discusses how dad has had a long-standing affair, and she is clearly overstressed and bitter and I understand all of that.  As I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m looking through different eyes now. Yes, Adam didn\u2019t sleep and I was so grossly sleep deprived. Yes, I was obsessed with finding out every ounce of information in a world that doesn\u2019t accept autism. As a mother who loves their child (or a father \u2014 think Robert Hughes, Ralph Savarese among hundreds of other incredibly dedicated dads), this was the obvious choice.  As an educated person, I read and study\u2026and go back to university to get a degree in Critical Disability Studies. It is  my way  of dealing with things.  I have a need to help Adam in this world that still does not offer enough programs, services, care, respect and inclusion. And I\u2019m choosing to accept the choice with open arms. I\u2019m choosing to move forward and continue learning from all the lessons on this autism journey.  Truth about divorce lies somewhere between anecdote and statistics. While I have compassion and I feel that this is so real for so many families, I have to question if we are all being manipulated. I am thinking of Jenny McCarthy and her story of feeling alone in her marriage with her autistic child. I think many parents feel alone when they are researching and searching for scarce programs \u2014 indeed there is a feeling of isolation that sometimes even extended family members will never understand. I remember the  Autism Everyday Video  and how the number \u201ceighty percent of all autism marriages end in divorce\u201d was thrown out as a matter of fact, rather than what it is \u2014 speculation. I spoke out about the \u201cwanting to drive off the George Washington bridge\u201d with the autistic child comment because it was used in a campaign to raise money for autism by making autism look terrible, not because I don\u2019t believe or do not have compassion for the moments when some parent may be in a moment of despair. It\u2019s all real, you see. The divorce is real too. Some partners do not want to deal with the responsibilities of raising children \u2014 particularly disabled children. Some partners do not leave just because of autism.  The problem with using these stories in autism promotion videos is that it is used to sway our feelings about autistic people in particular. It uses autistic people as a crutch for the gamut of natural human emotion. People with non-disabled children also get divorced. People with non-disabled children also do unspeakable acts to their children. It is simply not fair to blame autism or disability as the cause for despair and divorce. There may be some truth to divorce and disability, but statistics don\u2019t necessarily agree. Apparently divorce rates, according to Kristina Chew\u2019s article, are  down  and I\u2019m particularly concerned when disability is used as the sole reason for a divorce. Kristina also writes:   \u201cCiting autism as the reason for a marriage failing can be seen as yet another reason for saying why autism is so awful. Taking care of Charlie is a privilege but it is not always easy. Childcare arrangements are a constant juggling act for Jim and me and we tend always to think of Charlie\u2019s needs first, and of each other\u2019s after that. We both agree that it should be this way. Jim and I would much prefer living closer to New York City due to our jobs but Charlie\u2019s education comes first. We left the house that we planned to live in for 30 years in order that Charlie could have the right school placement. (And until this September we were living with my in-laws, which was very, if not too, interesting at times.) Jim and I have made many of our choices based on \u2018what Charlie needs\u2019 rather than on what would be best for the two of us and I do hope that, ultimately this will be best for the three of us.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter what stressors are involved in marriage \u2014 the more there are, the more vulnerable a marriage becomes. Some couples manage to work together, some do not.  Sometimes, when the marriage is done and some of the stressors are gone, parents become better at working together. Sometimes challenges bring couples closer together. There is no magic formula and there are no right or wrong answers. Is raising a child with a disability more challenging? Absolutely. Should it be blamed for divorce? No. What we need along with the compassion is to look at our sorry weeping selves in the mirror to ask analytical questions. Who is producing the video? Is it a real story or is a fundraising video? What is it asking us to believe? Does it pull on our heart-strings to sell copies? Telling truth means that the conclusions are not necessarily clear \u2014 at least not for public consumption.  I for one, will not blame autism or Adam for my marital situation, even when day-to-day life is not always easy.  In her article  Genie In A Bottle , Shelley Hendrix in  HuffPo  discusses divorce, emotion and her autistic son:  \u201cFor a very simple reason over the last six years, I have clung to the hope that my son Liam was insulated from the emotional distress that can envelope a child when their parents divorce. He has autism. For once, I had hoped that his exceptionality was a perk, protecting his innocence and preserving his heart. I was wrong. Very, very wrong. With his nonverbal days behind him and his growing conversational skills he can express himself, just like any other child that experiences divorce. His message this summer? He desperately misses the unified family that he once had. His questions and comments mirror the conversations I have had with his younger sister throughout the years. Is it his fault? Why can\u2019t we get back together? Why did you get a divorce? Did you love daddy? Did he love you?.\u201d I worry like any other parent during a time of divorce.  I too want to protect Adam, as all children of divorce seem to do, from blaming himself. I am particularly aware of how he manifests anxiety and worry that it\u2019s because of divorce \u2014 and as autistic children are not unaffected, I must assume that there are days when his head wonders what the heck has happened. One day, like Liam, he may be able to tell me so, and I don\u2019t think anyone should underestimate the effects of divorce on the autistic child just because that child seems happy all the time, or cannot talk, or does not  appear  to be aware of what\u2019s going on.  Two adults are responsible for making it (or not) and society is also responsible for supporting marriage and families \u2014 particularly families who  have more on their plates because of the lack of community supports. (And  uh hum  \u2014 who is going to want to provide supports when people \u2014 as the woman interviewed \u2013 discuss autism as worse than getting a root canal?!) Two divorced adults are also responsible for making transitions in life for the autistic child as smooth as possible, while respecting the child\u2019s need to express their concerns which are manifested by anxiety (and we know as autism parents that anxiety doesn\u2019t always look anxious, but also hyper).  Adults are responsible for taking the responsibility. There is no easy answer for our lives in marriage or divorce; no predictions.  The work I must do for Adam still sits in front of me. The assistance he may require in his adult years is likely. I look at it this way: when a marriage ends there are new opportunities \u2014 to build strength and hopefully cooperation. Right now, as I myself am going through this new transition I have yet another opportunity to look at pity in the eye and step forward proudly with my autistic child. Of course I would not be human if I did not wonder if more support, programs and information  would have lessened the time I spent assisting Adam, coordinating his teams, his school requirements, his IEP, his communication devices and needs, playgroups\u2026 Would I have done things differently if there was more support out there? If I had had more sleep? This is a question I cannot yet answer. All I can say for now is that it was a choice grown from love and devotion. Choices have consequences and rewards. I don\u2019t blame autism. I don\u2019t blame a person. It\u2019s what was meant to happen. The work we do today, I believe, may help others tomorrow. Adam, for one, will know that he is valued and that I valued the time I was married to his father. I value the lessons we continue to learn and the many joys and struggles on our journey.  I started the Joy of Autism blog in 2005 with the support of my then-husband who told me to \u201cstart a blog\u201d not unlike Julia\u2019s husband in  Julia and Julia .  He apparently believed that, like Julia, I \u201chave thoughts.\u201d :) He supported the work I did for  The Autism Acceptance Project.   But life, as they say, is \u201ccomplicated.\u201d Here we are.  Who would believe that I think that even all of  this  is a gift? I do. Now, on with the future.

{"date": "2010/01/06", "body": "Curiousity is a wonderful human trait. Adam is autistic and while he needs some regularity and structure and familiar environments, he also needs to explore new ones. He is curious. He likes to explore \u2014 in his own time \u2014 new foods, new things, new places. I pride myself on having traveled with Adam even when it wasn\u2019t easy to travel with him. I do it with him as a single parent now, and his dad and I did it together when we were married. While I was tentative in Adam\u2019s early years of flying him as far as Africa, I do not rule it out as he grows older. Just because Adam is autistic does not mean that he should not see the world. It\u2019s how we orchestrate the process and itinerary that\u2019s important. As a parent, I know I also have to be prepared for anything. Too many expectations can foil the best of plans. We\u2019ve had great flights and not-so-great-flights. I can never predict or prepare enough. I have learned from Adam to give ourselves plenty of time, to pack his bag with his favorite toys, foods, and DVD\u2019s.  I generally know that early morning flights seem to be easier than mid-to-late afternoon flights, although like everything, there are exceptions to that rule.  Adam can be happy and calm as I \u201cwork\u201d the flight with him. As a parent of an autistic child, I have learned to stay on top of Adam\u2019s needs before any anxiety is triggered, for once triggered, it can be difficult to calm down. So as a parent, I don\u2019t get to read the paper or a good book when I\u2019m on a flight with Adam, but I still believe the effort is worth it. Travel, like autism and life, is a journey we cannot perfect. We cannot always predict how bumpy the flight may be. We can\u2019t predict delays that are a normal part of travel. We can\u2019t predict the mood our child might be in as much as we cannot predict our own. We can, however, try to prepare ourselves and do our best to keep calm in challenging circumstances. I\u2019m talking about travel because not only do I thrive on it myself, but as a single mom I look forward to exploring the world with my autistic son. We\u2019ve been to Alaska, we\u2019ve been to the U.S. and the Caribbean.  I am looking forward to taking Adam to Italy where I have a feeling he will love it for the sights, the gentle sounds of a murmuring town square, the Gelato, tomatoes and salami \u2014 not to to mention the flocks of pigeons he can chase and the magnificent art. It\u2019s my dream to take Adam abroad. But it\u2019s not my dream to endure a difficult flight. It\u2019s my problem, I know. I don\u2019t like to see Adam suffer.  I think I have to just get things organized (like rent one place and make it our \u201chome base\u201d for several weeks).   I am admittedly tentative about the overnight flight to Europe. Everyone tells me that this should be the easiest because children \u201ccan sleep on an overnight flight.\u201d They don\u2019t know my Adam.  I remember that twelve-hour day from Alaska back to Toronto where Adam was beside himself. We learned that Gravol didn\u2019t put him to sleep as it sometimes does for other children. I\u2019ve learned that Chlorohydrate doesn\u2019t settle Adam  before an EEG. I\u2019ve learned that Melatonin won\u2019t relax him on a flight, either. Adam, my Adam, is my prize-fighter. If Adam is anxious and does not want to sleep, giving him sedatives may have the opposite effect. He may metabolize medication differently. Or, he just too anxious, period. I will eventually book that trip to Italy at some point, deal with my fears and see what happens. I think I\u2019m a well-prepared mom and it\u2019s the times when I\u2019m most prepared that I find easiest for both Adam and I.  I\u2019ve found some good suggestions on traveling with the autistic child (see below) that others may find useful and I\u2019ve employed about all of these strategies. But I\u2019ve not yet traveled afar with the little one and I notice that no one else has written  a thing  on the Transatlantic flight and the autistic child. I assume (hope, really) that some autistic adults may have some suggestions on helping a prize sleep-fighter enjoy his mid-air travels. Like so much information we seek as parents of autistic children, there simply isn\u2019t enough to support us on our travels in life and abroad.

{"date": "2010/01/08", "body": "Tonight on  The Fifth Estate we can watch the documentary Out of Control  which addresses how youth and the mentally ill are treated for their behaviours by the use of restraint. Ashely Smith, once detained, committed suicide. Yesterday,  Boy Interrupted  was aired about Evan Perry who had bi-polar disorder and committed suicide by the age of fifteen. \u201cBi-polar disorder,\u201d says the family doctor in the piece, \u201cis like cancer. It can kill. Some people survive.\u201d Produced and directed by Evan\u2019s mother Dana Heinz Perry, we see the family\u2019s genetic history of the disorder while also understanding the mother\u2019s profound love of her child.

Yes that takes patience and disciplined work.  While I know \u201cmaking the world a more accepting place\u201d is becoming an over-used phrase, thus coming to mean nothing, our work to understand mental illness and disability and de-stigmatize  both  is valuable and worth it. We don\u2019t seem to value people who have disabilities, depression, or any other physical illness very well. We spend more money and time putting people away rather than investing in them. Charity without thought and engagement is particularly concerning as it is a way of avoiding real issues. In the Buddhist sense, I read something that the 17th Karmapa (thus ordained by the Dalai Lama), who stated about generosity: \u201c True generosity requires some wisdom \u2014 a clear understanding of ourselves who are giving, what we are giving, and to whom we are giving. If we use our intelligence, then generosity benefits both ourselves and others. We should not give just for the sake of giving or from an old habit. Further, in the process of giving, we should not become distracted, for losing our focus diminishes the scope and effect of our activity.\u201d  ( Shambala Sun , January 2010, p. 52) Many other Western philosophers felt the same about charity, particularly Nietszche who believed that charity was given by the rich to make them feel superior. It is also a way to avoid engaging with real problems and people and thus pretending the problem isn\u2019t ours, but we are good people to at least do something about it. While charity can be helpful, it can also be a declaration: g o away \u2014 I don\u2019t want to deal with it,  or,  thank God it\u2019s not me . When we watch  The Fifth Estate  tonight and think about people like Ashley Smith of Evan Perry, I hope we can all try to think differently about all different kinds of people\u2026 and how we \u201ctreat\u201d them.

{"date": "2010/01/20", "body": "Some of you know that I have curated a few exhibitions. In  2005 and 2006  I curated two exhibitions in Toronto regarding autism in attempt to question stereotypes. On Valentines Day, I will be moving into my new home with Adam. It\u2019s a cheesy holiday, I know. Yet, if I have to move out of the home my husband and I built together, let the love pour into my new one\u2026.very symbolic. My new home is about belonging. The art I put in my home, as I see it,  is an act of love. On a prominent wall in the entrance, leading up the stairs, I\u2019ve placed some significant photographs (significant for me), which were in fact turned down by an organization that I proposed to do an exhibition with because \u201cthey may upset people.\u201d I was told that, because most of the photographs were of nude, that this was the issue \u2014 not that they were both nude and disabled people. I would argue, however, that they would not likely turn down the Venus de Milo. She\u2019s nude and she has no arms. I am building my own \u201coutsider\u201d art collection. You will find me always putting the term \u201coutsider\u201d in quotation marks because while it is a recognized term in the art community as a genre unto itself, the implication is that it is a genre on the margins of the art world because most of the art that was produced under this category is \u201cself-taught.\u201d Yet, it is a genre large enough to have created a category, but not quite significant enough, one could argue, to belong to larger art community that participates at Art Basel, Venice Biennale, Dokumenta, and at major private galleries an public institutions. I personally feel the attitude is changing. The term \u201coutsider\u201d has remained precisely as a symbol of how we might have formerly regarded the artists who produced the work as individuals who were relegated to the margins of society. I like to think that we have more respect for individuals today who were treated as \u201cmarginal\u201d people. Disability, beauty and sexuality and the idea of acceptance and belonging are big issues when considering the essence of identity. On my wall, I have place a photograph of \u201cScarlett\u201d in an rampaged room (I collected this photo from Europe), along with a series of Diane Arbus-type photographs by other well-known photographers. I compare them to the visionary Diane Arbus because she also studied families and circus people up close and challenged society to revisit ideas of what it means to be human in a time when such individuals she studied were sent to the circus for us to view as freaks. Diane used her camera to move in close, make us uncomfortable and like the freak show, she knew we wouldn\u2019t be able to take our eyes away.  When I put them up I thought of the upcoming house-warming and \u201crenewal\u201d parties (I like to call it that for now as I am in a period of renewal)  and the way people are going to react to the photos confronting them in my front hallway, knowing how one institution already responded.   Will this upset people; will they think these photographs are weird?  I considered.  Will it make them uncomfortable?  For certain, I anticipate many conversations in my home about what it means to be disabled, what is beauty, what is identity and what makes a sexual being. On the one hand, I wonder about art in the home as typically people put up neutral things \u2014  should I have put up an abstract or a bunch of flowers?  Yet in my home, I have an autistic son. I live with difference and the beauty of his difference every single day. Not only do I want my son to see people with disabilities as humans \u2014 but beautiful humans and I want him to see himself as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d  if beauty be equated with value. I am often struck by how \u201cbeautiful\u201d people in wheelchairs are still regarded  more  than average-looking people in wheelchairs. We often consider it \u201ca shame\u201d that \u201csuch a good-looking person\u201d be confined to the wheelchair, as if the value of the person is now cut in half. The people in these photographs are a mixture of beautiful and average-looking people with a leg missing, non-functioning legs and average-looking people with \u201cmis\u201d-shaped faces and bodies. I think to question beauty is important \u2014  from manufactured beauty to the beauty inside a person. Christine \u2014 the woman with one leg \u2014 is also reflected from a mirror on my fireplace mantel on an opposite wall. Everyday as I chastise myself for not being thin enough or young enough, I hope to be reminded that I am more than what I appear to be. I\u2019ve advocated for Adam all of these years and all of these people, including Adam, have reminded me to be less judgmental of myself  as a woman living in graceless times \u2014 where we carve ourselves under knives and lasers to become something \u201cmore beautiful.\u201d I am not attempting to chastise the entire industry of prosthetics or plastic surgery because the industry has also helped a lot of people cope with events like breast cancer, burns and so on.  But I hope that in raising the question we can all see how complicated the body has become. As a woman, I\u2019ll admit this is a great area of conflict for me and my emotions can\u2019t keep up with my head.  So, I had to question who else might put these works front and centre in their home (which is why I\u2019m writing this post).  It\u2019s fine to look at such images at exhibitions and in book, but the home, where we manifest our identities may be something different.  I\u2019m trying not to self-adulate, because  I  found myself questioning. I know that some people will not understand and may initially  feel uncomfortable (the precise opposite of what we try to accomplish in our homes as we want to welcome people to them). Across from the photos, by the way, sit two paintings that I purchased from  Larry Bissonnette  \u2014 a well-known autistic artist, and my two  Jonathan Lerman  pieces (also an autistic artist) are on the stairwell going down to the basement. I have a series of thoughts and hopes, perhaps, as I put the work up. First, it will prompt discussion \u2014 some of it may be difficult, I understand. Second, I want to question stereotypes of not just disability but what is beautiful as we (especially me) spend many dollars and energy seeking to look more perfect and defy our age. And last, I actually want people in my home to let their hair down. I want the judge in everyone to disappear.  In my view, it\u2019s the best welcome mat money can buy.

{"date": "2010/01/31", "body": "Review of  Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage , Elizabeth Gilbert \nReviewed by: Est\u00e9e Klar I\u2019m a separated single mother. Last night, having dinner  \u00e0 la   Sex in the City  with my three long-time girlfriends, I realized that I am the only truly single lady at the table. My girlfriends may have had the recipe for relationship success right all along \u2014 they  never, ever  got married. They may be single, but they are all in long-term committed relationships. This is not to say that I\u2019m against marriage now just because I am separated, but since I feel I have not yet been successful, and in fact \u2014 let me borrow Gilbert\u2019s own words \u2014\u00a0 \u201cgutted\u201d by the entire process, her new book may have come to me in the nick of time. Perhaps not just for me. Judging by the hot topics of discussion out there \u2014 like  \u201cAll Kinds of Families\u201d  upcoming on television with Rosie O\u2019Donnell,and the hit HBO series,  Big Love , and  Desperate  Housewives , well, Gilbert definitely knows what is on our minds. So long  Ozzie and Harriett, Little House on the Prairie  and  Leave it to Beaver ; these times\u2026they  have  changed! Gilbert acknowledges that she is no scholar of Western marriage, but her research makes us rethink our beliefs. Woven in between her own personal journey \u2014 falling in love with Felipe at the end of her  Eat Pray Love  journey, living with him on his three-month visas into the U.S. and vowing never to marry each other \u2014\u00a0 we learn a little bit more about her and how and why we think such things about finding soul-mates and marriage partners. \u201cSentenced to marriage,\u201d because her partner Felipe will finally be deported out of the United States if they do not marry (no more three-month visas allowed), Gilbert decides to research almost out of terror. She has already been divorced. She has no children. She writes, she travels. She seems to covet her freedoms. But she has also fallen deeply in love with Felipe. So she embarks on her next quest which manifests in this newly released book. Expecting the world from our partners to \u201cmake us eternally happy,\u201d she cites an important, maybe crippling, contemporary theme \u2014 that the only quest worthy in life is to find happiness. \u201cIt\u2019s the emblem of our times,\u201d she says.  \u201cI have been allowed to expect great things in life. I have been permitted to expect far more out of the experience of love and living than most other women in history were ever permitted to ask. When it comes to questions of intimacy, I want many things from my man, and I want them all simultaneously\u2026.We Americans often say that marriage is \u2018hard work\u2026\u2019 but how does marriage become hard work? Here\u2019s how: Marriage becomes hard work once you have poured the entirety of your life\u2019s expectations for happiness into the hands of one mere person. Keeping that going is hard work.\u201d (p.48). \n Of course, Gilbert can\u2019t be excluding the same expectations of men who stake their happiness on a woman. Honestly, if I were to wager an un-researched guess, men have more difficulty in our culture being without a woman than women do without a man. If it\u2019s a popular topic of discussion of our times, it does not belong exclusively to women-kind. But she does note that her father seemed to have fewer expectations of his 1950\u2019s marriage than her mother: \u201c\u2026while it\u2019s true that my mother has given up more of her personal ambitions in marriage than my father ever did, she demands far more out of marriage than he ever will. He is far more accepting of her than she is of him.\u201d (p.197). So while Gilbert seems to identify in part the \u201cshackles\u201d that women find themselves in when they enter marriage, she also acknowledges that it can also be a repressive tool against men. \u201cIt\u2019s an ancient truism across countless different cultures that there is no better accountability-forging tool for an irresponsible young man than a good, solid wife.\u201d (p.198.) She cites Robert Frost who says, \u201cin traditional societies single young men have a global reputation for squandering their money on whores and drinking and games and laziness: They contribute nothing.\u201d (p. 198). But ask a thirty-something year-old single man, and I\u2019m not so sure he would or wouldn\u2019t agree. As woman have changed, I am hopeful that, since Robert Frost\u2019s time at least, men have too. Among the Hmong people she sets out to interview, where marriages are arranged, the women she attempts to probe about love don\u2019t seem to have any expectations of their men. It is set up more for civil function and child-bearing, and the woman remain with the women during their days, and the men \u2014 well they are off doing God knows what. When Gilbert asks the Hmong women about how they felt about the subject of marriage, she was greeted with laughter and confusion. Of the Hmong grandmother she said,  \u201cNeither the grandmother of any other women in that room was placing her marriage at the center of her emotional biography in any way that was remotely familiar to me. In the modern Western world, where I come from, the person whom you choose to marry is perhaps the single most vivid representation of your own personality. Your spouse becomes the most gleaming possible mirror through which your emotional individualism is reflected back to the world.\u201d (p.35).  In Canada, where the person we link arms with is an important choice that reflects who we \u201care,\u201d whether I like the idea or not, I would have to agree. Gilbert\u2019s chapters are separated to many aspects of marriage:  Marriage and Surprises; Marriage and Expectation; Marriage and History; Marriage and Infatuation; Marriage and Women; Marriage and Autonomy; Marriage and Subversion  and finally  Marriage and Ceremony  where she ultimately makes peace with her \u201clife sentence;\u201d albeit with a lot of soul searching and research! It seems to me that she finds her success in being \u201cseparate\u201d while also devoted to and a part of Felipe. It makes me realize how utterly lucky I am to have time to myself, to be alone at this point in my life before launching into something too fast and too soon. Maybe I can call it my  Eat Pray Love  kind of year \u2014 the eating and praying part for sure and the love I am gaining for myself as well as a recognition of an enduring love for my son. Maybe we all need  at least  one of those years in our lifetimes. It seems to be our fear of being alone and that stigma prompting the fear that may be the saboteur of a peaceful path to coexistence. That stigma of being single looms. Just a quick look at the amount of on and offline dating services that exist out there, and we can see it.  We are yearning for connection \u2014 looking for that lost half of ourselves. It\u2019s not unfamiliar that concept \u2014 our \u201cother half,\u201d our \u201csoul mate.\u201d But is there such a thing? With Hollywood romance pounding the message into our brains that there must be one soul mate out there for each of us, we\u2019ve certainly come to believe it, and all things Hollywood must be rigorously questioned.\u00a0 Yet instead we go out into the world and look for our mates as if it is our life quest. Gilbert says \u201cour choice-rich lives have the potential to breed their own brand of trouble.\u201d (p.45).  Apparently, as soon as we abandoned arranged marriages and began to choose for ourselves, divorce rates sky-rocketed. As I read her book thinking of our freedom to create different \u201ckinds of families\u201d\u00a0that we either inherit by default because of circumstances, or choose, I consider that the reader will be left with the question: so which is better; to be able to be free to choose, to remain single or to go back to arranged marriages? Gilbert would opt for freedom, but not of the escapist kind. When women began to have equal rights and opportunities, they no longer had to remain in bad marriages. Then came the myriad of choices, for better or for worse. While\u00a0 Western marriage is comforting in the sense that it eliminates all choice, it has, as I\u2019ve hoped to illustrate via Gilbert\u2019s book,  its own set of issues. Religion imposes a civil and \u201cmoral order\u201d (religion assumes we are sheep that need guiding \u2014 another power schematic) \u2014 a role that today our lawyers deal with when we get divorced: how property and children are divided. After all, the State doesn\u2019t care about our broken hearts. Gilbert discusses how women gave up everything to be in marriage in history \u2013 and let\u2019s face it, to a large extent still do in modern times. In Europe\u2019s history, cites Gilbert,  \u201cthe legal notion of  coverture  \u2014 that is, the belief that a woman\u2019s individual civil existence is erased the moment she marries\u2026a wife effectively becomes \u2018covered\u2019 by her husband and no longer has any legal rights of her own, nor can she hold any personal property\u2026 Coverture  was a French legal notion that spread to England as late as the nineteenth century. British judge Lord William Blackstone was still defending the essence of  coverture  in his courtroom, insisting that married women did not really exist as a legal entity. \u2018The very being of the woman,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018is suspended during marriage.'\u201d  (pp.65-66). Woman eradicated as humans?  This is not  something I enjoy reading about, but I believe it\u00a0 still exists in the deepest caverns of our collective minds. It plays out in marriages, in court rooms and infects the behaviour of many men and woman today \u2014 that our worth is hinged on marriage and men alone. Just going out with many women, and seeing more middle aged women going out on the town with each other, I\u2019m not altogether happy with what I see. Not only do women just want to go out \u2014 and now they can without the man which is of course, great and something we now take for granted \u2014 many of us womankind are still fiercely hunting. \u201cMILFS,\u201d (a sexist, unfortunate term meaning \u201cMothers I\u2019d Like to _ _ _ _\u201d) we in a certain age-group have now earned such derogatory terms \u2014 \u201cCougar\u201d being another one of them.  You can see it in the eyes \u2014 checking out the men who walk into the room, trying to look coy with that red-coloured martini in their hands ( wait..I like red-coloured martinis ), probably hoping with bated breath that some guy will approach her. While many women might say they have earned the right to employ on the goose what was done to the gander, I have to wonder if women are out really enjoying themselves, or if they are seriously hunting for a man for the sake of increasing her self-worth. I\u2019m not suggesting that woman are solely to blame here, as She has been the object of sexual oppression for generations. Yet why perpetuate the cycle? Without the pressure of man-hunting, the best possible relationship and the ones I really value are those of my girlfriends \u2014 married, unmarried, gay, and yes, even yearning. None of us are alone with the very same questions Gilbert raises  \u2014 \u201csometimes life is too hard to be alone, and sometimes life is too good to be alone.\u201d (p.81). Doesn\u2019t that just say it all?  Now single, I am even aware I may now be a threat, possibly, to some of my married friends. It even shocks me to encounter married women who think it is so wonderful to be single, so easy \u2014 as if I can party all night long. It\u2019s all very ironic because  none  of it is easy. I may represent what perhaps some married women fear they may become and representing that comes with a price that has saddened me to pay. A single gal can\u2019t always win with the married type. It seems married or not, we all want to believe the grass is either greener on the other side, or that it\u2019s as scary as hell. And  believe  me, it really  is  hard the first year of transition from married to single life! Don\u2019t let my going on and on about being single fool you for a moment. I cried for six months straight!! Nothing can spare us from the heartbreak following the break-up or a loss of a long-term partnership or marriage. What I starkly realized whilst becoming single (it\u2019s a process), is the stigma \u2014 that I am less  valuable  if I am not attached to a man (one of woman\u2019s greatest fears). I have also learned that this idea is farthest from the truth. As I grow and spend about as much time thinking about this topic as Gilbert has, being alone for a long stretch in one\u2019s life without jumping into other people\u2019s beds in order to escape loneliness is probably the most important thing we can do at least once in our lifetimes.  And we all will \u2014 our spouses will die, our partnerships will break up. We simply have to learn to live well with and happily with ourselves. As a single person and a person who may enter any future relationship, it is\u00a0most important to learn to value oneself first in order to be valued. One way to value oneself is to spend time alone\u2026and not fear it. Elizabeth Gilbert protects her freedom, it seems for similar reasons. Like me, she enjoys traveling on her own. Like most women today, we try to find that safe place where we can have a partnership while also maintaining our need to pursue our own dreams. Ironically, even with all our hard-earned freedoms, it still can seem like an extreme sport. Gilbert can get us really thinking with the amount of thought she and Felipe pour into their oncoming nuptials. For me the finest chapter was on  Marriage and Infatuation . \u201cHistory teaches us that just about anybody is capable of just about anything when it comes to the realm of love and desire.\u201d She puts new words to the harsher adage \u201call\u2019s fair in love and war.\u201d It seems to me Gilbert, despite all the research, came up with the answer mid-way through her book about what makes partnerships last or not, and as I read this I considered by parent\u2019s marriage of forty-six years. I witnessed them building their marriage like maintaining a beloved house. Walls had to be repainted, dying trees cut down and replanted, and some rooms eventually completely renovated. It  was  constant work and in between they lived out their frustrations and their joys. They are products of this historic belief system as much as my generation is, and future generations will be. Something in them and maybe even about them, I don\u2019t know \u2014 they just stuck it out. Who knows what those factors were as they traversed life\u2019s trials that bonded them together or nearly tore them apart. These are the intimacies I will never know. But, it does make me realize that to be in a partnership is to enter a contract that is tacitly renewed every single day. And yes, maybe that is supposed to be at times, \u201chard work.\u201d Expectations or no expectations, it just can\u2019t always be easy. Gilbert uses the work of Shirley P. Glass, a psychologist \u201cwho spent much of her career studying marital infidelity\u2026[whose] question was \u2018How did it happen?\u2019\u201d So as I read the following paragraphs, I thought of the \u201chouse\u201d with the strong foundation my parents built: \u201cThe answer, as Dr. Glass explained, is that nothing is wrong with a married person launching a friendship outside matrimony \u2013 so long as the \u2018walls and windows\u2019 of the relationship remain in the correct places. It was Glass\u2019s theory that every healthy marriage is composed of walls and windows. The windows are the aspects of your relationship that are open to the world \u2013 that is, the necessary gaps through which you interact with family and friends; the walls are the barrier of trust behind which you guard the most intimate secrets of your marriage. What often happens, though, during so-called harmless friendships, is that you begin sharing intimacies with your new friend that belong hidden within your marriage. You reveal secrets about yourself \u2013 your deepest yearnings and frustrations \u2013 and it feels good to be so exposed. You throw open a window where there really ought to be a solid, weight-bearing wall, and soon you find yourself spilling your secret heart with this new person. Not wanting your spouse to feel jealous, you keep the details of your new friendship hidden. In so doing, you have now created a problem: You have just built a wall between you and your spouse where there really ought to be free circulation of air and light. The entire architecture of your matrimonial intimacy has therefore been rearranged. Every old wall is now a giant picture window; every old window is now boarded up like a crack house. You have just established the perfect blueprint for infidelity without even noticing. So be the time your new friend comes into your office one day in tears over some piece of bad news, you wrap your arms around each other (only meaning to be comforting!) and then your lips brush and you realize in a dizzying rush that you  love  this person\u2014that you have always loved this person! \u2013 it\u2019s too late. Because now the fuse has been lit. And you really run the risk of someday (probably very soon) standing amid the wreckage of your life, facing a betrayed and shattered spouse (whom you still care about immensely, by the way), trying to explain through your ragged sobs how you never meant to hurt anybody, and how you never saw it coming. And it\u2019s true. You didn\u2019t see it coming. But you did build it, and you could have stopped it if you\u2019d acted faster. The moment you found yourself sharing secrets with a new friend that really ought to have belonged to your spouse, there was, according to Dr. Glass, a much smarter and more honest path to be taken. Her suggestion would be that you come home and tell your husband or your wife about it. The script goes along these lines: \u2018I have something worrying to share with you\u2026\u201d  pp.109-110. While this piece of information hit me like a brick from that shattered house on my head and comes in the middle of her book, the rest of her book is worth reading too. I thoroughly enjoyed (obviously) reading about wo/man\u2019s journey with marriage and where our beliefs may have derived. Most of us, even if we are good at being single, want friends and partners in life. We are, I believe, built to share. While \u201clove based unions make for fragile tethers\u2026maybe divorce is the tax we collectively pay as a culture for daring to believe in love.\u201d (p. 83). I have learned while we need to have choice and freedoms, with them come many responsibilities \u2014 for nourishing ourselves and others and treating each other with respect and kindness. And this also grows and changes, like the institution of marriage in our culture, with that tacit contract. Maybe the contract, like people, get better with age. Maybe we come to understand the fragility. Maybe some of us learn, in this age of free expression and openness, that there are some things in life that should be left between two people. Gilbert certainly reminds us of the nature and importance of privacy and the need for a couple to really discuss and think about things, instead of expecting them.  Gilbert, after soul-searching this serious marriage business, finally marries Felipe in the house she buys in New Jersey (which ironically happens to be a converted church) when Felipe\u2019s visa is finally approved.  As they utter their vows, a dog suddenly lies auspiciously between them (which just happens to symbolize fidelity). I envision all the people out there writing their long list of pros and cons about relationships. I might be one of them one day. Yet very much like Elizabeth, I still believe in love. I do, I do, I DO!

{"date": "2010/01/28", "body": "Adam is almost eight years old. I can hardly believe how the time keeps marching by; how the year of separation from Adam\u2019s father has also gone by. Soon, Adam and I will be living in our new house and rebuilding our lives.  Adam is changing and I reminisce from the early days \u2014 when he was diagnosed at 19 months of age, how I started this blog back in 2005. He is becoming more curious, more adept, stronger. He is always learning. He gets frustrated. He still cannot communicate with words very well. He must use a device. He does not understand, I believe, inherent dangers as he explores his new exciting world. Laundry chutes, small dark corners are inviting spaces for all little children. I teach as best I can with a firm \u201cno,\u201d a new rule that he can easily comprehend, and a stop sign posted to various areas of the house. It may not be \u201cdesigner\u201d but style makes no sense where safety is concerned.  Adam is also heading out into the world. Yes, he has his aides. But as a newly separated person who now must share time with Adam\u2019s father with regards to Adam, I find myself during lonely nights thinking about how life is always about letting go: of fear, of things, of little children growing into bigger independent children (or quasi independent in our case). As Adam grows, I must learn to let him out into the world with others so he can learn more. It is a great challenge for any parent, and perhaps even more punctuated when one is a single parent. And as all things with our children as we watch them grow, it\u2019s (delightfully) bittersweet. Adam would grow up resenting me if I held him back and did not let him explore. I have to let him do it in safe ways, in stages. When he grabs that sharp knife to cut a piece of fruit, I have to teach him with a dull knife (and with supervision of course). I have to let him explore dark spaces by creating safer dark spaces. I have to let him jump around the house, not on furniture where he may hurt his head, but on equipment set up for the task of jumping. In the case of Adam and his neurological needs, I also have to LET him be who he is and get the feedback he needs. He needs to run, he needs to jump, explore, and yes, eat lemons. I would never be able to hold him back to change these activities because they don\u2019t look like typical play. I need to provide him safe avenues to explore these things. Instead of viewing these things as \u201coverwhelming\u201d because they are not what all typical children necessarily do, I must learn new ways of helping him explore. While there are not as many programs and \u201chow-to\u201d books out there, common sense, time, and a deep breath help me figure it out. It\u2019s the same at school and we are lucky right now to have a school that allows Adam to explore safely, that allows aides, that allows us to bring in adaptive technologies and programs that help Adam learn in the way he can. But when people first meet him, I am starkly aware of how they will measure him \u2014 what \u201ccompetency tests\u201d to assess what he does and does not know that are delivered in a way that we take for granted, and perhaps that Adam would not be able to respond to. Far less effort (and money) is paid to adapting those tests so that he could respond \u2014 like visual options for answers, multiple choice. Adam is extremely visual and \u201cperforms\u201d well when given this option. And I write this because I saw the movie  NELL  last night with Jodie Foster. I have been calling Adam  \u2014 among many nicknames like boo boo bear, moo moo, Adiboo, Adamame\u2026  and Chickabee \u2014 the nickname Nell uses in the film. I must have picked it up a few years ago when I first saw it. I love the movie  Nell  because it reminds us that humans can create languages that perhaps not everyone understand easily and in the way we are used to, but how we create meaning.  And Adam communicates, indeed. He has a language that I\u2019ve learned to, believe it or not, take for granted! But as he goes out into the world not everyone will know his language. He would be given those \u201ccompetency tests,\u201d and maybe even fail because they don\u2019t measure in a way that addresses how he can express what he knows. So yes, my Adam now goes out further into the world. And yes, we have to teach him to communicate within it and learn the more common way of communicating. But I still believe he will and should always keep his mother tongue. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2010/01/28/2786/", "title": "He must go out into the world\u2026."},

He is discerning in who he expresses affection to; \n2) He only really wants mom and dad and gives us extra special hugs and tends to shun others away as he wants us all to himself; \n3) He knows who his family is because he has variants of affection for different people; \n4) He cries when he knows he has broken or made a mess of something; \n5) He cries when he thinks he\u2019s upset someone, or that he knows someone is upset; \n6) He dances when he\u2019s happy (not the happy dance, but real dancing); \n7) He sings what he can\u2019t say \u2014 when mom and dad were together with him the other day, he sang Beyonce\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a Single Lady\u201d  \u2014 a song that came out at the time of the separation. Here I will add a little bit of my memory of other children I knew when they were little who dreamed of their parents back together again. I imagine this is Adam\u2019s way of telling us the same and that he recognizes the current situation; \n8) He laughs at funny things \u2014 he laughs at my jokes and he laughs when he\u2019s trying to make me laugh; \n9) He talks more and more each day; \n10) He types more and more (independently) each day; \n11) He reads out loud and understands what he is reading; \n12) He knows how to manipulate certain people who all respond to different things. He knows how to \u201cwork it\u201d; \n13) He uses a word to describe what he is looking at (i.e.; he may type sock and then I can help him build a sentence to correlate with the work  GAP  he is peering at on his sock so he can  type, see and say ).  I could go on but it\u2019s late and I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m just basically trying to say how Adam is such a Mensch to me in every way. He works really hard, he wants to do things, he loves people, and his will is strong. I see and experience how hard it is sometimes for him to stay focused and I\u2019m still very proud of him.  When his fabulous assistant (she has been with us for five years now and counting), told me that he went wild for  Carmina Burana   at school, I smiled. I went wild for Carmina Burana when I was young and consider it to be my foray into classical music because it\u2019s so dramatic. Adam danced and moved his body to the music.  When I see his notebook wherein Adam is struggling to draw, he is specific about what he is drawing (his assistant writes what he has named his characters that he struggles motorically to draw). And all I can do is keep trying hard with him, to learn, to keep an open mind, to provide him various modalities with which he can work and express himself.

I remember exactly where I was watching a younger CNN minute-by-minute, glued, because the year before I had just been there. I visited East Berlin where the group I was with were searched, when we were escorted to the places we were only meant to see. Bullet holes still embedded in old buildings were not just the remnants of the the war, but of a regime too tired to rebuild its environment or nurture its people. For me, Berlin is also the place of Bertolt Brecht, who I studied in university: Brecht\u2019s Marxist political convictions led him to propose an alternative direction for the theatre that would fuse the two functions of instruction and entertainment. In this way the theatre could project a picture of the world by artistic means and offer models of life that could help the spectators to understand their social environment and to master it both rationally and emotionally. The main concept of Brecht\u2019s program was that of Verfremdungseffekt (\u201calienation\u201d). In order to induce a critical frame of mind in the spectator, Brecht considered it necessary to dispense with the empathetic involvement with the stage that the illusionary theatre sought to induce. Generally, this has been understood as a deadening coldness in the productions, but such an interpretation proceeds from a general ignorance of Brecht\u2019s own writings on the subject. Rather, he insisted, as Appia, Craig, and the Symbolists did before him, that the audience must be reminded that it is watching a play.   (Stanford University website). And it was rather like that, my visit to East Berlin \u2014 a carefully staged tour, a kind of theatre of pretense. Yet what remained hidden remained so visible in its absence. I\u2019ve not yet been back since the wall has come a-tumbling down, but I\u2019m in awe of the art installation of dominoes to commemorate this important point in our history.

{"date": "2009/11/18", "body": " We all love to read to our children. I have my own favorites and Adam has his. He will sit calmly in my arms reading  The Giving Tree  by Shel\u00a0 Silverstein.\u00a0 His favorite are  The Mr. Small and Mr. Giggles books . Adam can begin to tell me his favorite parts and why they are his favorite parts \u2014 something that he could not articulate when he was two or three-years-old.\u00a0 He loves reading cookbooks, all kinds of books now, when in his toddler years he would seem to only be drawn to books with letters and numbers. While he still occasionally looks at those, they are not all he looks at anymore. Did I teach him to like other books? Not particularly. There was no forcing I could do to get him interested, no \u201cprogram\u201d with a reward system of getting him to like reading other books. Instead all I think I did was use the books he was already reading, describing pictures within them, talking about other words that began with the letter of the day. Come to think of it, I should have been hired by Sesame Street for coming up with everything that goes with the letter A. As Adam grows older, I\u2019m interested in books that have meaning for us without hard-boiled moral endings. Books about the dentist are good. Books about doctors \u2014 good too. The books I come about autism and friendships are okay but the majority are made with the intention of raising money to cure the child which minimizes the purpose of not only the message, but the complexity of it. Remembering the  Wild Boy of Averyon ,\u00a0I decided to purchase the children\u2019s version by Mordicai Gerstein.\u00a0 When found in the wild living among the animals, the \u201cWild Boy\u201d was brought to Paris.\u00a0 He was found living successfully in the wild. Yet trying to \u201ccivilize\u201d him in Paris was a challenge. The boy, never having been socialized with humans, could not talk. His sensory system was different (he could survive in the cold winters without clothes). He was observed and stared at as a strange creature, and written about in the media to the fascination of all who read about him. Because he didn\u2019t listen they determined him to be deaf and mute. Of course, the boy tried to run away back to his woods, but he was captured so that scientists and scholars could study him. He ignored the sound of guns shooting next to his ears, but not the sound of a cracked walnut in the next room.  \u201cHe loved walnuts.\u201d  He would not eat the food civilized society gave him, but only nuts, potatoes baked in the coals. He didn\u2019t seem to feel pain as they pinched him. They could not get his attention with toys and after weeks of examination. \u201c\u2018The boy\u2019s behavior,\u2019 they said, \u2018places him below all animals, wild or domestic. He is hopeless.\u2019 Then they lost interest in him.\u201d  Until John-Marc Itar, a young doctor cared for him and decided to teach the boy he named Victor.\u00a0 He began to learn the things Dr. Itar taught him, but he could never learn to talk.\u00a0 Then, \u201cOne sweet spring morning, Victor woke and, without thinking, ran off to find the woods. He became lost in the suburbs of Paris and spent the night hiding in a park till the police found him.\u201d  They  brought him \u201chome.\u201d His hair was combed, he could set the table, he was proud of himself when he could solve difficult problems.  \u201cHe wasn\u2019t wild anymore.\u201d  \u201cBut he did remain silent, and could never tell of his wild life. And something of the wild was always in him\u2026.The sound of a rising wind, or the sight of whirling snowflakes or the sun bursting from behind a cloud made him tremble with excitement and wild joy.\u201d  Victor would gaze every night at the moon and the doctor would wonder what he saw there. \u2014\u2013 Mordicai Gerstein,  The Wild Boy , Sunburst Edition, 2002.

It\u2019s a problem, actually, of writing about oneself; a problem that many writers experience when writing about life.  The mother always has to think twice. More like a thousand times a day. A mother has to wear a shield around her so she does not upset the children she loves so much. A mother has to be solid, grounded \u2014 a monolith MOTHER as described on the tombstones in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto where many of us Torontonians walk and run through every day like Central Park. I know, it\u2019s a more melancholy park, you\u2019re thinking. But it\u2019s truly spectacular for it\u2019s scale and landscape in the centre of our city. I walk by stone angels here almost every day. \u201cBeloved wife of,\u201d \u201cMother of.\u201d That seems to be our legacy \u2014 and while it is an important one, it is peripheral and lonely. I am reminded of Margaret Laurence and her Hagar. MOTHER \u2013 it describes everything and nothing out here in the cool fall air.  If I were not a mother, I\u2019d be pining to be one, envious of the epithet. If you don\u2019t know me, now you do in part. I wanted a child so badly and had I not had one, I\u2019d be crying now. I walk among the stones reading them, picking up brown oak leaves that smell fragrant as they decompose, wondering what my stone will read.  I gather the oak leaves in my hand because that\u2019s what I do when I go out on my walks.  I collected my first three four-leaf clovers this year after looking for the previous forty-two of them. I would look for hours as a child. I\u2019d search within the thick bush of clover knowing that one day I\u2019d find my luck, but all I found were the common three-leaved variety. The rich green mass became too overwhelming to continue the search, and mother called me in for dinner. I found three this year when I wasn\u2019t looking, and in the nick of time. Going through a separation while recovering from cancer surgery was the worst event of my life, so someone wanted to tell me something, I figure. Now, I pick up four oak leaves because the oak tree symbolizes strength and courage and you must know me \u2014 I\u2019ve got a lot of that.  We are born into this life, a blank slate of possibilities and stories to be written. The stone that remains is a summary. The men in this cemetery typically get some interesting descriptions \u2013 heroes and veterans particularly so. I look for the mothers and wives, thinking that, like the sullen ambrosia of the leaves and earth, our time here is short but never lost; the earth and leaves beneath my feet are the smell of life that goes on forever. Dust to dust indeed \u2014 our fragrance is sweet. Among phallic monuments erected to the family name or patriarch of the family, I\u2019m particularly drawn to a modest stone laid just before it on the slant of a gentle hill.  Sitting low to the ground, an older worn stone with the block letters spelling MOTHER. She is modest there in front of the huge piece of marble pricking the empty sky. Underneath the \u201cmonolith,\u201d the woman\u2019s world is rich and wrought with things some children will never know. Why is it that men do not hide their desires as well? Why do they live out loud?  Why do they get to?   It\u2019s a problem, really, as a writer. I could dress her up in fictitious clothes \u2013 a universal mother, woman with desires and unmet dreams, who has been hurt, who has stories that can never be told, or if they are, told carefully.  I write around and around her like a rubber tube spinning so much harder and faster than the centre of the rim. The core that stands so open, awaiting the spear of the archer\u2019s arrow, or my pen. Yet it compels, so to want to get to know her.  I wish I could grab a cup of tea and look through her photo albums, have a woman-to-woman chat. I bet she shared her life with many of her friends. I bet she has a great story that should have been told.

I learned that no matter the true temperature, grief made the air crisp and cold; that it caused me to drive slowly, carefully; there was very little I could eat. I learned that I didn\u2019t notice things until they flew out at me and that most stories and books and news articles were unreadable, being accounts not of the events themselves, but of me. Of what I had lost and would never have again, of what I had once allowed myself to want, the things I used to love. Of small consolations no longer available. I learned that my heart could stop and start a dozen times a day and that my throat felt so sore and tight I often had to swallow air simply in order to breathe. The world receded; everything took place in slow motion and was viewed as if down the wrong end of a very long telescope. So much was unfamiliar that if I was asked my name, I had to think for long moments. \u2018Grief is a visceral process of disengagement,\u2019 a friend said. In my grief, old versions of disembodiment became a cruel joke. You thought that was bad, not being able to walk into a roomful of strangers without disassociating or turning remote and distant?

In the Art World, the term was used to create a category of art because it did not seek a point of reference from within the \u201chigher\u201d art world.  This post for me is thrilling.   Today\u2019s Parent  magazine in an article called  \u201cIs It A Learning Disability?\u201d  ,  suggested that children with learning disabilities (LD\u2019s) ..\u201d don\u2019t draw,\u201d the caption said, \u201cthey scribble.\u201d   They  is used as yet another \u201coutsider\u201d term, using the \u201cthey\u201d as a foreign connotation. I retorted at how important any human marking is, a scribble or a sun. Adam\u2019s motor planning issues makes holding a pen or pencil very difficult. He could draw letters lightly when he was very young and his first \u201cpicture\u201d was a happy face with long hair when he was six years old. When I asked him who it was he said \u201cmommy.\u201d Of course that stays in my treasure chest forever. I like to draw and I\u2019m quite average at it. This past summer, I spent a few hours with Adam drawing what was around us at the cottage we rented, and I tried to teach him how to paint by numbers with a watercolour set \u2014 to \u201cstay within the lines.\u201d So counterintuitive is the paint-by-numbers set to me, but I noticed Adam\u2019s willingness and effort to gently use a small watercolour brush, and his keen interest in painting. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that one of his grandmother\u2019s is a painter, his grandfather is a photographer, and his half-brother, a master at etch-a-sketch, not to mention his other artistic pursuits. Adam is interested in all of their work and I\u2019m certain they have all imparted their own abilities to him. I was not expecting these drawings passed to me from school the other day because I guess we can never know if or when we can expect things to happen, and it wouldn\u2019t be anything I\u2019d force upon him.  Adam draws, as of this week, by his own motivation. He suddenly copied pictures from books and I\u2019m utterly breathless at his line and his attention to detail. He told his aide what the pictures depicted and you can see her handwriting \u2014 a verbatim record of what he said.  From a developmental perspective, I suppose you could say he is seeing the \u201cwhole picture.\u201d His attention to detail, bearing in mind his motor challenges, seem remarkable particularly when one\u2019s child has not been able to express themselves easily. Art can tell us a lot about what a person sees, how they see it, and how they can express it with certain challenges. As I was always certain that Adam could \u201csee the whole picture,\u201d I post here, I suppose, what society needs and what it likes to chew on, which is the sad part of being a part of such an achievement-oriented society.  But let\u2019s for a few wonderful moments just savour how beautiful his lines are \u2014 how delicate and careful.

I think when people go through separation and divorce, it is typical to heal for a year or two, and indeed I\u2019ve felt sort of paralyzed.  I remember thanking everyone around me  profusely  for their incredible support for the first eight months. I learned the importance of reaching out, and I sit now watching, less nervous and anxious than a few years ago when we would go through the same assessments. When I look back on the past year,  I can\u2019t help marveling at Adam during his assessment today and think about every evening when he comes home from school when he reads to me about what he\u2019s accomplished at school. He has learned to read out loud. He has learned to become an independent typist, and now he is drawing like never before. Yes, we have our challenges too \u2014 he is more rebellious these days, knowing what he wants, not unlike many other seven-year-olds. Sometimes I wonder if children also rise to the occasion, and I believe Adam has done just that. I\u2019m reading my blog  The Joy of Autism  \u2014 the older version before it was mistakenly taken down to reminisce. As I watch Adam now and process the year that has passed, I sense a great transformation that is happening in both of us. I see how I\u2019ve evolved and softened, wanting to change direction a bit from the way I wrote and blogged in previous years. I see how Adam wants to be mommy\u2019s big boy and how he makes an extra effort. Hindsight is not just 20/20 \u2014  it makes me appreciate just how much we\u2019ve actually accomplished, and how much of a team we\u2019ve become. It\u2019s hard for me to write this. I\u2019ve got butterflies like a person who is trying to get back out there, trying to re-launch and I know I\u2019m quivering and teetering. Yet today I sit even more diligently than ever, writing my fifteen pages a week.  Adam and I launch into projects like we never have before. I guess  we  managed.

{"date": "2009/11/25", "body": "After listening to  La Vie En Rose , I booked a last-minute ticket to Paris. I leave next week to meet my girlfriend, Leda, who I became friends with while studying in Europe fifteen years ago. Leda is a pianist and her father is a well-known composer from Zagreb. I mention this because I need my artist friends. I need to be around them like I need food or else the daily ups and downs of markets confines the spirit to downward spirals only waiting for outside influences to send them up again. Art puts everything into perspective and reminds me that its wonderful to be a part of the human drama. Perhaps because of our foreignness in a foreign country \u2014 we were both struggling to be part of German life in a town called Frieburg \u2013 and because we shared Croatian roots, and maybe just because we both loved music, Tori Amos and lots of laughter, we became good friends. I met Leda again in Paris while I was married a few years ago. Our visit was too short. My ex was not that interested in listening to our memories, which made me feel pressured to cut my visit short with her as most of us do when we know someone is waiting.  Thanks to email and Facebook, I\u2019ve reconnected with many of my friends and I decided at the last minute to meet her next week. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s part of the divorce process \u2013 that bucket list of things we\u2019re going to do only because we are not married anymore. Or perhaps it\u2019s due to the sheer desperation to find and become something new, someone different, and the best way to begin is with a list. Like a compass, it can point you in any direction. All you have to do is choose. It\u2019s difficult, though, to travel with a child waiting for me at home. A child who knows poignantly when I am not with him,  with his few but precious words, I am told, says \u201cmama\u2026mama\u2026\u201d and who is visibly missing me. If Adam only knew the sickness in my stomach that I feel every time I leave him for just a few days. I hate that he misses me or thinks I am gone forever and I worry about it until I\u2019m nauseous. It stopped me from taking many long trips my ex otherwise wanted me to take with him. When your child cannot talk easily with you about his feelings or over the telephone, the worry plummets deeper. So I only booked myself away for five days.  In the earlier days when I knew Leda, when we were younger but not less hopeful, I would have booked several months away under similar circumstances and I would challenge myself even more. It\u2019s like teetering on the edge of an old and new life like standing on the Prime Meridian in Greenwich, which I actually did once at The Royal Observatory. Real and imagined, even with five days, I am crossing a line.  While I always hate leaving Adam, I still feel a rush of excitement about  going to the airport, which despite the relative ease and economy of travel these days, and with delayed flights, packed airports and flaring tempers, still elates me and I might as well be back in the 1950\u2019s traveling as far and foreign as Asia. I feel excited watching all the people getting ready to go to their destinations \u2013 people who speak different languages. I will fiddle with my bag, dig out my book and sit beside strangers knowing that just one conversation can change a person\u2019s life. I love the smell of engine fuel and the sound of them revving before lift-off, the movie selection and bad airplane food and the struggle to sleep because tomorrow will be well underway when I arrive.  As I prepare by launching into a temporary state of transformation, I listen to Parisian music. I have booked a full schedule of concerts, literary walks and dinners with Leda when I arrive. I will bring my journal, put on red lipstick and pearls, and smear my coffee cups and wine goblets with red stains, and find a good pen to buy. I can almost smell the Marlboroughs in the air, and hear the echoes in skinny lane-ways on the Left Bank of lovers talking and giggling and the sound of my feet behind them like Anais Nin\u2019s as the night clears the air.  In  Tender is the Night , F. Scott Fitzgerald describes the phenomenon of people changing and becoming like the environment they visit. While witnessing a group of Americans in Paris he describes them as \u201cundergoing a sea-change, a shifting about of atoms to form the essential molecules of a new people.\u201d  Travel, he implies, changes us and I yearn to be changed, if only for a week in time. I am ready walk out  into my life again in my little black dress \u2014 of rediscovering myself and perhaps who I will become. And I am discovering myself also as a single parent to my son who, even while schlepping to parent-teacher meetings, Adam\u2019s team meetings, O.T., SLP and other like meetings in her Honda, enjoys her red lipstick and Coco Chanel. Discovery is a wonderful thing, and we can be many things to ourselves and to others. But most importantly, the best kind of travel and adventure is the kind where I know I still have Adam to come home to.

Not only is it difficult for me to be without Adam some nights, but I do worry so often how he feels about missing mom or dad when he is not with us as we were. I know, many families get divorced and the children do okay. But I am not from a family of divorce and I spend most days wondering how children cope (I had four step-children as well so I was always thinking about how they were coping) and it all leaves me feeling a little melancholy.  I hear that families are co-parenting successfully, whatever that really means \u2014 some \u201cbusiness\u201d relationship where the couple only speaks about the children. But it\u2019s never the same. That daily interaction where the details we took for granted are often the details that never get discussed. Maybe sometimes for some families it\u2019s better. And for some it\u2019s worse. And for others still, life just goes on and we make it the best we can because families, these days, seem to come in all shapes and sizes. This song says absolutely everything about how I feel when Adam is not with me, and I do not believe that even as time smooths the hard edges of life that I will ever be used to a house with an empty bed. Thankfully, Adam has a loving family with grandparents and a mom and dad who love him so very much. So at least both mom and dad can hope that Adam will have sweet dreams because he will always know how much we love him: ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2009/11/27/sweet-dreams/", "title": "Sweet Dreams"},

It\u2019s a question that Barb Farlow and her husband Tim have raised for the past several years, and today, the loss of their court case was featured in  The National Post . I\u2019ve known Barb for several years and supported her after we shared numerous emails a couple of years ago about her daughter, Annie. Only because of a difficult year in my own life was I unable to support Barb more actively in her quest in 2008. Barb with her husband Tim, have pursued justice for their three-month-old relentlessly. Not only has their struggle symbolized a deep respect for the life of their daughter, but for the rights and dignity of all disabled individuals.\u00a0 They have argued that\u00a0 because Annie had Trisomy 13, hospital staff\u00a0 executed a DNR from a subsequent illness without her parent\u2019s permission. The Farlow\u2019s, having taken great pains and effort to ask questions and pursue the case, have raised the question about how we value the life of disabled individuals, no matter how severe their disability. Noreen Kelly wrote in her piece  Crusade for Change : \u201cMost infants born with Annie\u2019s genetic condition die shortly after birth; few live past the age of 10.   Despite these odds, Barbara and her husband Tim decided, after much research and deliberation, that the right thing to do, for them and their family, was to give Annie a chance and to make medical decisions for her in the same way as a child without disabilities.  The Farlows were assured that Annie would be treated like any child, and that if surgical considerations arose, they would be discussed and a decision would be arrived at mutually with the physicians. Annie was born full term and received excellent supportive care at a Canadian hospital for the first several weeks.  In August 2005, when she was not yet three months old, she suffered episodic respiratory distress.  Annie died within 24 hours of arriving at the hospital.  At that time, her parents believed that she would not have survived surgery and that her death was natural. After obtaining the medical records and discovering the shocking facts of Annie\u2019s last hours, Barbara and Tim Farlow made an exhaustive effort to seek answers and a resolution with the hospital.  When this effort failed to yield much beyond an insincere apology and token, ineffective plans, they believed they had no choice but to sue the hospital and two doctors involved.  The allegations included practicing a policy of non-treatment for children with certain genetic conditions and secretive euthanasia.  Annie\u2019s story is a multi-faceted case including allegations of violation of civil laws of consent and violation of international human rights laws, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\u201d Barb and Tim loved Annie deeply \u2014 that is evident from the emails I\u2019ve shared with Barb. As a mother with a special needs child, though, I also feel deeply indebted to her, her family and to Annie as they have helped to raise awareness in hopes that more disabled people everywhere will be granted the same \u201cnet worth\u201d as those living without disabilities.

{"date": "2009/10/14", "body": "Adam had a more verbal day today. I guess that\u2019s normal lingo for a family with an autistic child who has real trouble with verbal communication. One his \u201cmore verbal\u201d days, he can get out phrases and sometimes full sentences. He can take his teacher to the closet, grab his lunch bag, put on his velcro shoes and proclaim \u201cgo home!\u201d twenty minutes before dismissal. He can come home and reach for his toy alligator from the shelf and then find a smooth concave shell and say to me \u201ccrown it.\u201d When I acknowledge that he\u2019s pretending it\u2019s the  Alligator King  from  Sesame Street  (yes he can watch the video about 500 times a day if we let him), Adam is very pleased. He crowns his pretend alligator a few times and moves its mouth as if he\u2019s trying to help the toy talk. I pause to wonder what Adam thinks as he manipulates the mouth with no sound. I imagine all the things he wants to say to me on tougher communication days, and how frustrating it must feel. I imagine all the questions he has to ask his parents regarding their recent separation that cannot yet ask, though I am clever enough to know that he thinks them and I have to behave as if to answer them all for my behaviour sets the tone for everything. I have seen and known enough to witness that he can follow every instruction and he understands more than he can express. In the movie  Awakenings ,  Dr. Sayer asks the mother how she knows what her catatonic son is saying. She replies, \u201cYou\u2019re not a mother. A mother knows.\u201d It is true in my home as well. For seven years every sound, every move, every expression and I  just know . Sometimes I have to be careful to listen because I actually may be paying more attention to all those other subtle behaviours instead of that speech he tries so hard to get out. I suppose my actions also speak louder than words as they model for Adam and they may have become just as important as facund explanations. Perhaps if we were observed carefully as a unit, others would see this daily orchestration that we have come to take for granted as much as those who speak take what they say for granted. In our house, the saying \u201cactions speak louder than words,\u201d cannot more more true. Adam also has many abilities in helping out mom and dad, for he loves us both so much.  I think it\u2019s just one of his very precious gifts to us, and that he gives to others (although mom and dad are in that exclusive category). I know that Adam is a wonderful, loving boy who will give this gift to many during his life and I know he will bestow the new people in his life with that blessing. I guess, in a very special way, he is a lot like the king\u2019s seventh son. In my opinion, he deserves my crown, and I hope he won\u2019t mind the dents.

{"date": "2009/10/22", "body": "I have come across  Guy Dove\u2019s review of Wendy Lawson\u2019s Concepts of Normality recently (after being away for a while), and have to defend our positions.   Wendy Lawson\u2019s book is about regarding individuals with autism with respect and dignity and questions our idea of what is \u201cnormal\u201d when dealing specifically with autistic people. It is a wonderful thesis based upon how society views \u201cnormal.\u201d Of the \u201cguest author\u2019s\u201d Dinah Murray and myself, Dove states: The guest authors, on the other hand, seem openly hostile to such parents. Murray sarcastically remarks, \u201cSome Others [members of the typical population] weep and moan and deplore their autistic child\u2019s existence; they wallow in self-pity and congratulate each other on how Truly Dreadful it all is.\u201d This statement illegitimately paints a diverse group of people with a broad brush and seems to be little more than a mean-spirited attempt to silence critics. Klar-Wolfond is not much better. In her discussion of the admittedly questionable practice of using scientifically unsupported biomedical therapies, she offers the following rhetorical question, \u201cAnd to make them what? \u2014 better at maths, quicker on the sports field, or well-mannered?\u201d This is doubly insulting to parents of children who have tried such therapies. First, it belittles their concern. The suggestion is that parents are merely trying to get their children to \u201cact normal\u201d when in fact they are often trying to ameliorate severe challenges with respect to communication and social interaction as well as other difficulties including debilitating anxiety, painful gastrointestinal problems, insomnia, and even violent behavior. Second, it denigrates their reasoning. Many parents who try such therapies agonize over their decision. Although some of these therapies have potentially harmful side effects, most do not. When Klar-Wolfond lumps together treatments as diverse as supplements and detoxification therapies, she is being both misleading and unfair. \n To me it is a response not terribly unfamiliar. Dove discounts Dinah\u2019s perspective of being an autistic individual herself and myself as also being a parent who \u201cagonizes\u201d over decisions. It is precisely to that point I think worthy of addressing and why I wrote the piece in the first place. Parents of autistic children are being eaten. A plethora of information does not constitute proof of what causes autism or what may assist with the symptoms of autism, and even those symptoms may not be a direct cause of autism but autism may cause a more heightened reaction to an ailment. Come to my house when Adam has a cold and instead of a tired child, he may be running around the house.  Yet the rise of speculation has lead many (clinicians and those in the medial profession included, and conversely thanks to the researchers who have endeavoured to provide the real proof to many speculations out there) to sell their products to the risk and danger of the autistic child, feeding upon the desperate worry of parents \u2013 and most of the time these parents are new to autism thus more open to trying anything to \u201chelping\u201d their autistic child recover. I can\u2019t help but chuckle and Dove\u2019s choice of words. \u201cHostile\u201d is a descriptive word typically ascribed to women who tend to take a critical stance. The hysterical, hostile woman is no more a stereotype than the idea that autistics are less worthy and in need of a cure. Yet Dove, to be fair, is of the mindset, it appears, that these remedies are somehow safe and that parents are only trying to make the best choice. It is here where I think he misses not only the point, but an opportunity to engage in a discussion of how we come to push unproven remedies that risk the safety of our children. The very idea that our children are \u201cnot normal,\u201d is the premise for trying to recover them, which is why Dr. Lawson chose the guest author essays for her book.  The attempt, by Murray, Lawson and myself, is to identify this preying upon parental worries, not demonizing parents. Yet all of us have to step back and take a close look at what we are putting at risk and why.  Further, Dove\u2019s defense of parents instead of the autistic people who are much more vulnerable is sadly typical in our age.  It is this stereotype we are challenging and we need to point out the irony of critiquing the view of the autistic person who implores a different view. Yes, all parents agonize over their decisions. Where is the mechanism by which quackery is separated from scientific proof? As a parent, I can relate to the agony of putting my child on ANY medication (and this is NOT related to his autism but to his overall well being and health). The non acceptance of autism as a way of being, which is precisely Wendy Lawson\u2019s point, has driven many parents to put their children on hundreds of unproven remedies at the same time. The question is not hostility, Professor Dove. It is a question of having a critical mind precisely when emotions are the driving force behind the autism \u201chysteria.\u201d For any parent or autistic person willing to engage in this discussion, we are in turn called \u201chostile?\u201d Have you witnessed the hostility by non autistic parents against autistic individuals who are trying to be seen and heard?  I can tell you as a parent and a friend to many autistic individuals, there is a great deal of agony, indeed. The agony is in pushing them to recover from autism, not recover from stomach pain. Whether the two are linked, no one can really say. The evidence is still very anecdotal. Clearly, that pain should be remedied, but not at the risk of administering hundreds of medicines simultaneously in order that our children can act more \u201cnormal.\u201d I gather being critical is less important than putting our children\u2019s health and safety at unnecessary risk. As for Adam, I couldn\u2019t bear seeing him in pain. Of course I would seek counsel from his doctor and endeavour to remedy his pain. It would be no different if I had a non autistic child. The point is autistic children are being put at much higher risk precisely BECAUSE they are autistic.\n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&id=4962&cn=165"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2009/10/22/a-response-to-prof-guy-dove-on-wendy-lawsons-book/", "title": "A Response to Prof. Guy Dove on Wendy Lawson\u2019s Book"},

Neuroscientists study the innate rhythm of our brains,  citing that no other species possess this capability. Apes cannot synchronize if one ape taps a stick. The other apes cannot keep up the rhythm. So this is innate to human beings and perhaps a way we have evolved. Our ability to socialize, to gather as communities have been largely facilitated by this ability.  Young babies can understand musical structure before they understand language. Alzheimer\u2019s patients can remember emotions and early memories, as well as right/wrong notation and words of music even if every other faculty is gone. In other words, music is the last thing, the only thing and neuroscientists are looking at this aspect of our humanity. For Sting who had an MRI done in order to study aspects of this , when finally looking at images of his brain after it had been evaluated post-testing, he became a bit undone. He said he didn\u2019t want to know the inner workings of what is otherwise a mystical, spiritual experience for him. While interesting, dissecting his musical brain was unnerving.  It is also said that by learning a musical instrument, we may be able to ward off Alzheimers. Similarly, a child will increase their I.Q. by 7%  by learning a musical instrument. Adam is learning to play piano, and like all people, my autistic little boy loves music. He can sing better than he can talk. He tries, although motorically challenged, to keep a dance rhythm with his body, but is otherwise a wonderful drummer. Rhythm, be it through music or rhyme has composed a major aspect of our lives in just basic communication in our home, and I\u2019m lucky because it also comes naturally to me as I have been a singer, have learned many musical instruments in my life (violin, guitar, flute, piano, recorders\u2026). But use it or lose it. I\u2019ve forgotten how to play what used to come so easily, although I can pick up tunes by ear very easily using the piano.  We sing \u201chome-made\u201d opera in our house \u2014 sort of a daily dialogue in a Bugs Bunny/ Wagnerian way.  Use of music and rhythm is extremely important for any of us to use language, and it is highly effective with non verbal people. It makes me wonder why we don\u2019t discuss and utilize this so much more. We love to make utter fools of ourselves singing our home-made opera in our house \u2014 from asking for the juice to brushing our teeth, there is no shortage of home-made songs for every occasion. And even though it is I who makes the major fool of myself the most by doing it, I think Adam enjoys it as he tweets back my silly tunes in his smaller, more cherub voice.

Autistics tend to have poor social skills and difficulty response to stress or changes, which makes finding work a challenge (one study suggests that only 6 per cent of autistic adults have full-time employment). but Sonne realized they also tend to be methodical, possess excellent memories, and show great attention to detail and tolerance for repetition \u2014 in other words, the might make excellent software testers.

{"date": "2009/08/05", "body": "By 2012, accommodating disabled persons in Ontario will become mandatory for all non profit organizations. Accommodating people with disabilities will be enforced, and this will make it necessary for all not for profit agencies \u2014 which includes hospitals, schools, religious organizations, transportation services and the like \u2014 to be able to utilize and/or make available Assistive Devices for non verbal individuals as well as other equipment, environmental provisions and the deliverance of the \u201cproducts and services\u201d (which entails what we commonly refer to as\u00a0 accommodation) for a diverse population of individuals with various needs. Under the  Ontarian Accessibiltiy Act  which became law in 2005, non profits will all have to comply by 2012 and other businesses by 2025. The use of such terms as \u201ccustomer service,\u201d positions the act to read that it requires to view our disabled population also as clients and consumers \u2014 the latter term which, in our current economic belief and behaviour, renders Ontario\u2019s disabled as more \u201cvaluable\u201d citizens.\u00a0 It is true that the disabled are important part of our society and contributors to our economy, and it makes sad but true sense that our legislators have to enforce the accommodation of all our citizens by using these terms. Economic terms. We deliver a basic human right via \u201ccustomer service.\u201d Now that it is soon to become mandatory for an area that I\u2019m particularly interested in \u2014 schools \u2014 I wonder why there is continued resistance in Ontario to use AAC (Assistive Augmentative Communication).\u00a0 Adam needs the computer in his school to communicate his understanding of the concepts being taught. It seems like simple ABC to me. In this day and age where technology is common and relatively inexpensive, and where autistic children can indeed excel, it makes little sense that we have to make enforceable the ways and means that autistic children can participate and be included in the classroom and with their peers. This argument goes beyond devices and right down to understanding how autistic children can learn and respond and how the format of the lessons and teaching styles need to be delivered. For if our children are now viewed as valuable \u201cclients,\u201d then one would think they should certainly be entitled to no less. I for one am working with the act and terminology to encourage service providers unfamiliar with accommodating disabled people in Ontario to adapt and include. Once we can help others to understand that disabled children do not \u201cpull their other children down,\u201d but in fact propel them forward both as compassionate human beings as well as academically, we can create more just classrooms. \u201cResearch shows that for typical students in inclusive classrooms, academic performance was equal to or better than that of general education students educated in noninclusive classrooms.\u201d (Exceptional Children, 64: (1998) 239-253) \u201cAnd, contrary to the worries of many parents of typical students, the inclusion of students with severe disabilities (when there was appropriate support) did not reduce teaching time nor create many interruptions.\u201d (Exceptional Children, 61,3 (1994): 242-253). Yet the burden of proof will remain heavy upon us for some time. There is not really a day that we do not confront resistance to inclusion (or \u201cbarriers\u201d which is a commonly used term), in the name of safety, medical needs, the guise of inclusion under the term \u201cmainstreaming,\u201d competition and more myths about why special needs children should not be included in our communities, schools and daily life. It is up to us to hold steady with this burden\u00a0 to keep up the research and the dialogue about why inclusion is good for everyone. As Adam goes to an inclusive school, it seems logical that we learn to teach by teaching and we learn to include by including. Legislation or no legislation, we will still have a lot of work to do in order to help others understand autism and autistic people as valuable and entitled in their own rite.

{"date": "2009/08/04", "body": "Adam is learning to cycle. It is this cycling in the outdoors that keeps us alive in a time of change and confusion. It is a forward motion, it is a challenge to overcome negative thinking, the past, the things we can\u2019t change. My cycling has become a major part of my life this month, and it must be contagious because Adam keeps asking for his bicycle. I think this is something that is going to be something Adam and I will share. Now that may seem unremarkable for many. Yet my son, who had such difficulty coordinating his body when he was younger, who could not propel forward with his legs, let alone steer at the same time, is now able to coordinate all of those remarkable steps we take so much for granted. I can see us riding into our future together \u2014 mom and this little boy who will soon become a man before I know it. I know he will take some paths I will never take. I know one day I will have to let him move beyond me, even though I will not be far behind. But for now, I am here to help him learn and soon we will ride side by side. Adam is still on his training wheels and I am training on hills. Yesterday, I accomplished a 35 kilometer ride on a heavy bike (I have to get a road bike). I worked twice as hard and I dug deep. As I did, I noticed my thoughts. When I think about what\u2019s been \u201cdone to\u201d me, I become a victim. It\u2019s so incredibly debilitating. But when I refuse to be a victim, I can ride like the wind. Climbing up hills on a bike not suited to them, I had to push extremely hard and it would have been easier to give up. As I rose to the crest of the hill, all my negative thoughts washed away. Divorce or diagnosis \u2014 no matter what \u201cD\u201d you are facing (I like to call them the \u201cD\u2019s\u201d \u2014 divorce, disability, diagnosis, disease, death, depression\u2026), we cannot succumb to victimhood. We have to instead \u201cdig down deep,\u201d and face the demons which only we create in our minds. Demons are negative thoughts. They are always there, wanting to take over and render us zombies. Divorce is so much like getting a diagnosis of autism with your child.\u00a0 Your world is shaken to the core; all your beliefs our challenged; you struggle with your own identity and future in the midst of an uncertain one. I can\u2019t think of any blessing greater, actually, than being challenged to the core like this. No, it\u2019s not fun, but I have to make it so now after ten months of grieving. It\u2019s much easier to glide through life and it is also a blessing to have a strong relationship. But my thinking of hard times as a blessing is the way I can turn things around, for what becomes \u201creal\u201d is manifested by our thoughts. These are the choices that can turn our lives into something vibrant, or something that dies before its time. So today, I will run and tomorrow I will cycle again. This, I hope I\u2019ve conveyed, is about more than aesthetics. As a mother to Adam, I think about our future, my vibrancy, for the sake of not only myself, but for him and for others around me. I\u2019ve lived the past seven years climbing steep hills of various kinds. I\u2019ve glided down some great hills too, as my reward. I think that for all parents of extraordinary children, we can tend to get wrapped up in the politics, the struggle for acquiring access and services, or for some parents, the (in my opinion) negative struggle of trying to change the autistic child to become \u201cnormal.\u201d Sometimes, we need to focus on our own thoughts and challenge our own thinking in order to serve better. They say one can always become fitter. And so it goes also with the mind. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2009/08/04/propulsion/", "title": "Propulsion"},

{"date": "2009/08/11", "body": "I take a moment to talk about Adam, which I do so little of lately. He has been the inspiration for this blog and all my thinking and rethinking about autism. He deserves a great deal of kudos for turning minds around. He goes to camp and he can make everyone laugh and smile. He comes home at the end of the day, and I am told that everyone loves him. His smile can brighten an entire room.\u00a0 Often, I am given credit for this, but it takes two. He was born with the affable disposition. Yet, I do often wonder how, if I\u2019d kept him behind those closed ABA doors (the style of ABA at the time of Adam\u2019s early instruction), if he would have remained his true self.\u00a0 It is a question I\u2019m sure all parents ask themselves, and there is even a book out which follows children with various backgrounds to adulthood: \n   Fragile Success \n Ten Autistic Children, Childhood to Adulthood,  Second Edition \n By  Virginia Walker Sperry, M.A. It seems like an interesting attempt at trying to create proof, to distill what makes an autistic person \u201csuccessful\u201d in life, yet success is also in how we measure it. I, for one, have measures that seem more akin to a revolution that\u2019s happening right now. My measure may be more along the lines of those who reconsider behavioural economics \u2014 a movement away from growth (the thinking that image and objects will make us happier) to the things we do and the way we think that make us happy.\u00a0 Like all parents, I want Adam to be happy. I want him to learn. I want him to learn discipline without losing his  joie de vivre.  I want him to want things in life that will make him happy. So far, I think we\u2019ve been successful. He has a natural wonder and curiousity. He still has difficulty with speaking, but he tries hard to string his words together. His drive often amazes me. I do not think the word failure is in our vocabulary. I do not know if we can measure what makes autistic children become \u201csuccessful\u201d autistic adults. Like all of us, we are born with personality, to different families with different circumstances.\u00a0 Adam reminds me of the happy-go-lucky young girl I was once. I\u2019ve suffered my blows, but Adam continues to bring me out of any depths that may tempt me to wallow. He needs me. He thrives on my happiness. For now I am taking heed of the oxygen-mask analogy. I\u2019m taking good care (finally) of myself. I am losing the weight of the world that I chose to once carry. I am lightening up in every sense.

I\u2019m singing at St. Michael\u2019s Choir School Stage with our band \u201cMaurader.\u201d Those were the days\u2026 every weekend jamming in someone\u2019s basement. I played keyboard and as you can well see, sang. I think these were some ditty\u2019s from Pat Benetar\u2026.\u201dYou\u2019re a heartbreaker\u2026.\u201d\u00a0 Now this was no motley crew. I sang and went to school (St. Mikes was our \u201cbrother school\u201d as I went to HNM \u2014 an all girls school) with Michael Schade, now a world-renowned tenor, and Mitch himself is now a composer, among some other of my friends who stayed in music and went on to do other marvelous things. The folks from St. Mikes and HNM are a highly-achieved bunch. (C\u2019mon friends, speak up). Driving up North with my son Adam, the singing hasn\u2019t stopped. Both Adam and I sing out loud to the radio tunes. The rock and roll girl still lives on some 25 years later deep inside the responsible, devoted autism mom. I dance and sing with Adam every day and he loves it. He loves mama\u2019s spirit and mama love\u2019s Adam\u2019s.  Adam learns piano. He loves to sing. He loves to dance. We can never downplay the innate gifts we have to give to our children. Thanks to my old friend, Michel, who found these photos, and some of my high school friends (thanks to Facebook), I am aided in that they help to resurrect the great memories and the strong bonds we had. They awaken a side of me that I had nearly forgotten. Going through divorce makes one want to go back to one\u2019s roots. And mine, thankfully, are strong. The memories bring me back to myself. I am painting again \u2014 Adam watches every stroke of my brush with great intrigue and attention \u2014 he particularly likes it when I paint his portrait. I bring out my guitar to see if I can remember how to play. While writing has turned into my first passion, the other artistic pursuits help move things along when I am stuck. And if it\u2019s passion we\u2019re talking about, I\u2019m happy to say that one of my favourite bands, RUSH, is also going through a revival \u2014 eyeglasses, arthritis (I am just assuming) and all. (I am wearing my glasses I cannot live without recently as I write this). It\u2019s all rather fun to rediscover in order to grow.  ( This photo was the band that started it all\u2026Xephyr. My first boyfriend on the far right \u2014 that is if you don\u2019t count the 1st beau in Kindergarten). So if ever you think you\u2019ve lost yourself in times of great change, I think it\u2019s important to go back to the days when we felt most fully ourselves. I don\u2019t care if someone thinks I\u2019m a goof\u00a0 for doing something because of my age, for being a little silly and taking chances will be the one thing that keeps me vital. When we are young, there are no real obligations to quell some of these risks we take to discover who we are and what we love. Growing older and more experienced in life has certainly made me wiser, but when I look back at myself I get the chance to remember an aspect that still lives strong within me. It reminds me that it\u2019s not over \u2014 the exploration not yet complete. While I still sing in the car, I often think of returning to voice training now that my life has cracked open again \u2014 and why should I not? I\u2019ve sung in choirs (once with Toronto Mendelsohn), and in many other venues.\u00a0 I also consider how I\u2019ve turned my creative self towards autism and Adam and how he challenges the artistic growth within me as I also hope to nurture it in him. So, forgive me for being a little self-indulgent as I turn giddy down memory lane. Remembering who I was makes me excited of who I may still become. Rock on.

I had, of course, asked permission to publish this photo. I picked up Adam at noon so we could head up North for his last couple weeks before school starts. And what did I find? Adam was hugging and playing with his counselors and their affection for him was in no short supply. We could barely leave after saying multiple and lingering goodbyes.

{"date": "2009/07/06", "body": "This month\u2019s UTNE Reader has three superb articles on disability and design and disability and beauty.  Long-time model, artist and prosthetic user (as well as designer) Aimee Mullins also writes,  Prosthetic Power: Aimee Mullins redefines beauty and the body. In this photo, Aimee is photographed with prosthetic legs which she fashioned after the hind legs of a cheetah. She runs with these legs and has a dozen pairs of differently-designed and fashionable legs, which also give her five different heights. In the UTNE article, she discusses how she puts the legs on a table for young children to view and discuss. She asks adults to stay out of the room because \u201cthey [children] only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way and censors that natural curiousity.\u201d Instead of being stared at as some kind of freak, Aimee  invites the children to explore.  Unabashedly, they touch the legs an wiggle the toes, she explains. She says to the children \u201cI woke up this morning and I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house. If you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character, anything you can dream up right now, what kind of legs would you build me?\u201d The children shouuted \u201cKangaroo! Frog!\u201d and other amazing possibilities. Of this she explains, \u201cI went from being a woman these kids would have been trained to see as disabled to somebody who had potential that their bodies didn\u2019t have yet. Somebody who might even be super-abled. Interesting.\u201d As in autistic people speaking for themselves in any way or means they can, which also incites new ideas of what it means to be capable, valuable and above-all, human, Aimee raises two very important points. First, she has taken the bull-by-the-horn to invite people to explore instead of stare. The stare can be intrusive, full of, often misplaced, assumptions that the disabled person is less worthy and valuable or even capable. The stare can be overlayed with assumptions that an disfigurement is ugly. Autistic researchers who redefine paradigms of how autistic people learn are no different than the likes of Aimee who not only redefine disability, but refuse to let non disabled or autistic people define it for them. Because Aimee\u2019s disability is more visible, this point may be easier to absorb. Cognitive disabilities are still not understood in the same fashion. Still, Aimee talks about becoming the architects of our identities, and this holds true for our autistic community.\u00a0 As a woman who is admittedly still influenced by how I should look and behave and still tortured by it, I still have an awareness of how oppressive imposed identities have on us. She makes note how Pamela Anderson has more prosthetics in her body than she does but that \u201cnobody [calls Pamela] disabled.\u201d While its true that no one calls Pamela Anderson disabled, I would argue that she is entirely disabled and entrapped in a male view of what a woman should be. We are entrapped also by what we should be as contributors to an economy, which is restricted itself in the ways people can contribute to it.\u00a0 When women or any person works so hard in order to please others before themselves, they are no longer architects of their own identities, but slaves to an imposed identity. Having visited the MIT lab when I gave a lecture there a couple of years ago now, I was a priviledged witness of astounding design for the disabled. I believe the article hits the nail on the head as it suggests that this is no longer about accepting disability or discussing potential (although it is frustrating for many of us that the question continues to swirl), but about the potential issues regarding augmentation. In Graham Pullin\u2019s book,  Design Meets Disability , I believe we are witnessing devices and prosthetics for the disabled that are not meek and discrete, but that wears disability as fashionable as anything I\u2019ve ever seen. And I know that MIT works with autistic people in their lab so that devices are in fact useful and empowering \u2014 not based on a model of making up for deficiency. It will be interesting, however, to see where augmentation takes us in the sense of designing humanity. Like any other kind of design, there is such potential for abuse. I would view women who augment themselves to extremes like Pamela Anderson a form of self-abuse, and I am admittedly not immune to it. If sexiness is empowerment, I believe that Aimee is way too sexy for Pamela Anderson anyway, or for that matter, for many men equally dis-empowered by mass-media images regarding the women they are told\u00a0 should be at their sides. As a woman full of so-called flaws, can I just sneak in here that well,\u00a0 I\u2019m just too sexy for the status quo. Or at least I should, like the rest of us, keep convincing myself as such. Aimee certainly helps us all redefine beauty. And that is entirely liberating.

Several of the questions all have generally to do with the consequences and benefits of writing about children with the additional peril of writing about disabled children \u2014 usually children who cannot speak for themselves. As I\u2019ve noted, I have numerous reasons for raising these questions at this point in my four-year blogging history. Firstly, I am going through a divorce. I hesitate because the story I would tell would still be influenced by my being too close to be self-deprecating, no matter what the circumstance. I tend to think that all great memoir writing about difficult life circumstances has this element in it: the ability to see oneself and one\u2019s on imperfections even if the action towards you was unjustified, as well as the ability to be compassionate to characters who have done unjustifiable acts. In what I believe to be interesting narrative, everyone has their reasons which leaves out judgment. To understand others and their motivations is the foundation of all good writing and formulation of interesting characters. Of course, I am, as they say, still \u201ctoo close\u201d to write about my personal life, if ever I do at all. I will likely have more interesting things to write about.\u00a0 In order to tell really good stories of truth or fiction, we need to understand our perspectives and assumptions at a particular point in time. Without dissecting them, our writing and characters remain flat. One concern I have is for my son to read what I write about him. I want him to feel that I was real and wrote about him with truth, compassion and dignity. Compassion is the key to telling true stories, I believe. I want him to think that I was a good artist who didn\u2019t have to expose every detail, but got the bigger point across. So, I have made a commitment to him and to myself to write when I feel I can truly step away from things that are still emotionally charged. It\u2019s not that I want to be emotionally distant \u2013 indeed my emotions are a full part of my experience and they need to be written.\u00a0 It\u2019s the manner in which I\u2019m able to write about them that matters. It is the art and the craft of writing that can elevate a trite piece of writing to a piece that lives long after we\u2019ve moved on. The next issue I am having is one of revealing details about my son at this point in his development, perhaps influenced also by a divorce process (and thankfully both mom and dad are doing an excellent job as parents, still) as the vulnerable need not be made more so. This is my paranoia as his mother and I realize I am supposed to think about such things. It is my job and obligation. Even if he is resilient and strong (as we parents generally come to realize about our growing children), we are on our guard nonetheless. Writing about the vulnerable \u2013 be it children, disabled children who can\u2019t speak for themselves, disabled adults, the aged and so forth, requires us to think much more deeply about how we write. As I see Adam develop, my attitude has changed and softened significantly than at the time of his diagnosis. I think there is a huge urge of many parents to write about the diagnosis because there is narrative tension that is still interesting to the outsider. This is when most writing about autistic children really gets done. We read perhaps too much now (just think that a few years ago there was very little), on that D-Day or \u201cdiagnosis day.\u201d There is a lot of interest from new parents of disabled children to relate to the pain and conflict of early diagnosis. Little is written about learning how to live with a disability in the sense that the worry dissipates. Mostly, what we read are memoirs about how parents seek to cure their children instead of learning about themselves as parents in a world that is filled with different kinds of people. Donna Williams remains the top of my list of autistic writers who not only write beautifully and artistically, but tell a story that goes beyond childhood. The tension is still there, but the story isn\u2019t sensationalized for the sake of selling books. Let\u2019s face it: our lives are not like everyone else\u2019s, which is why so many of us need to write.\u00a0 \u201cSuffering has always animated life-writing,\u201d says Arthur Frank who has written about his own illness. Indeed that familiar theme of finding peace, a spiritual awakening, an appreciation for life itself, is a kind-of triumph-over-struggle theme that appeals to most of us in a challenging world. I think of Audre Lorde and her cancer diaries and poems that I devoured after my two cancer surgeries last year. Her honesty and artistry helped me see myself as fully human even with my stage of dwindling self-image and pain. Yet what is especially disturbing to me is when that theme is diluted into a sugar-coated story, only telling of the good stuff \u2014 you know, how all our children are \u201cangels\u201d kind of rhetoric.\u00a0 To my chagrin, I\u2019m afraid that much of the \u201cacceptance movement\u201d has turned saccharine and in it a fear to acknowledge the challenges and the pain as well as the joys. Conversely, when all a parent does is complain about how horrifying their disabled child is and disruptive to their lives, without qualification or deep circumspection, is equally if not even more disturbing, for we get a sense that we are not being told the whole story, or perhaps a story with a particular agenda and worse, we are being told that disabled children are a blight and burden on society thus threatening their right to exist. So in order to write a good memoir, and how we define what is good if not ethical life writing is what\u2019s at stake here. Frank says, with regards in how to respond to illness and disability, \u201cwhat is done within the body, what happens in relationships and how existential and spiritual attitudes change \u2013 is presented as a sequence of choices. The writer\u2019s identity becomes crucially implicated in how she or he makes these choices: a person\u2019s responses are a measure of his or her character.\u201d (p. 174  The Ethics of Life Writing ).The stories we choose to tell and how we tell them in the case of writing about our children, is therefore an indication of our character. Somewhere along the road to raising children, either at the time of birth or later on, our expectations were thwarted. That in and of itself has been enough to warrant many people to approach us and say, \u201cyou should write a book!\u201d But how good of a book? To what end? What are we trying to achieve?\u00a0 My soon-to-be ex husband even came to me regarding the circumstances of our divorce stated \u201cif I were you, I would write a book about this.\u201d What an invitation!! Not that I will necessarily take advantage of it for my own personal gain, for that is not the point here. I did, in the past, write about many encounters with friends and family regarding discussions about autism and their reactions to Adam to which I was angry (an honest emotion), but used as illustrations of a day-in- the-life of an autistic family. I felt that these examples were especially important to illustrate how our society has been trained to react and respond, no less treat, disabled people. Those encounters in mere blog posts were enough to achieve that tension. In as far as maintaining relationships is concerned, some managed to stick by me and support the purpose of the posts, and others couldn\u2019t handle seeing themselves within the narrative. I once received an email from a friend\u2019s husband referring to my writing as \u201cgetting things off my chest,\u201d thereby diminishing my feelings, our significant experiences and my writing. Yet, I write and express to get things off my chest, that\u2019s for certain. It\u2019s just that I hope not to sound pathetic doing it. I hope the writing transcends the individuals to illustrate the more important points \u2014\u00a0 and the point that we all have much to learn. But isn\u2019t that what writing, gossiping, telling stories is all about? I am making a general assumption here that all gossip is negative, which isn\u2019t necessarily true. I will also suggest that gossip, for the most part in my view often has the sole intent of denigrating another person. So in telling true stories, intention matters.  \n Telling stories, it can be argued as parents of disabled children, is still important. It is especially important that we as parents write\u00a0 well \u2014 truthfully and with dignity. I cannot say that I have accomplished to my satisfaction, the \u201cwriting well\u201d part. To accomplish this, it takes great deliberation and like anything, practice. To live with disability in the family, as in any other oppressed minority group, is to also live politically whether we like it or not. This adds another sensitive dimension to our writing. Many parents of typical children will not experience this to the same extent, if at all. For me to tell those stories during those early stages of Adam\u2019s development were exceptionally important in navigating our way through ignorance and understanding it \u2013 my insecurity about such statements admittedly came of a place where I was also in their shoes, that is the shoes of the ignorant \u2013 completely unaware of the full extent of disability itself \u2014 meaning the community, the politics, the meaning and history of disability, the lives. Should I keep these stories to myself or do they benefit not only myself in my growth as Adam\u2019s parent, but also others who are on the same path? Would those people still be my friends if I hadn\u2019t of told those stories?\u00a0 What is friendship anyway if we cannot be honest? Right\u2026? (I am happy to report that the really great friends still hang around even if rigorous disagreement or debate is involved). Of this I would emphasize that the intention is important with regards to telling our stories. It might just be difficult after all, to be a writer. In her essay,  Friendship, Fiction and Memoir: Trust and Betrayal In Writing From One\u2019s Own Life , Claudia Mills\u00a0 discusses the risks of writing about one\u2019s family and friends and seeks the meaning of friendship as her guide. Using Aristotle and Kant \u2014 \u201cwe seek the good for the other for his own sake and not our own,\u201d (Aristotle) and \u201cThe strictest friendship requires an understanding friend who considers himself bound not to share without express permission a secret entrusted to him with anyone else,\u201d (Kant)\u00a0\u00a0 \u2013Mills painfully deliberates, as if her conscience is eating at her: \u201cWhat contexts are we primae facie justified in sharing the stories of our most intimate associates with others?\u201d She suggests that she couldn\u2019t have relationships if she couldn\u2019t talk about them \u2013 that we benefit from talking about them and notes how secrecy can be \u201ccorrosive and damaging.\u201d Yet there is a difference between talking or writing at someone else\u2019s expense, as I said, in order to hurt them. While telling the truth may be hurtful to others, or be outright embarrassing, it is this shame that is the most costly to our peace of mind. There is nothing more liberating than living your life out in the open. But living mine out in the open does not necessarily mean I have the right to live Adam\u2019s out in the open for him. So we must choose our vignettes and words carefully, without over-editing which also takes away from the authenticity of an interesting story. Mills takes the easier route and chooses to write fiction, even though her family and friends seem to recognize themselves in her stories. For parents with disabled children, this writing can be a cathartic process and a way of breaking down the reductive view of our disabled children. Arthur Kleinman, in  The Illness Narratives , suggests that people who are ill are reduced as people in terms of their pain and debility, or their illness. That proverbial medical view of the disabled person as a mere patient instead of a complex individual remains a part of the demoralization process. Instead, Arthur Frank turns it around. He calls his personal narrative a \u201cremoralization process,\u201d an act of telling a counter-story to the ones that we see all too often in the news and Hollywood and much of literary media where disabled people are used in the background like bridges to the \u201creal\u201d characters. In looking at narratives like Michael Berube\u2019s  Life As We Know It , and Thomas Murray\u2019s,  The Worth of A Child , and Cranes\u2019  Aiden\u2019s Way , among other parental narratives, Frank points out that we as parents write in order to break down the assumptions \u2013 that our writing can be \u201cacts of justification\u201d as we write to justify our children\u2019s right to exist. As I continue my writing and work to become a better, more artistic writer (I am hopeful with much more work), I am aware that to summarize Adam as a series of impairments, to finalize his character in the narration, is what the medical community already does. So I want to avoid this at all costs. \u201c[Reflexivity] is moral work, since what\u2019s at stake is personhood and its entitlements.\u201d Most of us are all too aware of society\u2019s rush to categorize our kids, to judge them, reduce them instead of viewing them as people with a right to be included in everything. This is a great risk that we undertake as parent-writers \u2014 this act of finalizing our children, defining them\u00a0 and thus imposing identity that has really not yet been fully formed.\u00a0 As Frank notes about the writers of the exceptional memoirs cited above, \u201cThey resolve this dilemma, and keep a dialogue open, by refusing to say any last word about their children. The child\u2019s future \u2013 his or her horizon of possibilities \u2013 is kept open, though this requires nothing less than redrawing the horizons of human possibility itself. These writings become teachings in the morality of respect: not principles of respect, as in Kantian respect for persons, but practices of respect, which the writing not only describes but reflexively exemplifies.\u201d I hope in my next post about writing about children, I will be able to compare the recent writings of Jenny McCarthy and Temple Grandin\u2019s mother\u2019s older book  A Thorn in My Side , in order to illustrate what I consider to be problematic in the name of our children\u2019s dignity and telling our true stories. As for my story, it\u2019s easier to dance around it than tell it at the moment during my set of current circumstances. I am only left with the deliberations of what and how to write next.

Here are the details and click here for the website: http://www.esf.org/index.php?id=5256 ESF-LiU Conference \nTHE PERFECT BODY: BETWEEN NORMATIVITY AND CONSUMERISM Chaired by: Dr. Katrin Grueber \nIMEW (Institut Mensch, Ethik und Wissenschaft) \nBerlin \nGermany Dr. Ursula Naue \nLife Science Governance Research Platform \nUniversity of Vienna \nFaculty of Social Sciences \nDepartment of Political Science \nVienna \nAustria 9-13 October 2009 The conference will be held at Scandic Link\u00f6ping V\u00e4st, Sweden \u2013 7km\u00a0 from Link\u00f6ping airport and 4km from the train station. Most notably,\u00a0 the Swedish chain Scandic Hotel\u00b4s commitment to sustainability won the\u00a0 Green Meetings Award in 2008. It is located in Link\u00f6ping which is the\u00a0 capital of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland county, situated in the center of a vast open\u00a0 farmland. It is Sweden\u2019s fifth largest city with more than 136,000\u00a0 inhabitants and has a long history as a city of learning. Preliminary Programme Enhancement as the improvement of desired characteristics (W. French\u00a0 Anderson) means to focus on abilities, capacities and quality of life.\u00a0 These categories can be viewed and defined from different value-driven\u00a0 perspectives which are based upon certain viewpoints on what\u00a0 constitutes \u201cnormality.\u201d Furthermore they are framed by the concept of\u00a0 autonomy. The general approach towards the issue of enhancement can be\u00a0 understood in the context of consumerism \u2013 the \u201cproduction\u201d of\u00a0 enhanced persons as an act of individual freedom and choice. But\u00a0 another approach, which will be the main focus of the conference, is\u00a0 based upon the fact that perspectives of disabled persons on\u00a0 enhancement have been neglected so far. This is important as\u00a0 enhancement technologies can have different societal and political\u00a0 implications for disabled and non-disabled persons. The discussion\u00a0 about enhancement focuses on therapy of something in need of\u00a0 treatment. But with regard to disability, this debate about\u00a0 enhancement in contrast to therapy and treatment has to be re-thought\u00a0 and re-contextualised. Hence, the conference takes as its starting point the view that it is\u00a0 socio-politically as well as ethically necessary and important to look\u00a0 at enhancement technologies from a \u201cdisability-perspective.\u201d In the\u00a0 context of historic developments and the intersection of medicine and\u00a0 economy, enhancement technologies will be discussed from several\u00a0 different scientific perspectives. The conference is organised as an\u00a0 interdisciplinary dialogue and aims to provide an open forum for\u00a0 discussion and networking. This approach towards enhancement\u00a0 technologies is necessary, as the field of enhancement is an\u00a0 increasingly important area of intervention into life and the body.\u00a0 The conference will be the first international meeting to bring\u00a0 together Disability Studies, Science, Technology and Society Studies\u00a0 and Ethics. The following are some of the questions that will be discussed: * To what extent and in what way does consumerism influence the\u00a0 current debate about enhancement technologies? \n* Which problems arise from this understanding of enhancement\u00a0 technologies for disabled and non-disabled persons and consumers of\u00a0 these technologies? \n* What are the consequences of enhancement technologies for\u00a0 disabled persons? \n* Is the \u201cupgrade\u201d an upgrade from old established norms or is a\u00a0 \u201cnew normal body\u201d created? \n* Who is excluded by both starting points of enhancing the human\u00a0 being? \n* Do enhancement technologies carry a risk of excluding certain\u00a0 groups within society, such as disabled persons? \n* How can consumerism be embedded in an ethical framework? \n* What role does normativity play? \n* What new possible forms of exclusion and inequality on several\u00a0 levels might occur as a result of using enhancement technologies?\u00a0 Questions such as these make it quite clear that the conference is a\u00a0 necessary and important way of approaching enhancement technologies\u00a0 that already have implications for both human beings and for society.

{"date": "2009/07/30", "body": "We are free to view life from many possible angles. I think I am making my way into singledom with grace. Those of you who have followed this blog might have noticed some soul searching buried within some of these posts. A surgery, a husband leaving, and a vast new expanse of what-ifs and a nasty bit of weight gain (okay, that\u2019s the vanity part of me\u2026I gain weight when I\u2019m down as opposed to you lucky ones that lose piles of it), and I finally got to another tipping point \u2014 my life has to go on and it may even get a lot better. I did the sleeping thing. The \u201cdon\u2019t want to get out of bed\u201d thing. I did the crying and the grieving. These are the things that one does when a relationship has been an important part of your life.\u00a0 I did what I had to do until I realized that I had to put a time limit on it. If all of our pain and suffering is created by how we view our present circumstances, I thought I\u2019d better change the view. So I decided to take my first trip alone since my separation. And it was life-changing. Funny how getting out of the confines of your daily existence pats you on the shoulder to remind you again of who you really are. I quite enjoyed traveling on my own, meeting really nice people on my recent biking trip from Prague to Vienna. The flight was wonderful on Austrian Air. It exceeded my expectations as a chef was on board and served very good food. I was excited to use my German again \u2014\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t used it in over fourteen years which was the last time I spent living in Germany. At first, I missed sitting there next to my husband as this symbolized a turning point for me. I briefly wished he was there to share this with me, as we had traveled so much together and he was a good travel partner. But I soon eased in to this new reality that this would be my first major European trip on my own again just as before I met him. I relaxed into my seat and decided to let the ride just take me along. I had been studying in Europe before Henry. I was learning new languages. I had many friends from around the world. I sensed I would be coming full circle. I noted how I was adapting to my days on my own, and to meeting new people with ease. I recognized that I could ride at my own pace without having to slow down or keep up with my partner. This Es-\u201ctella\u201d got her cadence back. I felt vivacious and social. If you\u2019ve seen the movie \u201cHow Stella Got Her Groove Back,\u201d you\u2019ll get it.\u00a0 Divorce can make you realize how you may have lost yourself in the process of giving yourself up a little too much. No one should have to go that far, but more often than not, we do without being conscious of it. Sometimes we do it because we believe that\u2019s what love is. The lesson may be in the need to keep track of ourselves as partners and individuals within a marriage \u2014 to become conscious and honest about who we are and what we want and be accepted for it. I think partners need to regularly check in with one another and definitely share some major interests. Aside from my mini post-divorce evaluation here, I have to laugh at some of the things I do when I\u2019m on a trip alone \u2014 taking pictures can be a little tough. It\u2019s hard to get the background in with your face close up to the lens which tends to expand your face like a blowfish.  But hey, I had to have a picture to prove I was there!\u00a0 The trip reminded me of the pace of life, the ups and the downs. But most of all, it introduced me again to the self that got lost because I never fit into the box I was asked to fit into (except for the distorted picture frame\u2026okay\u2026there are advantages of having a partner too!). Let me get to my metaphorical point: I began my first cycle day with a crash. Yep, day one I had a whole two-minute ride! As I traveled up a steep climb, not able to figure out the new-ish gears (duh me \u2014 I couldn\u2019t locate them as they were at the front and the back of the handle), and my feet were strapped in so I couldn\u2019t get them out quickly enough. I could not change gears and I lost control of the bike and fell into a bit of a long ditch\u2026.on and over my head. As I fell over and over again, it was one of those circumstances that you can see yourself and do nothing about it. I thought I was screaming on the way down, but a Czech lady (the only person who spoke English that day in Central Bohemia), told me she could barely hear me at all asking for help. I was in a state of shock and enough pain (I am still feeling it to this day two weeks later) to warrant a 911 call and a trip to a Bohemian hospital. A testament to Czech hospitality, the woman offered to stay with me the entire day to translate to the doctors when she was really supposed to be spending vacation time camping with her sons. As I lay in the ambulance, all muddied and covered in grass, I was wondering why this was happening to me after such a harsh two years. I was really ready to feel exceptionally sorry for myself. I mean, this was to be the \u201clife-changing\u201d trip and here I was down again. The only person I could think of was Adam, for if I had really hurt myself, I would have potentially made him suffer too. Luckily, after it was confirmed I was not likely to be a Natasha Richardson case, we began to laugh and act silly. So a crash can be a blessing. I made a new Czech friend, renewed my faith in humanity (and my resilience),\u00a0 and got to know my guide, Darius, for about six hours. I became close to two complete strangers. And it made sense that we became so close \u2014\u00a0 a brusque Czech nurse stripped me down virtually naked while men were walking in and out of the examination room. When we asked for a gown, the nurse literally threw a small square of\u00a0 paper towel over my groin. I mean, you just cannot take your self too seriously when there (seem to be)\u00a0 no other options. I had to rest the following day, but I still wanted to get to know my new bike-mates, so I joined them for lunch at a farm. I was anxious to get back in the saddle, so the day after, I did just that. There was nothing that was going to stop me now. I rode and rode at such a pace and made it past the town square. At that point, as I was riding down the highway back towards Prague and felt something was amiss. I figured our guides likely wouldn\u2019t want us to be taking the traffic route. After failed attempts to find my way, I called Raphael and asked him where I was. He told me to make it back to the square and at this point, I took enough of a break for this shot. Yet, I enjoyed getting lost. I felt satisfied for having tried to find my way, discovering routes I would not have seen otherwise. So, while no one ever gets lost on a straight road, no one might ever discover something interesting from one\u2019s mistakes, either. It began to pour rain on us but I wasn\u2019t planning on stopping soon. I was motivated to test my will, my strength, and dag-nam-it, to jump start my twenty pound weight loss (an added benefit I hoped) to shed the guard and vulnerability that became my new weight. I think it\u2019s significant to talk about this for many women. It becomes not only a health issue, and not just a vanity issue, but an issue of what is happening to us on the inside. Some of us pack it on like a shield for the blows we are taking. Sometimes we have no energy to spare when so much of it is being spend on the shock and healing. Yet now, life is about a lot of shedding to find the woman that has been buried and guarded for a while now. Nine months after separation, it is time for a rebirth. Our group rode the next day in Austria toward the Wachau region. It was stunningly beautiful and a clear day. The hills were very much alive in my lungs as I realized that when I returned back to Toronto, I would have some serious hill-training to do. I made it up the hills, but this is when the stronger cyclists could really catch up to me and where I would fall behind. I\u2019ve had my heart-rate measured many times and I\u2019m lucky that I have an athletes heart (my resting heart rate is just under 60 beats per minute). So I guess I\u2019m telling myself that really, I\u2019m all out of excuses. I cut my hair before this trip. I don\u2019t know why because I actually prefer it long \u2014 more like this:\u00a0  I think it was also a part of my shedding. Separation is a good time to re-evaluate everything on your plate. I\u2019ve looked at all the jobs I\u2019ve had to do, and all the stress to determine that the priorities are making sure Adam is okay, managing his programs, team and education as well as focusing on keeping myself healthy and working on that which is important to me. The rest has to drop away in order to do a good job at the things I believe to be important right now. The shedding is for health and well-being. This is not just about being attractive, but it\u2019s about feeling the best I can about myself. This is why cycling was exceptional for me: it enabled me to challenge myself in a way that had meaning beyond just aesthetics.\u00a0 This is why I wonder why I\u2019ve never taken an active vacation before, and this will surely not be the last time. I\u2019m already looking into hiking this summer, and I\u2019m cycling every weekend now just outside of Toronto. It has given me more energy for Adam as well. I can\u2019t say enough as a divorced mother, how the guilt can keep creeping in: am I doing enough for him; am I keeping up with his curriculum; am I on top of his team; is he getting the best from me? The sense of obligation for a child, and a special needs child are immense. For seven years, I\u2019ve spent my life completely devoted to my wonderful little boy. And feeling down and out the past nine months, I realize that Adam needs and deserves a strong and happy mother. I may take a bit more time for myself now, but in the end this will benefit him. Already, I\u2019ve taken him cycling. Every day he asks to use his bike. As I become more active, I envision Adam become more so as well. My goal is that Adam can one day bike with me and participate more and more with mom in the activities we can enjoy and share together. I think it is no coincidence that many men and women who have ended their long-term relationships must take a life-changing trip. Frances Mayes bought a property in Tuscany for heaven\u2019s sake! While I can\u2019t just take off and leave Adam to buy a new property in another country, there is no reason not to expand my own, as well as Adam\u2019s horizons. The feeling of expanding is liberating. Life is not just about Toronto, Torontonians (I have a few things to say about the city I was  born in for the people don\u2019t exactly have the \u201cgemutlichkeit\u201d I am more comfortable with). Life that is  out there  and can put the  back here  into a clearer and more positive perspective. When we reached Vienna all sweaty from a bike ride on a 35 degree celsius day, we toured the city a bit and reached the Goddess of Wisdom which I ran right up to for a photo opp, taken my a fellow single lady from Edmonton. I realized that maybe I have finally learned what\u00a0 others might learn earlier, and others still may never learn at all \u2014 that wisdom comes from experience and that the way we succeed in life is by how we adapt and respond to the life that happens to us. We can choose to respond negatively or positively to everything that happens to us. For it happens all right \u2014 in sickness, health, disability, divorce, and so much more. These in and of themselves are not failures and tragedies. The tragedy is if we never learn to adapt at all. \u201cLife is not the way it\u2019s supposed to be, it\u2019s the way it is,\u201d says Virginia Satir. \u201cThe way you cope is what makes the difference.\u201d So thanks to my guides, my new bike friends \u2014 the incredibly kind people who made my journey something I will never forget.

I believe with all my heart that there is a place for Adam \u2014 \u00a0many places among us all where he will contribute greatly. I believe it so much, \u00a0I joined the Critical Disability Studies Department at York University; to help make the dialogue as prominent, if not more so, than the research funded for cures.\u00a0 I am at a university which not only has such a department that questions all status quo notions about disability, but also talks fundamentally about social justice. It is so ironic because nearby work the to \u201cfight this terrible disease,\u201d and across the way, a behavioural department seeking to modify undesirable autistic behaviour. It\u2019s an interesting mix, this microcosm of the world the UNIVERSE-CITY. (University was never as subdivided as it is today. The focus used to be on studying everything so one had a universal knowledge \u2014 sort of like a renaissance-man sort of body of knowledge where one area of study would inform the other. Scholars often note the dumbing-down of a university education with areas of specialty. This is what the Critical Disability Studies Department does not do. It culls from philosophy, history, sociology, law, culture, art and more to study disability).

{"date": "2009/04/12", "body": "I don\u2019t mean to rain on your Easter Parade. Or for that matter, your Matza Brei. It is another religious holiday again and I wish everyone peace and happiness as you celebrate with your friends or families. Also, I would like to think of the vast majority of people who have no place to go today, who have no friends or families, or at least have not been invited by them to eat at their tables. Religion and holidays tend to make me question everything that has to do with religion. I have seen and experienced unjust things on the \u201choliest\u201d days of the year, for man cannot, by his very nature, live up to these expectations created not by God, but by man \u2014 the leaders of religions.  I listen to people who won\u2019t eat pork, but will eat a cheeseburger or shellfish, when their religion bans it. I am very interested to listen to the concept of \u201cobservance,\u201d and \u201ctradition,\u201d but am equally interested at how individuals modify practice in order to suit their own needs. Religion has come to be something we consume and like all consumption, it eventually leaves us empty. So what is it that we hang on to under the religious umbrella?  I can think of one thing: family and friends. We all want to be connected to each other. Religious holidays can sometimes force us to do it. But when the holiday is over, then what? I am concerned that what we lack is not religion, but connection and spirituality. That last word is so overused. It is sold on video tapes and spirituality is often tied in with some aspect of \u201cbecoming successful,\u201d in a monetary sense \u2014  get in touch with yourself and the money will follow,  and usually you can find some book that links in getting in touch with yourself and success in business in seven easy steps. But spirituality it isn\u2019t concerned at all with money, achievement, success. It is concerned with love. Sometimes the money will follow and sometimes it will not. But even if it doesn\u2019t, one can feel so filled and complete by doing the things we love. Love is about connection, a deep connection to everything around us so that we realize we are never alone. \u201cThe Hindu-Moslem-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist believe about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint John: \u2018Let us love one another, for love is God and everyone that loveth of born of God and knoweth God.'\u201d  (From Bell Hooks, All About Love: New Visions, p. 75). Religion is the most segregating and alienating aspects of human life. And  that  is my humble opinion. It does not urge people to act out of love, but instead act out of pity. It says you will have a place in God\u2019s kingdom if you do \u201cgood acts,\u201d even if you just throw money at someone or some cause. Yet, it is the most selfish way to act.  Instead, if we view God as a power within us, the power of love that transcends us, we are living in the here and now, fully, with dignity, love, and respect for all life. It means that when we love others as ourselves, we try to engage with them. I hope we can all decide not to hide behind the matzah and the Cross, but come out and treat others with love and kindness. Seems to me the world and all its creatures are so in need of this action, above all else, for John says, \u201c\u2018anyone who does not know love is still in death\u2026\u2019 All awakening to love is spiritual awakening.\u201d I know this to be true as far as Adam has awoken something very special within me. If someone is suffering in not being accepted by a person or a religion, or is experiencing extrication of any sort, let us all try to listen and share. Act out of love,  not  to save ourselves a place in heaven. For ultimately, we ARE each other\u2019s pain, suffering and struggles. We are all one.

{"date": "2009/09/30", "body": "Recently, John Travolta admitted his recently deceased son Jett was autistic: Travolta recounted in last week\u2019s testimony how he tried to revive Jett, 16, who had fallen after a seizure in a family vacation home on Grand Bahama island. The actor also publicly acknowledged \u2014 for what is believed to be the first time \u2014 that Jett had autism. News of the testimony sparked an ambivalent reaction from the autism community. \u201cI ran downstairs with my wife to help my son,\u201d Travolta said Sept. 24, according to The Associated Press. In his testimony, he said he and his wife Kelly Preston were awakened by a nanny around 10:15 a.m. Jan. 2, 2009, the day of Jett\u2019s death. Travolta said when he went downstairs, another caretaker was doing chest compressions and he began administering breathing help. The actor testified that his son Jett was autistic and suffered seizures every five to 10 days. He said the seizures would last 45 seconds to a minute and Jett typically slept for 12 hours after each one. \u201cHe was autistic. He suffered from a seizure disorder,\u201d Travolta told the jury when asked about his son\u2019s condition. Looking at pictures of Mr. Travolta, I feel for the family deeply. Perhaps because of my own recent strain of going through divorce and watching Adam go along with us, maybe it has sparked some deeply painful feelings for me. Thinking of Adam\u2019s future, as we must do when we go through a divorce even more so than ever, and we have to consider all the possibilities of epilepsy as well.  Going through all of this and reading stories about the Travolta family (I could not imagine having to go through this in the public eye) I have compassion for them and all the families who are not in the public eye \u2014  ABA, RDI, I really don\u2019t care. I care about the rights of our children. I care about not denigrating them by saying they are \u201cless than\u201d or \u201ca fate worse than cancer,\u201d because political exaggerated political sound-bites (even if there is an snippet of truth about the struggle) does not benefit anyone or any cause. We all must deal with the  daily care, the worries, the strain on the family as well as on autistic people as a community. And I still believe that society does not yet have a healthy view of disability or autism and  that  needs real work and evolution. But I have compassion. I have compassion for those parents who are in depression because of autism. I used to be a more vocal activist (that may not change but may change it\u2019s form), but the school of hard knocks has made me realize that my way of coping with Adam and non acceptance (of me as well as of Adam), was with activism. As I\u2019ve reflected over the past year, activism for many people (like me) is a way of coping with crisis that might otherwise have sent me into a place where I might not have been able to function. My nature was also a part of activism \u2014  I was not about to give up on a child that, despite some hardships, is still pure joy to me. Some activism is harsh and negative, on both sides of the political spectrum. It leaves us with less energy rather than more. In real life, when we  have a strong opinion, we will be met with opponents. There is a healthy way to debate and an unhealthy one. There are rules of engagement as there are in war, when the going gets really tough. Using children for the sake of angling is not okay. I prefer to read the blogs and writings of parent and autism activists who can see both sides of the experience.  I say this with the recent report on the Travolta family because I want to support what they have gone through and know the kind of love they must have had for Jett and the pain of the loss of him, in the midst of what I imagine to be an oncoming political agenda to use the family in a most difficult time, rather than a simple compassion (not pity) for them. I just do not think the time is right. Joy Behar and others on The View  talked about why John Travolta did not come out earlier about his son\u2019s autism. About a couple of years ago, I too came out rather harshly on Mr. Travolta in my older Joy of Autism blog for not \u201ccoming out.\u201d But Joy, I think said it right. It\u2019s up to the family. It would be my hope (and is obviously my decision as Adam\u2019s mother) that more parents will understand that to advocate for inclusion and acceptance means we have to \u201ccome out.\u201d But Joy is also right by noting that the labeling aspect can limit our children to meaningless sound-bites, where popular representations and culture whittle down our children\u2019s individuality and abilities as well as real challenges. As far as Adam and I are concerned, we walk the fine line everyday. As his mother, it is my job and choice to advocate for him to attend any program that I believe he would enjoy, excel, or where he has a right to be with his community and to learn. He is different and it is not appropriate for people to put the onus on Adam to \u201cbe like\u201d other children. Rather, the onus is on us to quiet our expectations, and live with everything Adam can do and offer and to pick up quietly and patiently on what he can do in order to nurture him. So \u201cits a fine balance,\u201d as Joy said,  between revealing and not revealing. But I\u2019ve laid my bets on revealing for the sake of a better, more accepting world. And as I learn about autism acceptance more everyday, I also am beginning to learn how to accept myself, my evolution as an autism mom, a person with strengths and limitations, and an autism activist.

{"date": "2009/04/25", "body": "\u00a0 April, 25, 2009, Chicago Tribune: Days after Chicago police promoted their expanded training for dealing with people with autism, a teen with the disorder was allegedly struck by an officer who ignored the family\u2019s pleas that he was a \u201cspecial boy.\u201d While Chicago police refused to discuss the incident, relatives of Oscar Guzman detailed the alleged assault and said it was an example of why more officers need to be trained in handling people with special needs. Guzman, 16, was standing on the sidewalk Wednesday night, taking a break from working in his family\u2019s fast-food restaurant in the\u00a0Pilsen\u00a0neighborhood. He was watching cars go by when a police cruiser pulled up and two officers began asking him questions, his family says. Guzman didn\u2019t understand the questions, said his sister Nubia, 25, and looked down, away and eventually began walking away. Diagnosed with moderate autism at age 4, he doesn\u2019t like confrontation, his sister said. \u00a0 This story comes on the heels of the other incident in Newfoundland several days ago, where an autistic boy was arrested for walking. Due to the difference in his gait, the officers thought he was drunk. In both instances (see previous post) officers deny the allegations, excusing as \u201can honest mistake,\u201d or \u201cnot commenting until further investigation.\u201d If these statements don\u2019t infuriate parents and autistic people, I don\u2019t know what will. Seems to me that our society values deceipt (covered up as \u201chonest mistakes\u201d and \u201cfurther investigations), more than honesty and goodwill. In this Chicago incident, the report states that Easter Seals gave them a training list. Sounds like paper to me. If we don\u2019t get autistic people in there training our police, and some parent allies as well, I\u2019m not sure a document will do the trick.

{"date": "2009/04/20", "body": "There\u2019s nary a moment when I won\u2019t find Adam engaged in some new passion. Unlike the so-called \u201cstatic\u201d nature of supposed autistic interests and fascinations, I find Adam\u2019s interests variable and ever-evolving. Lately, he loves puppets, faces, art (he\u2019s an excellent artist), making faces, swimming, the ocean, and most of all, reading cookbooks and then, cooking. He has always enjoyed cooking, but now that he has better coordination, cooking becomes more fun. I thought of this when I traversed upon this website:   http://www.mywire.com/pubs/Lets-Cook/     Adam deciding what he wants to eat at Tony Roma\u2019s We\u2019ve always wrote out the recipe in visual form for Adam to follow, and I know many parents employ this structured approach which works very well. For those of you who are new, you might want to check it out.  It\u2019s a good step to break down other creative projects as well, and might give parents some ideas. Adam used to be the young boy who wouldn\u2019t have much of an attention span. He used to \u201cobsess\u201d over his alphabet and numbers, and love to watch videos over and over again, and we expanded his interests by using his own and also allowing him to just be with his own. While he likes the alphabet I once never imagined, in his early days, when he wouldn\u2019t  need  the alphabet anymore (in the calming sense or as a restricted interest). I could have obsessed over this as a parent and let it (excuse the pun) eat me up. Now, we watch little tv and spend our days reading, making things, going out, going to the theatre, playing and visiting friends, discovering new toys and yes, in the pool of our activities, there is still a lot of swimming.  I keep wondering how to relay this to a new parent of a young child who has just received an autism diagnosis. How do you talk to parents about how life  will be ? It is a question that many of us \u201colder\u201d parents think about a lot. There is no way, I have concluded, to offer advice except to speak of our own path and acknowledge that everyone has their own journey. My life with Adam is different than I thought it would be before I had Adam or before he was diagnosed. Yet today, as we\u2019ve simply lived our lives, we no longer fret our days away. We just do. We just live. Only time and learning to live with Adam as a member of our family who as GIVEN so much to us, has it mellowed me. One could read this journey by going back to the early days of my blog as I observed prejudice, among so many other injustices. There comes a point, unless it is outright cruel and pointed, that one becomes less angry and understands that the only way to social justice and acceptance is to carry on with a level of determination and constancy. To live peacefully is our ultimate aim. To accept autism isn\u2019t to accept in order to cure or \u201crecover\u201d (a silly word used as a curtain to hide the word \u201ccure\u201d). Acceptance means to leave what is and get on with living.

{"date": "2009/04/28", "body": "\u00a0 I\u2019ve been reading the thousands of pages of Adam\u2019s journals I\u2019ve written and kept track of over the past seven years. It\u2019s a lot of tracking. I\u2019ve tracked everything from the structure of our days, the logs of his work and progress, his first \u201csteps\u201d in every aspect of his development, those early ABA charts, other progress reports, my to-do lists\u2026.I still survived on severe sleep deprivation (Adam never slept through the night), life obligations, taking care of four other step children (I always felt guilty at having to ask them to quiet down when Adam came around not knowing that Adam was autistic and extremely noise sensitive at the time), autism activism and advocacy, three of my own surgeries and three of Adam\u2019s (ear and dental), and of course, my own struggle with accepting the various aspects of the journey. I have so much paper that I am quite surprised and fascinated that I look back on those old days as no big deal. Yet, one can say that in retrospect. I could tell parents all about acceptance and the journey, but each of us has to go through the years and experience ourselves. When I write like this, I have no idea if it fully sinks in to a \u201cnew\u201d parent. There is reading, absorbing and then there is knowing.\u00a0I can see it through my notes, all the queries, all the research I did, all the intensive time I spent observing and playing with Adam. I see who I was and who both Adam and I have become. Other than pejorative referencing of autism as illness, and of course, dangerous therapies that risk a child\u2019s health, well-being and life, I can discuss autism with so many parents with different attitudes, which is the gift of time. I meet parents who have taken a different route, who think differently than I do, and in most cases, it\u2019s pretty much okay (again, unless they want to describe my son as of lesser value and do not accept him, then get out of the way). \u00a0 We are all on the same route taking different paths. Many of us see things differently. There is still work that needs to be done; questions on the nature of what it means to be human and a full acceptance of our children by and in every facet of society. \u00a0I do not think that our kids need to change themselves in unnatural ways (an autistic person will always be autistic) in order to fit in, for being a part of this world is a constant compromise, but one should never compromise one\u2019s true nature. As a woman going through a divorce who has made enormous compromises, this resounds so strongly within me these days. Being a woman in this world somehow draws me closer to others who need that strong sense of acceptance and belonging.\u00a0I know I write as a woman in a particular circumstance, but there are dads out there too who are going through the same journey. I do not want this post to sound this is for  women-only .\u00a0We can only belong when we first accept ourselves. I think I\u2019ve survived it all so far pretty well, maybe even more than \u201cpretty-well.\u201d Yes, I have feelings, and no, it\u2019s really not easy. One doesn\u2019t have to pretend to be strong in order to be strong. Strength comes from not being afraid to talk the truth \u2014 in not being ashamed of being sad, weak, in need of help, in finding the humour in things\u2026 Divorce, cancer, autism, stigma, and I\u2019m still standing. Adam is still happy through it all because mom doesn\u2019t believe that anything less than fortitude, truth, and a positive attitude is warranted in this world. Mom believes that Adam is good enough as he is, and now, as a single person, that  she  is  more than good enough  as she is. She expects Adam to clean up after himself, go to school, continue learning and contributing to the world. I expect no less of myself \u2014 of fulfilling my own purpose. Everyone, no matter what challenge, can press on. We all have a purpose in life that needs to be fulfilled. It is our hope, our inspiration, and our difficult, yet still inspiring, mountain to climb.

Whether you\u2019re planning for retirement, your children\u2019s education, trying to reduce your taxes, or just looking for financial clarity, the process starts here because it will help you answer three key questions: \n \n\u2022\tWhere am I now? \n\u2022\tWhere do I want to be? \n\u2022\tHow do I get there? Please be as thorough as possible. Don\u2019t omit any information \u2013 it\u2019s all important for helping you reach your personal financial goals. Fill the sheet for both you and your spouse.

{"date": "2009/01/11", "body": "Should this blog only discuss autism? I will tell you, I can\u2019t just focus on that. Soon, the old Joy of Autism Blog (down-loadable also by clicking on the PDF file in the right margin) will be published and you will be able to read eight hundred pages about our world as it relates to our lives with autism. Some posts are very specific; others meander for your consideration. I promise, however, to complete three projects this year specifically regarding that are specific to disability and autism: 1.\tI will be completing a paper on single parents of disabled children as it relates to stress, coping, management and quality of life; \n2.\tI will be writing a piece on investment and financial planning for Canadian families with and for disabled people; \n3.\tI will continue the Inclusion Initiative with TAAProject (which in and of itself entails a few projects) \n4.\tI will be enhancing Adam\u2019s curriculum as usual (that\u2019s the major part of my daily life). In addition to my studies at the Critical Disability Studies Department at York U, living and planning for Adam\u2019s life and writing about all that, and now with a specific interest on managing life and our future as a single-parent family, I have this urgent need to muse about our world, perhaps oh so generally that it makes some of you crazy. But hey, everything is connected. As I read  The National Post  this morning, I remind myself why it\u2019s good not to read the papers everyday, but also na\u00efve not to.  Here in Toronto, we have Palestinians protesting on Bloor Street the crisis in Gaza \u2014 police on horses are eerily positioned way too close to home.  In the comments section of the post Mark Silverberg from Toronto eloquently writes on how Israel is \u201closing the PR war\u201d \u2014 referencing an article by Jeet Heer,  Silverberg writes,  \u201cAccording to figures on the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs Website, 1,176 Israelis have been murdered in terrorist and missile attacks since 2000, including 140 suicide bombings killing 543 individuals \u2013 many of these attacks perpetrated by Hamas. Quite impressive achievements by a group Mr. Heer refers to as \u2018a raggedy half-starved guerrilla force whose homemade missiles are usually as dangerous as firecrackers.\u2019\u201d    Silverberg sure has a point here. The media wars influence our thinking in grossly unfair ways. I think of a quote by Golda Meir herself that sends chills up my spine when I think of the media wars on how they influence perception and how all life is truly precious. She said,  \u201cWe can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children. We will only have peace with the Arabs when the love their children more than they hate us.\u201d  I hate reinforcing monolithic ideas \u2014 that  all  Arabs don\u2019t love their children \u2014 I would not let that stereotype go on for the sake of my Arab friends!  But there is a wave of terrorism that uses children and families as human shields. That\u2019s the kind of use that we have to focus on \u2014 not stereotyping an entire people, but focusing on the groups that simply do not accept the right for all of us to live in peace. Meir\u2019s quote may rub some of you the wrong way, but it also rings of tremendous conscience and responsibility in a complicated situation. As I\u2019ve said numerous times in my presentations, there is enough death-talk in this world \u2014 even among many autism \u201cadvocates.\u201d It\u2019s time for more  life talk. Let me go on about what I see in the paper: an article on epigenics on the front page. Sounds nice that we might in utero be able to detect if human beings will develop cancer later in life (the article carefully leaves out people with disabilities, but of course, read between the lines, my friends). I think of my ovarian cancer this year that I caught, thankfully, early.  So, if it was detected in my mother\u2019s womb, might my life have also been prevented??  Are we going to cure it in utero? \u201cIt\u2019s about choice,\u201d says the article. Indeed, I\u2019m an advocate for choice. Yet, there is a point when social pressure is so strong when choice ceases to be a choice. Let\u2019s go to another page. This one really effects me. You see, when my divorce becomes final, I had this idea in my head that I would travel to India. It\u2019s the trip of a lifetime for me. Also front page that continues on the back: all the missing Canadians. Never mind the recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai this past year. That really put a damper on my willingness to travel. But if that didn\u2019t quite do it, this article did called,  Searching for Ani,  and  Anatomy of the Hunt \u2026. \u201cEvery year hundreds of Canadians go missing in other parts of the world. Last year alone, Foreign Affairs opened 413 missing persons files\u2026.\u201d So much for my desire to go to India with a sweet wonderful autistic son at home who really needs his mother.  So you don\u2019t think the news has much to do about autism in what should be a strictly autism blog? I beg to differ.  I don\u2019t go out much since my separation. I am careful about who will be in our lives. I am careful about everything and yet, I am able to connect with thousands of you (2000 to be exact) through The Autism Acceptance Project alone \u2013 never mind blogs and Facebook.  The world is rough out there, and so here we are trying to connect with each other on the Web. In this world that seems to be falling apart at the moment, we must never give up connecting. The enormously wonderful and potentially dangerous power of the web! We have a choice on how to manage this world. We have a choice in the way we report the news and the words we use. We can also keep speaking up against stereotypes if we are to move forward. I reiterate the words of recently deceased Canadian writer June Callwood on page A10 of  The National Post , where the winning design for a park in her honour is proposed to be built between Fort York and the Waterfront. \u201cSubmitted by the firm gh3, it literally articulates a quote the author and journalist gave in her last interview before her death. A voice wave of \u2018I believe in kindness,\u2019 will be translated into a \u2018sinewy path that runs north and south through the clearings in an urban forest that will be planted with native Canadian tress\u2026.\u201d So you don\u2019t think there\u2019s any connection between autism, the world, the media, and the way we think about things and the world we forge for our children? It\u2019s ALL I can think about when I read the paper: how do we think about things, each other, and where are we headed?  Thank goodness all that bad news was punctuated with the most important quote of all: \n \nI believe in kindness. I hope the sentiment never gets lost in the propaganda.

{"date": "2009/01/08", "body": "For those of you investigating like me, ways and means to save for our children\u2019s future, in may be worthwhile looking into the newly instigated Canadian RDSP. In addition to the following press release, visit  The Bank of Montreal\u2019s website for more information : New RDSP enables families to save tax-free for future of disabled Canadians By The Canadian Press TORONTO \u2013 Families of people with disabilities will be able to set up tax-free savings plans under a long-awaited measure enacted by the federal government. The registered disability savings plan \u2013 RDSP \u2013 \u201cis about helping bring more independence to families of persons with disabilities, who are facing challenges, particularly financial challenges, when planning their future,\u201d federal Human Resources Minister Diane Finley said in presenting the program Tuesday. The RDSP had been proposed in the Conservative government\u2019s March 2007 budget but became effective only this month. \u201cYou know how government works \u2013 here we are the end of 2008,\u201d joked Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, joining Finley for the announcement in the lobby of a children\u2019s rehabilitation centre. The government estimates 280,000 Canadians are eligible to open RDSPs, allowing parents and others to set aside funds for a child with a severe disability. Ottawa will provide matching grants of up to $3,500 per year, plus a $1,000 bond each year for families with incomes under $37,885. Each RDSP has a lifetime contribution limit of $200,000 from the family and $70,000 from the government. The program is expected to cost Ottawa about $200 million a year in contributions and forgone taxes. Flaherty said the deadline for opening an RDSP and making contributions for 2008 has been extended to March 2. RDSPs are intended for individuals who qualify for the disability tax credit, their families and others. Unlike a registered retirement savings plan, contributions are not deductible. But the money grows grow tax-free and will not be included in taxable income when withdrawn. Income paid out of RDSPs also will not affect federal income-tested benefits, such as Old Age Security, the Canada child tax benefit and the goods and services tax credit. The federal government has negotiated with the provinces and territories, and RDSP income and assets will be excluded from benefit clawbacks in Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and the Yukon. Quebec, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island are exempting RDSP payments from income support calculations up to set limits. In the Northwest Territories, a limited exemption will be allowed. \u201cWe are leading the world in this initiative, and I expect it will be copied in many places around the world,\u201d Flaherty said, explaining that the program\u2019s lengthy lead time arose from the complexity of progressive social and tax policy, including getting other governments onside in not taxing or clawing back the program\u2019s income. Bank of Montreal, the first major financial institution offering RDSPs, said it received about 600 inquiries on the opening day of the program.\n  ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.4.bmo.com/investments/0,4629,35649_62554606,00.html"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2009/01/08/registered-disability-savings-plan/", "title": "Registered Disability Savings Plan"},

{"date": "2009/01/15", "body": "Adam has been hanging out with friends. He has three friends now that he hangs out with on weekends. It\u2019s simply delightful for me to watch him take the hands of his patient little friends (shows that kids CAN be patient, loving and kind), and lead them around to what he wants to play because he can\u2019t always say it. We didn\u2019t use RDI or facilitated play groups, by the way, to achieve this skill. It doesn\u2019t mean we didn\u2019t try those things long ago. We did. We just didn\u2019t keep those \u201cmethods\u201d up. Adam has learned by being engaged with people while being respected when he needs a break from them. He observes. I was thinking about Adam and finding what he loves. We tried a few things over the years \u2014 movies \u2014 those were difficult to sit through. I can name three movies he did sit through from start to finish: Charlotte\u2019s Web \nHappy Feet \nWall-E Movies are harder than believe it or not, theatre. Adam will sit glued to the theatre. So much so, I\u2019ve been able to take him to major productions. He loves to enact too. It makes me think it\u2019s time for a drama class.  He watches videos and he tries so hard to say (he has verbal difficulty) what the characters say. He tries to imitate what they do (he has had motor planning difficulty which is improving significantly). Adam tries so hard and this is his way. So it puzzles me when parents of autistic children take away videos because they believe their children are \u201cstimming\u201d over them. When I watch Adam, the provide some repetitive comfort from an over-stimulating day AND he is desperately trying to learn. As I think about what autistic adults have told me \u2014 using puppets (Adam loves puppets) or \u201cPretending to be Normal,\u201d it reminds me of how we all have to try personas on to find our own. It takes so much effort and I respect Adam\u2019s.  Drama is a really healthy way to explore feelings and one\u2019s SELF.  It\u2019s what I believe is a safe haven for Adam to explore himself and probably the most healthy and accepting way of developing one\u2019s Self overall.  As we\u2019ve grown into adults, don\u2019t we all have stories of pretending to be something that we are not?  By trying certain things that may not feel natural at first, we come back to being who we are meant to be.

{"date": "2009/01/14", "body": "Adam uses certain words frequently that can be rather mysterious for the rest of us to read into. For instance, he uses the word \u201cred\u201d a lot. I\u2019ve considered the words he uses seem to be like emotions he reads, or feelings. Red seems to mean the negative emotions of others. Adam  feels  a lot, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s given much credit for it. If it weren\u2019t for me, this blog and autistic people, and perhaps the patience of a special few, Adam would be written off as nonsensical. Yet, much of his conversation is just as sensory as he is, perhaps we could simplify it and say on a kind of  sensory overdrive,  and as vibrant as a poet\u2019s use of language. So I try to listen and learn. There are a lot of things going on in our lives right now. Today, Adam and I found a new home to live in. I will spend the next few months preparing the house, doing him justice by giving him plenty of transition time. When we moved into our current home, I would bring Adam over for visits every week. We would walk over, check out how the building was coming along, and play ball on unfinished floors.  I plan on doing the same again and it is good advice for any autistic child. First take short visits, then extend them. When Adam is thrown into a new environment, he doesn\u2019t really get used to it until the third day. That seems to be the magic number. It takes him that long to stake out the new joint, figure out its configurations. In the meantime, new places can be very upsetting. As for new things and changes, he is changing too. I wonder how he will express these days of his life (he is to an extent which is private and I will not share). As for the fun stuff,  his new teeth are exploding into his tiny mouth. He sort of stretches his jaw, and to many \u201cexperts,\u201d they would just look at him as if he were stimming, but it\u2019s not a \u201cstim;\u201d it\u2019s a necessity in dealing with the feeling of all those teeth breaking through his gums.  Adam writes a lot more on his own now \u2014 another big change in him this year \u2014 I\u2019d say most of the time at home and all of the time at school. Doing school work is easier to type independently than conversations where he might become distracted and needs my reminding be it a tap on the shoulder or a verbal reminder to keep going. I imagine this to be because doing school work is more concrete than open-ended conversation. But this is what he said recently about his teeth: Me: I can see your front teeth coming in. Adam: tooth coming in. Me: How does it feel? Adam: it feels \nit feels open   \u2014 [now think of it, he has no teeth there at the moment] Me: Can you feel a big tooth coming? Adam: yes it feels jar Me: To mommy, a jar means a container. What does jar mean to you? [I find asking him to define is sometimes easy and often difficult] Adam: jar milk Me: [trying to get him back on track] You say your tooth feels like a jar. That is difficult for me to understand how it feels. Jar is not a feeling. Adam: jar is a feeling yes So as I said, maybe every word and every thing IS a feeling in an autistic child who many researchers and media define as having no feelings at all. In a life that is completely jarring, Adam is doing great. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2009/01/14/jarring/", "title": "Jarring"},

The number of single-person households across the globe is growing at an alarming rate. Struggling with feelings of lonliness and isolation, more and more people are turning to online dating and social networking sites to try and muster up some companionship. Meanwhile, divorce rates are at an all-time high.\u201d \n \nWell heck,  that  explains three posts in one day. Or, if we\u2019re really smart, we can recognize a great economic opportunity when we see it (seeing as how all of you biz guys are freaking out, why don\u2019t you wake up a little bit).

It might be interesting to examine any correlation between online connecting, the Internet and divorce rates, if any. It\u2019s interesting as connection is at an all time Internet high, we are disconnecting from each other moreso in our personal lives. In my neighbourhood anyway, neighbours hardly come out and say hello to each other (except for my one favourite neighbour). No, instead, we connect through Facebook when we are only meters away from each other!

I see thousands of you connecting on Facebook at at  The Autism Acceptance Project.  While it may just be you and I in front of our screens right now, we are at least together in our alone-ness.  All of these social connection tools are a way to connect with each other in an otherwise cruel and dangerous world.  How do we get out from behind our computer screens and connect in person? We do it often the autism community and many other communities with a cause do it too. We write, we are active and we meet up at retreats and conferences. Just check out Autism Hub, all the autism activist groups, the forums, the chat rooms. I think the power of the Internet to connect us in our causes and interests has been a blessing in this confused world at the moment. It will be okay. We will all find our way.

Disability policy around the world effects us all: Disability Groups Send Recommendations to Obama Dear President-elect Obama, Congratulations on capturing the hearts, minds, and hopes of our nation! As grassroots, community-based, consumer-controlled disability organizations, which collectively represent over 50 million Americans with the full spectrum of disabilities, we look forward to working with you and your administration to make cost-effective policy changes to enhance the lives of and restore the civil liberties Americans with disabilities. Attached you will find nine summaries of the top policy issues facing Americans with disabilities. Taking action on your commitment and these policy measures will not only benefit citizens with disabilities, our nation\u2019s wounded warriors, and the ever-growing aging population, it will benefit all Americans and save our government millions of dollars as individuals with disabilities become full participants in society. They include: \u00b7 Employment: Reversing the persistently high percentages of people with disabilities who are not working but are ready, willing and able to work; \u00b7 Education: Increasing access and opportunities for physical activity, and improving quality; \u00b7 Health Care: Improving access and decreasing disparities and inequities; \u00b7 Home and Community-based Services (HCBS): Promoting effective community-based services as alternatives to costly nursing homes and other institutions and increase the FMAP to states; \u00b7 Disability Research: Promoting a quality of life and participation-based research agenda; \u00b7 Civil Rights: Reinvigorating civil rights enforcement, extending access requirements to new technologies, and continuing to restore protections stripped away by hostile courts; \u00b7 Human Rights: Protecting human rights of individuals with disabilities at home and abroad; \u00b7 Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery Needs: Planning, coordinating, and providing resources to support people with disabilities before, during, and after a crisis; and \u00b7 Genetic Science and Technology: Promoting ethical use of new technologies. Like you, we stand and sit on the shoulders of so many who have come before us. As our nation approaches the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 2010, we embrace the disability rights principle, \u201cNothing About Us, Without Us.\u201d For too long others claimed the need to speak for us, but no other group \u2013 professionals or relatives \u2013 speak for us. Additionally, we urge you to embrace the fundamental principles for sustainable change, which are essential elements to building healthy, resilient, empowered communities. As you move forward with deliberate speed and consideration, we urge your administration to: \u00b7 Provide oversight of federal agency public policy, regulatory, and enforcement actions, and collaborate with consumer and community-based disability organizations as partners to better serve the ever-expanding population of more than 50 million Americans with disabilities; \u00b7 Hire qualified professionals with disabilities, who have expertise in policy areas, throughout the administration, including a Special Assistant to the President on Disability Policy; \u00b7 Include individuals with disabilities in policy formation in all areas addressed by the administration, and integrate representatives of our community on all advisory boards of all major agencies; \u00b7 Provide services that serve people with disabilities across the life span, from cradle to grave, and all those with increased needs for health care, health promotion, and long-term services and community-based supports; \u00b7 Incorporate consumer-directed services and include consumers in policy development; \u00b7 Embrace the disability experience as part of culturally competent policy and diversity at all levels of planning, policy formulation, implementation, and evaluation; and \u00b7 Focus on \u201cuniversal design\u201d as a cost-effective innovative way to enhance the quality of life and level of participation of all Americans in community life and incorporate it into infrastructure changes in the economic stimulus package so we upgrade the infrastructure for all to use; Thank you for your support of the need for the federal government to be \u201cdiligent about making sure the states enforce the rights affirmed by the Olmstead decision.\u201d Enabling people with disabilities to live independently in their own homes and communities, rather than being forced into costly Medicaid-funded nursing homes and other institutions will ensure civil liberties, enhance the quality of life and full participation of all Americans by creating stronger, sustainable communities of inclusion and acceptance to honor the 10th Anniversary of the Olmstead decision. As a community of individuals with disabilities, we ask for nothing more than what other Americans expect and already have. We seek inclusion. We seek a voice for the disability rights message in the change you create. As you create more jobs for Americans, include jobs for Americans with disabilities. As you improve education for America\u2019s students, include students with disabilities. As you improve the healthcare system, include the healthcare needs of individuals with disabilities. As you restore civil rights to Americans, include the civil rights of individuals with disabilities. To paraphrase your now immortal words, \u2013 We are not a nation of disabled and non-disabled Americans. We are the United States of America. We stand ready to work with you and look forward to an opportunity to discuss our priorities with you personally in the coming months.

Authentic strength isn\u2019t found in our armor but at the very pit of the wounds each of us manages to survive. As one widow put it\u2026\u2019Strength doesn\u2019t mean being able to stand up to anything, but being able to crawl on your belly a long, long time before you can stand up again.\u2019 Transformation is in our wiring,\u201d says Mark Matousek in  When You\u2019re Falling, DIVE. I have been thinking a lot about \u201ccrisis\u201d lately. Cancer, divorce, disability, illness, death. Ironically, these are also the things that keep us from slumber and vibrantly alive. Aristotle called good luck the moment on the battlefield when the arrow hits the guy next to you. It\u2019s a torn-in-half feelings, \u201cpartly shattering, partly sublime.\u201d (Matousek). Most of us will have our share of luck and misfortune. We are meant to experience both as they are temporary, fleeting. \u201cLuck\u201d can come at a great price to either ourselves or to others, so there can never be an enduring sense of satisfaction over it. This is a great way to define how the \u201cacceptance movement\u201d in autism can become kitsch and cliche and end up achieving nothing at all. People think that \u201call acceptance is good.\u201d Acceptance combined with a sugary dose of naivete is not acceptance. Acceptance can look a LOT like denial. I liked Dr. Rachel Ramen\u2019s thoughts in this regard (a physician quoted in Matousek\u2019s book who lived with a \u201cpainful physical condition for fifty years.\u201d): \u201c\u2026\u2019optimism is not required for healing\u2019 \u2026.how liberating is that for those who\u2019ve scrambled to keep their own smiley-face masks in place when what they needed to do was scream?\u201d \u201cIn a dark time, the eye begins to see,\u201d poet Theodore Roethke reminded us. With our illusions of safety exploded, out side the bounds of \u2018normal\u2019 life\u2026new abilities indeed dawn in a person; values, intuitions, skills, perspectives that might seem unnatural \u2014 even perverse \u2014 to those who\u2019ve led more sheltered lives.\u201d (p. 11. Matousek). \n Hmmm\u2026 I believe I was name-called quite a bit BEFORE the terms \u201cjoy and autism\u201d were used by others. Over time, with people who make he effort to come to know Adam and I along our journey, know that there are many struggles that enable us to find the joy in life.   In a neighbourhood I live in which is blanded-down by illusions of security and \u201cnormalcy\u201d, most of us are never open enough to feel the pain to experience,  on voit le soleil.  No matter if you\u2019ve been hit by some kind of crisis, we are suppose to absorb the wounds so that we can live brightly.  Joy is only given to those worthy of their \u201csufferings.\u201d For many of us who have become unmoored, do not be afraid to suffer in order to live.

{"date": "2009/01/22", "body": "In the cold, grayness of a bleak Canadian winter not to mention global climate, a new American President reminds us that hope springs eternal. There is something powerful in a single man who can move millions of people to hope again, and to act for themselves. But let\u2019s not get too trite about hope. In Mark Matousek\u2019s book,  When You\u2019re Falling, Dive , which I\u2019ve read this week, he reminds us that instead, \u201chope is a waifish thing stranded on a lonely cliff, barefoot, tempest torn, eyes concealed behind a blindfold as she reaches her empty hand out toward a harp with only one string.\u201d (p. 73). He is of course is referring to Watt\u2019s painting above. Her fingers strain \u201ctowards an instrument that offers her only chance of music, yet has only one string still intact, as likely to snap as it is to play.\u201d He compares this to life itself and we are the blindfolded members of society, reaching, straining into our next moments knowing that the string might snap in our face. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t reach, you\u2019re not really living,\u201d he says. Baruch Spinoza said hope is inspired by fear. For without fear we would have no hope and without hope, no fear. Spinoza was also not being too trite about hope. He implies that it is only fear that motivates it. Buddhists believe in the duplicity in our lives. It is the struggle and the joy earned, for without walking willingly through hell, we would not reach the other side. It all eludes to the craft of life, of living, really. For if we lost all hope, we would not be able to carry on, and if we did not accept the darkness, we would not know hope or joy or heaven, or whatever you want to call it.  This is \u201cnot the naive hope that everything will be hunky-dory, exactly as life used to be, but the hope that assures us, when things seem darkest, that although it doesn\u2019t look that way now,  something else is also true. \u201d It is also true of perspective. We have one and there is always another. Often, you hear me write on this blog over and over and over again about autism acceptance and joy. More often, I read misinterpreted, glossy if not sickeningly-sweet definitions of what acceptance and joy and even hope means in autism or life itself that concerns me greatly. It concerns me because if expectations are unmet, many children face dangerous consequences, not to mention that parents can remain in an everlasting depression. Expectations are a staid way of existence. My father always told me not to expect anything in life. I really didn\u2019t like this when he said it. I defied him. Until now. Forty-three years later, my father\u2019s irritating wisdoms that I received as a teenager ring not only true, they give me peace as I live and learn. Matousek says, \u201cfixated hope is a problem,\u201d meaning, a desire for a particular outcome in any aspect of life can leave one stuck. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to become hope\u2019s hostage,\u201d he says, \u201cto imprison ourselves in optimism, entrap ourselves through inflexible craving for a premeditated result. We risk spending our time consumed by longing, obsessed with all the things we don\u2019t have and unhappy with what life has chosen to give us.\u201d (p. 75). Buddha believed that all things come to an end. Our children grow up, our families and friends will die, we may gain and lose our fortunes. The wheel keeps turning. As long as we believe things last, then suffering is inevitable.  The Dalai Lama asks us  to keep our hearts open in hell  \u2013 at a time when we are suffering most and when compassion is more difficult. This art of living, this craft as it were, is like \u201cturning poison into a boon.\u201d  The more we remain flexible and become at \u201cease with uncertainty,  \u2018poise amidst shakiness,\u2019 by learning to stay with the broken heart and rumbling stomach and achieving some detente with hopelessness, can we be truly happy,\u201d says American born Buddhist master Pema Chodron. \u201cIn a world of hope and fear we always have to change what is. But when we allow ourselves to feel uncertainty, disappointment, shock, embarrassment, we discover a mind that is clear, unbiased and fresh.\u201d Life and autism and all the feelings and fears and hope that surround it all, is a contradiction. If we can accept this duplicity in all things, this double-ness which is our reality, \u201cacceptance would trump hopelessness.\u201d  Let me relay one more story from Matousek\u2019s chapter where he talks about a teacher in Thailand named Achaan Chah. \u201d In Thailand,\u201d says Matousek, \u201cpeople in this country use therapists or astrologers. One day a father from the town came to Achaan Chah\u2019s monastery, extremely upset, to ask the master how he could possibly live with not being able to protect his children in such a violent world. How could this man, this father, hope to survive his kids\u2019 tragedies, the thousand blows that life would deal them? Achaan Chah lifted a lovely crystal goblet from his side table and help it up to the sun. \u201cI like this glass,\u201d the master said, delighting in the diamond light patterns shining through its thousand facets. \u201cI find this glass very beautiful. When the sun shines through it, there are rainbows. When you test it, it gives a wonderful ring. But I know that this glass is already broken.\u201d The worried father did not understand. \u201cEach time I sip from this glass, I enjoy it,\u201d the master continued. \u201cAnd yet, when a strong wind tips it over or I knock this glass with my elbow and it shatters into a thousand pieces, I will say \u2018Ah, so, it was already broken.\u201d Achaan Chah seemed to be suggesting to the father that were he to love his children in this way, each moment he spent with them would be so direct, and so precious, that there would be no room for regret, no necessity for hope.  \nAnd then there is the girl on the rock with the broken harp.  I like Matousek\u2019s thinking about her and hope as he wonders whether the girl would still want to play the harp with her blindfold off because she would no longer bother to reach seeing that the harp was already broken. \u201cOr whether the girl would still want to play because playing itself is in her nature, knowing that one string can be enough, and if that last string breaks, she can always sing.\u201d I am writing, really, about two things. About a recent and personal loss  and  about autism because I have discovered that life is not that numb comfy place that I tried so hard to protect. Life is about constant change and crisis and comfort and then change again. The more we can roll with the punches and accept the hand we are dealt, be it our children or whatever happens to us in our lives, the more we may actually grow more content with it all. Today, I feel like that girl on the rock. We can live each day and accept and sing, or we can worry and wonder if or when that one string will break. I can\u2019t help but feel a new hope in general \u2014 much of it is self-generated \u2014 perhaps that is what has driven The Joy of Autism since 2005 \u2014 and this post ironically coincides with the recent appointment of a hopeful new President who seems to instill the same idea that we must all keep carrying on. My own personal story is not really about Adam or autism, which I have come to accept now with ease, but of becoming a single mother, not yet anchored, but still savoring each moment during a period that enables me to see things in a new way, that pains me, that makes me stronger to become again, perhaps create, and still no matter what\u2026 sing happy and sad songs as I drift along.

{"date": "2009/06/03", "body": "Virginia Woolf wrote much on the homes where she lived and the homes she wanted. Her husband enabled it too \u2014 if she wanted a place, he would move with her and she would write extensively about the house and its spirit and how she lived (or wanted to live) within its walls. Adam has moved once. As my husband and I were building the house where we now live, I introduced the house to Adam slowly. I took him on the day we tore down the old building that once sat on the land where this new structure we build stands. I took Adam when tractors were about, nails being hammered. I brought Adam for three years before we finally moved in, the final few introductory days playing ball on the floor as the final touches were being made. Yet saying goodbye to the older rickety house we had lived in until he was three years old was very difficult despite the hope and anticipation a new home can bring. As old as that painted white house was, built sometime in the 1930\u2019s, my husband and I had spent many a night in the sun-room out back and still filled the house with the things we hunted for together. I went into labour in that house, walked half a block during labour to realize I couldn\u2019t walk anymore and said a goodbye that day to the house that would quickly change as a new baby filled its walls with both cries and laughter. I do remember that day we returned with our newly born Adam. The house was dark on an early spring morning and I could feel it missed me. Its air was already stale. Yet quickly, Adam filled it up again as he took over all of our living space with baby-things. I also remember the day we moved out for good and Adam stayed with his grandparents. We had moved on a sunny hot day also in a spring season. I remember the first few strange nights introducing myself to the house and the house to me with its new rumblings and gurgles. I never thought I would miss the old white house, but I did. Adam\u2019s first important years were in that house. Still, even though we had moved in, I had forgotten his crib. I could not leave it behind. It was my crib made for me by hand by my own grandmother. It still sat in our old master bedroom, now scattered with dust balls. When Adam fell asleep in the back of my car, I drove up to the old house. It had clouded over and began to rain softly. That may have been the most difficult day, saying goodbye to what it housed \u2014 my first meeting of my stepchildren, my first living with Henry, our wedding and the photos we took inside, and of course, of Adam and the family we had built around him. I am half-living at the moment. I am living in the past and in the future, the present quite a haze of where-to-go-from-here loss and opportunity that divorce sets before me. I am half-married, half-moved as I transition Adam to yet another house and am about to move from the one where I write this post today \u2014 the modern one. The goodbye has been quiet and sad, but it is slow, which is both good and not so good. It is good for Adam as he gets used to the idea that his mother will not be living here anymore, but his dad will move back in.\u00a0 This was the house that started writing projects, The Autism Acceptance Project, with its office overlooking Adam\u2019s trampoline where I would write, create and watch him laugh. I will call myself a nester. I am building a new nest for my baby-bird. It feels lighter, but goodbyes are a necessary ritual, no matter how painful. I will borrow what I found a particularly beautiful paragraph writing by Louise De Salvo on goodbyes: \u201cBut when will the new house become a home? When I\u2019ve organized its rooms, its closets? When I\u2019ve hung our paintings, our positioned our pottery on top of dressers? When I\u2019ve cleaned it top to bottom for the first time? Or will it take time? Or will it take not time, but instead a bread baked, a soup made, a journey returned from, an illness survived, a few pages written, a sweater knit, to make the house feel like home? First, though, I must let this house go. But I can\u2019t. Not yet. I feel like I\u2019ve betrayed this house, for I\u2019m the one who\u2019s leaving. The house can\u2019t go anywhere. It certainly can\u2019t come with me, though at times I have imagined taking it with me, digging it out of the ground, propping it on stout timbers, and moving it, like the houses I\u2019ve seen moved from one place to another on the East End of Long Island. How can I think of letting perfect strangers move through its rooms when it\u2019s sheltered us so well all these years? How can it go from being mine to being someone else\u2019s? And yet if everything about the house can change \u2014 the style of its furnishings, the contents of its cabinets and closets, the color of its walls \u2014 then why have I loved it so exclusively? While I lived here, I foolishly thought no one else ever would. So now, too, I feel like  I\u2019ve  been betrayed, even though I\u2019m the one who\u2019s leaving. About leaving this house, I feel sick inside, like a brute, like I\u2019ve disrespected it, violated it. I feel like I\u2019m abandoning a lover for no good reason. I feel sure the house will miss me, will wish I had stayed on; I feel sure it won\u2019t like the new people, for they won\u2019t understand it and its special needs and endearing quirks \u2014 how it doesn\u2019t like curtains on its windows; how it likes its wood-work cared for; how its stained-glass windows must be treated gingerly; how its roof must be cleared of snow. For this house is not merely a house. It has become imbued with spirit. My spirit. My family\u2019s spirit. When I leave today, I\u2019m sure that I\u2019ll be leaving something of myself behind, something of myself that will never be found again, something that will remain here.\u201d Louise De Salvo,  On Moving:   A Writer\u2019s Meditation on New Houses, Old Haunts and Finding Home Again , New York: Bloomsbury, 2009, (pp. 209-210).

I no longer wish to write specifically about Adam or autism in particular because there are many other things to write about. In 1995, my husband eagerly encouraged me to start this blog and he egged me on, being my most ardent supporter and editor. It was really nice to have that kind of moral support. But now he has left and not for this reason but a general evolution have I reached a new dilemma well worth talking about. Admittedly, for quite some time now, I\u2019ve been uneasy with publishing his words, his accomplishments, or sharing details about Adam.\u00a0 Yet it all seemed for a good cause. In pursuit of attempting to erase stigma about autism and advance opportunities for both Adam and other autistic people, I wanted to be able to tell our story from an atypical point of view. I do not think the motives were (and are still not) at all wrong. I am simply reconsidering the manner in which we write about our autistic children and how we write from the time we receive that initial diagnosis to later on in life when we have all evolved. Perhaps the manner in which we write and expose ourselves has as much to do with the manner in which autism is negatively portrayed in the media and the way we feel that the \u201cstare\u201d (of the disabled in our society, not to mention children) is our fundamental right. Last week, I had posted a photo of my beautiful boy sucking on a lemon. After I had posted it, there was a corresponding sour feeling in my stomach. Something had indeed changed. While I still believe that writing memoir has a real purpose and that meaningful writing on the topic of how must be true, I needed to take the photo down. It was not because of any particular pressure (save for another ignorant comment by John Best which my son does need to be protected from \u2013 any adult who comments on a child should be banned from blogging all together in my opinion), but mostly because Adam is now of the age of self-pride and achievement. He has forged his own life and he is becoming separate from me. This happened from the day he was born, of course. I was not just a mom gushing over her beautiful new baby. I was a mom gushing with new and exciting experience. When Adam was diagnosed with autism at the age of eighteen months, the proliferation of autobiographies and parent memoirs was overwhelming. My response was to participate in the dialogue, in my case, hoping to align more with the introspections and observations of autistic people themselves and to illustrate how I was growing as a mother understanding her autistic son. Other authors were doing it too. I noticed the ones who were \u201ctell-all,\u201d stopping at nothing to protect the privacy of their autistic children, to those who were also more careful and contemplative about the need to tell an important story, what contribution that could make to the service of social justice in a world that struggles to accept those who are different.\u00a0 When I first read Ralph Savarese\u2019s book  Reasonable People: A Memoir of Autism and Adoption , the tension between writing about his son D.J. or not was evident in his entire introduction. Not only does he ask the question about risking his family\u2019s privacy, but Ralph also touches upon the notion between our autistic children and their sudden thrust into general public scrutiny by government programs, educators, testing and the like. \u201c\u2026a key question remains,\u201d writes Ralph. \u201cHaving taken such precautions with strangers, is it reasonable to invade my son\u2019s privacy without changing his name and, thus, obviously my own and Emily\u2019s as well? I\u2019ve agonized over this question, believing in the end that the story of D.J.\u2019s emergence ultimately outweighs these concerns and, as well, that writing under a pseudonym would both undermine what is irrefutably factual \u2013 namely, his emergence \u2013 and inhibit the work of activism I wish this book and its author to perform, however modestly\u2026\u201d  (introduction). Michael Berube in his book  Life As We Know It ,\u00a0 eruditely discusses the dilemma of the private versus the public when our children are diagnosed with a disability. In reading his work, one can\u2019t help understanding the \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em,\u201d phenonmena. This, I believe, is the simplest way of describing my own personal motivations for writing about autism as a response to the negative, stigmatizing, dreary way of viewing, publicizing, representing and treating disability in our culture. In my view, it is a response to a way of looking and an ignorance of  how  we look at things and why. And yet, I hold my son in the highest regard. Not for the purposes of exploitation of a simple idea \u2013 that life can simply be a trite kind of\u00a0 \u201cjoyful.\u201d Such a simple description is to me another kind of exploitation, one I\u2019ve been wrongfully accused of \u2014 in other words,\u00a0 a denial of the problems, challenges and ethical dilemmas we experience on a daily basis. In writing specifically about Adam, I struggle daily with preserving his privacy and dignity, and in an Internet Age, where we are becoming aware of what evil lurks about out there, I am concerned for his safety. Such a discussion on the ethics of writing about our children as parents and the role we play, or do not play, is what I will attempt to discuss over the next couple of weeks. In a writer\u2019s workshop I attended a few years back, I felt certain permission when Asian-Canadian writer Wason Choy addressed the writing of memoir and family as \u201cthey know you are a writer,\u201d so in other words, caution to them!! The proliferation of memoirs and workshops and general popularity is on the upswing. People love reading about people. We love to know that we are not the only ones out there. Yet Adam brings about a different kind of responsibility and questioning in me. In the  United Nations on the Rights of the Child , which I reviewed again today, Article 16 states, \u201cNo child shall be subjugated to the arbitrary or unlawful interference in his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her reputation.\u201d The other week, I had quoted Gloria Steinem who wrote, \u201cMost writers write to say something about other people\u00a0 \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t last. Good writers write to find out about themselves \u2014 and it lasts forever.\u201d\u00a0 As such, I\u2019ve been deliberating on the content of my writing as an autism mom, divorced woman, a woman in general and the like. Where is the line between what I write as my own experience and how others are involved in my perspectives of that experience? In  The Ethics of Life Writing  by Paul John Eakin, the author quotes Janet Malcom who writes, \u201c as everyone knows who has ever heard a piece of gossip, we do not \u2018own\u2019 the facts of our lives at all. The ownership passes out of our hands at birth, at the moment we are first observed\u2026.the concept of privacy is a sort of screen to hide the fact that almost\u00a0 none is possible in a social universe.\u201d So perhaps the best we can do is remain analytical about the way in which we observe and represent. Alice Wexler, in her essay  \u2018Mapping Lives: Truth, Life Writing and DNA,\u2019  discussed Huntington\u2019s disease, which affected her family, and how it functioned as \u201ca textbook stigma for proponents of the US Eugenics Movement in the early 20th century.\u201d (Eakin). \u201cWexler\u2019s polemical purpose in her memoir was \u2018to show one such family, my own, from the inside, rather than as viewed through a clinical or eugenic lens.\u2019\u201d (Eakin, p. 11). In the coming week, I\u2019ll begin to look at some of the autism memoirs written by parents and continue the discussion of what may or may not be exploitative writing (even if it \u201cpositively represents\u201d autism), or writing that continues to explore the tension and the ethical dilemmas of how we represent autism in writing. \u201c\u2026recognizing that life writing in an age of DNA carries risks, Wexler,\u201d writes Eakin, \u201cacknowledges that the revelation of genetic identity can trigger grave social and medical consequences, including the loss of jobs and insurance. Allegiances to privacy and truth\u2026.prove to be in tension; neither stands alone, reminding us that the goods and harms in life come extricably intertwined.\u201d (Intro).

{"date": "2009/03/07", "body": "Are you happy? Just think about how loaded a question that is. Just thinking about it makes me dizzy. The question leads to many others, like what will make me happy? Am I happy now? How do we measure happiness? I\u2019ve done what most people do upon a major life change: I\u2019ve made lists. Wish lists, to do lists, travel lists \u2014 all in the name of happiness. Instead of a list of what makes me happy right here in the now, don\u2019t we all tend to make lists of what will make us happy  if only  or  when we\u2026  I plead guilty. I know that books prescribing ways and means to be happy must be flying off the shelves in contrast to a threatening economic depression. I find the dichotomy quite revealing. Just yesterday, I bought more books on how to be happy right alongside Harvey Dent\u2019s  The Great Depression Ahead.  What an irony! Yet is is a fact that books on how to be happy are popular in times of financial strife. As I must manage my own finances now in the face of divorce, I find myself swallowed by the deluge of material I feel I need to learn about financial markets \u2014 they don\u2019t seem to be making  anyone  happy these days.\u00a0 (In fact, in his  Washington Post article  A Year of Living Gloomily , Weiner suggests we have a proclivity to live negatively ). As an artist, a writer and a creative spirit, I feel sort of overwhelmed by the confusion out there among the very financial \u201cexperts\u201d \u2014 everyone scurrying to be the next correct financial prophet. If too much information leads to stupidity, then we must certainly be on the right path. Money just doesn\u2019t seem to buy happiness outright. Research has shown that as soon as our needs our met, money alone cannot make us happy. British academic Avner Offner said that \u201caffluence breeds impatience and impatience undermines well being.\u201d Just think about all the inattention and information out there. I can\u2019t remember when a person has simply paid complete and utter attention in a deep conversation with me. Minds are drifting in and out of blackberries, wants,  what-must-I-do-next  worries, and to-do lists. So what is happiness, then? Is it an attitude \u2014 that happiness is not the destination, but the journey sort of thinking? I\u2019m enjoying my latest read by Eric Weiner,  The Geography of Bliss.  Just halfway through in one sitting as of yesterday, my flu just easing enough to enable my eyes to focus on the printed word instead of sleeping through the day, I realize that this is all that\u2019s been on my mind since I can remember. Is happiness a \u201cpursuit\u201d or is it an attitude? Is it right here in my lap, or snuggling in the crook of my arm at night before he falls asleep? Or is it \u201cout there\u201d somewhere yet unidentified? As we stimulate an economy in order that we all remain happy (or as we try so hard to hold on to the happiness we equated with consumption),  we might be amused yet confused at what Bhutan has prioritized in its government policy as Gross National Happiness: \u201cIn a nutshell, Gross National Happiness seeks to measure a nation\u2019s progress not by its balance sheet but rather by the happiness \u2014 or unhappiness \u2014 of its people. It\u2019s a concept that represents a profound shift from how we think about money and satisfaction and the obligation of a government to its people,\u201d writes Weiner (p.56) The author then spots a hand-painted sign in a country that otherwise lacks billboards and advertising which reads, When the last tree is cut, \nWhen the last river is emptied, \nWhen the last fish is caught, \nOnly then will Man realize that he can not eat money . (p.57) Hmmm. I feel like putting that sign up on my door. What a great little mantra for a world gone mad \u2014 we Westerners who seem to have lost the meaning in our lives \u2014 and in a time when we face the reality that consumption leads down a road of despair with scarce enough resources to survive (if we keep along the same path say the environmentalists), let alone be happy. How much do our expectations infringe upon our potential for happiness or mere contentment? I mean, I am content with a book in my hands that I enjoy reading. I am content watching a good movie. I can become ebullient when dancing, or sharing a deep and attentive conversation with another person. I think that\u2019s it for me \u2014 a contentment and connection with a person or myself in a moment. I can be content with Adam just as he is. We are going to the art gallery today and we will simply enjoy each other\u2019s company with no grand affair. I can be happy even when I am going through crisis with the mere realization that there are moments that make us happy within more difficult times, like the times I am going through right now. For me, even these simple revelations are the essence of happiness. Weiner writes, \u201cIn America, high expectations are the engines that drive us, the gas in our tanks, the force behind our dreams and, by extension, our pursuit of happiness.\u201d Just in that one word alone \u201cpursuit\u201d I am exhausted. It truly doesn\u2019t make me happy \u2014 this race to find what makes us happy. I don\u2019t believe that the grass is greener on the other side, as the saying goes. Something deep inside me has always told me that my happiness has to do with my outlook on life. It\u2019s something that I always have to re-confront. Weiner interviews Karma Ura, a part of the Bhutan government\u2019s think tank. Karma (I like his name for I believe we reap what we sow), says, \u201cMy way of thinking is completely different [than an American\u2019s way of thinking]. I have no such mountains to scale; basically, I find that living itself is a struggle, and if I\u2019m satisfied, if I have just done that, lived well, in the evening I sigh and say, \u2018it was okay\u2026.\u2019 Even if you have achieved great things, it is sort of a theatre playing in your mind. You think it so important, but actually you have not made such a difference to anyone\u2019s life\u2026We like to think we really made a difference. Okay in the week\u2019s scale it may have been interesting. Take another forty years, I\u2019m not so sure. Take three generations, and you will be forgotten without a trace.\u201d (p. 65) Like Karma, I think about death every day. Like him, I find it \u201csanitizing,\u201d not morose. I think about it to remind me of the pleasures and gifts of today. I find that the work of being happy much too exhausting. Rather, the realization of what I have today, seems to bring me unadulterated contentment. I hope your day brings you contentment, even if it\u2019s just washing the dishes, walking outside, reading a book or\u2026going to the art gallery. Today, I\u2019m not Elizabeth Gilbert of  Eat Pray Love , or Eric Weiner of  The Geography of Bliss  \u2014 searching somewhere  out there  to find happiness. I am living as if the life and the things I go through are contributing to my happiness. The plain old subtle day-to-day stuff that is actually, quite special depending upon one\u2019s view of things.  My life is about Adam these days, navigating a difficult time, and realizing what makes me happy, or at least content, right here at home. The geographies I navigate are living inside not just me, but in all of us. We don\u2019t need to really travel that far.

{"date": "2009/03/06", "body": "It is no secret that I am going through a separation. In going through the process, I get to meet with more people who impute their thoughts and meaning about what it must be like to have an autistic child.  I hear a lot of emapthy, sometimes sympathy, and it starts to make me uncomfortable.  I mean, when Diane Sawyer interviewed Kristina Chew of  Autism Vox  and now  Change.org , and said that joy is a way of masking sorrow, I was really upset with her. We all have our own journey to take. In writing my book, I have to review old notes and diaries and come face-to-face with myself. I can see where the cracks may have begun to form in my life. If hindsight is 20/20, I can see clearly now.  There was definitely that \u201cmama bear\u201d in me \u2014 no one was going to discriminate against my child!  Yet, there was also a great sense of isolation and aloneness in those early days. There was a great deal of misunderstanding. There was confusion on my part with the early messages about Adam\u2019s autism in terms of how he played and what I should or should not be doing. There was a great deal of guilt and a heavy load of responsibility I felt upon me.  In all of this confusion, I lost friends too. I don\u2019t think they understood this journey I was on. When I became \u201cActivist Mom,\u201d I gained some friends, but also lost some and was called \u201ctoo militant,\u201d which only gave them greater reason to abandon me, instead of diggning deeper to discover what someone has to go through to become an activist.  Activism does not have to be militant, so I want to reveal that it is disconcerting to hear the two as synonyms, and I think there is a huge gap in understanding the journey parents must go on that the \u201coutside world\u201d (meaning families with children without disabilities) simply do not understand. As I look back on my early words when Adam was not quite two years old but just diagnosed, I was so distressed.  I was turning 40 years old. I was being told that autism was \u201cnot a sprint but a marathon.\u201d I had written that I felt like \u201ca part of me had died.\u201d I had written that I \u201cenvied other families with typical children who were able to talk to them easily about their experiences when Adam could not.\u201d  I was angry when people went up to Adam and gave me distressing looks or yelled in his face as if he could not hear them. I was pressured to accept the comparisons between an ADD child and an autistic child \u2014 and in many senses, I still think you cannot compare these experiences at all.  People were trying hard to be my friend by making my family experience familiar through comparison. It\u2019s an understandable thing to do because it is one\u2019s segue to understanding and empathy.  But really, there was no adequate comparison that could match my experience. The truth of the matter is, I experienced the pain of having a child diagnosed with autism just as much as any other family. I have a written record of it on my desk right now. I can see how isolated I felt, how I didn\u2019t get the support I really needed, and how I fought to stay afloat all by myself. There was no one out there to really support us without pitying us, and I resented that too. Pity was not going to get Adam included in the programs and schools he needed to be participating in.  Adam was my life buoy. Every time, even despite his anxiety issues and his cries, he smiled or made one small step forward, he pulled me back to him and to a new reality. I rebuilt my dreams and my expectations. Yes,  I went through doubt and I walked through my own hell, but Adam pulled me out of it. My world shrank to Adam and I and then it exploded to a world of other friends \u2014 autistic people and other families \u2014 all thanks to Adam.  It expanded to accept other people with disabilities in a way I had never done before. My world expanded so I could see things in an entirely different and new way. While I lost many friends, I also gained so many more. This is how life is supposed to work, I think. Life is meant to shatter expectations in order that we grow bigger and stronger and more open to many things. Desperation morphs, you see. It is part of the journey. A valid part. And you just have to wade through it, just like I did then, and am doing now in the process of divorce.  I now prefer to see it as \u201ca part of me died\u201d in order that I could become a more accepting and loving person. So, walk through hell with dignity and an open heart. I promise you will get through to the other side. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2009/03/06/the-form-of-desperation/", "title": "On Desperation"},

{"date": "2009/03/10", "body": "I took this photo a couple of days ago. The park where Adam frequented in summers, it is desolate and gray now with the promise of spring as the snow melts away. I went out on Sunday and began taking photos of that which I will miss when we move from our home. I admit, with so much loss, I can really be queen-of-the-mopers. I can walk around and feel the  woe is me  deep down in my bones. No, I don\u2019t pull out the booze and talk about what\u2019s wrong with the world. I don\u2019t go that far.  It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a sad or depressed person. It just is what it is. I know I\u2019m not the only one. To deny your moping is just that: denial. The difference between a down-right serious depression and this, is that I think I can measure the space in between loss and happiness. In other words, by writing, painting, taking photographs, whatever,  it creates an awareness so I do not become lost in it. I can feel both within the span of a day (no, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m manic). I don\u2019t feel that running away from my feelings of alone-ness will heal me or make things better. Instead, I take photos of it. When I need to dive in, I just do it. A few months ago, I read that most women suffer from \u201cbag lady syndrome.\u201d It was in the  Globe and Mail  last fall as well and I remember the story well. Searching on the Internet, there are a deluge of stories on it. No matter how affluent and successful a woman is, she still worries she\u2019s going to end up in the streets. So deep is this affliction, I decided to wallow right in  because facing fears is the only way to to minimize them. \u201cBag-lady syndrome plagues, puzzles and, in more extreme cases, paralyzes women who want to get a better grip on their financial lives, according to Olivia Mellan, the author of The Advisor\u2019s Guide to Money Psychology and a Washington, D.C., therapist who specializes in money psychology. Lily Tomlin, Gloria Steinem, Shirley MacLaine and Katie Couric all admit to having a bag lady in their anxiety closet.\u201d (MSN Business). As I did this day of photography, I suddenly came across this bright yellow shopping cart in our neighbourhood park. What struck me is how bright yellow it was (I\u2019ve got a bit of tweaking to do on this photo to bring that out). It\u2019s owner, I imagine, must be some wonderful imaginative bag lady leaving it for a while to find food or objects, for it was not there at the beginning of my walk, but only here at the end of it. The cart is empty, sitting there, an entity waiting to be filled up. Is that what we are? Just a bunch of numb people waiting to be filled up? As a woman now \u201con my own,\u201d this is exactly what confronts me. It\u2019s not that I haven\u2019t created ventures and done and accomplished many things. It\u2019s just that when you lose your partner in life, desolate feelings arise within. I am not trying to diminish the value of partnership here by suggesting that it is bad to have a partner in whom you trust to take over aspects of your relationship. Connection should fill us up.  It is natural for partners to assume different roles. It is a fact that when your partner leaves or dies, life can be scary and bag lady fears can come rolling in. We have this fine line between being comfortable and confident in ourselves and appreciating even the fleeting reality of connection between people. Lately, I have been replacing \u201cBag Lady Syndrome\u201d with The Little Match Girl Syndrome. The story was written by Hans Christian Anderson. Do you remember her? The little girl sent out to sell matches? I bet many people born after 1970 don\u2019t know her at all.  With no shoes in the stark cold, she dared to light some of the matches she depended on to make income to keep her warm. In her desolate state, the world buzzing around but ignoring her, she crouches in a corner and begins to imagine a feast, the warmth of her grandmother, a lovely Christmas tree. Her imaginings bring her enormous happiness. \u201cShe hastily struck a whole bunch of matches, because she did so long to keep her grandmother with her. The light of matches made it as bright as day. Grandmother had never looked so beautiful. She lifted the little girl up in her arms, and they soared in a halo of light and joy, far above the earth\u2026\u201d \n \nOf course, by morning, the little match girl is found in that corner, frozen-to-death, passers by only making mere mention of it \u201cshe must have frozen-to-death,\u201d they utter. On the last page, which is an illustration without words, the sky shines now two stars, which we imagine to be the little girl reunited with her grandmother. It got me to thinking more about happiness. In this case, the little girl\u2019s imaginings were necessary for survival. If I were starving, I might pretend to have a big feast if it would make me feel better.  If you have access to a computer, I doubt you are one of those people freezing in the streets. You are probably dabbling through your day, in and out of your busy tasks, watching the stock market and drinking a cup of coffee perhaps intrigued by this notion of happiness. Who wouldn\u2019t be? So I lead to a question here: do you read your children the story of  The Little Match Girl?  Do you read it as some sort of pity story about poverty and how we have to help the poor? Or do you avoid the story because it contains too much pain? Or do you read it as a story of not only social responsibility but of happiness? What are we really teaching our children about happiness, pain and suffering? It stuck me when Adam\u2019s assistant picked up the book and read it to Adam (she did not know the story). As she was reading, she felt she had to censor it for Adam\u2019s sake because it was \u201ctoo sad.\u201d This, a children\u2019s tale! A Hans Christian Anderson tale! Never mind the Brother\u2019s Grimm. I mean, these tales do not have proverbial happy endings. Happiness is not just an ending, its a means and an ending. Nietzsche said \u201cthe measure of a society is how well it transforms pain and suffering into something worthwhile. Not how a society avoids pain and suffering \u2014 for Nietzsche, a deeply troubled man\u2026knew that was impossible \u2014 but it transforms it.\u201d ( The Geography of Bliss) \n \nAristotle believed that how we pursue happiness matters more than the goal itself. \u201cThey are in fact, one and the same, means and ends. A virtuous life necessarily leads to a happy life.\u201d (Ibid). Perhaps there is something missing when we pursue happiness in things and avoid the pain,  the struggle and the \u201cfailures\u201d of life. It is missing when we suggest that a goal in autism, even is to make people \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cindistinguishable\u201d because, let\u2019s face it, it will make many parents (not necessarily the autistic people in question) \u201chappier.\u201d If we think it will be easier, we believe it will make us happier. Everything  is tied in to our view of happiness and how we shape and live our lives and how we think we and other people  should  be. Instead of enjoying the journey, embracing the struggle as if it were a natural part of our existence and an intrinsic part of our overall happiness, we want to avoid it at all costs in favour of something  over there  \u2014 over the rainbow \u2014 something better (even if we don\u2019t really know what that is). Right now, my happiness is in writing, reading, taking photographs and thinking about life itself.  It is in my early morning cups of coffee and the luxury (and necessity) of reflection. Happiness right now, is sublime. I suppose with all that life has brought me thus far, the good and the painful, I am not a person to run away. I don\u2019t believe we find happiness in other people, except that connections with other people do bring me much joy. I believe happiness and imagination are so deeply entwined. We make our own happiness. While these objects stand alone in a desolate landscape (about to turn into a spring), they are in and of themselves entirely beautiful. It brings me happiness to travel to the depths of my feelings about what\u2019s happened in my life lately.

Here in the city during the cold winter, we rely on cars, not snowshoes, to get around.  Sad, I think, for we would be outside taking advantage of winter a lot more if city snow didn\u2019t turn gray or melt with salt. City winters are wicked. Nevertheless, spring has sprung.

{"date": "2009/05/17", "body": "\u201cMost writers write to say something about other people \u00a0\u2014 and it doesn\u2019t last. Good writers write to find out about themselves \u2014 and it lasts forever.\u201d  \u2014 Gloria Steinem I have to admit it. Going through this divorce is one of the toughest things I\u2019ve had to go through in my life. It really bothers me that some people think it\u2019s easy and trite. It definitely is not. My marriage to Adam\u2019s father was the most important adult-to-adult relationship of my life. So the the reason I\u2019ve had trouble working and writing and responding to emails. \u00a0So the reason that many of my usual tasks have easily slipped my mind. I\u2019ve hesitated and hesitated \u2014 do I write about my personal life? Do I write at Adam\u2019s peril? What do I keep and what do I reveal, for as a writer, I find it difficult to avoid the truth and the self and disguise it in fiction. I am not a fiction writer. Not yet, anyway. As for Adam and this divorce, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m only interested in human dignity, and while truths emerge over time and perspective, Adam\u2019s father and Adam\u2019s mother deserve the best regard and respect for Adam\u2019s sake. I\u2019ve hesitated about writing about myself too much for fear it may appear like \u201cwriting therapy.\u201d But let\u2019s face it: all reading and writing is \u201ctherapy\u201d if it brings us to a greater awareness and understanding of ourselves. The best reading is the \u201ca-ha\u201d moment \u2014 a connection with an author\u2019s observation. For me anyway, the best reward is when others express gratitude and connectedness to my writing. Another reward is a larger perspective of life and the world itself, and a growing compassion. Adam and I must move houses. I\u2019ve been preparing one since the beginning of March. This is also top of the stressor list (death, divorce, moving\u2026). So again, if I haven\u2019t responded to some of you, please do not take it personally. Thank goodness for the house, even if it\u2019s all bittersweet. A house allows us to build again. It asks for creative energy. As a creative person, I\u2019ve come to realize that I\u2019ve had a desperation to build something lovely, something peaceful. \u00a0It is only bittersweet because I am still living in the \u201cmatrimonial home,\u201d which I built for my family and will soon have to leave. I put as much creative energy into that home too. \u00a0Yet with Adam\u2019s father now gone, there is a loneliness to it all. As for work in autism, I do so again quietly. TAAP will have to reassemble. It\u2019s website will remain up as I seek to find ways that outsiders can contribute to its growth more readily and easily. As I read Gloria Steinem, I related to this:  \u201cI had felt burnt out many times in the past twenty years, like so many people in social-justice movements \u2014 especially in the feminist movement, to which women bring the very training in selflessness we are trying to change \u2014 yet unlike other women with more self-vision, I believed so little in my own inner world that I couldn\u2019t stop to replenish it. Like a soldier who is wounded but won\u2019t lie down for fear of dying, I just kept marching. Why? Well, if I stopped, I would have given up the way I made myself \u2018real\u2019 \u2014 that is, by being useful to people in the outside world \u2014 just as I had made myself \u2018real\u2019 as a child by keeping so busy that I numbed the sad unreality at home where I looked after my mother\u2026 my image of myself was very distant from other people\u2019s image of me; and that, in short, my childhood years \u2014 a part of my life I thought I had walled off \u2014 were still shaping the present as surely as a concealed magnet shapes metal dust.\u201d (from Revolution From Within, preface). Maybe you can tell where I\u2019m going as I move through the fact that I had lived my recent life for Adam, and I, like so many other women, was taught that the only way to be a \u201cgood\u201d woman or mother was to constantly work and serve, leaving myself to the very end, if at all. I am not at all complaining or suggesting this was or is Adam\u2019s fault. All of it was my choice \u2014 to work, to serve \u2014 and I still intend to do so. It\u2019s just that as mothers with disabled children, we have a tendency to throw our entire selves into our children. And why? Needs are higher, for certain. But I also wonder about the lack of social supports to help us out \u2014 lack of respite for the average family, lack of inclusion, services and so great a lack of understanding. How many years (since 2005) have I written this blog and written before this blog, trying, by gargantuan effort, to convince family, friends, schools and public, that Adam is indeed worthy and valuable as he is? Was it worth it? I have no regrets. But work in social justice movements may come at a high price. Not paying attention to our own growth and nurturing our relationships also comes at a high price. \u00a0How to mitigate it? I\u2019m not so sure. I am not solely responsible for  not  nurturing it. I did what needed to be done. Adam still needs this to be done. I recognize that I also need to take care of myself for him. And that fine balance seems difficult for me to achieve. Or maybe I\u2019m simply too hard on myself. I\u2019ve been called strong so many times. As I move through the pain and loneliness of divorce, sometimes it sounds like an easy write-off to me \u2014 \u201cyou are so strong, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I can\u2019t tell if people say this to me because they fear my pain or just do not want to engage in it (understandably). I feel obligated to keep on a happy face for others, so I do not scare them away. Being a divorced woman comes with its share of stigma. \u00a0All I can say is I recognize that my situation renders great discomfort in others and sometimes I cannot spare the energy to spare them, even though I try. For certain, I\u2019m learning so much. I\u2019ve spent the day in my new garden, filling in gaps in the earth with new perennials, being with the plants and the earth, knowing they will grow and bring me pleasure with their life. The dirt beneath my fingernails and a sore back is also a reward \u2014 knowing that I\u2019ve contributed to renewed growth. Gardening is a creative, hopeful act and a belief in the future. A sore and gritty body means I\u2019ve done the work to nurture it. \u00a0I do it as Adam is away this Victoria Day long-weekend with his dad. It gives me time to think. I\u2019m alone and I honour my relationship with myself and with Adam\u2019s father to permit myself to mourn and learn as I dig deep. I believe that distraction is counter-productive. I believe that if things have to drop away for awhile, so be it, as I put my energy into rebuilding my life and making it as productive and creative as possible. I believe that, in the words of Noah Benshea, \u201cstrength is not the absence of weakness, but how we wrestle with our weaknesses.\u201d \u201cI worshipped dead men for their strength,\u00a0 Forgetting I was strong.\u201d  \u2014 Vita Sackville West A- ha.

As I check in on my email, I listen to three newbie autism moms refer to their books and talk about anxiety and autism, schools and trying to make sense of it all. They are abuzz on caffeine and worry, their voices popping in and out of each other to get a word in edgewise on a new book they are reading. They are talking about methods, what\u2019s better, what\u2019s not. For some of us older autism parents, this is old territory. I am listening to the mother I once was and ponder the one I am becoming as Adam grows, as I go through separation and divorce. The very fabric of our lives are changing in profound ways \u2014 in ways I am right now, too close to objectively comment on. Yet listening to new moms allows me to to consider how time changes us. There would be nothing I could say or do to change the learning process they must go through. They are engaged and intent. They are Jenny McCarthy\u2019s \u201cwarrior moms.\u201d There is likely nothing that will stop them from trying to do what they can for their children. For some, it will be the  anything and everything approach . It may be reading every book they can get their hands on. It may later or sooner be meeting autistic people, reading research, attending conferences\u2026.I can make a long list of  to do\u2019s  that was a part of my journey. I have kept every list, every day diary, every journal I have, and every communication book on Adam since day one. As soon as Adam was diagnosed, I began reading. He was so ill, I remember. We had our suspicions, Henry and I, and I booked several diagnostic appointments just prior to our Xmas holidays in 2003. Adam was 18 months old.  We had traveled to Nassau and Florida and Max and Adam became very ill with a horrible flu. I also became very ill. I nursed and tried to help Adam as I also lay for days in my in-law\u2019s more comfortable bedroom in Florida. I don\u2019t think we got up for nearly a week. Adam ended up in emergency on intravenous. It was a nerve-wracking time. Still, this period began my intensive reading about autism. I started by finding books at our local bookstore and it went from there. I was hyper-vigilant and anxious. Life as we new it (or expected it) had suddenly changed, although Adam had not changed at all. I\u2019ll agree that early autism moms can become \u201cwarrior moms,\u201d protective of our children and determined to get them \u201chelp.\u201d I\u2019ve learned to calm down. I\u2019ve learned to respect Adam\u2019s way of learning. I\u2019ve learned that what I did and read and all the hard work was something that I would never and could never change. Yes, I\u2019m on a much different path than Jenny and I\u2019m one of her critics. Yet when she wrote \u201cwarrior mom,\u201d there was something universal in that that I know every mom can relate to. The more I\u2019ve learned to accept life as it is, the more easily I can swim in it.  When I hear a report on  CNN about autism and amygdalas  and brain size,  the more I know this will be tempered by further science. Gary Taubes, as I quoted  in my essay The Mismeasure of Autism  noted that when it comes to science, it is the first claim that is likely to be wrong. While CNN is reporting a \u201cfinding\u201d based on a theory, it is still not exclusive fact without further testing  under different perspectives .  I would like to discuss the anxious parent \u2014  the neurotypicial parent (or a parent under the delusion that they are typical for everything is relative). We are the of  earlier generations who had not gone to school with and played with disabled kids. They were rarely seen in our neighbourhoods. They were the kids who were sent away.  Yet, because of parents like Adam\u2019s mom and many millions of others, who will not accept exclusion, this is beginning to change.  What lens do we look at autism through and how might this change in the future as Adam\u2019s generation is exposed and plays alongside other disabled children? This is the social science test that I am interested in. Let science undergo the test of time.

It\u2019s for their safety on the streets,\u201d he told AFP. \nAsked what the signs should read or where people should wear them on their bodies, he said this was up to the government to decide at a later date. \u201cThey won\u2019t be penalised if they flout the rule; it\u2019s only a precaution for their safety,\u201d he added. Transport experts said the law was preposterous and the government should focus on providing facilities such as level footpaths and wheelchair ramps rather than requiring people to wear signs. \n\u201cIt is strange when handicapped people are asked to carry extra burdens and obligations,\u201d Institute of Transportation Studies chairman Darmaningtyas said.

{"date": "2008/12/21", "body": "Disability has existed since the dawn of mankind. So has autism. It\u2019s only because autism became a distinctive \u201ccondition,\u201d another breakdown of a minutiae of impairments, do we have a spectacle of autism stories in books and the media. There is proof of it; disability since the dawn of mankind, that is. I know many of you heard Dr. Morton Ann Gernsbacher say it on CNN about a year ago (if you recall) and many \u201cautism advocates\u201d still don\u2019t believe it. Kathy Snow and her Disability Is Natural website and articles is another one of many who has studied and espoused that disability is a natural part of human existence. Many anthropologists have studied it \u2014 it\u2019s not an arbitrary claim by some of us folks who believe that diversity extends to all people \u2013 not just of sexual orientation, race or religion \u2013 but also to individuals with neurological differences. Since antiquity, we have documented evidence of physical impairments. Berkson (1974, 1993), argued: Monkey and ape groups include individuals who have fallen from trees or who have been injured by predators. [They] may survive in natural animal groups when their injury does not actually interfere with foraging or escape from predators. In other words, the injury may not be handicapping. Injured animals may survive and live in a group because group living itself can provide aid to adaptation. Mother monkeys provide care that compensates for even severe injuries, and other members of the group\u2026 where predation pressure is low and food is plentiful, handicapped animals may live to be adults. (Berkson 1993: 5-6)  In their essay,  An Institutional History of Disability ,\u00a0\u00a0 Susan Parish and David Braddock seek to describe the history of institutional history of disability in Western society but end up at the beginning, which helps us identify ways in which disability is addressed as a social problem, that is to say, a problem in and of itself, but a problem of how society stigmatizes and thinks about disability like monoliths \u2014 over-generalizations which lead to prejudice. As I read the chapter, I cannot help but ask what we can learn from history. Have we advanced much farther than the Middle Ages?\u00a0 What does a diversity movement, a movement founded upon a need to accept everyone in an ever-complex globally connected social environment have to do with it? The paradoxes in thinking about disability and treating the disabled are sadly thriving. Let me, for the sake of what should be a shorter blog post, and not the full-fledged essay, make a few comparisons. The authors note that \u201cAncient Western notions of impairment in Greece and Rome accepted the belief that persons with congenital impairments embodied the wrath of the gods and should be killed.\u201d (Braddock and Parish) How many times do we believe that pain and suffering or disability, often equated with the former, is due to the fact that we have done something wrong? What about after we give birth and count our infant\u2019s fingers and toes and \u201cthank God\u201d everything is okay. \u201cYet this view coexisted with the fact that those who acquired their disabilities later in life were often integrated into society as workers, citizens, and soldiers. During the Middle Ages, widespread belief in demonology as an etiology of impairment was counterbalanced by religious movements preaching compassion and support towards persons with disabilities.\u201d (Braddock and Parish) In Sparta, infanticide was practiced on children born with deformities while in Athens, they were spared.\u00a0 \u201cExisting court records provide compelling evidence that the linkage between disability and entitlement to monetary support from the government was not absolute. Individuals with disabilities in Greece would have had to prove that they truly were economically needy and not just physically disabled to receive a small food grant.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Men who were disabled by war were granted pensions and the status if disabled people varied. How is this different and less complicated today? We revere the war hero but dread the disabled infant or child, at least enough to want to prevent them from being born, and this is not only true for Downs syndrome, but becoming ever more real for many other disabilities. Yet, as in Sparta where one region prevented physical disability by killing those babies, there were others who kept disabled people among them. What might history tell us about the high rate of uninformed prevention in our society today, and the smaller rate where there are parents like Sarah Palin \u2013 a more high-profile individual anyway \u2013 would keep a disabled baby? It might be all the more reason to suggest that in terms of politics and accommodation, disability is here to stay \u2013 just like it was in Ancient Greece. \u201cRoman Law enumerated certain rights for people with disabilities\u2026Justinian Code classified persons with disabilities in detail and delineated rights pertaining to different types and degrees of disability; for example, people with mental disabilities were not permitted to marry. Drawing on the Jewish discrimination between degrees of deafness (Daniels 1997), the Justinian Code identified five classes of deafness. The code became the basis of law in most European countries from the sixth to the eighteenth centuries.\u201d (Braddock and Parish) Do we continue to divide the minutiae of differences between us to delineate one\u2019s rights? Does not the very existence of a Diagnostic Statistical Manual promote such discrimination? The New Testament used disability as a way to show the power of God, or Jesus, performing miracles in \u201chealing.\u201d\u00a0 Disability is written to be caused by sin. Yet, in the same paradoxical vein, the New Testament asks society to be generous and kind towards impaired individuals while at the same time declaring \u201cimpairment was the wrath of God.\u201d (Braddock and Parish). Healing tales take take us down the road of autism diets and Jenny McCarthy and TACA, among others who proselytize that they have \u201chealed\u201d or \u201crecovered\u201d their autistic children with specific drugs and treatments. Healing must be, therefore, connected to demonization of the disabled, for they must be healed \u2013 they are not good the way they are. Once epilepsy, the condition McCarthy\u2019s son is said to have, was believed to be caused by the devil himself. \u201cAttempts to cure people with disabilities from early medieval times reflect supernatural beliefs in the abilities of magic and religious elements. For instance, Anglo-Saxons offered the following antidote to mental illness: `A pleasant drink against insanity. Put in ale hassock, lupine, carrot, fennel, radish, betony, water-agrimony, carche, rue, wormwood, cat\u2019s mint, elecampane, enchanter\u2019s night-shade, wile teazle. Sing twelve Masses over the drink, and let the patient drink it. He will soon be better.\u00a0 (Russell 1980:45).\u201d \n \nConsider this list of remedies purported for autism today: Calcium Selenium Zinc Magnesium Iron CysteineSulfate Taurine B-12 B-6 \nLysine Methionine Essential Fatty Acids Vitamin d Vitamin e Vitamin a \nVitamin c Vitamin Zinc Calcium/magnesium Probiotics Digestive \nenzymes Vitamin b-6 Infrared Sauna Taurine Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber \nMelatonin Methyl-b-12 Folinic acid N-acetyl-cysteine Amino acids TMG or DMG \nCoenzyme Q-10 Transfer factor Selenium Iron Chromium Multiple \nvitamin/mineral N-acetyl-carnitine DMAE Silymarin 5-HTP Active \nCharcoal Pantothenic acid Phosphatidylcholine Oral gamma globulin Pycnogenol \nCreatine Carnosine SAMe Methyl-B-12 B-spectrum vitamins, including pantothenic acid \nQurecitin Curcumin Oregano oil Caprylic acid Olive leaf extract Garlic \nLauricidin Cod liver oil L-Arginine Oral gamma globulin Specific herbal \nsupplements L-Glutamine Quercitin Pyenogenol Magnezium Cucumin Niacin \nAnti-inflammatory nutrients and flavonoids, including quercitin, pycnogenol & others \nLauricidin Arabinogalactan Acidophilus Bifidus Garlic Saccharomyces boulardii \nCobiotic companion L-Glutimine Lauricidin Panthothenic acid Gama OryzanolEvening \nprimrose oil Permeability Factors Biotin Omega-3 EFAs L0Theanine \nGABA Inositol Fish oil Larginine Glutathione \nDetox phases 1,2,3,4 ALA Silymarin Dimercaptosuccinic acid The list is longer than what I\u2019ve provided here. The bell curved sharply for humankind at the dawn of a more modern eugenics era that lead to sterilization, incarceration and extermination of disabled people from the nineteenth century onward so let us measure these historical examples against the current concoctions and interventions for autism, and I think you\u2019ll get my point: the paradoxical thoughts we have about disability \u2013 from hero, to mystical gift, to angel, to demon, to just plain tragedy, permeates our consciousness so much so that we have to keep studying, discussing and as with all things, shake up our thinking. The effects of Obama becoming our first Black President, to women in high offices and now above the glass ceiling, to blind politicians and disabled leaders says it all. While we still have conflicted views about disability, diversity will prevail. Since the dawn of mankind.

It took a great deal of time and patience! Grandpa and Grandma must have thought, as Adam gets a few ear infections and he is hypersensitive of his ears being touched, that taking the mystery out the ear\u2019s anatomy might interest him. I quite think it did. Leave it to the Grandparents to come up with such a brilliant idea! I sat quietly in the background with a great sense of peace watching them working together. You see, Grandpa is a special person in Adam\u2019s life. Grandpa is the man who teaches Adam so many things and loves to show him new things every weekend if he can get the chance. Grandpa cooed and sang to Adam in the days when I spent hours trying to get him to sleep. I would try, then if Grandpa was around, he would offer to try and ask me to take a rest. Grandpa would cradle Adam in his arms as if he was the light of the world, swaying him and singing to him in a deep, soft voice.

So often we seek it from other people. I think what I most admire are the people, many who have gone through so much more than I have in this life, are those who find their contentment from within \u2014 who do not chase rainbows. Only then can we really have compassion for others in any circumstance.  In the old Joy of Autism blog (which you can download in the margin) I wrote a few times about just what happiness might be for all of us struggling either with our own views, or the barriers that confront autistic people.  As I move on in my life now, employing compassion with continued intellectual debate will continue to be my goal. It is something I have tried to practice since Adam was diagnosed and since every bump and turn called life. It\u2019s just too short to waste being angry with it. This is our real test.  Really, it is Adam who has helped me to grow in so many ways; who has brought me to so many of you from who I continue to have great interest and learn.

The first was the \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d [your kid has autism] comment, to which I can now calmly reply that this person need not be sorry for Adam is the best kid in the world (and then explain nicely why I respond as such). In fact, when I see neurotypical kids nag their parents and get greedy for  thing s , I feel I am blessed with a conversely gentle, affable, loving, amazing child who is growing and learning and changing by the day. The second was the usual question I get \u201cSo, what do you think of Jenny McCarthy?\u201d Well, all you need to do is go to the right side bar, watch my  Autism In The Media  video for an answer on that. Usually, people unfamiliar with autism and the politics surrounding it will believe Jenny and are shocked that I do not endorse her. They sort of look at me a little perplexed and conclude \u201cwell at last she\u2019s raising awareness.\u201d As I\u2019ve said before and will say again \u2014 not all awareness and advocacy is  healthy \u00a0awareness and advocacy. Anything that shifts public perception to lesson the value of human beings based on their disability, sways people to feel sorry for us or our children, or endangers their health, is not advancing the needs of autistic individuals or creating an Inclusive society. \u00a0It is so unfortunate that Jenny has received so much air time and so many children have died as a result of her claims that vaccines cause autism. Refreshing was the woman last night who had asked me the question about my thoughts on Jenny. She also managed (as a scientist) to understand the scope of Jenny\u2019s damage to autistic people. This has been going on (and there are much better bloggers on the science and politics of vaccines and autism including  Kathleen Seidel ,  Left Brain/Right Brain ,  Mike Stanton \u2026). As I sat with my girlfriend at a restaurant last night, I receive an email to watch CNN. Any time there\u2019s something about autism, I get similar emails, but the thing is, this is old news for so many of us. Those who watch the science, instead of following Jenny-And-The-Quacks, have known this for a long period of time.\u00a0 Andrew Wakefield is busted  and CNN is finally reporting (what most of us already knew), that vaccines do not cause autism.

{"date": "2009/02/09", "body": "I\u2019m a self-proclaimed book-worm. Mind you, I haven\u2019t read James Joyce. I haven\u2019t read a lot of things listed in the  1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die .  As a writer, sometimes I forget how to spell a word. I find many mistakes in my writing. I care not much for perfection, but process.  I do read, perhaps, too many books at one time. If one really captures my attention, I may hold on to it from start to finish. Lately, I read them all at once, picking up chapters and paragraphs here and there that still all seem interrelated. I learned that there are many ways to read a book, and it\u2019s not always cover to cover. As I am now alone in the world taking care of my son Adam, books are the friends and lovers that remain. Ready and loyal, they await me. They care. They give me guidance when I need it most. They are there when I need them and stand with allegiance, even if they agitate me with their sage or simply stupid ideas. When I was first separated from my husband last fall, I turned to  When You\u2019re Falling Dive .   The book, by Mark Matousek, was well timed at a point when I was falling, but not yet diving like I meant it.  Then I think,  it is fine to write about the  Joy of Autism , and I suppose we all find that  falling-point  in the beginning, but there I was last fall, suddenly alone and I had to eat my own words about joy and acceptance, because let\u2019s face it, when something happens that you are not in agreement with, it\u2019s more difficult to accept. Here I was (and still am) at a critical juncture where I can dive to live, or get stuck in the purgatory of despair. I choose the former. So Mark\u2019s book was like a special visitor who came at the right moment in time. Quoting from Ram Dass, the Dalai Lama and others in the midst of terminal diseases, he taught me that it is actually these very rough times that teach us how to live and be alive; that it is only in crisis when we become awake again. It is an opportunity. \u201cTerror can be the door to enlightenment,\u201d he says. \u201cTerror is fuel; the wounding is power. Darkness carries the seeds of redemption. Authentic strength isn\u2019t found in our armour but at the very pit of the wounds each of us manages to survive.\u201d To translate the words of the Dalai Lama, we have to learn to walk joyfully through hell.  Terror and change can be the beginning of metamorphosis.  Meta , from the Greek meaning to alter, or occurring later than or in succession to; and  morph , meaning \u201cform.\u201d So, to alter our form is something that comes from within first, to without, second. I really hate the idea used with autistic children \u2013 that they must morph into something else \u2013 coming from without their \u201ccacoon.\u201d I prefer the idea to be applied to all of us \u2013 that we have the capacity and the will to stand up to adversity not with armour, but with an open heart in order that we learn and change our form as the purpose of why we are here in the first place. I consider the books I read part of my journey, so I had an idea that I might as well write about it! There is the outward struggle and the inward coping and managing. But there\u2019s even more to adversity. What does it have to teach us?  Of course, no metamorphosis cannot occur, for me anyway, unless we also turn to creative acts and ideas. I turned then to Twyla Tharp and her book  The Creative Habit: Learn It And Use It For Life. For any writer or creative person, I highly recommend her book. I was reminded again how artists of all kinds must wear their hearts, so to say, \u201con their sleeve.\u201d I learned that if you cannot  transcribe  the daily aspects and truths of your existence and what happens to you, you can easily be an artist-liar and churn out a bunch of crap. She says:  \u201cThe way I figure it, my work habits are applicable to everyone\u2026.My daily routines are transacational. Everything that happens in my day is a transaction between the external world and my internal world. Everything is raw material. Everything is relevant. Everything is usable. Everything feeds into my creativity.\u201d (p.10) \n \nThe artist or writer, very much like the person, changes and sculpts the raw material into the finishing piece. We people, like art, have to take away our experiences and make sense of them. Victor Frankl, who writes  Man\u2019s Search for Meaning  says that our suffering ceases to become suffering once we find meaning or tell it\u2019s story. Creating and telling our stories is a must. Be it losing my husband, or losing an expectation of the child we all think we\u2019re supposed to have before we receive that autism diagnosis, the former idea is an extremely valuable point in the process of acceptance. We have to have the time to figure out our story. And it is time I need and am taking. It is way too early to tell certain aspects of my personal story \u2013 which is why I only allude to it within these blog posts. It is what we often call being \u201ctoo close\u201d to something to see it clearly. My mind, however, as is my spirit, are changing. That said, I had to turn to the book  On Bullshit , by Harry G. Frankfurt, just to make sure I wasn\u2019t creating some of my own. I am not a fan of delusion. Not only that, I have certainly discovered that there is plenty of quackery and humbug to go around for all of us to choke on. Frankfurt quotes Longfellow\u2019s verse who, he says, Wittgenstein used as his motto (remember that Wittgenstein is purported to have been autistic): In the elder days of art \nBuilders wrought with greatest care \nEach minute and unseen part \nFor the Gods are everywhere Frankfurt concludes on this that,  \u201cThe point of these lines are clear. In the old days, craftsmen did not cut corners. They worked carefully, and they took care with every aspect of their work. Every part of the product was considered, and each was designed and made to be exactly what it should be. These craftsmen did not relax their thoughtful self-discipline even with respect to features of their work that would ordinarily not be visible. Although no one would notice if those features were not quite right, the craftsman would be bothered by their consciences. So nothing was swept under the rug. Or, one might perhaps also say, there was no bullshit.\u201d (pp. 20-21) \n \nConscience. I like that word a lot. I think that many people delude themselves of the truth, but the conscience continues to nibble away as a messenger of the truth. If we are lying to ourselves about the true nature of something, we might try ignore it until we become agitated, ill or simply stuck. So as my guide, my conscience is there as I sit alone now in the dark of the four o\u2019clock morning, reading these books as I am a woman soaking up solitude; working through every motion, every fear, every hope that solitude now has to offer. Marion Milner, British psychoanalyst and writer of  A Life of One\u2019s Own  is quoted by Florence Falk in  On My Own: The Art Of Being a Woman Alone , which I bought right after my marital separation, but couldn\u2019t bear to read right away until it nibbled for my attention. It reminded me of what Bette Midler said in the film  The Women , where she tells a devastated Meg Ryan (who discovered her husband was having an affair), to be SELFISH.  Sitting back in a yoga-retreat where the fridge is padlocked in the middle of the night, Midler finds a joint from a worker and shares it with a highly dedicated, hard-working, high-profile Meg Ryan, who can\u2019t figure out how she could be so betrayed after all her dedication.  In Milner\u2019s, and it seems Midler\u2019s view, SELFISH is not a dirty word. It means uncensoring oneself  \u201cagains the verdict of [one\u2019s] harshest internal judgement\u2026For if selfish meant finding out what made her feel alive, well, then selfish she would be\u2026.[Milner\u2019s] quest for happiness is what touches us most; for as time passed, and as she allowed herself the solitude to watch, to take in, to simply be that is so necessary for such an undertaking \u2013 all the while living an active life \u2013 she discovered, to her great surprise, that the \u2018best things\u2019 in her life had nothing to do with \u2018successes, either in friendships or work or play,\u2019 but were related to \u2018very small moments\u2019 when she let her rational mind fall away and was able to take in the world intuitively. In her pursuit, her \u2018worst sin\u2019 was to let herself be pulled in blindly in all directions so that she had no vitality left for needs that belonged to her personal self.\u201d (pp.173-174) I had to laugh as Meg unravelled in such conservative ways. She reminded me of myself \u2014 trying to be everything to everyone. Trying so darn hard. Of course, Midler\u2019s advice was the turning point for Meg in the truest Hollywood sense. Meg\u2019s character begins to write lists  \u201cWhat do I really want?\u201d  to determine the path to her future and turns a passion that she was chastised for, and didn\u2019t really honour.  She spent time filtering herself, distilling her life and her thoughts until her creative process lead her to become a mind-blowing designer. How often do we criticize the \u201cnonsensical\u201d play of autistic children only to call it inappropriate or not really play at all? How often do we do this to ourselves?!! And yet, it is  all  play \u2013 these moment-to-moment experiences of living that are so vitally important. We seem to fail to SEE them as we get caught up in other things. I see it in Adam in how he plays in order to discover on his terms. I see it in my play as I huddle under the covers with the moon shining in my eyes in the early morning, beckoning me to read and be alone (which is not to say lonely as being alone is taboo in our culture), until I push out this stream-of-consciousness type of writing that is actually leading to another place. You see, it\u2019s all play, it\u2019s all valid, it\u2019s all part of the creative experience of living. I am transacational in the moments of my existence \u2013 from waking up to moonlight, to feeling the stark pang or the sudden sucking in of my breath as I awake to realize that I\u2019m still, for better or for worse in these difficult moments, still alive (as if waking from a bad dream); to realizing that the bed, save for me, is empty and the house is unusually silent. I have taken the course of focusing on stability for my son \u2013 my beautiful autistic son  and  myself in order to rechart our course. I savour the last moments in the house we built for Adam (or that backyard at least) before we must leave it, the floors and walls that will vaguely remember our names, and then forget us forever as it is inhabitated by new strangers. It is all these threads that I will tie together to render a beautiful story. W.G. Sebald once said, \u201c I think fiction writing which does not acknowledge the narrator himself is a form of imposture which I find very very difficult to take.\u201d (p. 4). In James Wood\u2019s,  How Fiction Works , he talks in his early chapters on the omniscience of the author in fiction writing. \u201cAs soon as someone tells a story about a character, narrative seems to want to bend itself around the character, wants to merge with that character, to take on his or her way of thinking and speaking. A novelist\u2019s ominiscience soon enough becomes a kind of secret sharing; this is called free indirect style.\u201d Hmm. So it is inescabable \u2013 the SELF, that is, as we write stories, paint pictures, create characters. We are always there, orchestrating, making sense, be it for ourselves and for others.  Acceptance is a creative act. It is a process. It is filled with stories, characters, moments of beauty and sadness. In recognizing the duplicity in all things, at that point alone, we can begin to accept them.

I am happy that he\u2019s happy, and of course sad I am not there.  Being alone without my son for the first time is something to get used to. Heart Day is bittersweet. We can be struck by cupid\u2019s arrow that symbol for being caught by elated love, but it\u2019s inevitably going to bleed. We can have expansive hearts for our children, and broken hearts from our lovers or friends who leave us or break a sacred trust. That which we deem sacred is at the highest risk, perhaps because we put it way too high up on a wobbly pedestal. The heart is a marvelous thing. It is that one organ that keeps us moving that pump pump thumps with the vibrancy of life, and yet, we feel it. It can fly, it can suffer extreme pain. There is a lot of soul that pumps within that engine. We feel our hearts, quite literally, in every aspect of our emotional lives. If we sit back and just feel in the moment, that physical feeling that is emotion comes from two very important places \u2013 the stomach and the heart.  \u201cI cant\u2019 stomach it,\u201d is a phase for something we cannot emotionally handle or that which we find disgusting. When people are upset, they often cannot eat as the stomach clenches with pain or worry. But today we celebrate love with the heart. Love which is our lifeblood, our reason for being. We are programmed to love. I am most fortunate to have a son who I love unconditionally. I feel I have experienced life\u2019s greatest blessing to know such love. My heart is out there by the ocean, but I take solace in knowing that he\u2019s happy. I could cry at the commercialized hearts in store windows and mourn the loss of coupledom as I go out and about today on my own. I could focus on only those lovers holding hands today and ignore the other people, just like me, who want to just get through another day of plastic and glittery commercialized happiness. Naaah. It doesn\u2019t work like that. Of course, going out today may be treacherous, but my heart is Adam and I will cherish that.  My heart wants to be open, no matter what happens. Gentle am I, and I will be, with myself; a lovely, openhearted person who will celebrate myself and be open for what may or may not come. At my age, it\u2019s quite a revelation to love oneself, especially after the heart has been hurt. So imperfect am I, that I will celebrate my idiosyncrasies and the fact that I have given so much and will  give that space and love to myself. Celebrate, I will, the dream I have fulfilled in having a wonderful and affable child who will grow up, I know, to be a generous man with his own heart. Understand, I will reflect, that the heart only grows bigger with scar tissue. Happy I will be, with the flow of this life I live and accept a new relationship with Adam\u2019s father. Content, I am, in all of life\u2019s ordinary moments.  Today I will take simple pleasures by recognizing life\u2019s important blessings and lessons. And if for one moment, I feel sorry for myself because some silly Hallmark symbol I see out there delivers me the message that I\u2019m not \u201ccomplete\u201d without another, well, at that point I can guffaw, maybe giggle with tears, and just remember how complete  and lucky I already am. ____ Postscript: After writing this post, Adam sent me a \u201cHappy Heart.\u201d  \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2009/02/14/be-still-my-heart/", "title": "Be Still My Heart"},

After just finishing the movie  Blindness , I feel disturbed at its depiction of blind people as totally incompetent, they are quarantined and incarcerated, as disabled people were not that long ago. Then, on  About.com , I found this protest: National Federation of the Blind Protests the Movie Blindness \nMonday October 6, 2008 \n The National Federation of the Blind (NFB) announced its strong objections to the new Miramax film release Blindness, promising to protest at cinemas across the nation. The film, which opened on October 3rd, is based on a novel by author Jos\u00e9 Saramago, in which the people of city suddenly go blind as a result of a certain virus. Fearing that the mysterious blindness is contagious, the government quarantines the blinded citizens in an abandoned asylum. The NFB claims that the film will do substantial harm to the blind. Dr. Marc Maurer, President of the National Federation of the Blind, said \u201cBlind people in this film are portrayed as incompetent, filthy, vicious, and depraved. They are unable to do even the simplest things like dressing, bathing, and finding the bathroom. The truth is that blind people regularly do all of the same things that sighted people do.\u201d  I admit to listening carefully, perhaps sentimentally to the the last lines in the movie \u2014 the point where Danny Glover\u2019s voice over comments at being afraid of losing the \u201cintimacies\u201d from being blind \u2014 the connection, the oxymoron of  seeing more  when blind. It\u2019s spoken as if once sight returns, they will all put up some sort of guard yet again and cease to connect. It\u2019s a quaint idea. The problem is, is that it is just another stereotype, just like autistic people are all \u201csmart\u201d and all blind people can \u201csee deeper\u201d into things by virtue of some sixth sense. It is important to also note that not one actual blind person was in the movie. I guess we begin to SEE only when we recognize that all people are the same \u2014 no matter what their disability. \u201cWe are all perfect despite our imperfections,\u201d I said in  The Autism Acceptance Project video  nearly three years ago now. \u201cWe are all the same despite our differences.\u201d Yet, we are still so very blind to accepting this fact.

A plane ride of Goldfish and movies didn\u2019t suffice the large appetite of this otherwise slim and well-metabolized little boy.  I am the gushing mother of Adam. I\u2019m ridiculous at it and love to do it here on this blog.  What can I say? I don\u2019t mourn the loss of a \u201cnormal\u201d child to an autistic one. Adam is Adam and I am lucky to have him as part of my life as I watch him grow and evolve.  He is not a greedy little boy, but he is generous with himself and his heart. He does this with few words, yet he manages to do it better than most. Yet, when he\u2019s cranky, it presses my red alarm buttons. I fed him quickly. So happy was he that I explained that his \u201ctummy was happy,\u201d and I drew this happy face on his actual stomach. Adam is really into faces these days. In a world that believes that autistic people don\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d pretend play, he not only makes faces with things and food, he was making many things with strings of his spaghetti once his appetite was quelched. He also did not stop looking at his \u201chappy\u201d tummy, and he laughed hysterically. Yesterday (here I go a-gushing again), his aide told me that Adam was painting. There was music playing in the background and Adam proceeded to paint carefully and with intention along with the music. All the children in his class gathered around him. They expressed to the teachers around (while Adam heard of course) that he was a great painter\u2026.\u201dhe\u2019s better than Van Gogh,\u201d they exclaimed. You see? There\u2019s always something to celebrate. There is always something to make us happy. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2009/02/19/happy-face/", "title": "Happy Face"},

Wright\u00a0creates video games that enable people to create worlds. He praises his Montessori school for the method in which he learned \u2014 which is a process of discovery \u2014 and uses the Montessori model in his games.\u00a0 Adam goes to a Montessori school. At first, I was told that \u201cautistic kids shouldn\u2019t go to a Montessori school because it has little social interaction opportunities.\u201d Then, there was a Montessori school built here in Toronto that used ABA therapy \u2014 totally antithetical to the Montessori process. Needless to say, I never sent Adam there and I believe the school is out of business. The classic Montessori school has been a blessing in our lives and a boon to Adam. Adam has more friends in this Inclusive school than ever. He is into the creation of his own creatures and has launched into a realm of pretend play that didn\u2019t obviously exist for him when he was three. I say  obviously  because learning for Adam has taken a different path \u2014 no less important or valuable than traditional methods.  Obviously  might replace the world \u201ctypically.\u201d It is here that I will speak out against Applied Behavioural Interventions for autistic children. My child is barely verbal, yet he\u2019s social. He loves pretend play which he didn\u2019t \u201cdisplay\u201d when he was younger. I cringe at the attempts of one former speech pathologist who made Adam \u201cfeed the baby,\u201d each and every single day in preschool, but completely ignored the way he played on his own. I mean, how does that expand the mind? \u00a0Adam seemed so angry with her. He was probably thinking,\u00a0 \u201chere comes that boring lady who wants me to feed the baby every day when I\u2019ve got better things to do.\u201d  Today, I watch Adam progress and evolve, watching others and wanting to learn so badly. This can only come from within him. The environments we expose our children either nurture or squash the desire. The bottom line is this: autistic people learn. They discover. They have their own path. I want this game for Adam. It has no set conclusion. It is open ended. It enables him to keep discovering, as does his wonderful school. He can play this with any member of his family or his friends.  While Adam does get lessons in structure, sequencing, motor planning and much much more, there has to be a balance to let children be and discover. People do not fit into little boxes. If we put them there, we may never understand their true potential.\n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/will_wright_makes_toys_that_make_worlds.html"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2009/02/20/learning-a-process-of-discovery/", "title": "Learning: A Process of Discovery"},

The only two other times in my life that were highly memorable in terms of news-watching was the first man on the moon in 1968. I was only three but I remember it well. Of course, we all remember that atrocious day of 9-11. Today, I hardly watch the news. CNN is a plethora of pundits commenting on the news events. There is hardly a representation of real news anymore; by that I mean interviewing the people who are part of the story as opposed to onlookers who comment on the story. Thank you very much, but I think we should be reading such opinions from  The New York Times  or other older styles of news media that we held in our hands and contemplated. I for one still buy  The Atlantic ,  Harpers ,  Utne Reader  among others which I find intelligent and thoughtful. The demand for creating news 24/7 has not only overloaded us, but in my opinion, forces us to live on the periperhy of life, contrary to what we thought it would enable us to do. A lot of news doesn\u2019t make us more engaged in the world.  We might hear a lot of what is happening on our planet, but we are neither partaking in it, nor absorbing it well. I don\u2019t think I need to explain that this is happening in autism too because it is such a hot topic in the news. It\u2019s a very fine line because all this new media (it\u2019s sheer quantity), can also be an opportunity. Yet, in my experience in dealing with the media, there are journalists and programs few and far between that will devote the time, energy and funds to researching a topic for a great length of time. That documentary  \u201cPositively Autistic\u201d  (see one of the videos on the sidebar of this blog) took eight months to produce!

{"date": "2010/05/24", "body": "It is said that one should write something that they would like to read.  In those early autism years, as I was in that period of coalescing my arguments and thoughts about autism, I have enjoyed writing about Adam, motherhood, and our \u201cjourney.\u201d There is a sense of therapy to writing and that can be beneficial for many people undergoing a similar situation. Writing can help us transcend the feeling that we are \u201call alone.\u201d Yet I have the feeling after being a few years in this, that filtering autism down to miracles and gifts as well as horrors and tragedies has just become na\u00efve. It\u2019s time for all of us to up the ante (I am turning the finger towards myself here). There is no new take these days on writing an autism and this in and of itself seems to me that either I\u2019ve become over-saturated with the type of material, or I\u2019ve simply reached a new parenting stage and where it takes me with writing here, I am not yet sure. I have tried to post a few interesting presentations on the blog the past couple of weeks. There are so many performances and exhibitions, and art is a segue to complex ideas often then used and analysed also by science as much as science can influence art. Of autistic performance and exhibition, please don\u2019t label them as \u201cmiracles.\u201d I\u2019m fatigued by references to miracles. Autistic achievement, as is discussed so often here on the blogs, is so often referenced as gifted or miraculous.  There are no miracles. There is only what we wish to believe. We\u2019ve noted what a detriment to the autistic community such stereotyping can be. Even if it\u2019s true that autistic thinking is different, and of benefit to our society in many ways, this is no reason to call it gifted  or a \u201cmiracle.\u201d  When it comes to a play, or an autistic child typing, or a group of autistic children performing for an audience, I\u2019m really taken aback at references to the achievements being \u201cmiracles.\u201d  However, if we are referring to all of us as being \u201cmiracles,\u201d I sort of get that \u2014 I get that embrace of the miraculous state we call human. Miracles are a short-cut answer and resolution to that which is unresolvable. Try to tie it up with a convenient conclusion, and we will all fail. Acceptance is as acceptance does, and in all likelihood, the name is too simple while embracing everything . \u201cSimplicity embraces exactly the right details, the right difficulties, the right complexity,\u201d  but it also requires am effort in learning, observing, studying and yes, striving to argue well here in this contentious autism community. Acceptance is not simple. Autistic achievement is not a miracle, although it has been so unrecognized in human history that it is not surprising that we have labeled it as such. This is humanity we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s messy, difficult, wonderful, full of frustration, anguish and yes, joyful. And this may be the only miracle.

{"date": "2010/03/01", "body": "Now I know first hand what it\u2019s like to feel dark inside \u2014 when my child is disorganized and appears to be in pain and cannot tell me. These are the toughest moments when a parent feels helpless. Also frustrating are schools that claim they are there to support autistic children but will not take \u201cnon verbal\u201d autistic children. Believe me, the conditions out there in order to participate in society are just plain ridiculous and prohibitive, so I\u2019m going to make a strong plea to everyone \u2014 INCLUSION IS NECESSARY. Stop pretending to be inclusive to autistic children if they have to \u201ctalk and walk\u201d at the same time. It\u2019s  not  autism-friendly! Argh. Yet when I am feeling depleted, I fight it and I will urge every single one of you to do it too. For each one of us has that power, if we can be aware and monitor what\u2019s happening to us inside. It\u2019s important to remain honest with ourselves and then be able to step back from those feelings that can suck us down. I reach out for help. I call people. I call Adam\u2019s aides and therapists for help when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed. This is a good place to start. Always call for help and bring in only those who support you and your child in the manner that you need. Do not bring people in who will put you down, make you feel lower or try to fix your child. The most important thing you and your child need are love and respect. One thing I know FOR SURE, is that there comes a time in life when we really do have to muster every bit of strength we have and resist the calls of the demons. The echoes of   The Autism Everyday video and \u201cwanting to drive over the George Washington bridge  is like a siren call and this is why this kind of marketing \u2014 the kind that exploits and capitalizes on people\u2019s pain  \u2014  should be illegal in my opinion. It\u2019s not that I disrespect Allison Tepper Singer for her genuine feelings that might be expressed cautiously in a book or another venue.  It\u2019s about how those feelings were exploited for capital gain:  make autism desperate enough and we can raise money to cure it.  Well, I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: I believe this kind of marketing (consider type of presentation, method of delivery etc.,) is more harmful to parents than ever. People shouldn\u2019t have to stifle their feelings \u2014 that doesn\u2019t help and can an adverse effect. I\u2019ve read Sylvia Plath\u2019s  The Bell Jar  and it\u2019s all about wanting to die. Beautiful work exists because of honesty and by sharing honest feelings we do not feel alone.  There are expressions of hopelessness everywhere \u2014 and some quite well-written in fact. Yet these can be used to empower and can also be used as cautionary tales. It\u2019s the latter cautionary tale I wish to dwell upon.  People must reach out in a world where literature on loneliness prevails. In this past weekend alone, I\u2019ve found one book on  Lonely  by Emily White (it destigmatizes loneliness and  it is  an interesting read) and two articles on loneliness and depression ( The New Yorker  and a review of White\u2019s book in Saturday\u2019s Globe & Mail). It feels as if we live in a technologically hooked-up world that seems, in fact, to be coming socially undone. This morning I find the following story on the murder of an autistic child (see below) which is why  Autism Acceptance  is so vitally, URGENTLY  important \u2014 not just for parents but for society at large. Society must begin to realize the incredible challenges that families with autistic kids have when they are NOT included and accepted. If we are a community, then EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE.  I take the story of Gigi (excerpted below\u2026almost there) very seriously. It shows that no amount of money can fix anything. Better spent, is money accommodating autistic children and making sure every child gets a fair shot at being included and educated. If I have one dream, it would for  The Autism Acceptance Project  to raise more money to advocate more strongly that acceptance is a social responsibility, and to make a place where autistic kids can be fully accepted and receive an amazing education. My former neighbour  Mike Lipkin is motivational speaker extraordinaire and author of several books , one called  Strong Mind, Strong Heart , co-written with Dr. Bernard Levinson.  I\u2019m very good friends with his exceptional wife and herself an inspiration, Hilary. Re-reading some of his chapters after a very challenging couple of weeks with Adam reminded me how certain thoughts are defeating. Mike reminds us: \u201cAre you worried about your children\u2019s future? Are you unsure whether you\u2019re on the high road or the low road? Have you noticed that everyone you talk to has a different idea of where you should be going? Are you slightly confused? Are you a little exhausted by having to make so many decisions all of the time? Are you being bombarded by massive change? Is your brain frying?\u201d (p.88) \n I think that many parents can say  yes  to all of these questions.  We worry what will become of our children and where they\u2019ll end up. We want our kids to go to school, to have places to be social and be accepted there too. With so much negative information getting into our brains from the media or from individuals who believe that an autistic person is only better once they are cured, there are real dangers that lie ahead. By reading Gigi\u2019s story (still coming, I promise) it was clear that she was overwhelmed with trying \u201cfix the problem.\u201d When one discovers that autism cannot be fixed or changed, but perhaps begins to appreciate that while there are challenges, there are many advantages, life begins to look a little less desperate. I urge everyone to consider the list of what an autistic child contributes to the family instead of what s/he takes away. While the rhythm of life certainly changes, it is only those who can adapt and learn to walk to the beat of the new drum who will find joy in life. An autistic child demands that we learn to go with the flow. Mike Lipkin talks about this a bit, albeit not about autism specifically. He talks about how life \u201cwill hit you hard like hail from the sky.\u201d (p. 79) He says that people need to learn how to be resilient.  \u201cResilience is the ability to heal after a hurt. It\u2019s the knowledge that bad things happen in this world, but just because bad things happen, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re bad. People who lack resilience are people who invest too much negative meaning in what has happened to them. They obsess on the dark side of their psyche. They focus on why the knocks happened to them. They ask the fatal question: Why does this have to happen to me?\u201d  (p 80) We all have dark days. Autistic people also have dark days and learning to be resilient is hardest for them. The world is tough and it hits you hard.  And you have to fight it with everything you\u2019ve got. Gigi Jordan could not: A few weeks ago a terrible story unfolded in a posh midtown Manhattan hotel where a 49-year-old mother, Gigi Jordan, was found \u201cbabbling and incoherent\u201d beside the body of her eight-year-old son Jude, dead from an apparent overdose of ground up prescription pills, including Ambien and Xanax.  Later it was revealed Jude was autistic. In his press conference, the stunned and shattered father, estranged from his ex-wife and son for the last two years, said he had no idea what provoked his ex-wife to kill their child.  \u201cTo be honest, she was the most wonderful mother I\u2019ve ever seen. She left her business, left everything, just to take care of Jude.\u201d  Her oldest friend, Dr. Marcus Conant said, \u201cShe went to clinics all over the country looking for new treatments, grasping at straws, trying to fix the problem.\u201d \n The kind of hopelessness that Gigi faced might have been averted. Also new as a single mother, I know those nights when I feel I have no one to call upon. In those moments, I know I have to pull myself together again and remember that it\u2019s always darkest before the dawn. It doesn\u2019t have to be Adam that can make me feel this way. It could be a separation, a loss of a loved one. Mike Lipkin would agree: \u201cOne of the greatest sources of stress afflicting the people who come to us is the discontinuity that prevails everywhere. Just when our clients thought they had finally figured out a pattern, the pattern splintered into pieces again.\u201d (p. 88) That pattern in the autism world is expectation. If we expect our children to change, to be fixed, to adapt easily, we cannot be resilient parents. Mike suggests that we \u201csketch out many different paths\u201d in our minds to \u201ccreate an array of different possibilities.\u201d  He reminds us that not only is life unstable but that \u201cas human beings, we have deep-rooted desire for certainty and stability, \u201d and quotes Francis Bacon who nearly 400 years ago said, \u201cIf a man begins with certainties, he shall end in doubts. But if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.\u201d In autism too, there are no certainties. The article that talks about Gigi, talks about how the autistic brain \u201chardens\u201d at the age of eight, and it would make any parent want to cry if you\u2019ll believe it. Again, the article is somewhat misleading. It\u2019s only through misleading expectations that a child must be fixed before the age of eight or all is lost that sends many parents into a tailspin like Gigi. Not only is this inaccurate about autistic people, but it\u2019s this type of limited thinking that can stifle us and make us feel hopeless. I for one know that autistic people continue to learn and the possibilities are endless as they are for any human being. Instead, as Adam also turns eight this April, I will ask myself how Adam and I can make a difference in the lives of others who are also on this path. For helping others and having this self-ascribed mission helps us. We have opportunities to learn. Every hard-knock and experience is another opportunity to learn. We get our hard-knocks every single day every time a school or a program doesn\u2019t appreciate the special contributions Adam can make to the world. It\u2019s enough to make me want to start my own school \u2014 and I know many other parents feel the same way (can we harness this energy??). Do not listen to the media, but trust that your child is a human being filled with potential. The media will always be there, and sometimes it\u2019s just a good idea to turn it off or give it a hearty  guffaw  because you will be tempted to feel sorry for yourself and this will deplete your capabilities as a parent. Become the kind of warrior that fends off the demons of the mind and the media. Remember that every child has difficult times and when our autistic children have them, we have to take deeper breaths, ask for help and figure out where this journey is supposed to take us alongside our children. While times seem a little easier for those with special needs, there\u2019s a whole lot of discrimination still going on in our communities. WE have to change this together and support each other in our efforts. \u201cSo once again, here\u2019s one unchanging Life Principle over and over again,\u201d says Mike. \u201cYou need a Still Mind to think through the confusion and noise. The only way you can master the cacophony on the outside is to have harmony on the inside. Without inner harmony and quiet, you cannot have a Strong Heart. And without a Strong Heart, where are you going to find the resources to not only brave the darkness, but lead others as well?\u201d (p. 90). It looks like all of us have to lead. It is also important to stop listening to others and begin believing in ourselves and our children.\u00a0 We are forging ahead with a new demand in this world and that demand is that our children be integrated into our communities. For this, we need to be brave. Adam and I had a tough weekend adapting, still, to his new home. So much so that I\u2019ve asked his aide to bring him home early so we can begin implementing fun activities here and teach him some structure. It is my hope that he will swagger on his turf soon and we can both get back on the path of working on our mission which is to help others along in the  Inclusion Process . Yesterday morning, after a very dark night, I stopped my inner fight. I leaned in to Adam (who has difficulty speaking but not always understanding), and modeled language (this means that I say a sentence that he might wish to say himself in order to show him that I understand) while he was trying to soothe himself by playing on the computer.  \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well, Mommy,\u201d I said in a soft sweet voice. Immediately, Adam stopped what he was doing, came over and leaned his head of feather-hair into my arms for a hug, and we remained like that for a while.  As the day wore on, Adam became calmer and things got a little better. This morning, the sun came out and his happy grin made me shine inside.  If we can hold on, the sun will come out again and the possibilities are endless. But you have to believe it. I hope by sharing a bit of our story and adding some inspirational words from my friend Mike, I have helped anyone who is reading this a little too.

Perhaps a better title for this would be \u201cfor every downside, there is an upside.\u201d This is could be very true about the Human Genome Project. Today Carolyn Abraham reports on the front page of  The Globe and Mail  the recent publicity surrounding the findings of an international group of scientists trying to uncover the genes that comprise autism. Throughout the article, Ms. Abraham describes autism and it\u2019s \u201cgenes\u201d as a hiccup \u2014 \u201cgenes fouled up by long stretches of missing or duplicated pieces of DNA.\u201d   Doomsday is coming, or it could come. I know that there are parents who dread having a child with any disability. I understand that no two families are alike in the way they approach the subject. Yet there are families who do cope well; those of us who value the children we have and balk at the concept that humanity can be distilled into DNA. Of course, it can in a sense, but the complexities of being human cannot. I could tear this article apart. I am utterly offended by it, if I am to admit my leanings. I cringe at the thought of my son reading that he is a  \u201chiccup\u201d or a series of \u201cfouled up genes.\u201d  Just as important is the idea, the very scary idea I might add, that we can terminate an autistic pregnancy. The study co-author Peter Szatmari admits that the prospect of the commercial test that will prematurely reach the market \u201cmakes me nervous. I don\u2019t think we have the science yet to nail it down. This isn\u2019t one gene but a profile of genes, a pattern of susceptibility, not cause.\u201d As reporter Abraham writes, \u201cin the direct market age, the market rarely waits for more research.\u201d In other words, in a world that hardly understands disability, how disabled people live and feel, disabled pride, autistic pride, and rarely hears or listens to the voices of autistic people, parents may rush to pick up a screening test. Without this knowledge, what do you think is going to happen? Then it occurred to me: Adam\u2019s parents, that\u2019s right \u2014 his father and myself and his entire family \u2014 would likely have many of those genes \u2014 those \u201cfouled up\u201d ones in one way shape or form. Maybe this would mean I would not be here, his dad, his grandparents, his Bubby or his Zaida. \u201cIn all,\u201d says the Globe article, \u201cthe study spearheaded by post-doctoral fellow Dalila Pinto at Sick Kids, identified more than 100 genes affected in the people with autism, many of them forming a part of a network that governs how brain cells grow and talk to each other.\u201d Perhaps this comprehensive network is part of all of us that make up autism. Autism is an accentuation of our very human traits. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is doomsday approaching fast IF the dialogue about how we use science \u2014 how we implement knowledge \u2014 better be linked with a dialogue about not only what it means to be human, but the very right to be disabled, autistic and yes, what can be wonderful about that in our world that has been taught to fear disability.  There is a social aspect here that is running the show and we are a highly biased society against those with neurological differences and further, we write about autism as if it\u2019s the worst thing on the planet. In our family, and in many others that I know of, it is not. Premature reporting of scientific findings without a balanced argument (or even acknowledgment that there are people who prefer to be autistic) of this kind runs a very high risk.

He eventually yawned and put his head down on his pillow. It sounds \u201cnormal,\u201d I know.  Around here,  hums, noises, hand-flapping, smiles, and some words (difficult to come by) are our normal.  Also \u201cnormal\u201d is Adam\u2019s soft hair that I can\u2019t help recounting over and over because he presses his head gently into my face before he drifts off to sleep. Adam has adapted to his new school which will accommodate his special learning needs. Today, he brought home a Recognition Certificate for his accomplishments  \u2014 on focusing and \u201ccompleting daily tasks.\u201d I thought it was a wonderful idea to recognize his accomplishments. I loved it also because Adam was full of smiles when he came home from school today. Thankfully, his cheeks are still so round that when he does so they just get fuller like the moon. Time has not taken them from me yet. As his parent, I have a right to enjoy Adam\u2019s brief childhood. I\u2019ve been in this autism world for six-and-a-half years now with Adam (he is eight) and I\u2019m always breathtakingly amazed with the copious amounts of information about autism, usually presented in dire terms, that infiltrate parents negatively and make them worry. We worry so much that we blog, enter information on Facebook and Twitter about autism endlessly. Okay, let me speak for myself by hiding behind the \u201cwe,\u201d  won\u2019t you?  If we\u2019re not actively doing that, we at least read so much.  Worrying about our children, autistic or not, seems to be part of the parenting job.  We all want our children to learn. I am not against research or reading the information.  Yet I do think it\u2019s okay for parents to take a break from the autism tornados brewing out there. Autism doesn\u2019t steal our children. Fear and worry steal precious moments with our kids. It steals our happiness with what is. It might be the reason why I find it difficult or frustrating  to read some things these days. We still need more  \u201cpositive autism\u201d  out there. I cannot think of times more special than these: reading to Adam, watching him smile, being witness to every accomplishment (no matter how minor), and simply putting him to bed, to name a few. Thinking of how quickly this will pass \u2014 when he will no longer have the famous cherub cheeks and tiny-voiced giggles, well,  I want to know that while there was worry constantly spinning around  us, and a race to make Adam \u201cbetter,\u201d that I really did work on being the calm within the storm.

Like Aristotle, Sandel agrees that justice cannot be determined without an understanding of the following: 1) What abilities we recognize as worthy of honour and recognition and, \n2) the purpose of our social institutions. It seems to me that these are, in fact, the essential questions that we can ask ourselves as we discuss and debate the bigger questions like \u201cwhat is autism?\u201d and \u201cwhat kinds of help do autistics need to contribute to society?\u201d The question pertinent here, of course, is how and if we  regard autistic individuals as worthy and how we prove that we believe it.

As I continue to work with others regarding Adam, I proceed with caution. The goal in getting Adam to focus, still seems to hang  on getting him to stop these behaviours. We believe that once he stops, say, hand-flapping, he can \u201cstay on task.\u201d It\u2019s certainly a challenge if we expect Adam to do something in particular that other typical kids do.

{"date": "2010/12/19", "body": "I know that gait in a split second. The one where I can tell that someone is autistic. It\u2019s a little stiffer. The arms, they hang differently. The eyes blink and look intent on, say, a door. The door he is waiting to go through.  His brother comes. They look like identical twins. His brother\u2019s body looks a little more relaxed and he guides his stiffer brother through the door to the line up at Adam\u2019s favourite burger joint. \u201cWhat do you want on your burger, buddy?\u201d He pats his brother on the back. The stiffer brother wants the \u201casian\u201d onions, which are really only plain fried onions. I stand behind with Adam while the same young man briskly puts his two fingers in front of his eyes. Then his hand goes down.  I tap his brother on the shoulder. I don\u2019t usually do this. It\u2019s Adam\u2019s PD Day and just before the holidays.  \u201cMy son is similar,\u201d I say, smiling. \u201cOh, he\u2019s autistic?\u201d replies the fluid brother, the one who opened the door.  \u201cYes,\u201d I reply, Adam looking at the hot peppers he has taken to recently.

I  do  feel lucky but I\u2019m hoping the conversation won\u2019t take a negative turn, whatever that might be. After a tap on the shoulder, I could be entering territory I am not really prepared for today. Yet, I am curious. \u201cAre you twins?\u201d I continue. \u201cNah, he\u2019s my older brother,\u201d his face is friendly, and he seems to relish in the fact that his brother is older.

I get a little more story about the two brothers as Adam looks as if he\u2019s staring down the mustard behind the glass. The other brother, right ahead of Adam is looking at the asian onions, but I have a feeling he is paying attention. I know that Adam does. He will now respond to many things that I say, precisely when it appears he isn\u2019t listening. Adam often surprises me with his comments that often come a few long seconds, sometimes minutes, after I have finished talking. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice for me to see everyone out and about. I think for parents it\u2019s good for us to see that we all belong in our communities. I hope that older autistic people will help Adam. It gives me hope.\u201d We share a few niceties. The burgers are served and we eat in separate booths. Adam first eats the hot peppers, then pickles, tomatoes and finally, the onions, picking small pieces with a delicate pincer grip.  The actual hamburger is left to last, and he only takes a few bites. Suddenly, I feel a tap on my shoulder. \u201cMerry Christmas to you, eh?\u201d says the brother. His autistic brother is standing further back, facing our direction.  \u201cHey, thanks so much. Merry Christmas to you too.\u201d I turn to face his brother and smile. Although I wonder why I didn\u2019t address his brother directly while standing in the line,  I\u2019m still hoping that my way of saying hello was okay. I\u2019ve addressed and worked with other autistic adults before, but uncertainty lingers. I cringed inside, thinking of myself as that kind of person who addresses the aide, and not the handicapped individual. You know, like one typical person talking to another typical person as if the handicapped person is incapable. Maybe I was trying to find a way to segue into a possible inclusive conversation? Perhaps I was just trying to find that communion, there, standing in line? Approaching any new person isn\u2019t easy. I know I\u2019m appreciative of people who try to approach me. Respect isn\u2019t always smooth. I just wanted to talk and then I had thought of it afterwards like this. Still, I think I\u2019ll commit to tripping, fumbling and making mistakes. As long as it keeps leading me to new people and we can keep learning.

With separation and divorce, all kids and parents must traverse this similar path of custody arrangements. So, these absences are not entirely within my control, although even married, parents do have to leave their children for work, for travel, for one circumstance or another. Adam\u2019s Christmas vacation is split between mom and dad. While I\u2019m not with Adam, I want to build my life.

Sure, I have to accommodate the way in which he can be included in it, but that\u2019s a different post. Once in a while I get a report from his aide or teacher that he has asked for mommy while I am away. I can\u2019t tell you the wave of love and trememdous guilt that overcomes me when I get those reports, or lately, even a short email now from my son. Then, I tell myself that this is the test of our love: that we can miss each other and always return, the universe willing. Still, for a young boy, typical or autistic, a parent\u2019s absense must feel like the end of the world. Adam can\u2019t tell me the depth of feeling he must have, but I can imagine it. I can remember what it felt like when I was a child and I use those memories to help me in the way I treat Adam. \u201cCome with me,\u201d he says as he grabs my hand. Then the words don\u2019t come \u2014 he simply tugs. His cherub cheeks peek from behind his ample hood with a tuft of faux fur.

The findings, published in the  Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences  stated that \u201cthose children who demonstrated strong self control skills as early as age three were less likely to abuse drugs, and develop health problems, experience financial difficulties or be convicted of a crime.\u201d  The ability to control one\u2019s own behaviour is an indication, therefore, of future success. I guess that makes most of us the doomed portion of the population. I\u2019m not just writing this because I felt like I was reading a paper in 1900, not 2011. I\u2019m writing because I have an autistic child, where the controversy in his way of being is primarily described as behavioural \u2014 difficulties with attention, focus and impulse control. Children diagnosed with ADHD, ADD share similar impulse control \u201cissues.\u201d  It\u2019s an odd time we live in.  We diagnose every possible human way of being under the sun, while also being able to appreciate, paradoxcally, the creative contributions and potential of people with, as we say, \u201cdifferent kinds of minds.\u201d  Despite all our best efforts to use medications to control behavioural issues, the individuals we medicate are often incredibly able, talented, and have been, in fact, insanely successful. An official  ADHD website proudly lists successful people with the disorder , the list including Albert Einstein.   And this list.   In keeping with funny little lists,  here\u2019s one that cites some successful autistic people.    And another one. Most of us have heard and read about  Donald Treffert\u2019s work  in giftedness and autism, although not every autistic person possesses exeptional gifts (even though everyone is exceptional). The real issue seems not to be that the ability to exercise self-control makes us more successful, but in how we learn to work within the frameworks we\u2019ve got. The most heralded people of our culture are the ones who are able to think out of the box; in other words, differently.  Another issue is one of pedagogy. The study insinuates, for me anyway, that all children should be alike: focussed, sitting at their desks and compliant with their teacher. A child like Adam is a sure candidate then, to be banned from schools that use these criteria as a series of prerequisites. Sure, we all have to learn the rules, but the rules also have to bend for the accommodation of individuals so that they  can  learn. One example is having children move throughout their day in order to think. As physical programming gets slashed and Canadians, in a recent CBC report, are getting fatter, it might be no wonder how children have difficulty concentrating. There are many different ways to learn. Most autistic chidlren need sensory stimulation throughout their day, similarly, to be able to focus.  \u201cSelf-control is a vital skill for scanning the horizon to be prepared for what might happen to you, for envisaging your own future possibilities, for planning ahead to get where you want to go, for controlling your temper when life frustrates you,\u201d says Terrie Moffitt from Duke University, quoted in the article. Really? Can we truly plan ahead? I mean, a few years under my belt and I\u2019ve been stimied over and over at the universal joke: that life never ends up the way we plan. Nevertheless, we\u2019re all supposed to have a good one. While it\u2019s not the entire point of my post here, some of the reasons cited as necessary for being in control of oneself in the study seem a little silly. How many of us have had behavioural issues in our lifetime, or a real diagnosis effecting our ability to control our impulses? Have the researchers considered the contributions made to our society by individuals who have severe difficulties with it? How many of us might have to use many accommodations throughout our day in order to be \u201csuccessful\u201d \u2014 the very word raising many other questions on what success really means? \u201cYou\u2019re training people to think about long-term consequences of their behaviour,\u201d Professor Piquero was quoted.  Indeed. \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/self-control-at-an-early-age-helps-avoid-pitfalls-study/article1881494/", "http://www.add-adhd-treatments.com/Famous-People.html", "http://www.mindgameslearning.com/Home/Resources/ADHD101/SuccessfulPeoplewithADHD/tabid/109/Default.aspx", "http://ezinearticles.com/?11-Amazing-Autistic-Famous-People&id=543023", "http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_on_the_autism_spectrum", "http://http://daroldtreffert.com/"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2011/01/26/about-control/", "title": "About Control"},
{"date": "2011/06/14", "body": "\nI\u2019m going to ramble about good feelings. Following the shock of last week \u2014 hearing that Adam\u2019s class was going to be dismantled \u2014 I felt like I was in another hurricane. That short story ended quickly, though, as the school came through to accommodate Adam for next year. They too understood the tumult he has been through. For me, it was a wake up call to our future. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know something\u2019s coming, right? It\u2019s interesting how something has to happen to get us to the next level. The occurrence reminded me that it\u2019s time to leave the past behind, and get back to learning the next phase of advocating for Adam\u2019s needs. It\u2019s also time for him to learn that he\u2019s autistic and what\u2019s involved in that so he can begin advocating for himself. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think that he knows he\u2019s different. What he needs is a toolbox of self confidence and skills to be able to stand up to the people I stand up to now as a neurotypical person.  It\u2019s another reason why I love  Autistic Pride Day  which is on  June 18th . I imagine what positive messages we can give to our children while they are growing up (for there are otherwise too few) \u2014 that difference is neither good nor bad, it just is. We are all unique individuals with differing needs and strengths. It\u2019s important to be proud of ourselves, even if we have our challenges. We are proud to be autistic, or family members of autistic people. I would like to help empower and enable Adam in this way. A walk next year (as there is little time to prepare this year), would be a wonderful, peaceful way to walk proud. Change has blown in in so many ways. It is because of times like the school news that I need to celebrate Adam, myself and the people we love. We are losing his aide of seven years and are welcoming a new one into our lives. We\u2019ve hired a new male aide worker on weekends who I hope will become a part of Adam\u2019s life. His team is shape-shifting and I see Adam soon sitting around the table for part of our meetings and later, for all of them as he tells us what he wants to do with his life and how we can best support him. Sometimes all of these changes literally knock me off my feet they are so exhausting, which is why I take as much time as I can to beam. There is love all around and I don\u2019t take it for granted. There is a person in our lives and lots of music and good feelings all around. I no longer feel I\u2019m swimming way off in the deep ocean. I believe I am arriving at shore \u2014 or the ship I\u2019ve been building is at least sturdy enough to lead us there. The really simple things make me extremely happy. The pummels and disappointments \u2014 whether they be from our past or about school \u2014 make these moments even more special. I can tell we are settling as I can\u2019t wait for Adam to come home from school. I used to be so tired and worried about Adam\u2019s distress. Just last year he was spasming so much he needed an EEG.  Now, he saunters into the house with his lunch bag, flicks off his shoes and runs down the hall to the kitchen where his snack awaits. After reminding him to wash his hands, he perches himself at the counter and noshes at red peppers or fruit. If that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019ll ask (lately) for popcorn with vinegar (yes, that\u2019s right). He\u2019ll get the popcorn himself and after learning that pressing too many buttons on the microwave actually locks it, he turns to me and asks, \u201cPopcorn, puweeze.\u201d He is not quite satisfied until I open the package and turn on the microwave. Then, he\u2019ll go into the pantry and grap the large plastic jug of white vinegar. \u201cVinegar, puwezze.\u201d He hands over the heavy jug so I can pour it on top (yep) on top. He moves back to the counter stool and gets the popcorn from the bottom of the bowl first so it\u2019s soaked, and chews on one piece at a time I can also tell we are settling by our routines. Adam nestles into my arm at the end of each day while I watch Peter Mansbridge on  The National . Sorry, Peter, but you put my son nicely to sleep. Adam his happy to watch with me quietly for a while. Then his eyes begin fall shut slowly and when he\u2019s breathing deeply, I carry him to his bed, even though he keeps getting heavier. As I pull the baby blue blanket right up to his chin, he is grinning with his eyes tightly closed. \u201cGoodnight my sweetheart,\u201d I say. I kiss him and leave the room, remembering myself at his age, just as happy when my mother or father did the same.  I feel like  Jodie Foster in Little Man Tate.   Sure, we are not as verbally articulate, but we are no less expressive. We understand each other. We have our many ways. Like them, Adam and I lie around and watch the clouds together; and I hold him tight when the lights are low and the house is quiet except for the whir of traffic outside.  Without disturbing too much privacy, I think there are only a few things I can share as Adam\u2019s ally \u2014 simply because I need to express these good times \u2014 like his love of music, for one. Adam also has some cool dance moves. This is a combination of raising his arms up in the air to swaying them with the rest of his body side to side, to a full on  rock on  jump and hand flap \u2014 and let\u2019s not forget his electric smile. Adam is increasingly adept at piano and tries his hand at guitar (I think he prefers guitar \u2014 no lessons involved). There is no question that he has artistic ability (see photo).    This could just be becoming the happiest time in our lives.  That\u2019s why the news of last week was so upsetting because it takes so long to find balance and when there are additional challenges with a child, the last thing one wants is more.  I know there are more challenges ahead, but today I decide to take in the light breeze. I was once told when Adam was first diagnosed that this was going to be a \u201cmarathon, not a sprint.\u201d Well, after a few years now, I don\u2019t just think it\u2019s a marathon\u2026it\u2019s Ironman. All of the work is really important, especially in a world that still does not fully understand and accept autism, but it\u2019s not everything. It\u2019s not what Adam will remember or what will necessarily trigger his heart.  He\u2019s going to remember when I carried him to bed and pulled the blanket under his chin. He\u2019s going to remember lounging out in the yard and watching and naming the clouds with me when I\u2019m gone. I think the work that we do goes without saying, but it\u2019s also important to stop and listen to the music, to experience love. It\u2019s everything.

{"date": "2010/11/14", "body": "At what point do we stop participating in research studies? I think about this as I receive another request to do so with Adam. We\u2019ve received many of these notices and requests over the years to participate in one research study or another \u2014 none of them very appealing to me. Adam is eight. He began his life as any other infant and toddler. Then suddenly, at the age of 19 months, before he was two (!), he was diagnosed as autistic. Everything at that point changed in our family life, although Adam had never changed. Our views of him had changed by virtue of a label, a screen through which we now saw him. We spent time in doctor\u2019s offices, with diagnosticians and therapists galore. Life has been nothing but a stream of experts and research trying to  figure  him out. As his mother, I\u2019ve accompanied Adam on this journey, and even subjected him to this. Although I\u2019ve always been so inclined, and this is likely a natural progression for me, I feel as if I\u2019m entering a period of trying to look at myself objectively as his parent and how I need to figure  myself  out. How have I managed, after all, with autism and the many things that life brings? I am becoming far less anxious about what Adam will be when he grows up to trying to figure out what will make us simply content in the day-to-day. The work we need to do should be less about fixing people than on creating an inclusive, welcoming communities. After all, life is extremely fragile. The odds of being born are slimmer than we imagine. Nature has a way of aborting the \u201cwrong combinations\u201d of genes. Yet, there are so many fragile people who have usurped the odds and reached the point of being born. Who is to say that autism or any other disability in this sense, then, is \u201cwrong?\u201d Perhaps there is no real genetic \u201corder,\u201d and \u201cnormal,\u201d is not one complete genetic sentence. It is a new way of looking at disability. It is a new way I can look at Adam who continues to overcome so many odds. Adam is here. He forced his way into the world and he not only survives \u2014 he thrives. Today I can\u2019t stop thinking about Adam\u2019s quality of life, and what that means for him, not me, although the quality of mine seems to improve everytime I look at Adam and enjoy him. He must be taught, he will grow, and he will develop his own need for independence. No matter how severely disabled one is, the will to be so is strong in all of us, even when we need others to assist us in our daily lives. I\u2019m reluctant to be a part of research studies as they are crafted right now \u2014 to subject Adam to batteries of tests and \u201cexperts,\u201d even if some of these studies may be valuable. I know there are some disorders that may benefit from studies, although my thoughts are still inconclusive on this. Still, I do not want Adam to view his life as if he is living in a sort-of test tube. I do not want to get angry at people who will view, by virtue of their research role, on-looker and so forth, Adam as a subject or a pathology. Hey, he made it after all. He deserves to be here. Researchers should be throwing rose petals at his feet! (Hmmm, that\u2019s an idea. Celebrate life. Novel.) So I don\u2019t participate. We don\u2019t need false expectations and I don\u2019t need the pain of prejudice, that is, that subtle suggestion that we should be doing something to change Adam and make him better. I am much more interested in, not the genetic code, those \u201cincomplete genetic sentences,\u201d if you will. I\u2019m interested in book of life we are writing \u2014 fragmented to full sentences, idiosyncratic spelling, words, noises and all. We are born to give back to the world, to contribute, and to find the beauty in our lives. As I grow a little older, I no longer see the value in competition, in being the best. I see the necessity of working together in creating a more just world. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2010/11/14/at-what-point/", "title": "At What Point?"},
{"date": "2011/04/04", "body": "More Magazine is a Canadian magazine that \u201ccelebrates women over 40.\u201d I eagerly sought the April 2011 issue as I knew that  Kim Pittaway, who did this article also about Adam and myself , also wrote an article about Michelle. I learned during the interview process that unlike most reporters I had been dealing with the past few years, Kim had been spending a  lot  of time with autistic people.  I met Michelle in 2006 during the  Joy of Autism: Redefining Ability and Quality of Life  event I organized. We spoke and I also sought advice from her about the very title of the event, to what autism advocacy from might look like in order to be fair to autistic people.  It wasn\u2019t all easy for me in those early days in trying to understand what \u201cadvocacy\u201d could be. We all want to \u201chelp,\u201d and as a parent with a young autistic child, I wanted my son to be accepted and understood. It was easy to get confused with the fundraising models to which I became accustomed; before I bore a child with a disability. I learned from Michelle who helped me at the time, to use the following words when I founded  The Autism Acceptance Project  whose mission became \u201cto help autistics contribute to society as autistic people.\u201d The words continue to resonate in Canada where we still seek to change the autistic person. Autism advocacy, for the most part, fails. It has failed because it relies on pity models \u2014 poor person with  fill in blank .  I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want to be like that. I\u2019m sure they want to be cured; to be normal. So glad I\u2019m not like him/her. I should give money to help that horrible circumstance.   Not to be too cynical here, but study the Disability Rights Movement over the years and one will learn why the whole way we look at disability, autism and how we raise awareness must change. Pity models don\u2019t support people to get what they need in order to become active members of our communities. They suggest that people have to be normalized in order to do so. Bringing Michelle, Laurent Mottron and Morton Ann Gernsbacher, to speak about the short-comings of ABA and the science to support autistic intelligence at the event in Toronto came with a price tag. We received a lot of nasty letters. I learned afterwards that many ABA advocates actively boycotted the event. Yet, I learned, and continue to learn, so much from Michelle and individuals like her. As a fellow woman I admire her intelligence and tenacity in a world where it\u2019s easier to just get along rather than actively push for truth in order to fairly support autistic individuals. As a mother of an autistic son, I am grateful for her work. A quote from Michelle in  More Magazine: I became involved in [the Auton case \u2014 when a group of parents fought the BC government to pay for ABA treatment and Michelle intervened] becuase the false and unethical claims and practices by both sides had a drastic effect on the well-being of autistics in Canada,\u201d says Dawson. \u201cI intervened as one such autistic, who had lived the consequences and would continue to live the consequences. I was an early autism parent, that is, Adam was not even two years old when I began reading Michelle\u2019s work at  No Autistics Allowed , when my emotions ran high and every parent of an autistic child at the time urged me to enrol Adam in ABA (early intervention behavioural therapy) as soon as possible \u2014 before it was \u201ctoo late.\u201d  Or else, they said, he would be doomed to a life with autism. Well here we are and Adam is about to turn nine. I don\u2019t feel we are doomed, even if we have special needs. Michelle\u2019s work along with Dr. Mottron\u2019s continues to be a part of my journey as Adam\u2019s mother.

{"date": "2011/04/04", "body": "Recently, the CDC proposed a separate criteria for wandering in autism.  You can find the PDF here.  I have received permission from the  Autism National Committee (AUTCOM)  to make this letter available to readers in response to the proposal: Dear Ms. Pickett: We are writing as a coalition of organizations representing a wide variety of different constituents in the disabilities field. We include organizations run by people with disabilities as well as those run by parents, other family members, professionals, providers and many others. Our coalition also includes groups representing a wide array of different kinds of disability categories, including developmental disabilities, mental health conditions, physical disabilities and sensory disabilities. We are writing to express our profound concern about the proposed ICD-9-CM code for wandering discussed at the last meeting of the ICD Coordination and Maintenance Committee on March 9th-10th. While wandering behavior leading to injury and death represents an important and legitimate safety issue for the disability community, we are concerned that the proposal put forward by CDC\u2019s National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD) is not rooted in high quality research and has significant potential unintended consequences for people with disabilities and family members. We encourage the National Center for Health Statistics to reject an ICD-9-CM coding for wandering behavior as ill-advised and inappropriate. First, a code for wandering behavior could limit the self-determination rights of adults with disabilities. The wandering coding has no clear operational definition and thus no limits to its application. The proposal makes no distinction between wandering behavior that would qualify for the coding and a rational and willful effort by an individual with a disability to remove oneself from a dangerous or uncomfortable situation. For individuals with significant communication challenges, attempting to leave a situation may be one of the only ways of communicating abuse, a sensorily overwhelming situation or simple boredom. We are concerned that if this coding enters the ICD-9-CM such attempts at communication will be disregarded as medical symptoms. Second, a code for wandering behavior could lead to serious unintended consequences in professional practice for schools and residential service-provision settings for adults with disabilities. Restraint and seclusion in schools and in residential service-provision settings is already a persistent problem. The application of this coding may result in increased restraint and seclusion as a way of preventing wandering behavior, supplanting required active support, person-centered planning and appropriate supervision. In addition, we are concerned that this coding may enable other forms of overly restrictive interventions and settings. For example, individuals with disabilities who are labeled with a wandering coding may be less likely to be included in the general education classroom, more likely to be placed in large group homes or institutions and more likely to experience chemical restraint. Each of these issues already represents a critical problem for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities that this coding may exacerbate. For example, while only 18% of adults on the autism spectrum receiving developmental disability services have a diagnosis of mental illness, 41% of such individuals are receiving psychotropic medications, suggesting a high incidence of chemical restraint. Third, the proposed ICD-9-CM code for wandering behavior lacks research support and is not based on evidence or a controlled examination of the issues involved. No research exists to look at wandering as a medical rather than behavioral issue. The research which CDC relies on to make the case for this coding is weak. For example, one of the statistics that CDC cites (that 92% of families of children on the autism spectrum report at least one or more incidents of wandering) comes not from a high quality research study, but instead from an online poll on the website of an advocacy organization. This is not in line with the high standards for research and evidence that CDC\u2019s bases its other decision-making on. While we respect the good intentions behind the creation of this coding, we firmly believe that there are other ways of accomplishing the positive objectives of this coding without placing people with disabilities and our families at risk of the same unintended consequences. Other methods of data collection around wandering can and are being pursued by both public and private funders. In addition, a wide variety of human services and educational approaches hold significant promise in addressing the issue of dangerous wandering behavior outside of a medical context. As a result, we strongly urge you to reconsider and reject the proposed ICD-9-CM coding for wandering behavior.

{"date": "2011/04/06", "body": "I\u2019m a horrible mother. This thought entered my mind early Monday morning. Adam left for school. I leaned down and he smiled at me and kissed me goodbye, puckering his blushed lips, looking\u00a0into my eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to carry your lunch bag,\u201d I urged, trying to teach him to become as independent and responsible for himself as possible. He grabbed the blue handle brusqley and walked out the front door in his spring jacket. At nearly nine years of age, he looks like a little man with a miniature brief case. He turns around, revealing a glimpse of soft skin. \u201cI wuv you mummy, yes. B-bye.\u201d I closed the door and headed to the window to wave the way I always do. Adam looked up at me as the car pulled away. Adam\u2019s birthday was a week away \u2014 a few days from now as I write this. It was March Break a couple of weeks ago and he was with his dad. We alternate that holiday every year and it was my time to do my own thing.  Am I supposed to have fun? Am I supposed to fall in love again and rebuild my life?  It\u2019s so different being a single mother.  I panic, noting the date in my head.  Which friends do I invite?  Adam doesn\u2019t get invited to very many play dates. Instead, we do programs and school. During programs he at least receives the attention and assistance he needs. There is structure. At least he is happy, but I\u2019m missing him when he is in those programs. I still wish he had friends who came over to visit him in his own home. Adam and I are so dependent on each other for friendship. Then there is our issue these days of him being terrified going to new homes. We have to work on that the way I said we would a few months ago. We have to visit friends on weekends, for ten minutes or so at a time, at least that\u2019s my plan.  We could work our way up to more time and voil\u00e0, Adam will be used to new homes. Why haven\u2019t we done more of it?  Parenting is tough work, period. It\u2019s also important to enjoy our children. I think it has to be stated even more so when there is such pressure for us parents to be super-charged teachers or \u201cwarrior moms (and dads).\u201d We need more balance in terms of what our roles should be and the supports we and our children deserve. Right, there\u2019s the PECS I have to print out. The team told me I have to label more around the house \u2014 they give me a lot of tasks. \u00a0More schedules. Safety rules to teach, the phone skills he needs to learn now. I\u2019ve managed to at least put the PECS on the phone. It\u2019s waiting to be programmed. There was that four page instruction list of OT recommendations for evenings in order to keep Adam organized and ready him for bed. There is the homework we do \u2014 at least I\u2019m good at\u00a0 that, piano practice. Adam is exhausted by the end of a long school day and likes to entertain himself on YouTube for a while.  But we have so much work to do\u2026. I\u2019m exhausted by all this planning and coordinating of people. I\u2019m guilty that I\u2019m exhausted,\u00a0some days, and wonder if I\u2019m a good enough mom.  I should be teaching him more on the iPad, his Vanguard \u2014 crap, I forgot I have to do that too and program it.  Then there\u2019s typing, reading books and comprehension questions I have to ask him every day. Reading an article in the Globe & Mail yesterday,  Autism: Tracking a Decade of Treatments , and Dr. Cummings states that treatment includes looking \u201cat the role of parents in working with their kids at home.\u201d  Holy *&^6. I\u2019ve been doing this for nearly a decade and you want to lay on more? The reality is, Adam comes home from school, eats his snack, likes to hang around me leisurely in my office or in the kitchen. We do homework, a bit of music and music comes easily to us. He sits beside me and we play duets and it feels like the path of least resistance when we are simply relaxed, doing stuff together. Later, has a shower and winds down for bed. I mean, how much time is there really in the day to be super autie mom? Heck, forget the autie part. There are some moms who home school and nurture genius. Maybe I\u2019m just not one of them. Life has changed. I try my best, even if some days I feel my best isn\u2019t good enough. They are moms who run those PECS off every day at their computers. They are moms who crack the whip so their kids learn to type and\u00a0publish\u00a0books. I try to just keep things moving, negotiating with people in the background, but who are in the foreground of Adam\u2019s life. For me, that\u2019s a full time job right now. I\u2019d guess that for all of us it is. It hits me. I\u2019m learning my limitations as a mother and as the person I am. I\u2019m learning what I need to do and how to do it so that there is abudance of happiness, not stress, in my home. My laundry list of worries is part of my awakening. I\u2019m really good at the most important part of mothering Adam. That is, loving him. Lately he calls my name a whole lot more. So I guess he knows it. At least I know it too. Party time.

{"date": "2011/04/14", "body": "Adam has a new teacher at school. Immediately, she ripped down the clutter on the walls that distracted Adam. She has Adam learning about money, in \u201ctaking circles\u201d with the other children. Reports are Adam is doing well in school and wants to pay attention. Before this teacher, we were worried about Adam\u2019s attention and even tried Ritalin for a couple of days. It just took two days and I couldn\u2019t take watching my son transform into a person I didn\u2019t recognize \u2014 his eyes glazed over and his legs twitched uncontrollably. Adam lost his joy and personality which seemed like much too big a sacrafice even though he was completing tasks like a robot on speed. I polled numerous parents who do have some success with this and asked how long it actually takes to get the meds \u201cright.\u201d Some parents said \u201cyears,\u201d and \u201cnever,\u201d because a child continues to grow. I don\u2019t have the stomach for it. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned as Adam\u2019s parent. I look at some parents and see what levels of creativity they have in awe. I can\u2019t muster the energy to build castles, a volcanic model\u2026 yet. Okay, I\u2019m not that bad. I do lots of things with Adam. Mainly, I enjoy just being with him \u2014 going for walks, to the park, drives, to restaurants, and playing games here at home. I enjoy learning to play music again and Adam often plays the piano next to me \u2014 I like that and it comes naturally. In the summer, we enjoy swimming. I just don\u2019t have the stomach for the endless trial and error to get Adam to become \u201cnormal.\u201d In the quest for a cure, I have seen that Adam loses his essence. So it\u2019s official: I can love him and have my limitations too. In my journey, I\u2019ve learned that other people have to be his teachers now. It is good for Adam to learn from others. I see him becoming more independent and communicative at home. I am really good at loving him, and well, being his parent. I get top marks for that, I think. So I\u2019m thrilled that one teacher can make such a big difference \u2014 that Adam can pay attention without medication. It should make us all think, as parents, what we can do to help proliferate this need for great teachers and schools \u2014 to create lucrative enough opportunities for teachers to want to stay in the profession, and with our kids. Sure, I don\u2019t know what the future has in store. My ideas of it are always shifting. I\u2019m just trying to have faith that everything will work out the way it is supposed to. \u2014 On another note, I\u2019ve been wanting to write that Adam had his ninth birthday party on Sunday. Most of the kids from Adam\u2019s school have never attended a birthday party before. Like them, Adam rarely gets invited to parties. It is but one unfortunate fact of the autistic life that people need to know and understand. I try to create opportunities for socialization and had typical kids in with the group. I hired a company that brings snakes and an alligator in order for the kids to be engaged and kept a lot of structure, which was successful. The \u201cspecial needs\u201d kids were so grateful and polite. I heard a lot of thank you\u2019s that day. Later in the week, my mother sat in my kitchen. \u201cThat was the loveliest kids birthday party I\u2019ve ever been to,\u201d she said. \u201cThe kids were so nice.\u201d Her face changed to a look of awe. \u201cUsually you go to birthday parties with typical kids and they are all spoiled and complaining. These kids were so mature.\u201d I felt eubuillant when she said that because I felt it too. If only everyone knew. If only everyone knew that  the kids with challenges are not \u201cbehavioural\u201d because they are spoiled, but because something in the moment is truly frustrating and difficult. If only they could have seen what my mother recognized. Maybe we\u2019d be invited to more parties.

I always like to commend magazines that include articles on autism. I feel that the more awareness there is, the easier it is for parents to begin to accept and involve their child with autism in the community. As a senior IBI (intensive behavioural intervention) therapist, I develop and implement programming for children with autism and work closely with families to help develop skills. I must admit that I found this article refreshing with its focus on the joys that children with autism often offer. Parents can become so focused on making gains that they forget to enjoy all the little moments of joy. As a parent of three children, I always try to encourage the families I work with to enjoy their child just as they would any other child, and to embrace those little moments of joy that children with autism so often provide.  \u2014  Rebecca Grezegorczyk, St. Thomas, Ontario. \n Fabulous!

{"date": "2011/05/04", "body": "As an only child and single mother to an autistic son, I have to be honest that I sometimes find myself grumbling about holidays. I know it sounds very cynical of me, but hear me out.  Another hallmark holiday can make me feel left out. Our kids are supposed to make us cards, buy us flowers, gifts and tell us how wonderful we are. Usually, there is a husband to make the kids abide if the kids are too busy playing Xbox. I remember fondly making those cards and telling my mom how much (and still do) love and appreciate her. In my case, my dad didn\u2019t always have to remind me. Adam can\u2019t make me a card; at least not without the help of another person.  So, another holiday comes and that\u2019s the pang. I can\u2019t get rid of the holiday. Millions of people this Sunday will go out and buy flowers, and make their kids make cards for mom and grandma \u2014 another fuss. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think it\u2019s lovely that people want to celebrate their family members. If I had gotten the date right this year, I may have even made a tea for my girlfriends and their mothers. Part of me does it to avoid self-pity. Another part does it because I believe in making celebrations out of just about everything, not necessarily on holidays. This Mother\u2019s Day,  I\u2019ll probably visit my mother for coffee with Adam and I know she and my father will give me their good wishes.   As Mother\u2019s Day approaches, I think of the daily moments I share with Adam; how much we\u2019ve been through together and how much I wanted him. I waited until my late thirties to have him. Other\u2019s have forced him to make cards and say \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day mummy\u2026 I wuv you,\u201d and he repeats it obediently, hands me the card made with construction paper and crayons.  Sure, I love the card and keep them in a special box, but I know he doesn\u2019t care about it so much.  Today, he cares about the items he can make on his own volition. He cares about when I am there for him and can comfort him or love him just because.  In return, I receive his voluntary hugs and kisses, his laughter, his smile, his pulling me towards him and saying my name. At night as I tuck him into his favorite blanket, he\u2019ll say in his little voice, \u201cdon\u2019t go.\u201d  In this house, Adam\u2019s affection and his ability to express himself are like daily holidays. If your child has difficulty talking, you\u2019ll understand these actions and the few words as the gifts that moms like us receive. Mother\u2019s Day? I can see Adam laughing inside if he really understood the nuances of being forced to celebrate Mother. I mean, love is love. Period. He knows it well. For us moms whose children cannot and may not make cards and say I love you this year, don\u2019t despair. I hear you and I\u2019m with you. Be proud of your mothering efforts and happy that we are moms of our wonderful children. I don\u2019t know about you, but I never get the feeling that Adam doesn\u2019t love me. Just because he can\u2019t always express it in words, or as slick as a Hallmark card, I feel ocean waves of love and appreciation every single day.

{"date": "2011/06/30", "body": "There is a lot of change facing Adam again and I, as his primary care-giver. After all the years of worrying about schools, I see that we may have a variety of options that may require us to re-juggle our days. I knew this day would come. I wrote about many things regarding schools and it\u2019s not easy to be in the midst of it and have an opinion at the same time.  The process of evaluation has now begun: the eclectic ABA school, the public or Catholic school, the online/homeschool options are on my list. Don\u2019t you just love when people think that there is a rainbow of autistic schools out there that actually suit every autistic child on the planet?  The road called \u201cevaluation\u201d is filled with opinion and advice. Everyone has a thought about what\u2019s best. I am taking each word in and processing it slowly. Although September is only two months away, I know this cannot be rushed. This requires a lot of questioning about what\u2019s best for Adam, for his autistic learning style, his levels of anxiety as well as his other interests and needs. I have been making long lists of my assumptions versus the reality of how Adam will best grow, and grow happily. School is a tricky thing. We tend to view it as the ultimate socializer for our children and a place where they should get everything they need. For any child, I tend to want to question our way of thinking about school (and sure, of course, making this a whole lot harder on myself, as usual). The United Commission on Human Rights Statement on the Right to Education , written in 1999, reads: The core human rights standards for education include respect of freedom. The respect of parents\u2019 freedom to educate their children according to their vision of what education should be has been part of international human rights standards since their very emergence. In her book  Home Educating For Autistic Children: Paths Are Made By Walking , Terri Dowty and Kitt Cowlishaw write:  We all know just how difficult it can be to reclaim the responsibility for our children\u2019s education \u2014 or to decide not to relinquish to a school in the first place. Parenthood is riddled with guilt, under-confidence, and a sneaking fear that our children might be better off in more qualified hands\u2026 \n A child is to school as bread is to butter. Perhaps that was true to some extent in the days when knowledge was a restricted commodity; however, we now inhabit a world where access to information on any subject imaginable is only a library ticket or a mouse click away. As society changes, the sacred cow of education has come to resemble a rather less exotic domestic beast, prompting thousands of parents to take the leap of faith into providing it themselves, in co-operation with their children.  I have to decide soon what is best for Adam\u2019s day, which could be a combination of things. I will be dedicating my summer (and I\u2019m sure other falls and winters) to this. I can relate to the pressure of outside opinion, or the preconceived notions that being in school is better without really thinking about it deeply. Probably, like all things, a little bit of everything is true.  The one area I wonder about, is that autistics do better when they are socialized in a school setting. Certainly, for most autistics, this becomes the only place where they get any socialization, but school programs aren\u2019t always set up just to work on social skills or even just to be social in an autistic way. Again, what kinds of programs are best suited for the autstic person? Where do we all get our social fix? Does this all have to happen in school?  Autistic people are not always wanting to be social in a typical way and it\u2019s not always fair to assume that they must have our same skill set. Yet, it might also not be fair to equip an autistic person with the skills they may require in order to feel like they can at least manage friendships with neurotypical people. This is so tricky and we need to acknowledge that it is and be careful with autistics so that we do not bombard with just neurotypical ways.  Regarding school as the primary source of everything, Dowty and Cowlishaw continue: We are now so ready to accept that school is the means by which children become socially competent that it is tempting to wonder how society managed to advance beyond grunting until the advent of compulsory mass schooling. I\u2019m one of those parents, like thousands of you before me, who are pushing through the bush of assumption about what school is and what is best for Adam. There is confusion for everyone out there and even more so for autistic people who have even fewer options.\n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2011/06/30/what-about-school/", "title": "What About School?"},
{"date": "2011/05/14", "body": "I\u2019m going to write this raw and unedited. Have you ever been so scared that you literally wet yourself? I did today. I lost Adam.  I took him to Sportball. It takes place in a church \u2014 they don\u2019t lock the doors. All the kids are special needs. The gym is in the basement. I usually go and his instructor has responsibility for a bunch of kids. We\u2019ve not really had difficulty like this before, but I could see it coming. I ordered the shoe tags, a GPS, but they haven\u2019t arrived yet. Adam\u2019s father reported that Adam tried to bolt last weekend.  So I turned to Adam\u2019s instructor to address the issue. In just one second (no exaggeration), Adam was gone. I knew I had to move quickly because Adam is so fast, but they tried to reassure me he was ok, so I thought they moved a little slowly. I ran around the entire church \u2014 full of rooms, nooks and crannies. The front doors to the outside were locked. But there were more doors. An alarm went off. I ran outside screaming for Adam, I ran back in to look in between pews. He was gone. Someone called 911. I peed my pants, running and running, hoping my desperate voice would trigger his tiny \u201chere I am,\u201d voice, but nothing. One more run back into the main sanctuary, and there he was under the cross, peering behind the curtain, on the altar. I grabbed him and couldn\u2019t stop crying\u2026sorry it\u2019s hard for me to write because I\u2019m starting to cry again. Adults came in to say that they saw him running outside the church. He could have run out to a very busy street alongside the church. He could have been really hurt. No one stopped him. No one thought of it. Even those who knew him. I guess people thought we must have been nearby. I held him so tight when I found him on the altar.  I\u2019ve called my team and my parents because I need support right now.  Adam\u2019s impulse to explore, especially go through every door, has become insatiable. I do have extra inside locks on every door of my house, and lucky too because I can see he\u2019s trying to unlock the regular ones. I\u2019ve managed to keep us safe and myself sane in my home, but now I see I have to deal with this aggressively and he cannot be left unattended. I\u2019d also wish to suggest for programs for special needs kids (or maybe all kids) that the doors be locked so kids can\u2019t just disappear this easily. It seems to be a huge oversight and a lack of accommodation. I\u2019m so glad I have him because after five minutes of searching and calling out frantically, I thought I was going to be one of those parents you hear about on the news. I don\u2019t want to come that close ever again. Not only will he always have a shadow with him now, there will be more aggressive teaching about safety and more positive reinforcement for staying and asking for permission to explore. I also implemented intuitively (and later read) that it\u2019s really important to take your kids on the same routes all the time. They will usually want the same routes and can either be found or will find their way home. As Adam ran outside, he managed to find an open door back into the church.

I thought, just when things seemed to be going so well\u2026another challenge. Then, my ceiling leaked from the rain. Ah well, I said to myself as I opened my eyes this morning. At least Adam had the sense to re-enter that church all by himself. At least there was no tragedy. At least my roof isn\u2019t caving in. Someone is coming to look at it hopefully later today. I think it\u2019s good to let the down go through us \u2014 to hibernate after an event like this. But I also reached out. I contacted every team member, my friends. I was so surprised by the deluge of support. I realized, that even as I think I\u2019m alone, a single mother, I am not. I learned this by not keeping yesterday\u2019s event to myself. I realized that I cannot do everything by myself. I am really grateful to my friends, family and Adam\u2019s support team who are always there for us, and even you readers who take the time to lend your support by commenting here and on Facebook. For me, writing is a way to survive, to think, to overcome my challenges. I cannot let them fester. Other people manage other ways. I manage this way. I spent many years learning how to build a strong team of support. I realize that network has been carefully woven and I\u2019m in awe of the time it took. I hope to be able to write a piece how I was able to create this web of support, and the trials of putting it together. When we are building teams for our children, we have to look at good fits. We have to feel good about who is working with our children. For myself, I could not hire people who treated Adam in a way I did not want him to be treated. It was simply an intuitive way of parenting him. Building a team later became supported by what I was reading and hearing about certain therapies and ways people with disabilities have been treated.  I never realized it, but I have a distinctive parenting style. I appreciate sensitivity because it suits Adam\u2019s needs. I love kindness. I adore when people realize he is a person full of potential, despite his challenges. As I built a team to support Adam, I realize I also built one to support me in my ability to parent him. I realize my limitations and my need for others to help, and how we work as a unit. I am his mother. I am suited to loving him well. Although I teach him as a parent would, I am not a great teacher. I reach Adam by being gentle, not impatient. His interest in music and art is nurtured by my interest and activity. I\u2019m good at a few thing and not good in others. When I think Adam needs to learn something I cannot teach, I am happy to hand him over to those who can give him those other gifts. I ended the evening yesterday talking to one of my best girlfriends. She has a typical daughter. She talked about how she lost her daughter at the cottage. So many parents have reached out and told me their tales of losing their children \u2014 typical and autistic. When I rethink everything, I realize that exploring is a rite of passage. Adam wants to be independent \u2014 the very trait we want our autistic children to learn. He wants to explore, hide, and thinks excitable voices are really funny. I wonder if we target the autistic child for wandering, like so many other challenges, and forget about how the typical child does the same things as our autistic children do. The age ranges may be different, but sooner or later, it happens.  Sure, I\u2019m nervous about this and will be on top of it as will his team. Yet there is a side of me that thinks \u2014 tragedy averted, of course \u2014 that he made his way back into the church. He wants to explore and do his own thing. He tried to make his own popcorn the other day and wrecked my microwave. I mean, how many parents have the same story of their homes being near destroyed by a clever, well-meaning child? It\u2019s time to support Adam again and make a new plan. We have to avoid danger and we have to support his need to explore and be independent now. I just have to learn to keep up.

{"date": "2011/05/24", "body": "This is a day I always promote. Autistic Pride Day occurs on June 18th and the t-shirt designed above is by  Jason Ross. Let me use Jason\u2019s words to describe the importance of the day, since Jason is autistic himself: Neurodiversity is just as it sounds, it is knowing how we are special, unique, and have a very our very own belief system that should not be imposed on other people. Why do we have Neurodiversity? If we didn\u2019t have different kinds of minds and we were not wired differently, we would be considered the same. Wouldn\u2019t that be boring? What would life really be like? Before people consider every one thinking the same way, we should be considering how others think too. There are many different kinds of minds and different ways of thinking and different ways of living. The only thing we can learn to do the same is having proper social skills to incorporate ourselves to function with each other to form relationships. It does not mean change our way of being and thinking. We need different perspectives in the world to teach each other about life. However, we do have free will to think of our different way of being, but that does not mean you can impose your ideas on others. It just means speaking your mind and telling your stories. The way we all can fix society is by any one in the world communicating their views to share it and evaluate what others say, but not getting angry or upset when we hear what they say. Listen to the suggestions and/or thinking the other person may be telling you, and adjust it to your state of being to become your unique \u2018YOU\u2019. Any one can believe whatever they want to, and can be what they want to be to succeed in their life, but they must choose to accept it. Otherwise someone will always be influenced by another and eventually Neurodiversity disappears. How sad would that be? Think about it! \n I have been reading lots of blogs and Facebook posts these days. I continue to read the debates between terminologies: \u201ca person with autism\u201d or \u201cautistic person.\u201d The discussions illustrate the importance in how humans define and see themselves. The commentary suggests the tenuous ground where the term Autism still lies. The debate is important to discuss society\u2019s responsibility to understand and accept people no matter what their label or inclincation. We are just human, after all. It is also true that no person is their label. \u201cClassified\u201d individuals are treated as second class citizens despite the intention that labels are meant to be beneficial.  A diagnosis can be a huge relief for parents and autistic individuals because there is no more mystery on why there are differences in learning and communicating. Parents and individuals can, if they are willing, stop berating themselves. Yet, we continue to segregate labeled people. The psychological impact of labeling and marginalization can be debilitating. While labels are invented to serve, they can also limit ability because people with learning disabilities are not believed to be individuals who can contribute to society or succeed. When a young person believes that of themselves, this is the devastation. A label can make it difficult for people to see what they are good at. This is but one more reason why Inclusion is an important goal for all people. We are always more than our labels. Autism, like any other learning difference or disability is not equitable with intelligence. Thinking exists outside of reading and communicating. Explaining this to the to a person who only hears about autism from some charity ad that espouses that autism must be cured can be demoralizing for the person advocating for themselves or for their child.  When I read the Toronto chapter\u2019s Autism Speaks\u2019 ads in Canada\u2019s  Globe and Mail  recently, I always want to ask\u2013  since they are raising money for genetic testing for autism  \u2014  how  such research will help with \u201cearly intervention?\u201d  I think the question we should ask is not only how, but what kinds of teaching would help a very young autistic child? Also, what about the autistic adult  who gets looked over past the age of twenty one?  What is the end goal in helping the autistic child (I will continue to use \u201cchild\u201d because the premise of the research is help infants)? Is it for them to respond like other children? If so, why is it acceptable to expect that of the autistic child and not of the dyslexic or blind one? In any classroom, a blind person has the right to ask a teacher or Professor not to make visual references in order that they can learn better. A visual learner also has a right to ask. Do you think this is hard to accommodate? It\u2019s not. Teachers possess varying abilities and we can appropriate them to  different groups of learners. Autistic learners are not offered this choice. They must learn to \u201cbehave\u201d like \u201cnormal\u201d people through ABA despite my own anechdotal evidence here at home that many tools, and an understanding of Adam, is the most helpful teaching toolbox of all. Finally, dear fundraisers and researchers, if we were to genetically screen for autism, what percentage of new parents do you think, under the current bioethical climate (can I call it that?) will be the beneficiaries of \u201cearly interventions\u201d for their babies? Is this marketing supposed to suggest that if we know the genes that cause autism we will understand everything there is to know about the autistic person, including how to teach them?  No matter what you think about \u201cautistic person\u201d or \u201cperson with autism,\u201d let\u2019s think about the bigger picture. Our children and the way they view themselves (hopefully as whole, entitled and able to give back), are the reason I celebrate Autistic Pride Day\u2026every day.

{"date": "2011/07/22", "body": "\u201cMa\u2026. M. Ma\u2026 M. \u201d That\u2019s what Adam said to me last night before bed, before he woke with a fever this morning, no doubt having caught the summer cold. It also happens to be Toronto\u2019s record-breaking heat wave. As I wandered in his room with my early morning \u201cgotta wake up\u201d voice, Adam seemed woozy. I sat on the side of his bed and felt his forehead and body. He felt like an oven.  There is not a day when he\u2019s ill that I don\u2019t want to take away all his aches and pains. Last June was a difficult month of transitions \u2014 heck the last three years have been full of them. I find it difficult to write when we are going through something because I have to process a lot of my own emotions and ways of looking at life. My convictions are tested. I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m glad I have some. Losing an aide worker of seven years, another change in school, a new camp\u2026Adam demonstrated his distress with an obsession with looking behind every door which lead to bolting. When Adam is anxious, his body twitches and he started to lightly nibble at his arm, and sometimes mine. If I had to describe it in my own words and perspective, it was like Adam had to explore everything as if it was a flight response. I would say that this was all about fear and uncertainty. He will able to tell be better when he is able. He is getting more able as he types more to me. At first, I did what any other parent would do and asked him to stop. Drawing attention to it made it worse. When Adam goes through a state of anxiety, it is hard for me not to as well\u2026like his illness, I wish I could take it away \u2014 all his pain.  I wish it would stop. As a single parent, I take on the brunt of it too. My parents are a wonderful support system for me as are the people closest to me, but I take so much on emotionally where Adam is concerned.  It is sometimes so overwhelming, and I find myself strewn across my bed when he is asleep wondering how I can go on. I find myself in that futile trap of worrying about the future. Then something clicks. I think of Adam as a person, as I think of myself as a child \u2014 all of my fears and needs. I needed my parents, my mother especially, when I was scared or sick. My dad embraced me the times I least expected, like the break up from my very first boyfriend.  My mother took good care of me while my dad taught me some lessons about brushing myself off again after life would offer its hits over and over again. I\u2019ve learned that happiness is not a given. It is a gift. Life is about the struggle so it might as also be about how we handle it. I need to show Adam that I am as strong as he will be. He needs me to be. There are times when I think it so unfair to bring children into a harsh world. I wonder, as Adam will have to struggle through life the way we all do, why I did this to him.  Yet nature was stronger than this logic. I wanted Adam as much as I needed air. I cannot imagine life without Adam and without having this level of love and responsibility in my life. Sure, I\u2019m not unlike everyone else that I also imagine freedom. Yet, now that Adam is here, it\u2019s not as important. This is what I made, and what came my way, and I want to make the very best of it. When I woke up that morning and everything clicked together again, I remembered that we\u2019ve gotten through a lot of phases. I remembered Adam\u2019s smile, even though he wasn\u2019t smiling that much in June. I remembered how much he loves and needs me and how I am fit for the calling. I may have to lie exhausted, strewn across my bed some days, but I know as long as I\u2019m alive, I\u2019ll get right back up again. Since his new camp began in early July, the twitching abated as did the nibbles on his arm. I learned not to call attention to it, and to provide him with more soothing activities, while teaching him how to soothe himself.   Adam uses a steamroller \u2014 purchased through Southpaw Enterprises  \u2014 as a \u201csqueeze machine\u201d which provides him with the deep pressure he seeks. As several weeks have passed, he is more verbal again and the smile is back, even in his latest group camp photo. I try to rub his back and tell him that I understand when he\u2019s frustrated, and he appreciates it. Adam\u2019s ways of communicating are so diverse.  He has motor planning issues, apraxia and catatonia-like initiation issues. These are not motivational in the least. These are real impairments which need understanding and creativity in order to help Adam become enabled.  When people also think that Adam doesn\u2019t understand, I want to show what he can do on his iPad or computer. He is able to demonstrate his ability to answer, usually one hundred per cent on comprehension exercises, with a multiple choice format.  I asked his school to do that last year and he was able to answer questions better this way because it is a visual prompt \u2014 he has to choose from one out of three of four possibilities. Another way to see this is through his iPad. There are programs (you can start with \u201cPlaywords\u201d) that ask children to pick the right word to match the picture or the verbal prompt \u2014 some of the words are getting sophisticated. Adam can zip through that exercise like it is nothing. Yet, give him another format, like fill in the missing letter of a word he knows very well, he has some difficulty.  He needs me to model several times, the correct way to complete the exercise. Then he\u2019s flying again. After a couple of weeks of camp, a video of the end of the day \u201cFlagpole\u201d was sent to me by email. I always wonder why Adam points to his favorite activity being \u201cFlagpole,\u201d everyday. It is an end of day camp activity where the entire camp gathers together. In this video, counselors were demonstrating a dance and all the kids had to follow. It was boring at first to watch the counselors on a roof dancing to warbling electronic music. Then, the camera panned out. Suddenly, a small figure to the bottom right looked familiar from the back. I recognized the beige floppy hat and the lean body. It was my Adam following the dance moves and I could tell he was intently watching.  It looked like he was having\u2026.fun.  I was so happy, I forwarded it to all my friends and family. It was indeed the gift I have learned never to take for granted. Today Adam sleeps in my bed and he needs me around to take care of him. I\u2019m stuck in the house, but I know he needs me, and he loves me.  He has just woken as I get up from the other side of the bed. \u201cStay here,\u201d he says. Don\u2019t worry, Adam. I\u2019m not going anywhere.

{"date": "2011/05/25", "body": "\nMatthew Israel, Founder of the Judge Rotenberg Educational Centre where autistic students were taught to comply with electrical shock \u201ctreatment,\u201d has finally been charged.  Here from Boston.com: The founder of the controversial Judge Rotenberg Educational Center is scheduled to face criminal charges in Dedham today arising from a night in 2007 when two special needs teenagers at the center were wrongfully administered dozens of electrical shocks, according to the father of one of the victims and another person with knowledge about the case. \n In a deal reached with the state attorney general\u2019s office, Matthew Israel, 77, is expected to be spared prison time in return for stepping down from the Canton-based center that he founded 40 years ago and accepting a five-year probationary term, said Charles Dumas, the father of one of the two victims in the 2007 case who said he spoke yesterday with prosecutors. As part of the agreement, the school\u2019s day-to-day activities will also be overseen by a court-approved monitor. \n As a mother of an autistic son, I am sick that it has taken this long after many of us signed petitions to stop him. I read through reams of his statements suggesting why this form of Behavioural Conditioning was an \u201ceffective treatment\u201d for autism. The Judge Rotenberg Center treatment goals include a near-zero rejection/expulsion policy, active treatment with a behavioral approach directed exclusively towards normalization, frequent use of behavioral rewards and punishment, video monitoring of staff and the option to use aversives, the most controversial of which is the use of electric shocks. The final item has provoked considerable controversy and has led to calls from several disability rights groups to call for human protection from behavior modification, behavior therapy, and applied behavior analysis approaches. (From Wikipedia) \u201cIts most effective backers have been the parents of some of these troubled students who say Israel\u2019s center accepted their child when no other school would. Israel has said his methods work and have virtually eliminated the use of psychotropic drugs at his center,\u201d says the Boston Globe. Is this the type of quality education we receive for autistic students when \u201cno other school\u201d will provide it? And don\u2019t kid yourself that similar aversive tactics are not used here in Ontario. You will hear of the autistic person being \u201cignored\u201d by therapists as a behavioural tactic in order to stop the person from crying. Instead of attempting to figure out what might be the root and cause of upset, a child or person will receive this cruel form of \u201cteaching.\u201d It is my experience that this makes a person either more aggressive or shuts them down completely.  [Israel\u2019s] tactics have been condemned as barbaric and savage by many top medical and mental health professionals. But despite some injuries and even deaths at the facility, the center has continued to get state approval to operate as a special-needs school serving some 200 students with serious emotional and behavioral problems, including autism and intellectual disabilities. It has taken years for Israel to be charged and such tactics to be viewed as criminal. There have been many parents who have believed that this shock treatment has been helpful and have stuck up for the Centre, typically arguing that their children are aggressive or self-injure, and the arguments can sound compelling. This is one of the reasons why it took so long to charge Israel. This is the side of parent advocacy that is risky to autistic folk. There is a side to people we don\u2019t want to see. There are difficult sides and as our history has shown, we\u2019d rather lock it away in institutions, and treat it harshly and ignore it all together. I was never convinced that treating human beings with shock treatment against their will was ever a viable option. I don\u2019t imagine I ever will be.

{"date": "2011/07/08", "body": "Please read Kristina\u2019s and  help return Ayn, an autistic girl to her father. They live in British Columbia.  Ayn has been taken because of wandering.  Like Ayn, Adam is nine years old and has bolted. We work so hard to take care of and nuture our children and Foster Care is a devastating option.  Ayn\u2019s father Derek fears that Ayn is being drugged to sedate her. It may take up to a year to get Ayn back, states Derek\u2019s laywer.  Let me describe why I believe this is discrimination against autistics and their families. As a parent of an autistic child who clearly is anxious about the world about him, which lends to wandering and other behaviours as I\u2019ve observed, I can think of no other person on this planet more equipped to protect my son than myself and his immediate family. We live in a world that wants to make Adam \u201cnormal.\u201d He must go to school, and when he goes, he has to exert more energy than other children just to cope. Because Adam is barely verbal, but otherwise very bright, he cannot speak out. Instead, he reacts. Our schools, while they attempt to accommodate, simply have not been making the grade. As I\u2019ve researched school options and program options in Ontario, our options are few and far between. Every program seeks to normalize Adam. Precious few wish to spend the time it takes to see his abilities and build upon them.  This requires systemic change and a real listening to and understanding of autistic people. May I ask what schools hire autistic adults to work with autistic children in the classroom or consult on school boards for autism programs? Please, write if you know of one here in Ontario. Instead, non autistic educators believe they know better \u2014 they believe they know how to teach autistic people. Even we parents sometimes think we know better. It takes us out of our comfort zone to be patient with an autistic nature. Think about the patience and effort that people like Ayn and Adam have to produce in dealing with ours? Sure the toolbox of methods work here and there, but what is happening to our children, to Derek and Ayn, is not an accommodation. This is what we seek. Understanding, accommodation \u2014 not separating us from the people we love. Every single day, Adam and I face these challenges together. We fight for better services, be they ABA or AAC and for all kinds of acccommodations that help autistic people contribute to society  as autistic people . I know we are not always listened to. We are not heard. No one believes it\u2019s a good thing, perhaps, to be autistic. Few want to bother because autism is seen as our contemporary problem. If we can\u2019t fix the problem, we have failed. I say we are failing autistic people. Must we also live in fear, like Derek, of our children being taken away? As parents, we cannot control everything that our children do, or what happens to them. This is true of all children, not just autistic children. Being autistic seems to be a reason to discriminate against us.  As Adam himself goes through many changes in his life (we\u2019ve been checking off the list of \u201clife\u2019s top stressors\u201d), I\u2019ve been re-reading Temple Grandin\u2019s book  Emergence: Labeled Autistic . She describes similar behaviours to Adam like fixations with doors, difficulty with communication or inconsistent communication. She describes her twitches (like Adam\u2019s) as \u201cpanic attacks\u201d or anxiety. While I\u2019m processing a lot of this lately because we are in the midst of this ourselves, I see an urgent need for others to understand us.  I see a need to reduce some of the expecations, and for calm environments. I see a need to simplify our lives and let things be sometimes. We are so busy dealing with what our kids must or should do, that I truly believe that this only brings on more stress. Every morning when I wake, I wonder how we can simplify our lives, and wonder why it seems to be ever more complicated. This is the commitment many of us parents of autistic children make every day: to stand by our children and fight for their rights to be included in our society, not taken away or segregated. Every autistic adult who has written a book discusses their panic at this over-stimulated world we live in. Donna Williams, Temple Grandin are really accessible reads. Let me take some quotes from Temple\u2019s book that may help describe what I call now the \u201cflight response\u201d of Adam, and perhaps children like Ayn. I know there is no scientific evidence to support my theory yet, but I really suspect that wandering and fleeing in many cases has a lot to do with this anxiety: \u201cThe real world became more unpredictable. I longed for relief, but I was trapped in physical distress. Stress showed in my speech, my actions, my relationship with others.\u201d Adam\u2019s bolting is associated with doors recently. He is fixated on them and has to check what\u2019s behind each. This has calmed a bit since the end of school, but when he\u2019s anxious it can start up again and this is how he can suddenly disappear, even if we hold his hand \u2014 he can slip out so fast. Yes, our house has locks from the inside, like Derek\u2019s. I\u2019ve bought I.D. for him, even a harness (which we have not yet used, but it\u2019s here just in case), and we are looking into a GPS. We have programs and social stories and are trying to help Adam in every way we can with his stress. Re-reading Temple\u2019s own accounts, seems to have re-affirmed my suspicions about Adam, and helps me to consider various  options for him to grow and develop as a fulfilled autistic individual: Then, in chapel one Sunday, I sat on the folding chair, imprisoned by the school\u2019s rules of attendance and bored\u2026bored\u2026bored. When the minister began preaching, I escaped into my inner world of non-stimulation. A world pastel and peaceful. Suddenly, a loud knock intruded upon my inner world. Startled, I looked up and saw the minister rap on the lecturn. \u201cKnock,\u201d he said, \u201cand He will answer.\u201d \n Who, I wondered. I sat up straighter. \n \u201cI am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shalle be saved (John 10:7.9). The minister stepped out from behind the lecturn and stood in front of the congregation. He said, \u201cBefore each of you there is a door opening into heaven. Open it and be saved.\u201d He turned and walked back to the lecturn. \u201cHymn 306, \u2018Bless This House.'\u201d \n I barely heard the hymn number. Like many autistic children, everything was literal to me. My mind centered on one thing. Door. A door opening to heaven. A door through which I could pass and be saved! The voices sang out and when I heard the words, \u201cBless this door that it may prove/Ever open to joy and love,\u201d I knew I had to find that door. \n For the next few days I viewed each door as a possible opening to love and joy. The closet door, the bathroom door, the front door, the stable door \u2014 all were scrutinized and rejected as  the door.  Then one day walking back to my room from dinner, I noticed that an addition to our dorm was being constructed\u2026I climbed to the fourth floor\u2026.And there was the door! It was a little open door that opened out onto the roof\u2026.A feeling of relief flooded over me. Ayn wandered to a yard with a trampoline. Adam returned to the church from where he escaped\u2026through doors and then back inside them again. While wandering is a very serious issue, are our children seeking their escape? Are they seeking relief? Joy? We must keep our children safe, and I can attest that we are doing everything in our power to do so, like Ayn\u2019s father, Derek, who  loves his daughter so very much. But because Ayn is autistic, and perhaps because Derek is on social assistance, she has been taken away from him. Is this some sort of sick cost-saving measure instead of providing the services that Derek and Ayn might need? I can imagine the pain he and Ayn must be feeling right now. Our society must work so much harder to understand what we as parents face and what autistic people face. We must be able to share our challenges in order to survive them, without fear that our children will be taken from us. I want to be proud of the country I live in in how it supports autistic individuals and families. This incident does not make me proud, or rest easy. Let me share one more quote from Temple Grandin, lest society think that autistics can\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to them: As an autistic child, difficulty in speaking was one of my greatest problems. Although I could understand everything people said, my responses were limited. I\u2019d try, but most of the time no spoken words came. It was similar to stuttering; the words just wouldn\u2019t come out\u2026\u201d and,  Too many therapists and psychologically-trained people believe that if a child is allowed to indulge his fixations, irreparable harm will result. I do not think this is true in all cases. Fixations can be guided into something constructive. Talking the fixation away can be unwise. Just as a bad habit is expunged only to be replaced by another bad habit, so it is with fixation. But making a positive action out of a fixation can be rewarding. Maybe Ayn needs that trampoline. Maybe a neighbour can give her  that access. Social services should give Ayn back to her father as soon as possible. Parents and autistic people need accommodation and better supports. Foster care will not give Ayn many options and will likely create irreparable damage. Ayn is a person-first and a very lovely little autistic girl, I might add. This is the stuff that makes being a parent of an autistic child, challenging. Let me reiterate: we need understanding and support. Not punishment. Please sign this petition to help bring Ayn home.

So, I don\u2019t like problems thrown at me all the time.  I\u2019m impatient. I expect those who say they are experts to help us, not throw the problems back in my lap. When it comes to Adam and talking with those who help him out, I\u2019m not certain they realize that\u2019s what I hear. Sure, we\u2019ve got challenges. But it becomes overwhelming when things are constantly presented as a \u201cproblem.\u201d Hearing this for seven years now since Adam\u2019s diagnosis, and maybe this will make sense. If you are a therapist or a teacher or aide, consider this: that\u2019s all we hear from the time our children are very young. From a parent\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not only very scary in the beginning, but later, it\u2019s just plain exhausting. In the beginning we scurry like there\u2019s no tomorrow becasue we are trying to find the best program or school placement, and that\u2019s not easy. Perhaps if you are going to present a challenge, offer a solution. I\u2019m fortunate in that I do have people with whom I can strategize. Yet, there are few options out there for autistic people, and even therapists are hard-pressed to be able to find places for us to go.  Schools are scarce. Inclusive schools are scarcer. There are few adaptive services. I spend hours each week not only filling out forms and getting on wait-lists, but also phoning to find suitable sports and other programs for Adam. This begs the question: why are there so few of them? Why can\u2019t Adam learn how to play baseball? I remember how easy it was for my step-kids and all the programs they had to choose from. I\u2019m trying to reach Special Olympics, Boyscouts, ski programs\u2026it takes a while to hear back. For Adam, his options seem so much smaller than they were for his half-siblings. It\u2019s not equal and it\u2019s not fair. Why should he have to go to an autism school if the autism school doesn\u2019t fully integrate a vareity of tools to support Adam\u2019s strengths? Perhaps I\u2019d go to the autism school if I felt it treated him like the magnificent person he is, addressing the challenges he has, and training him as an autistic person to prepare for college, university, or some other vibrant future. Believe me, if I could find an autism school that was as robust as those belonging to the deaf community, I\u2019d consider it. At least there, using the deaf community as a model, autistic people would be allowed to act autistic, and build their own strong community. Instead, I see schools addressing \u201cautistic defecits\u201d  in an ABA format, which I don\u2019t believe works that well for Adam, as it escalates his anxiety. (Side note: and can we hire autistic adult teachers, pleeeze). Repeating skills in that format is good (belonging to ABA and other methods), sometimes positive reinforcement is good, but it\u2019s not very creative because it teaches not so much content as much as it is a way to teach someone how to answer and respond. It\u2019s not necessarily a \u201cbad\u201d thing, it\u2019s just not the only way to teach, and I fear it lacks the engaging content my son needs.  It doesn\u2019t foster creative behaviour.  You see, I think discipline is really important. It\u2019s an art to teach a very young, challenged child to be focussed without also inspiring him and building his confidence. With Adam, this is especially difficult. Despite his communication challenges, he has pride, will avoid tasks that he thinks he likely will fail, and is very aware of his inability to communicate like other people. Force him to \u201cput the puzzle\u201d piece in for the 1000th time, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll do it. Offer him a candy to do a task, and he knows that if he avoids the task, he\u2019ll get a candy. It works sometimes, but he\u2019s outsmarts us. Still, breaking down tasks into smaller pieces, and repetition is a key to fluency and competence. Marry that with exploration activity and keeping the topics and materials moving along (he\u2019s not a baby anymore), and that\u2019ll keep his interest. I wonder if we just expect too little from him. An inspiring person/teacher, and tapping into Adam\u2019s innate need to be proud of himself, and I wonder\u2026 I don\u2019t think that typical families understand the extent to which we have to hunt for places for our kids to belong, and I believe Adam has the right to be fully integrated and included into our community. I feel I am met with resistance, and I knew this would take a long time. I hope it doesn\u2019 drag on well into Adam\u2019s adulthood. This is a systemic problem. We simply don\u2019t know how to teach autistic people, despite ABA being the purported solution. All we know is how to use a few PECS, schedules, and accommodate sensory differences. Sure, this is a big change from even a few years ago, but I\u2019m becoming impatient. I have not seen any creative programming for autistic people. Is it because we don\u2019t believe enough in autistic people to invest in fully inclusive programs that train facilitators in a vareity of methods that must then be uniquely applied to each individual? Instead, it might be easier to say that an autistic person has this defecit and apply a one-size-fits all solution. As I used to work in public art galleries, and also used to teach young children art through music, I\u2019m thinking a lot lately of helping schools use an art program to teach other topics such as math and science. And if you want to see another extremely creative parent,  check out Kyra and Fluffy at thismom.com. Kyra completely blows me away with her boundless energy and ideas. I\u2019m not as creative as she is . I just hope people take a look at some the projects she works on with Fluffy (she homeshools him). I hope, using them as one positive example, that we never give up on autistic folk. I meet wonderful teachers. I wonder why I don\u2019t see the programs to place them because autism seems of great interest to many.  When I consider Adam, I think of just last night as we practiced piano and how he became enamoured with the low G. As he continued to play it, I improvised. He smiled and we made music for over 30 minutes, coordinating together. I think of how he can get so focussed in art-making and all the things we can learn from making it. Art can be therapeutic, sure, but what of all those lost learning opportunities because our teachers are not trained in using these tools so easily accessible for Adam?  If Adam is any example, he does well when we find a patient person who listens, who wants to learn how he learns, and who can accompany him in the community that he\u2019s so interested in. I have a boy yearning to try new things. Thank goodness for his camps. There is has learned to climb walls, archery, and many other wonderful skills. He seems happiest at camp, learning from physical activity to quiet art and loves drama and creative movement \u2014 hmm.. we hear autistic people can\u2019t do the latter, right? Not so for my guy. I just thought I\u2019d write this because we have huge scarcity in Ontario and I keep looking to autism websites here and don\u2019t find much. Social skills groups are always full and I wonder what they teach anyway? How to say hello? Play with the plastic doll? Okay, that\u2019s a skeptical comment, but what creative programming exists within the skills that autistic children need to also learn? We  can  inspire our children.  People think we need autism schools, but that\u2019s not necessarily the solution. It seems easy because at least that\u2019s a place to  put  autistic kids.   I like it that Adam sees everyone and that he be seen, and where he can feel competent as he is (this is a problem if we stick our kids in typical schools where they then remain on the sidelines). I still see people wanting to change him and fill in his \u201cgaps.\u201d Certainly, they exist; Adam has challenges. Yes, I hear about them all the time. I see them everyday. I am supposed to be teaching him at home more too \u2014 the onus is always on us. How much more time do we have? Okay, just so this post doesn\u2019t come off as a rant  (I hope),  here\u2019s a link to Hopeful Parent.   Maybe it\u2019s the snowstorm coming, the large piles of paper I have to get through, and a team meeting coming up tonight.  I am hopeful. Maybe I can help out through teaching again.

In fact, Adam and I are about to go out for a walk. Seems the news is full of hype on all counts, whether it be about autism or the weather. Weather is big business. Except for the Tsunami in Indonesisa. We needed the news reports then. But they never came. I hate being skeptical. Yet everytime  The Weather Network   predicts weather, and this comes from undocumented personal research, it\u2019s always less severe than they say.

{"date": "2011/02/04", "body": "We talk often in autism about a dissonance of skills and \u201cuneven learning.\u201d It\u2019s an easy thing to notice or say, but it doesn\u2019t seem that easy to accommodate. Not easy, because we still have the expectation that an autisitic person must respond typically.  Adam has had quite the transitional year. He has gone through parental separation, moved to a new home with me and started a new school where the expectation is that he sits at a desk. His sleep has worsened, and his avoidant behaviour in doing certain \u201ctasks\u201d has begun. And yet, my Adam is talking in full sentences more often, is telling me how he feels, and can play a mean \u201creciprocal\u201d game of  I Spy  with me. He can draw well (if given the chance) with perspective that is more sophisticated than his same aged-peers, even if his motor planning, that is line, is not as sure and resolute.  I have to say that when someone talks to me about Adam\u2019s \u201cbehaviour\u201d I do think in the old-fashioned sense that he is not behaving \u201cwell,\u201d as opposed to looking at what\u2019s causing the behaviour. It still pops up from time to time, and I am concerned that implicating behaviour is a way to not only blame Adam, but put an expectation and onus on him that is not fair. That is but one  legacy that ABA left behind, although I\u2019m not commenting on some of the methods used by the practice as part of an overall pedagogy. I bribe him a lot to get things done. Adam needs physicality, lots of movement, interesting content, and a chance to respond more by typing. He needs more preparation, I believe, to start his day, and a different kind of structure in it. What I mean is, by 2 p.m., the boy is tired. I am still trying to figure out what that structure should look like as I orchestrate new programs and activity in his life. Because, Adam is no longer a baby. He will be turning nine this April. It seems to me that we are learning about how autistic children learn, or at least I\u2019m learning everyday. My process of learning about Adam and trying to work with his team of teachers and supporters never ends. Sometimes, I sit and stare at the wall, I admit, and wonder why we still haven\u2019t figured this out. Maybe I was secretly hoping we would have by now. I\u2019ve hit the books again. I\u2019m watching Adam closely as he has trouble falling asleep at night. I watch my own responses to him when I feel tired and frustrated. And one thing that surprises me is that I still am not giving up. I don\u2019t want to blame Adam for being autistic. I want so badly to support him and to have support.  I am still trying to articulate what accommodation really means for him. I am constantly evolving my attitude, and behaviour, towards him. Soon Adam will have an aide who will take him into the community, to help him be a part of it, make friends, take theatre classes and go skiing (he starts next week!). I hope to get him into Special Olympics and keep working with those who have helped us along the way. It is clear we don\u2019t have all the answers yet.

{"date": "2011/02/09", "body": "I\u2019m thinking a lot about behaviour today. I don\u2019t often re-post the articles of others, but in my search, I came across this blog:  Forward: FWD (feminists with disabilities) For A Way Forward.  A study recently released in Delaware found that disabled students are more likely to be suspended for \u2018behaviour problems.\u2019 More specifically, while 20% of the students suspended1 were disabled, disabled students only make up 14% of the student body. The study questions this disparity, asking why it is that disabled students are at more risk of suspension although there is an established body of law that is designed to specifically provide protections for disabled students, and to limit the circumstances in which they can be suspended. \n The article asks, not \u2018why are students with disabilities more likely to be suspended,\u2019 but \u2018what makes disabled students behave badly?\u2019 I personally think that\u2019s the wrong question. What is \u2018bad behaviour\u2019? How is this being defined, and who is defining it? It\u2019s good to see some mandatory accountability in the form of tracking discipline numbers and reporting them, but accountability is only one part of the equation. If districts are not taking action to address the disparities, reporting them doesn\u2019t make that much of a difference. \n And are schools adequately identifying disabled students? While there has been more of a push in recent years to identify and intervene when disabilities are observed in the classroom, there tend to be racial and class inequalities when it comes to diagnosis and treatment. Likewise, there are disparities in identification; a teacher may attribute differences in learning and communication styles to disability in a white child, and \u2018bad attitude\u2019 in a nonwhite child, for example. \n The approach to this particular educational disparity seems to be focused on what \u2018makes\u2019 students \u2018behave badly\u2019 instead of asking whether teachers are being adequately trained to work with disabled students and asking what \u2018bad behaviour\u2019 is and who is defining it. It assumes that everyone should (and can) engage in specific patterns of behaviour and it suggests that \u2018abnormal\u2019 behaviour patterns should be punished. \n Are students suspended for not using modes of communication familiar to teachers? For needing to stand or pace while learning? For needing a quiet environment for learning, and for becoming upset when one is not provided? For needing orderly and precise schedules? For not completing assignments they don\u2019t understand or find impossible to finish? For attempting to create and maintain personal space? For expressing any number of needs and needing a space where they are accommodated? For tics in the classroom? \n When nondisabled people are the ones defining \u2018normal\u2019 behaviour and deciding what is bad and worthy of suspension, inevitably you are going to end up with disparities in student discipline. When teachers are not provided with adequate training, when they are dealing with classrooms that have too many students in them, when they are being burdened with a lot of additional work outside the classroom, a tinderbox of circumstances is created and disabled students tend to lose. \n Suspension is a serious punishment. Students missing a month or more of school is a serious problem. Until we reframe the way that we talk about classroom behaviour, we\u2019re going to continue missing the heart of the problem.   \u2014 article by s.e. Smith I quote this because I\u2019ve been writing about behaviour recently, citing the issues with have with how we teach autistic people because their \u201cbehaviour\u201d is, purportedly, the \u201cissue\u201d of learning, or at the heart of, we are told,  \u201clearning how to learn.\u201d Instead, I\u2019ve coined recently the term \u201ccreative behaviour,\u201d and am watching Adam learn and gravitate on his own. How do we continue to foster the creative process? How can we move away from thinking about autism as a set of behaviours, implicitly \u201cbad.\u201d How, is the ultimate question, do we help children like Adam, express themselves? Let\u2019s think about this for a bit \u2014 what we know about creativity and the work we can produce. Let\u2019s step out of the autism box and all of the implications we press upon autistic people (for the label alone) and think about what it is we are really trying to achieve. Creative thought is the ability to think about the world in unique and fresh ways and convey this to the world. By bringing our unique thoughts to others, we help to shape the way we do things, and the way we think about other people. Creative thought also helps solve problems. We hire people to do a lot of problem solving for us, yes? I now turn to Twyla Tharp, author of  The Creative Habit: Learn It And Use It For Life . There\u2019s paradox in the notion that creativity should be a habit. We think of creativity as a way of keeping everything fresh and new, while habit implies routine and repetition. That paradox intrigues me because it occupies the place where creativity and skill rub up against each other.  \n It takes skill to bring something you\u2019ve imagined into the world: to use words to create believable lives, to select the colors and textures of paint to represent a haystack at sunset, to combine ingredients to make a flavourful dish. No one is born with that skill. It is developed through exercise, through repetition, through a blend of learning and reflectin that\u2019s both painstaking and rewarding. And it takes time. Even Mozart, with all his innate gifts, his passion for music, and his father\u2019s devoted tutelage, needed to get twenty-four youthful symphonies under his belt before he composed something enduring with number twenty-five. If art is the bridge between what you see in your mind and what the world sees, then skill is how you build that bridge.\u201d (p. 9) Yes, skill is really important. A way in which to convey meaning to others is vitally important. The rituals and habits we establish are the practice we need in order to produce something. Creativity sparks when we stare into space, have that second snack from the fridge, putter, and when we appear to be doing nothing at all. Adam takes piano lessons once a week. We\u2019ve adapted the lessons, and his fingering is getting pretty good.  I started teaching Adam to learn piano in a more traditional way a couple of years ago, even though we\u2019ve learned to accommodate the lessons.  He learns from a teacher who expects him to practice everyday and who can be stern about him sitting at the piano. In this case, Adam needs a bribe. I\u2019ll ask the teacher to make him work for the candy, and he\u2019ll oblige and finish practicing. Okay, it\u2019s hard to learn piano in the traditional way. Yet, like Twyla says, creativity is a habit. It requires tons of preparation. So we stick with the program. I\u2019m teaching myself how to play the guitar. I struggle with the chords, my fingers just beginning to become numb at the tips; hurray, I\u2019m building my first callous on my left index finger \u2014 a good sign. I pick it up every morning while Adam waits for his ride to school. He comes over and strums a good rhythm. He smiles and then gets really into it and forgets I\u2019m there. A couple of days later, as I\u2019m making a second cup of coffee, Adam goes to get the guitar leaning against my bookcase. He takes it to the couch and begins strumming on his own. He\u2019s focused. This time, he doesn\u2019t want me to help him. Two great examples, I think, between the art of repetition and practice, and the space to explore. Rather than seeing Adam as behavioural, because he may avoid that which is difficult in formal practice (I was the same, by the way, when I was a kid), I explore the value of both methods of teaching and learning. Art and music have been part of my entire life. I\u2019ve taken music lessons with the strictest of teachers. When I thought I could fart away in art class, Sister Collette (don\u2019t you just love that name that belonged to a Franciscan nun?), scolded me every week if I submitted a project late, and then loaded me with more work and deadlines because of it. While I was artistic, I didn\u2019t think an art teacher would be so strict.  \u201cArt,\u201d she said, \u201cwill teach you the greatest discipline more than anything else in your life.\u201d  I probably worked the hardest when I was in her class, where I stayed for my entire five years of high school. Art was an elective course, an option. Art wasn\u2019t a \u201cprerequisite\u201d like math and science. We think of art in trite ways \u2014 all we have to do is be gifted, talented, and the muse will bless us. Na uh. Art, like life and very much like in teaching autistic children, is the ultimate example. There is something intrinsic in all of us that we can express, and need to express.  We find the tools to help us express it, and usually the ones that we most gravitate towards, but that doesn\u2019t mean learning how to use them is easy!  We work daily becasue the manifestation of our inspired thought is more difficult to express to others.  What I\u2019m trying to say is that teaching autism is an art and has to be viewed in similar ways. We find the tools (aka \u201caccommodation\u201d) and we teach the child how to use them everyday. We repeat, but we do not de-value the unique process of taking in the world (aka: like when they are appearing to \u201cnot be in the room\u201d or \u201cin their own world\u201d). And as the living art forms that all humans are, we must also as teachers and parents, forget looking at autistic kids as a Diagnostic Manual of symptoms and behaviours.  For the human body and mind, in it\u2019s infinite wisdom, finds the tools with which to also express iteslf. Let\u2019s learn how to use them.

{"date": "2011/02/15", "body": "I am very sad this evening. It is the sadness of knowing that someone who was part of your daily life has meant so much to you \u2014 who has been the centre of our lives. This person is Adam\u2019s aide. She has never wanted to be named but is in the background of all my posts since 2005, obscured. She is called Adam\u2019s \u201csupport worker\u201d in an upcoming issue in  Today\u2019s Parent called  The Joy of Autism.  The March issue hits the stands February 21st. Today, Adam\u2019s aide has given us notice that she will be ending her support of Adam in order to move on to something else \u2014 time to grow, move on, as does everything in life. Who knows if she\u2019ll continue her work in this field \u2014 she thinks about doing other things now, and it\u2019s all natural, all good. Yet I sit here alone this Tuesday night. Adam is skiing this evening and knows not that his life is about to change\u2026 again.  \u201cHe\u2019s a duck in water,\u201d says my mom on the telephone as I\u2019m in the middle of writing this. \u201cWow\u2026wait\u2026wow\u2026look at him go!\u201d I hear others in the background.  It\u2019s only his second ski lesson. He probably can\u2019t remember being without his aide worker. She entered when Adam was 20 months old \u2014 just over a month after he was first diagnosed with autism. She has been with us on all the ups and downs of our journey. We have made decisions together, and she has implemented them on a daily basis. She helped me when I was going through cancer and divorce in order to provide extra support to keep Adam strong, while I was not. It has been a hectic day, but not just for this reason. Another urgent matter helped me shove the news I received early this morning into the background of my day. Yet, when I returned home and all was quiet, and I read that  article, the black and white print jumped out at me. She is all over those four pages; the \u201cjoy of autism,\u201d the ride \u2014 me, Adam and his \u201csupport worker.\u201d I am still crying, mascara channels down my cheeks. Does it take this kind moment to realize how much you can love someone? It\u2019s been eight years \u2014 I\u2019d say that\u2019s a good chunk of relationship. I\u2019ve always appreciated her, but parting is such sweet sorrow.

{"date": "2011/02/08", "body": "We\u2019ve been peaceful around here. This morning Adam picked up my guitar that I\u2019m learning (really slowly), and he played it himself, strumming and enjoying the reverberating sound.  I guess watching me and other people has inspired him. He already takes piano lessons and that\u2019s quite a formal learning process that he doesn\u2019t always like \u2014 we adapt the lessons but this type of teaching still requires those old reinforcements (I call them bribes\u2026 let\u2019s face it they work and that\u2019s exactly what they are. Must watch out though, he knows that he\u2019ll get that candy if he acts silly too). So, with the guitar, I want to let him explore. I took Royal Conservatory lessons for many years growing up. Piano teachers never liked when I sang in plays, or learned music by ear \u2014 which I was really good at doing. No, they were set in their formalized teaching method and there was no way I was allowed to waver. \u201cIt\u2019s either the play,\u201d said one of my piano teachers, \u201cor piano.\u201d I didn\u2019t understand why one had to come at the expense of the other \u2014 it was all about music. I listened and won a few first place prizes at the Peel Music Festivals every year, but I played a lot more when I did my own thing. Perhaps we need more room for marrying creative exploration and formalized teaching. There\u2019s a lot of treasure that\u2019s discovered from staring out of a window, and learning things in our own unique way. It\u2019s part of the creative process. It\u2019s creative behaviour. Despite my occassional worries (I\u2019m a human being, a parent, that should say enough), I\u2019m steady where Adam is concerned. When worry overwhelms me, I start reading more, reaching out and then I realize that I\u2019m on the best track we can be on. The issue with parenting autistic kids is that there are too many opinions about how to teach and how to parent \u2014 hey isn\u2019t that the case for parenting all kids? So many opinions. What kind of parent am I?  I ask myself.  What am I capable of doing?  After listening to how other people do things (or how they think they  have  to do things, particularly in the field of autism education), this can make a parent\u2019s stomach churn with anxiety, and I think it\u2019s okay to say  enough . After doing the due diligence work, there comes a point in all of our lives, whether we are parents or not, to follow what we think is right for us. Reading any latest edition of  The Autism News  or any other study will make your head spin.  I\u2019ve made the PECS, the visual schedules, I\u2019m teaching Adam how to type independently (it\u2019s coming along well), he goes to a good school where I see he is learning new things, I seek input, advice, and lots lots more. It\u2019s what a parent does.  I\u2019m not a teacher, yet I\u2019ve learned to work with them. I\u2019m not a therapist, but I\u2019ve learned to communicate opening and share ideas. When I heard  Rita Jordan  once say on CBC Radio One that parents have to follow their own values in parenting an autistic child, I knew exactly what she meant. How many of us are listening to those voices inside? Adam needs me to be his parent. With open arms and the love, he snuggles up to me for comfort, and I happen to be really good at this thing called love. He doesn\u2019t need to know what I do for him behind the scenes. When he comes home, he just wants me to love him\u2026as he is.

{"date": "2011/02/16", "body": "I was featured in the March 2011 issue of Today\u2019s Parent.  The interviewer was gracious and overall, felt it was an interesting article. It focussed a lot on me, and I hope it conveyed the work that I believe is not about me, but about all of our children.  Also, it is typical in story-telling and in journalism to use tension. The tension is real, yet I feel a need to clarify it. First, I never set out to \u201cpiss people off.\u201d The name of the exhibition and lecture series was titled  The Joy of Autism: Redefining Ability and Quality of Life.  The full title was omitted from the article. The lecture series featured Susan Senator, Michelle Dawson, Dr. Laurent Mottron, Dr. Morton Ann Gernsbacher, Phil Schwartz, Valerie Paradiz and Elijah Wapner, Dr. Nehama Baum and Ellen Yack. The exhibition featured Jonathan Lerman, Larry Bissonnette, Barbara Moran (this was corrected with editorial staff but was not corrected in the article), Michael Moon and Brian Henson \u2014 yes, all autistic artists and present at the opening. Also exhibitied were artists from the MukiBaum Centre. It was a week-long event and the second exhibition itself ran for a full month, garnering a lot of media attention. The first exhibition of Jonathan Lerman was the catalyst for this second event \u2014 so there were two events in 2005 and 2006.  The intention was to provoke people \u2014 to nudge others out of a long-standing complascent idea and portrayal of autistic people as a burden on society, incapable, and worthless as they are, unless they are \u201cfixed.\u201d Society has never looked at itself for its views of disabled people. As a result, disabled people have been subjugated to unfair and inhumane treatments in the name of \u201cnormalizing them.\u201d  With solely negative media portrayals, and I saw (and I was not alone \u2014 there are many other voices out there who speak the same) clearly how this would adversely effect all facets of support and funding for autistic people in Canada and throughout North America. I saw no sense in the idea that portray autistic individuals as valuable members of our society would take away services. In fact, as valuable and equal members, the idea served to speed things up in a way that would benefit autistic individuals to contribute as they are. Instead in Canada, we were promoting this idea that ABA would make autistic kids \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from their peers, and normalize them. This sounded like a good investment: get the kids back on track and then the government won\u2019t have to support them past the age of 21. The consequence of a positive portrayal, which did not at all exclude the real challenges of autism in our society, was that it \u201cpissed [some] people off,\u201d namely, those people were those intent on portraying autism as a fate worse than cancer in order to garner financial  government support for services. At that time, this was a group of ABA advocates in Canada and subsequent to the  Auton trial.  Autistic children were called \u201cnightmares,\u201d and \u201cburdens.\u201d These kind of descriptions did not match how I felt, and still feel, about Adam. What was also ommitted from the  Today\u2019s Parent  article was that the exhibition and event received so much support from people who wanted and needed this kind of event, and there were so many positive articles written around the world about it. So, it didn\u2019t just \u201cpiss people off.\u201d  It showed what autistic people  could  do with support. It showed what types of accommodation were needed to be supported by our communities in order that autistic people be successful in society as they are. The proof of such support is the thousands of subscribers to The Autism Acceptance Project website, which I haven\u2019t been keeping up as much due to the events described in that article. As such, it is still sad for me to think that others must be so political when we share the same experiences; our children are so similar. When others go out to name call those of us only wanting better services and acceptance of our children in an Inclusive society, it should make us all question one\u2019s motives. True, there are people who don\u2019t like disability. Think, Latimer. There are blogs called \u201cHating Autism\u201d (it is down now but I recently came across another blog, not worth linking so if you are interested go find it called \u201cI Hate Autism and Retards\u201d). There is lots of prejudice and name-calling of those who have real difficulty and are \u201cdifferent.\u201d This is the prejudice that endangers our families and our children, and in my opinion, all of human kind. The proof is there when one site also documented the murders of autistic children by their parents.  There was a monthly body count. I used to have a link to that site, but here is another one at neurodiversity.com. I\u2019m used to this approach and portrayal.  The National Post  once gave my ex husband and I a forum through which to clarify my position. It is called  Accepting Autism and I am posting it again  for the same reason I did back then. There\u2019s been a lot of great press too. In 2010, The Autism Acceptance Project was listed in  Oprah Magazine  as one (#69 to be exact) of  The Top 100 Things That Are Getting Better. Let\u2019s hope so. If you are interested in seeing some of that event, please visit  www.taaproject.com (The Autism Acceptance Project).

It\u2019s about his autistic son D.J. and how he communicates by typing. D.J., featured several years ago on CNN, is a non verbal autistic individual, and an autistic self advocate. D.J. is now in College and of this Ralph writes: Pitting his fear of an oppressive neurotypical culture, which as a rule continues to exclude people with autism and to prevent them from realizing their potential, against his belief in the power of words to combat prejudice and to change society, he decided to apply to a range of highly selective liberal arts colleges. Although he had made a place for himself in our small, rural community, he had his doubts about the wider world. The fact remains: very few people whom the medical community would describe as \u201cseverely autistic\u201d matriculate to college. By some estimates, only 20 nonspeaking people with autism have ever earned a college degree. Tito Mukhopadhyay, author of three books and perhaps the world\u2019s most renowned nonspeaking autist, puts it this way: \u201cMy school is the doubt in your eyes.\u201d We know of non verbal \u201cseverely\u201d autistic people who have been or are currently attending colleges and universities. If they haven\u2019t done that, they\u2019ve written insightful books on autism, are important researchers in the field of autism, and lend perspective about themselves and the human condition. Their contributions are evolving our view of how autistic people and those with other disabilities are viewed. The goal? An understanding of what it means to be accommodated in order to be able to contribute and to be accepted. Although I click my heels (there\u2019s no place like home) with glee everytime I read one of these articles that raise the bar higher, I have to recall the recent story in my hometown of Toronto where  Ashif Jaffer, a student with Down syndrome, was forced to withdraw from York University because he required assistance.  It\u2019s an interesting story and one to keep an eye on because many autistic individuals require assistance and accommodation to attend colleges and universities. Also, many are asked to leave precisely for this reason. There is little understanding of why an autistic individual is often dependent, in various degrees, and perhaps too much value placed on the myth of independence \u2014 at least the value of it. With new technologies, I see autistic individuals better able to respond and contribute to our university programs, but our institutions of higher education are not quite prepared, and still lack understanding of what assistance means for the disabled to be able to participate as they are in our society.

{"date": "2011/02/23", "body": "Adam went on a short trial of Ritalin last week, not for autism but for the ADHD he now apparently \u201chas.\u201d Please, I\u2019m not trying to be cynical. I just believe in a healthy dose of skepticism for the sake of getting things right for my son. There are many of you with a lot more experience with medications, and I value the input you have given me on my Facebook page. When Adam turned thirteen months of age, he didn\u2019t walk, he just started running. Now, Adam has to sit at a desk and concentrate. Yes, like so many other families with hyperactive kids, we decided to give this a try. Yes, like so many other families, particularly ones with autistic family members in them, I\u2019m not entirely happy to put Adam on anything and wish he could have more sensory breaks in his day as part of his accommodation. And yes, I\u2019m taking my personal bias out of this because I\u2019m trying to find the best options for Adam. I mean, what if Ritalin, or something like this helps him learn because he can focus more, right? At least that\u2019s the logic that I\u2019ve been hearing, and it sounds reasonable. It was an extremely interesting trial, and it\u2019s not over. We have debated for years what consitutes a \u201chigh or low functioning\u201d autistic person. So often, kids with lots of \u201cbehaviours\u201d and non verbal learning disabilities are deemed \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d For proof, take a look at this chart I found today which describes someone who is classically autistic and non verbal as likely retarded or severely delayed: Many people have delays. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s the real issue.  Adam is distractable. He is given very junior work at school because he has trouble responding in typical ways. Until he does, he is held back. It seems reasonable on the one hand \u2014 generally teachers do not want to go to fast or assume a child understands or comprehends if they cannot respond fluidly. I\u2019m not blaming the teachers. I can see the logic in teaching a child how to respond and trying to figure out what the child actually comprehends. On the other hand, what if a child does and s/he cannot type fast yet, or is so distractable that it\u2019s  difficult to know  what they comprehend? Ah, the rub of teaching the intelligent non verbal autistic person. (Yes, the ones we have also called mentally retarded and low functioning\u2026but I must be fair\u2026 there are more people who  get  that Adam is a very bright little boy too). The Ritalin was proof for me about what Adam understands \u2014 you can\u2019t learn what he knows in the two days he was on it.  It confirmed what I knew all along. He could listen to many instructions, complete tasks, do things I\u2019ve never seen him do before so quickly.  And yet . His legs couldn\u2019t stop moving. He seemed agitated. His smile disappeared. He did not want anyone to touch him.  I\u2019ve always thought that Adam was classically autistic. I\u2019ve always known that he understands me, can comprehend so much, and knows how to do so many things. He naturally learns in his enivornment and yet, his disability makes it so difficult for him to focus and respond.  Still, he can respond and learn and it appears (to us) like a slower process. He needs to complete tasks and work ten to fifteen minutes at a time. For the work he is really into, he can concentrate for long periods of time (hmmm\u2026usually those are called obsessive interests or preserverations. His would be animals, planets\u2026) What price do autistic people have to pay? I think so much\u2026more than we would expect of typical children, although we medicate them too. I\u2019m sorry to say that one drug has had to confirm that my autistic son is intelligent and has so much ability. He has a disability that we are still learning to work with, educate and accommodate, yet our kids are part of a generation of trial and error. Sure, we might be a little farther ahead than the previous generation of autistics but I\u2019m not so sure, either.  I do not want to make Adam into a zombie-robot. That\u2019s what I saw (granted it was only a two-day trial and I\u2019ll have more to say as we garner more experience). I\u2019m interested to learn and discover of how to accommodate Adam without taking away his innate joy, smile, and HIS desire to connect with other people. I\u2019m also not certain what part of the autistic learning process it may also be suppressing. Since we don\u2019t value the way autistic people learn naturally, I have to question this too. I think we should all be asking a helluva a lot more questions. I\u2019m trying to find the right questions to ask.

I\u2019ve loved typeface since I was a child, remembering picking up my mother\u2019s collection of old brown\u00a0volumes of\u00a0Encyclopedia\u00a0Brittanica. I admired the letters, words and sentences before I could read them. Around the age of four, I tried to write letters of the alphabet by sounding them out. I was proud as I showed my mother warbled symbols drawn with red crayon.\u00a0I don\u2019t know if I wrote all the letters correctly, but I  yearned  to read\u2026 and write.\u00a0 These days I\u2019m still attracted to typeface and letters, am a big fan of Cy Twombly and the artist, Agata Ostrowska (a printmaker whose work I\u2019ve posted at the beginning here), and others who incorporate text into their work. It\u2019s an \u201cobsessive interest,\u201d I guess you could say. I love the way one word can have one meaning when it stands alone, but when placed beside another, can connote something different. Long after my \u201cobsession\u201d was contently embedded, I gave birth to an autistic child who also loves letters and read them by 11 months of age. I revelled in his ability while many others told me to be on alert \u2014 that Adam, with \u201chyperlexia,\u201d meant that he would be able to decode words and letters, but his reading skills would still suffer later on \u2014 when he had to read phonetically and comprehend. Yet, the other day, while sitting on\u00a0his bedroom floor in the twilight,\u00a0\u00a0I pulled out some pictures and words that I thought were completely unfamiliar. It seemed no-brainer to him. He just knew what all these pictures were. He picked up the information somewhere and organized it. I think kids like Adam are like sponges, picking everything up and making sense of it in their own way, despite the fact that we don\u2019t always think so. Language and comprehension is like art. We don\u2019t necessarily acquire it the way Penelope Leach and Dr. Spock insist young children do, and we cannot be certain of how it is experienced and acquired, except that it does seem to be experienced on many sensory levels. We can make assumptions by how a person communicates, through different forms of expression. Like art, language acquisition, although widely studied, is largely ineffable; so vast that we will never know enough. Lists, and obsessive interests like purported autistic collectors and artists like  Joseph Cornell  and Gregory Blackstock  added fuel to my existing interest in not just letters, but the lists they can become. These are the way we organize information and make sense of them \u2014 the child who lines up the trains, the objects, perhaps, the artist who draws cities in perfect detail from memory , or the child who builds their knowledge like intricate networks of scaffolded knowledge. These are the ways we make sense and order of things. Umberto Eco, art historian and novelist, by virtue of his profession, is interested in form, structure and order. As a curator of art, I too understand the art of catalogue. I enjoyed working in a library for part of my university career for this very reason. I loved the smell and feel of card catalogues in and of themselves. I understand the way curators and librarians collect things and how important it is \u2014 these libraries of human thought. In his book,  The Infinity of Lists , Eco made me think about how I think Adam acquires language \u2014 like the curator \u2014 filing and cataloguing and even enjoying every sensory aspect like the musty smell of the card catalogue. How we take for granted the sheer art form of it. \u00a0 \n To finish this post, I\u2019ll leave the idea hanging for now. Just enjoy this. It\u2019s something Adam found, actually: \n \n But since we have digressed abundantly, \nTurn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path, \nSo that the way be shortened with time. \n This nature doth so multiply itself \nIn numbers, that there never yet was speech \nNor mortal fancy that can go so far. \n And if thou notest that which is revealed \nBy Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands \nNumber determinate is kept concealed. \n This primal light, that all irradiates it, \nBy modes as many is received therein, \nAs are the splendours wherewith it is mated. \n Hence, inasmuch as on the act of the conceptive \nThe affection followeth, of love the sweetness \nTherein diversely fervid is or tepid. \n The height behold now and the amplitude \nOr the eternal power, since it hath made \nItself so many mirrors, where \u2019tis broken \n One in itself remaining as before. \n \u2014 Excerpt from Dante\u2019s The Divine Comedy, from Paradise, Canto XXIX, VV, 126-45.

{"date": "2011/02/28", "body": "When we have that right space, that corner, whatever it is that we can claim for ourselves, we can loosen up, be creative and explore.  It\u2019s the same for children. The world is different. Therefore, learning should be different, and it is certain that all children learn in a variety of ways.  As I did a little google search in looking into how I might design an art studio in my home for Adam I began to think about how we design our schools to assist with learning differences. How can space foster creativity? When I watched  this video of  Odrup School in Denmark , it struck me how cluttered our current school environments are, and how limited they are in terms of letting our kids physically move throughtout the day. We still expect that learning can only happen while sitting compliantly at a desk. Uncluttered environments, and ones that allow for sensory exploration, better enable our autistic kids to thrive and contribute as autistic people \u2014 not only would they get the sensory input they need in order to be settled, but project-based learning can be more expansive.  \u201cCoping\u201d with autistic children and learning go far beyond the autistic person him/herself, and we might look at how we set our children up for failure as the culprit rather than for success. We don\u2019t usually consider these options because it is sometimes easier not to change our ways.This is a systemic issue that speaks to how we believe learning  ought  to happen based on what we used to do.  What if you could make art out of a math project? In art history, (a course in Piero Della Francesca to be precise), I had to make geometric models of his paintings. Math is a challenge for me, but the project taught me more about math and persepctive than I ever learned while sitting in high school. Do we also not value collaboration? What if we enabled autistic people to work in more collaborative environments? Right, we say they don\u2019t have the \u201csocial skills\u201d to be able to do so. But wait. When Adam hears his peers answering questions, he is more apt to answer. He works harder when he sits with his peers in a circle. Sure, everyone needs to also learn to work alone, but it\u2019s a piece of the process. Adam takes a lot of pride with his peers and teachers when he does well.  If we value these things and understand their importance on one level, then why do we seem to think that sitting at a table for forty hours a week is the ultimate way to teach an autistic person? Why do we consider that necessary or even fair? We talk often about how autistic people learn, and in so doing we have to talk about the environments that people best thrive in. Our space is yet another important tool for learning and it reflects what we believe about it, about people, and most of all, if we truly value and want to foster an inclusive society.

{"date": "2011/03/04", "body": "I haven\u2019t written because I\u2019m having nightmares. Last Sunday, the house I built with Adam\u2019s dad (it took us from start to finish maybe three years and a bit) went ablaze. It\u2019s completely ruined. The outer structure looks fine but the inferno shot flames twelve feet out of the garage. The entire inside is charred and burned. I was the first to get the call. My neighbour/friend called me in trying to reach my ex, \u201cEs, there\u2019s twelve foot flames coming out of your garage!\u201d she panicked in her othewise cheerful South African accent. I told her to hold on as I frantically tried to contact Adam\u2019s dad who was in the air enroute home. I fumbled with my cell phone calling every number I could think of, and the people who might know where he was \u2014 my voice was urgent. Adam quieted as he could see something was wrong.  \u201cYou should see it, man! There are firetrucks and police cars everywhere. There\u2019s so much smoke you cannot even see down the street,\u201d said my friend when I called her back. She sounded out of breath and I noticed that my hands began to shake. I learned in the meantime that Adam\u2019s dad would land with devastating messages on his Blackberry. I could not go to the house right away. I knew it was being looked after. I could not go to the house where I moved my toddler-Adam into, now completely ruined. I went later after I gathered my thoughts and courage. All I can think of since that time are the  what-ifs  \u2014 that stuff people tell you NOT to think about because  thank God no one was in the house and everyone is safe , bit.  It\u2019s just a thing , some say.  It can be replaced.  While all of that is absolutely true, I do know that  this new house  Adam and I moved into rebuilt me. I know intimately, the value of space \u2014 how we shape it and it shapes us. I put every bit of my energy and spirit here to start our new lives\u2026and it\u2019s lovely, I have to admit. Adam feels at home here and we two cheerfully snuggle lots on our comfy couch. Adam felt at home there, too. Adam\u2019s dad and I have managed to keep his routines and environments as consistent as possible. So, we decided not to tell Adam about the fire or take him near the house. It\u2019s not necessary to expose him to such tragedy when environments are so important to him and when he might fret over a disaster over and over like a bad commercial jingle we can\u2019t get out of our heads. Thankfully, he is used to his dad\u2019s parent\u2019s house where they can stay when they are together. In the meantime, as his dad figures out what comes next, we can prepare Adam for his next move. That\u2019s the practical side of me. There\u2019s that scared sick side, the  what if  side that is giving me nightmares, and yes, a grateful side that we are content in our new home, and that  everyone  is safe. It was a a disaster indeed, but a tragedy averted. It has opened my eyes \u2014 yet again \u2014 to the fragility of everything.

I  can\u2019t stop myself from setting the date to open the pool, to think about the gardening I want to do this year, and to imagine where Adam and I will be a few years from now. I am imagining his, ours, and my future.  Next week is my birthday. I foraged through old photos of myself that I thought were taken as they say, \u201cjust yesterday,\u201d only to realize that some of them were taken ten years ago. Adam will be nine years old this year. In the flurry of major life-transitions, I haven\u2019t really realized how fast the time has gone. Going into my third year of single motherhood, possibilities are just beginning to dawn on me.  I have to acknowledge the writer gals who have kept me company along the way.  When author of  Falling Apart In One Piece , Stacy Morrison, said it took her five years to feel like herself again, I am now beginning to understand.  Elizabeth Gilbert, whose quote from  Eat Pray Love  was included in the movie said, \u201cRuin is gift. Ruin is the road to transformation.\u201d I can begin to see that too. I know the book was popular and I\u2019m not supposed to like it, but like millions of women, I did. I love memoir and it was well written. I often pay  my quiet homage next to the glow of night light to Joan Didion, Virginia Woolf, Louise De Salvo, among many others. Richard, another student from my writing class said to me that we don\u2019t \u201cheal\u201d from the events or people that wound us, yet we can make it become part of us. We are both divorced and his words were well-timed. We can\u2019t expect to abandon pain completely, but we can learn and grow from it. We can become something different.  Beauty isn\u2019t in perfection. It\u2019s the potential we can see among the ruin. I imagine myself like spring itself \u2014 me, Estee, the one born on the cusp of spring, on an early Monday morning in a soft and gentle rain \u2014 nurturing the earth to sprout again. I am grateful for the circle of time and that spring has returned.  So have I.

What a disaster of proportions only imagined by me, as I watch images of towns completely destroyed by water. On the television screen the water appears to roll in calmly. Then, as houses are torn from their foundations and begin crashing into others, I get a sense of what this image, in real time, may feel and sound like.  The ruin in Japan is almost unbelievable; this country which prepared itself, by code, for such a natural disaster. Yet, parts could not hold. I began to think about the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, where friends stayed in Sri Lanka and told me their story of how the water surged to their hotel. My boyfriend flew there the following day. He showed me pictures of the ruin, recounting the despondent men searching along the beach for their missing wives and children.  A group of Sri Lankan women posed for him despite the atrophy. All bunched together as if for a Facebook party photo, their teeth and eyes gleamed. I couldn\u2019t tell from a picture if they were just happy to be alive, or happy to be in a photo taken by a Westerner. Even that simple act brought happiness. Or was their happiness innate? Which brings me to the Fukushima 50 \u2014 those employees of the nuclear power plant in Japan. They were left at the plant to assess damage and cool the reactors with seawater to avert a possible meltdown. It\u2019s not going well. Still, they remain to try and avert a disaster \u2014 to protect others. These fifty or so men will die. Their exposure to the radiation will be too much. Fifty men.

{"date": "2011/03/29", "body": "I went to Bequia for March Break. It was my turn to take a vacation as Adam\u2019s dad had him over the holiday. The island is in St. Vincent in the Grenadines and is really remote. I enjoyed every second of it. As a single mom, I have a life with Adam and a life without. We are building a new life over the crumbled mortar of the last one, and often, that makes for beautiful design. One realization I had after so much stress is that it is more important to be a happy parent of our children. Not only do I have to run Adam\u2019s programs and team, but I think he\u2019ll remember most the times when I was quiet with him on his bed reading books together, or we made jokes and laughed together. When I\u2019m relaxed and fulfilled in my life, I find I have much more to give to Adam.  So I travel when Adam is with his dad,  almost  guilt-free. I sure do miss Adam when I\u2019m away, but I also love being on my own again too.  I also want to travel with Adam as part of my plan for writing and for building our family life.  I need to travel to get new ideas and see life differently, and I believe children benefit too.  I know that many parents hesitate traveling afar with their autistic children, and you can count me in. I\u2019m worried about the flight, delays. A good plan is in the making. Changing environments seems at odds for the autistic child who seems to need routine. Yet, Adam has also enjoys changes in environment. He tends to talk more when there is a change. So it\u2019s a bit of a paradox. It\u2019s the accommodations that bother him for the first few days which I have to think about in advance. I am trying to figure out how to make him feel more at ease when he\u2019s in other people\u2019s houses or when we are in hotels. My idea?  I\u2019m thinking of renting a place in Europe that we can treat as our home base, invite friends, and take day trips. This is what I imagine: I rent that villa in Italy I always dreamed of and bring Adam with me. We walk the Palazzo in Firenze, eating fast-melting gelato on a hot Italian day as hundreds of pigeons scatter, the quick flutter of their wings providing a light breeze against our glistening skin. Adam gleefully watches their flapping wings in unison. We find a cafe off the main square at noon, the cathedral bells asking us to rest. He loves the spicy salami sweating in the yellow ochre sunlight and  gathers whole pieces in his hands to take a bite. The ripe plum tomatoes  burst in our mouths. As we lean back in our chairs content, the sound of footsteps and voices swell and dim as stylish men and women pass by easily on uneven cobblestones. I order a cappuccino and Adam eagerly spoons off the foam.  Then, we walk across the square to the Uffizi and oogle the  Birth of Venus  and her flowing blonde hair. The long corridor leads to the next room, our feet echoing along.   Children\u2019s voices whine to go home or to the bathroom in foreign languages and parents say shoosh. I tilt my head sweetly at Fra Fillipo Lippi\u2019s  Madonna with Child and Angels . Then, I crouch down, and give my own growing angel a kiss.  Every reality begins with a dream. I have many and they all, even when I\u2019m on my own, include Adam. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2011/03/29/travelling/", "title": "Travelling"},

{"date": "2011/03/31", "body": "Toronto weather is undecided. Yesterday the city was teased by sunshine and the smell of defrosting earth. When I awoke this morning, a film of white covered by backyard. It was like that ( I was away) last week. March 22nd was delightful, I was told. A real spring. The tulips were sprouting. The following day my girlfriend sent me a picture on my phone \u2013Toronto was having another snowstorm. Schizoid weather makes it difficult to plan whether or not I should uncover the backyard furniture and start putting out the planting pots, but that\u2019s the kind of city I live in. My house is crying throughout it all.  There is a big leak in the brick wall out front. The walls are buckling and water drips out of the brick like tears. I have a patio that is over my garage. It\u2019s too narrow to be a real patio \u2014 it\u2019s more like an awning \u2014  and the drainage is bad. My gut wrenches wondering if I have to tear down a whole wall and put an iron fence up instead.  I ache over the possible expense. I\u2019m hoping that I, and my wall, can survive the thaw with a cheaper remedy. Like the weather, I\u2019m undecided about my writing. One day I want to just write about experience and let it rip. I\u2019m currently in love with memoir. I want to write about disability memoir as I\u2019m writing my own.  My mother approached me yesterday about my Italian dream blog post: \u201cI\u2019m a little worried about your blog writing,\u201d she said, carefully searching my face. \u201cWhat if someone gets mad at you?\u201d Our previous laughter stopped cold.  \u201cMom,\u201d I said as I put my glass of water gently down on my cracked counter-top. \u201cPeople have already been mad at me. I just can\u2019t stop writing. If I do, I won\u2019t be able to breathe.\u201d I realized what I said was true \u2014 not just some dramatic statement for the sake of winning a point.  If I have talent or not, it\u2019s beside the point. I need to write, and I get enough emails from readers to at least support me and keep going. I\u2019m not ashamed to say that I gobble this feedback like a starving person \u2014 so grateful for it\u2026thank you. Writing  is  lonely. Her comment, though, made me briefly think of not writing at all. My stomach tightened and I grew anxious. I\u2019ve been writing since grade five, when my five-foot feminist teacher believed it was in me to write. When I was a teenager, I spent nights sitting on my bed with the dim bed-side table-lamp writing reams of pages to a girlfriend who lived abroad \u2014 mostly about boys. When I\u2019m alone, still, I\u2019m always writing in notebooks, mainly on my bed before Adam wakes.  I write in them every morning. Is  this  what makes me a writer? It\u2019s such an odd self-ascribed title. Yes, I\u2019ve been published a few times, but every piece of writing is like starting a new venture.  Writing about myself and my life is like digging in my garden and showing you the dirt as well as the flowers. It can be unnerving as I try so hard not to cringe at that dirty feeling on my hands. Sometimes I have doubts. They are probably good doubts when figuring out how to represent others fairly as well as myself. All characters, in fiction and non fiction, are complicated. Wason Choy , a Canadian writer once said in a class I attended, that everyone who comes into contact with a writer should know that they are somehow going to be a part of our story.  He didn\u2019t say it quite like that, but Wason has written a lot about his Chinese-Canadian family.  In the New York Writer\u2019s Workshop\u2019s  The Portable MFA in Creative Writing , it says the following about memoir in \u201cWhy You Should Write About Your Unhappy Family\u201d: One of the most common excuses for people not writing the book they want to write \u2014 usually involving their family \u2014 is that it would hurt someone. Writing a book always hurts someone \u2014 preeminently the writer, who grows poorer and more alienated. And banging the head on the desk and devouring the contents of the refrigerator don\u2019t do a lot for self-esteem. Writing is hard work, and we always want to avoid it unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Obviously though, you need to apply common sense and a sense of empathy.  There are many choices a writer must decide along the way. I guess today I\u2019m banging my head on my desk and isolate myself, yet again, in a 10\u00d710 room with this computer. It\u2019s raining outside now and my wall is bawling. The work continues.

{"date": "2010/08/11", "body": "We hate it when we see our children get sick. When we watch them suffer, all we say is that we wish we could suffer for them. Honestly, watching Adam be ill is one of the hardest things.\u00a0 Yet I know what to do. I know how to take care of him. As a single mom who becomes ill herself I am more at a loss. After that wonderful weekend in New York with my fellow autism bloggers, I seemed to be functioning fine. Then on Monday evening, \u00a0all of a sudden, I began to shiver uncontrollably. In the middle of one of Toronto\u2019s hottest summers, I began layering myself with winter socks, sweaters\u00a0 and six blankets. This began to happen when Adam came home from camp and from time spent with his dad\u00a0and I hadn\u2019t seen Adam\u00a0for a few days! \u00a0I had to pull myself together long enough to get food on the table, and ready him for bed. I could hardly read the books and play the games I had planned for his homecoming. Adam\u2019s face was beaming at seeing me and I felt like I was cheating him, even though I knew it couldn\u2019t be helped. After I got him to sleep, I went to my own bed, layering myself with more blankets and a heating pad, knowing full well I must have a raging fever.\u00a0 Then it suddenly began to hurt when I was breathing in on my right side. I knew I was getting a kidney infection after having one when I was a kid. I have never in my life shivered like that and I knew I should probably go to the E.R. Yet with Adam sleeping, I had to consider if I could make it through the night until I could see my doctor in the morning. The shivering was so bad my muscles began to hurt. \u00a0I had to start considering my options. I am an only child. I don\u2019t have siblings to call on for assistance. I have friends who I would call if it really was my last option, as I\u2019m the type who doesn\u2019t like to ask for help\u00a0unless it\u2019s critical. Instead, I have parents \u2014 the loving grandparents of Adam who take him on long walks in our beloved\u00a0city or some\u00a0forest path in the country, for subway rides and to places I\u2019m certain I\u2019ve never been. \u00a0As long as they are here, they are always\u00a0 ready to help Adam and I, always on call, and this is a gift I don\u2019t take\u00a0for granted. They were eager to come over but I waited a little bit until I could wait no more (because I am stubborn).\u00a0Dad took me to the E.R. while my mother stayed at my home for Adam. Yet I wonder how I would have gotten\u00a0to the hospital \u00a0if I did not have anyone to call in the night for help with Adam. If I was single without children, I would have just called a cab and made it to the hospital myself. It\u2019s not like that when we have children. With autistic children, if this were the daytime, I would also need extra assistance because Adam would have difficulty playing quietly in a room for hours and hours. It got me thinking about single parenthood and how we all need support. As single aut-moms or dads, we need extra support in times like these precisely because our autistic children need extra\u00a0assistance as well. It got me thinking about our interdependence and community and how we need to be on call for others as much as we need others on call for us. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an only-child thing, but it\u2019s difficult for me to ask for help.\u00a0 I also wonder in all of this, if\u00a0  Individualism  may have gone too far,\u00a0and it\u2019s something that we all know as autistic people and\u00a0parents of autstic people that we cannot afford.\u00a0\u00a0No wo/man is an island, although we seem to think that we should be. There are writings out there about how we can seek extra supports. Books like  More Than A Mom , for parents with special needs children. There are some good resources out there that can help us with ideas. It\u2019s definitely important to create a back-up plan as single parents, for it really does take a \u00a0community to raise a child, and we need our support systems organized and ready. In the meantime, I\u2019ve not only learned another lesson in my new role as single parent, but I am humbled, if not grateful, that there are people willing to lend a helping hand.

The ones I found most helpful to me in those early days were the ones where many autistic adults \u201cran the show.\u201d There was nothing more helpful to me at the time in trying to understand Adam, autism and the future for us both, than in meeting adults who were living their lives successfully \u2014 non verbal typists to wonderfully verbose Aspergians. I learned from everyone that there is a future for autistic people except that the issue for autistic people was that they were often not invited to speak at autism conferences for parents, or invited to participate on policy panels regarding the treatment and services required for autistic people. As I said, I think this helped me become a more settled, accepting parent. I avoided parent conferences after that primarily because I was avoiding negative messages, fear and stereotypes perpetuated largely by non autistic \u201cautism experts.\u201d A couple of years later, interested in pumping my writing life \u201cup\u201d again, I attended this year\u2019s  Blogher Conference in New York City  where I met many autism mom bloggers that you may already be familiar with: This Mom \n Niks Mom \n Thinking Guide to Autism \n Susan Senator  (although we crossed paths this trip) \n Stimeyland \n We Go With Him \n Love That Max \n MFA Mama \n Sneak Peek At Me \n Have Autism Will Travel \n Pixie Mama \n The Betty And Boo Chronicles \n AspieAdvocate Squidilicious (If I missed a blog, can someone please post it in the comments?) At the autism panel I was really overjoyed at the outcome as I have never heard parents so contented with the  state of autistic being.  For me, this is a real change from parent conferences I attended in the past. Perhaps this is the next step in the history of autism acceptance within which we are all participating and creating. There was discussion about the isolation as an autism parent \u2014 that the diagnosis of autism, we were told, is \u201clife-ending.\u201d Then, there was laughter in the room. Yet, I acknowledge that I did feel in the beginning that I would be all alone in this. There is some truth that when speaking to others about autism, it is sometimes tiring in that we are always educating others and thus feeling separate from them, not to mention some missed coffee klatches because our lives are different. Feelings of isolation are very real, and yet, I was wishing that every newly diagnosed parent and child (and I will say parent and child because it effects both so deeply), could listen to this kind of presentation. Maybe newbie autism parents would feel a sense of relief that we all so deserve. My favorite line was from a mom who described her child having fun and being happy to which she responded with ironic laughter, \u201coh isn\u2019t it so sad, there\u2019s the misery.\u201d There was no misery in this autism room in NYC, We\u2019re no psychedelic dreamers. We have our feet on the ground, and we\u2019re still smiling.

{"date": "2010/11/29", "body": "\u201cYou can\u2019t say your child is great,\u201d I was told when looking into services for Adam. As part of our growing process, we have to know what is available to us. I was discussing how Adam has many challenges and is also: -affable \n-affectionate \n-likes to be social but has difficulty at times\u2026 \u201cHe sounds great,\u201d interrupted the woman I was speaking to on the telephone who had asked me what Adam was like. \u201cJust so you know, I have a child with Down\u2019s syndrome. It\u2019s a drag to have to paint the worst scenario, but in order to get services, you just have to.\u201d Why subjugate our wonderful children, young and old, to terminal fates? You remember \u2014 the ones \u201cworse than cancer.\u201d Why must we have to paint a dimsal picture, or view people with disabilities as something horrible and devastating to us and society? This is the very reason why we\u2019ve had such misrepresentation that hurts autistic people, and why parents are literally forced to represent ourselves as desperate, our children as hopeless without certain types of services.  People with challenges have a right to support. At the same time, we have a right to love and cherish our children and believe in them. We have a right to think our children our terrific, great, a joy, even. It\u2019s not sugar coating anything (back in the day, I was accused of this). My child needs lots of support. I do not wish to embellish anything. I simply want to tell people what he needs as his inherent right. As it is, the services and supports for autistic people here in Ontario are neither diverse nor robust. If there is a thing called fate, I think it\u2019s terminal for all of us, isn\u2019t it? I sure wouldn\u2019t call autism a fate worse than cancer and to be honest, I find it really hard to speak about my son in a way that I find demeaning to him. There are facts, and there are exaggerations. We all want to make the best of the lives we have, and so we should \u2014 with the support we need, and the love in our hearts that we just need to express.

{"date": "2010/08/16", "body": "I am writing this at 3:00 a.m. I left Adam\u2019s room at approximately ten o\u2019clock hoping he would go go sleep. I know I\u00a0did, but I suddenly woke up at two. I was hoping to fall back to sleep but decided to heed some sage advice and not fight it. I\u2019ve heard that if you cannot go back to sleep, just get up and do something else. The sleep will come. Sleep is a huge issue for many of us. I remember three years of complete sleep deprivation after Adam was born: three hours of soothing and rocking him alone in a dark room, creeping out of his room on all fours because the floors were creaky and would wake him, only to have him wake up every hour and a half anyway. I remember feeling tired, frustrated and this certainly had an effect on the way I interacted with Adam in the early years, and I didn\u2019t even get a reprieve by way of a\u00a0naptime. I tried to \u201cFeberize\u201d him to no avail.\u00a0\u00a0I was always flabbergasted that Adam could keep on going on such little sleep. Later on, we discovered  Melatonin\u00a0\u00a0 which is the only thing that usually helps him fall asleep when he is particularly wired,\u00a0except for these monthly anomolies where it has zero effect, and I have not discovered the reason specific to Adam. As I began to quietly descend the stairs in what is typically called  the dark night of the soul , coined by F. Scott Fitzgerald, \u00a0I hear Adam\u00a0mumbling softly\u00a0to himself \u2014 quite a change from the infant and toddler days when he would cry. \u00a0In fact, my office is directly underneath his bedroom and I can hear him moving about contentedly right now. I write this because it\u2019s another feat in our coexistence as\u00a0two different kinds of people.\u00a0It used to be that Adam would make much more noise and I would spend hours trying to settle him. Perhpas because of experience, knowing that  autistic cicadian rhythms have been reported to be different in autistic individuals ,\u00a0I have decided on an alternate strategy:  not  to fight it. I am teaching Adam how to stay alone in his room quietly and do other things. It still requires some of my\u00a0effort, my reminding (and perhaps some dark circles\u00a0under my eyes in the morning),\u00a0but I know it will be worth it as he is growing and maturing.\u00a0 As he grows older, he will be able to use this time to read, study,\u00a0work on the computer, but right now I would hesitate putting him on the computer because he will gear him up rather than wind him down. This happens to Adam about once a month, I\u2019ve recorded. He seems to wake at 2:00 a.m. and he goes to camp or school and has, usually a fabulous day while I am otherwise\u00a0dreary-eyed. Still, I am discovering that I too am developing a\u00a0remarkable energy that I didn\u2019t think I had before. It\u2019s amazing how\u00a0things don\u2019t feel as difficult if we try to work with the circumstances.\u00a0In fact, I planned on reading and writing a bit before I realized that Adam was awake. \u00a0I\u2019ve ensured that the house is safe in the event I do doze off and he decides to roam, and this might be in large part why I can\u00a0relax. \u00a0So far,\u00a0Adam stays in his room. I suppose the only thing is my sensitivity to Adam. I didn\u2019t think I \u00a0heard him at two, although I must have. It would be nice to know thatI can sleep through the night while he does what he has to do\u2026.safely. We\u2019re getting there. I sit here writing sort of amazed at how far I\u2019ve come in this. Another milestone, perhaps, not for Adam, the autistic child, but for Estee, the autism mom. It\u2019s past three a.m. now. The dark night will quickly turn to dawn.

{"date": "2010/08/13", "body": "Last weekend, I attended my first conference in over two years. It was the  Blogher Conference  in New York City where I met up with fellow autism-mom bloggers. I remarked on how I noticed the positive attitudes towards autism among parents that wasn\u2019t so prominent a few years ago. In response, I got a comment stating that I should attend  Autreat .\u00a0Well, I had in 2007. Back in my earlier days, because the climate among parent communities was so negative, I sought out autistic individuals who shaped my view of autism and assisted Adam and I on our journey. I thought instead of having people sort through 800 pages of archived Joy of Autism blog (on the right margin), I\u2019d dig this up. It\u2019s a copy and paste job, so \u00a0I apologize in advance if the formatting appears off. No matter how I tried to fix it, it just kept reverting into a mess. I called this post: Are We Listening? \n The audience waved their hands\u00a0in the air \u2013 the deaf sign for\u00a0waving. There were others who rocked back and forth, some\u00a0other adults who gracefully\u00a0flapped their hands. Drake sat in the front and squealed in\u00a0acknowledgment when the\u00a0speaker said, \u201cjust because you don\u2019t cry, doesn\u2019t mean you are\u00a0not sad,\u201d in acknowledgment to\u00a0how many autistics take time to process their emotions. The squeal was a \u201cyes yes!\u201d to the\u00a0speaker\u2019s comments, and in any other setting, this highly\u00a0intelligent, non verbal autistic eleven-year-old may have been asked to leave, or others might have stared, thinking that he didn\u2019t think of anything at all. Yet Drake kept doing this. He sat longer than any other eleven-year-old I\u2019ve ever met and made his noises in acknowledgment of the important points. \u201cI am fortified by being here,\u201d he wrote on his Lightwriter, a keyboard with a small  screen that speaks for him after he types his sentence. I sat in the room and wished Adam was with me, his soft fiveyear- old hair brushing my jaw, snuggling up to me as he always does, and then taking breaks to jump up and down. Yet, I felt comforted in knowing that he would be there next year, and the year after that. I felt comforted that all of these people  are him years from now, and how privileged I felt that they were paving the way, for it is a tough way, like swimming up a rapid flowing stream. It is rare to sit in a room with so many other autistic people, some walking back and forth in the lunch room humming to themselves in a heightened perhaps even ecstatic state, where I can only imagine in other less accepting settings, would be frowned upon. When I came to squeeze into the small space where this young man hummed to deposit my lunch tray, he politely moved away to make room for me, extremely aware despite the fact that some people might believe otherwise. When I saw him next time in the leisure area, he was asking others to play a board game with him. Other autistic kids were hanging out together, and sprawled themselves out on couches in front of the TV, not unlike other teenagers. Around the grounds, people wore badges that indicated if they wanted to talk, if they would only talk to people they knew, or if they did not wish to talk at all. There were many times I wanted to flip my own badge that indicated the latter \u2013 as I am a person who likes to absorb and observe, yet have been taught to socialize and be diplomatic and suffer from a compulsion to keep that impression going. Although it\u2019s a skill I\u2019ve acquired, I still find it exhausting. I wished that those badges existed at the many functions I have attended, where most people pretend to be something that they\u2019re not, or interested in things that others say that they actually have no interest in at all. I consider all the wasted time I\u2019ve had to spend doing \u201csmall talk.\u201d and all the time I spend in explaining life as we know it to people who don\u2019t have the time to understand. The heat was oppressive this time of year. Yet, we were shaded by trees. My hair unkempt and my skin moist from the humidity, I unraveled. I could do what I needed to, to think. We were free to lie down during lectures, or roll up and be comfortable on the otherwise uncomfortable frayed wool couches \u2014 remnants from the 1970\u2019s. No lights were on in the summer heat, the hardworking garbled hum of old air conditioners tilting precariously in the windows of the lecture room. The atmosphere was as honest as the discussions were. We tried to figure out how to manage all the issues confronting autistic people today, how to give another message to parents that there are more options than they are aware of \u2013 because they don\u2019t hear it when all they hear about is ABA (in Canada specifically). The atmosphere was welcoming, where fear and confrontation were strangely absent. Strange because it is a sad reality of autism politics these days \u2013 where some non autistic people never get exposed to disabled people to hear the real views and issues. It was strange as it was relieving.  This  was autism, and it was comfortable. I didn\u2019t have to be appropriate, I could say when I had to leave without a guilty fuss. No one will judge me here. And no one will be judged. It\u2019s called Autreat. It\u2019s a place I\u2019ve never felt or experienced before, and I will want Adam to come again so he too can be fortified. Adam\u2019s fortification is what\u2019s tantamount here, as I try to raise him so that he knows who he is with autism, amidst a world that doesn\u2019t understand it or explains it inappropriately. It is important that he understand himself as not a defect, but as a person. It is why we as parents cannot accept  misery rhetoric , because no matter what level of \u201cfunctioning\u201d (that term means nothing as it has no bearing on either intelligence or awareness), no autistic child should have to grow up in an inhospitable environment that threatens their self-worth. Inhospitable and unsafe environments are those in which we seek to normalize and reward normal responses to tasks where the autistic response is never acknowledged, rewarded or accepted, thus valued. By never rewarding an autistic person for being autistic, we threaten their self-esteem and identity. Most will grow up being confused because every well-intentioned therapist was so \u201cnice\u201d to them. We have to train our therapists and clinicians to understand autism \u2013 because most of them currently do not. They do not yet understand how an autistic person learns. They turn to operationalized methods that all seek at this time to make the child not autistic, without valuing the autism. DRI and RDI are also designed to \u201ccreate a mind,\u201d or have a child \u201cplay normally\u201d to which the autistic audience gasped in disgust. What are those \u201cgurus\u201d implying? That the autistic people who could sit and listen, and contribute, either verbally or in writing need to re-create their minds in a fashion that suits the rest of the so-called \u201cnormal\u201d population? I surmised that many parents are and are reluctant to give up ABA becasue they may not understand that there ARE so many options and so many opportunities to educate and for a great quality of life. The latter is what hopefully unites us. What disunites us is the definition of what that quality of life entails \u2013 a life with or without autism. I seek the former because I have seen that we can live a good life, thank you very much. Quality of life is not determined by whether or not you drive a car, but rather, what you make of your life, and your attitude. Autistic people are capable, and how can we express to parents who only see \u2014 particularly those whose children who are more profoundly affected by the disabling aspects of autism \u2013 sensory issues, anxiety, no spoken communication \u2013 that their children are there and aware. How can we express that the most important thing \u2013 our children\u2019s right \u2013 is to be who they are, but to provide AC (augmentative communication) in the absence of speech, instead of trying to force them to talk when they cannot. How can we express that it is the teachers and clinicians who must learn how an autistic person learns, and not expect a typical response that can render an autistic person a robot. (All an autistic person ends up learning is to respond the way the instructor wants so that they can get the hell out of there). How can we express the dangers of therapies that try to teach in a way that is not natural \u2013 for our benefit so WE can feel satisfied that the child has responded \u2013 that the child may in the future as a result of such approaches, not understand who they are? This is the most important aspect.  Know who you are. Accept your autistic child for who they are  because this will allow them to know themselves. Pave the way for acceptance and yes, teach. But learn first. Learn how an autistic person learns and keep trying to adapt until you find the method that clicks with your child. That will constantly change. Be a parent, not a therapist. Do not treat your child as a project, but rather, treat them and raise them as a child. Model actions so that a child can learn. Do not expect typical answers to \u201cwhat is this?\u201d and other typical questions. Find out ways to pull out what the autistic child does know. Do they know and answer better on the computer? Then use that. Accept all forms of communication, for they are valid and real. We are all obligated as parents to find the AC that works best for our children. That is their right to have over and above all those other therapies and monies wasted on \u201cbehavioural therapies.\u201d Allow breaks for autistic children to re-focus. Truly seek to understand their sensory needs. Do not offer artificial reinforcements, like \u201cgood talking!.\u201d They are fake and the child will know it. Accept echolalia as sometimes the only language a child can retrieve, particularly in moments when they are overwhelmed, and then listen to what their body language and faces are telling you. Most parents want the best their our children. The difference is in how we regard autism \u2013 a medical disease, which it is not, or a disability with social implications, in other words, we have to deal with the societal barriers that obstruct the opportunities for our children. We cannot accept the latter. We must accept autism and move on with the real barriers \u2013 the attitudes that will continue to proliferate segregation. We need to be advocating for inclusion in the school system and for the accommodations that need to be made to acquire that. We need to educate others as to the value of doing this \u2013 for all children, not just the disabled ones \u2013 in cultivating sensitivity and understanding. We need to teach our children how to advocate for themselves \u2013 yes, even the non verbal ones. And for those who are more profoundly affected by the more disabling aspects of autism, we can seek the help of other autistic individuals to be mentors and to advocate for the services that do not degrade and oppress others. The one thing we must do is to make other parents aware that there are so many options about which they hear little or are belittled by an ABA movement that continues to espouse inaccurate facts about ABA under the guise of false scientific \u201cproof.\u201d We need to stop participating in genetic research studies which determines only \u201cprenatal risk\u201d and threatens the existence of autistic people. This research is done under the guise of providing \u201cbetter and earlier interventions,\u201d which are non existent. What babies need is love, support and engagement like any other baby. The only purpose of this research is to determine genetic risk factors. We do not hear about research that seeks to help autistic people be the best autistic people they can be. We need to redirect our attention to merging help (with the more disabling aspects of autism) with respect (respecting the autistic person\u2019s right to exist) and realize that there is life beyond an over-simplified \u201ccure.\u201d Further, helping the more disabling aspects of autism (anxiety, sensory issues) can exist outside of a \u201ccure\u201d for autism. I urge every parent (but for those who visit this blog, I bet I\u2019m preaching to the choir), to actively seek out the alternatives and become proactive in not accepting strategies that change your child to \u201cappear normal\u201d because they will ultimately be very damaging to their self-image as teenagers and adults, and we will have greater problems to contend with later. There are options outside of ABA which takes time from you to actively watch and listen and respect your child. Above all, as Anne Donnellan said in 1984, \u201cmake the least dangerous assumptions\u201d about your child. Or as Douglas Biklen said, \u201cpresume competence.\u201d \u201cThe least dangerous assumption states that in the absence of absolute evidence, it is essential to make the s assumption that , if proven to be false, would be the least dangerous to the individual.\u201d  (Zach Rosetti and Carol Tashie from the Communicator, Autism National Committee Newsletter, Inclusive Education edition.) The constant banter that autistic or non verbal people who do not look you in the eye are \u201cnot there\u201d or \u201cnot aware,\u201d or \u201ccannot speak for themselves\u201d is an extremely dangerous assumption. All people can speak for themselves in many different ways. Are we listening?

{"date": "2010/08/18", "body": "Lately I\u2019ve used this term: \u201cthe  normal  path of autistic development.\u201d\u00a0 I use it because I do believe that the path of autistic development seems to take on familiar patterns like later acquisition of language, motor planning skills and social skills, to name some. So, although we recognize that while autistic people are similar they are, like all people, also very\u00a0unique. For the purposes of this post, however, let\u2019s just say, it\u2019s often\u00a0more elegant\u00a0to compare apples to apples. Every once in a while, however,  I go check out the oranges . Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m a first-time mother to an eight-year-old boy. I\u2019m quite familiar with that path of autistic development as I find stories in common with other autistic individuals and the\u00a0parents of them. Yet as a parent of a young boy, I\u2019m curious about the typical eight year old boys. Aside from the speech, the social skills, the sports (among other things),\u00a0 I notice that Adam is becoming a, for lack of a better word, typical eight-year-old. Case in point: He is curious. I can\u2019t keep up with him in the house. He wants to be independent and doesn\u2019t want my help. If I tell him to stop doing something, he gets angry with me. He climbs and moves and climbs. I tell him not to. He does it anyway, even though I know he understands. He thinks disgusting things are funny. I don\u2019t like it. He thinks that\u2019s funny. I feel out of breath trying to keep up with him. He thinks that\u2019s funny. He seeks out attention. He likes attention. I find myself sounding like a nagging mother. I don\u2019t find that at all funny. He knows things. He figures people out. He can manipulate people. He is becoming more aware. He is becoming self aware. That makes me short of breath\u2026.my list goes on\u2026.. Are we getting the point? Adam is a boy full of beans. He is growing and maturing and often gets frustrated because he wants to be so independent. That sometimes gets me frustrated as well because I wonder why I feel so ill-prepared. After climbing upside down into his trundle bed and tearing off the guard rail (I guess he means to say he no longer needs it), I decided to pull out the old  Alphasmart Neo keyboard  that is so handy to carry around because it is so light weight. Even though we are practising on the  Vanguard, a much heavier AAC device , I find the Alphasmart still useful in a pinch. Adam has been practising writing stories on his computer independently. We write them out together, then transpose them, if you will, onto the computer to improve his typing skills. I was quite pleased today to see how his spontaneous communication via typing has also improved. It helped us calm down before bed time this evening and he told me about camp, his counsellors and his day. His body calmed and he was not just the active eight-year-old, but a more empowered one this evening. Adam wants what he wants when he wants it, sometimes. For the most part, he listens, puts away his things, is now more\u00a0inclined to get his own things. Then I wonder why I am so out of breath. I mean, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working towards for so long. He can put on his own shoes, is beginning to dress himself (okay not perfectly, but I don\u2019t care), and wants to give himself his own shower (I am fearful of the hot water). For certain, I must worry about safety and must always try to stay a step ahead of him. It was this boyish progress that prompted me to check out the oranges. I realized that really, all kids are the same. Just because some can or cannot do certain things, it doesn\u2019t take away the will or desire to do them. Just because Adam can\u2019t talk fluently or initiate play with other kids regularly, does not make him any less of an eight-year-old. I\u2019ve known that, but to live through our autistic kids\u2019 development just be different for us parents, after all. For so long, we worry about what our kids will  not  do, and we\u00a0spend inordinate\u00a0amounts of time and resources trying to teach them\u00a0how to do things.\u00a0There is nothing wrong with this!! Yet when it happens\u00a0 we sometimes speak about our kids as a series of behaviours instead of noticing that they are growing and maturing as they should \u2014 as they should differently, autistically and at the same time, very similarly to any other same-aged child. I must consider to stop running out of breath and learn to just breathe.

{"date": "2010/08/23", "body": "Watching me these days and I think you will find me deep in thought. I\u2019m dreaming, thinking. Not the kind of dreaming where I\u2019m floating (well, okay, sometimes), but the kind that I think is important for all parents of autistic children. Maybe this comes at the right time \u2014 right before Adam begins his new school. Usually when we speak of the future, there is fear in our voices. We believe that there will be fewer services, aides and opportunities once our kids turn twenty-one. This is the case for many people. While we must work on the programs and services that autistic people may need throughout their lifetimes, I also want to think about all that is possible. I believe that the more we do this, the more likely we will achieve the kinds of supports and opportunities for our kids that we fear we will lose.  I dream about riding a bike with Adam.  Kristina Chew\u2019s stories about Charlie and her husband James  has motivated me to teach Adam how to cycle better (he has a tendency to always be looking where he has been rather than where he is going\u2026a rather ironic notion).  I think about taking Adam around the world, and if not entirely around it or entirely  with me, I\u2019d like to think he will see the world in any event.  I think of  Horseboy  and recently the  travels of Larry Bissonnette and Tracy Thresh as part of the film Wretches and Jabberers (great title) .  I think that if we\u2019ve come this far, we can likely go farther both physically as well as mentally. I took Adam to Mexico last year, and lugged him deep down into Mayan caves, and there will be more.  Sure, we\u2019ll have to endure some discomfort along the way, some rude comments, leering eyes and possibly some meltdowns with delayed travel and other frustrations, but I consider when the time is right, it will be worth the try. I mean, Adam is already an explorer. He will find every nook, every cranny, every inviting pathway that I, in my perpetual goal-state-of-mind, will miss far too often.  Even with the liklihood of some discomfort, I can\u2019t help but wonder if moving around and seeing new things may be the best education of his life, and quite likely, of mine. I dream about Adam in higher education \u2014 be in college or university, exploring what he loves and being assisted if he needs it.  So many people delay their entrance also into higher education. So the timing just doesn\u2019t matter. There are many stories of autistic adults in universities right now and thanks to them, it keeps my dream alive. I dream of Adam having his friends and people he loves around him. He likes people. Although we are addicted to social networking (you can find me everyday twittering and FB\u2019ing and blogging \u2014 I\u2019m torn about the whole matter), I had written for the TAAP exhibition in 2007 how technology really assisted the social connections between autistic individuals. Adam also uses the computer (although not yet for that) and he has a friend he goes to school with. I see no reason, as he is helped along the way, why the wouldn\u2019t have people he loves to have around him.  The many autistic friends I\u2019ve made along the my journey of learning how to support my autistic child has helped me keep this dream alive. I was also thinking of the dreams I had for Adam when he was newly diagnosed and a toddler \u2014 how I had hoped he could go to a good school, become more independent and begin to communicate. Although he is still challenged on the latter, he communicates far better than he used to.  The autistic teenagers and adults who use Assisted and Augmentative Communication have helped keep this dream alive. I dream of Adam cooking his own food because he seems to enjoy helping me out in the kitchen. Although this is not always possible for all autistic people, for others, it is. Susan Senator and her family write a lot about cooking (or is it that I\u2019m especially alert to Susan\u2019s food postings?).  She and her son Nat have helped me keep this dream alive. I dream of Adam continuously enjoying self-expression. He has shown a particular fondness towards art. Those of you who know my passion for this subject will know that I have many autistic artists to thank and who have kept this dream for Adam\u2019s  happiness in self-expression , alive. It would be difficult for me to list everyone here. I realize that since before I started writing  The Joy of Autism blog , I have so many people to be thankful for in helping keeping dreams alive. There are many stories on the web now that weren\u2019t when I began writing in 2005. The daily successes are worth reading every day. Although Adam is still quite different, he has accomplished so much. As his parent, my dreams for him as well as myself are thriving. I think this is what we most fear as new parents \u2014 that the weight of unknown responsibilities will take these dreams and hopes away \u2014 not only for our children, but for ourselves. While I have not written the entire list of my dreams here today, I see that dreams, as we adjust our views and expectations of our autistic children, really do come true. As for Adam, I\u2019m quite certain he\u2019ll have many of his own dreams to share one day. What are yours? \u2014\u2014\u2013 \n There are so many autistic people and parents who have helped keep many of my dreams alive that I have not listed here today. I\u2019ve been writing about many of them for a few years now.

They travel to Finland, Japan and Sri Lanka to change minds, attitudes and debunk myths which was documented in the film  Wretches and Jabberers . We have learned from anthropologists like Roy Grinker in  Unstrange Minds , among others, that the views about autism around the world can be less forgiving because of cultural differences. \u00a0Adam was diagnosed at 19 months of age as a hyperlexic, \u201chigh-functioning\u201d autistic boy. Over the years, however, he\u00a0shows ability, is very bright and intelligent, but\u00a0Adam has real\u00a0communication difficulties and more \u201cclassic\u201d aspects of autism\u2026so dx is always precarious in the early years. I think of the very different experiences between Adam and Larry \u2014 how the world has changed so for autistic people and I am grateful for the generousity of autistic adults.\u00a0 As a parent in this for just over six years now,\u00a0I have to say thank you to  everyone  who put forth this effort. I often dream of Adam traveling the world, talking to other people, helping other people. That\u2019s my dream, I suppose, and not necessarily his, but that\u2019s what parents tend to do.

{"date": "2010/08/20", "body": "Sometimes a simple photo inspires me. This one was taken over a year ago. The gal Adam is holding hands with is the daughter of my most beloved girlfriend in the world.  Life got a little hectic for everyone and Adam didn\u2019t get to see T (the girl) too often this past year. T was here with her mom about a week ago and in Adam\u2019s way, he swam at his own pace, doing his own thing. The water calls him to dive under, I imagine because the feeling around him makes him feel secure. For Adam, tight spaces and squishes are an essential part of living well. T was diving into the pool with such enthusiasm, asking her mom to \u201clook\u201d as she demonstrated the various poses while jumping and then plunging into the water. In the picture above, we had spent a weekend together in the same hotel room. Adam got cozy with T, although in Adam\u2019s way it always takes some time. Last week, Adam watched T closely, sometimes doing his thing, gazing out of the sides of his eyes, sometimes watching her straight on. Unlike other children, however, Adam cannot yet consistently initiate play or \u201cget in there\u201d at the same pace. I know that if T were around a whole lot more, he would be following her around, or at least he might go along with what she wanted to do. It\u2019s just that way with my little autie.

{"date": "2010/08/30", "body": "I really like what Temple Grandin is doing in many ways. I like that she supports different minds and describes very simply and concretely what autistic people need and might be able to do as work. There is one thing I\u2019d like to point out to Ms. Grandin, if I may. It\u2019s the assumption about the autism spectrum or \u201ccontinuum\u201d as she puts it. It is tricky because it has been an  easy  way to describe and try to understand autism. Yet like most things easy, they are not fully descriptive. It is the point at which she, perhaps inadvertently in order to simplify the description, lowers the intelligence level of non verbal autistic people to the bottom of the \u201cspectrum,\u201d to the \u201cverbal\u201d autistics who are \u201cbrilliant.\u201d For all the non verbal or partially verbal autistic people out there, many of who comment here and/or write their own blogs and even do their own presentations, I\u2019d like to add that non verbal people can also be of \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cbright,\u201d or of \u201cgifted\u201d intelligence. Of course verbal and non verbal people can also be more cognitively challenged. There is no way we can use the \u201ccontinuum,\u201d really, to effectively describe autism and intelligence and I think we need to talk about this more. Temple Grandin talks a lot about  thinking in pictures  and she can verbalize this well. For many autistic folks who cannot, like my son Adam among others, I can say that verbal ability does not equal intelligence. I hope that Temple Grandin can speak a little bit more on that in the future so as not to cast another stereotype that she perhaps does not intentionally mean to cast. In this blog, I speak a lot about the visual \u2014 visual data and the potential for many autistic people to translate so much data into the visual so that we can better understand it. There could be many opportunities for our children if we look at this seriously and nuture the skills. As for her segment on visual perception, I once posted a drawing by Adam, who has motor planning issues, but clearly had an advanced perspective, demonstrated in some of his artwork, over his same-aged peers. I have always noted and recognized Adam\u2019s visual abilities. It\u2019s still incredibly difficult to find teachers who recognize and are able to nuture this ability. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating, in fact. I do thank Temple Grandin for being out there to discuss the need for mentors and the contributions our children can make to society, if given the chance and opportunities.

We can only know and come to understand this by engaging with autistic people. Also, parents have so much to contribute via anecdotal accounts of how our children engage with us and how we come to view autsm by living with our children day-to-day.

One thing to remember is the next time a news report states \u201ca new study links\u2026\u201d which is something we seem to hear almost weekly, that this study is more than likely a theory; another stepping stone to understanding autism and our amazing children.

{"date": "2010/10/07", "body": "Adam is clearly settling into his new school. He is happy when he returns home. He comes with a journal telling me what he has done as well as a day-timer for scheduling and organizing. I\u2019m sure liking this new school. Prior to this one, I had Adam in an integrated setting where I didn\u2019t get much feedback on what he was doing. I put him there in Kindergarten because it was a Montessori school  and at the time he needed to be calm with others in a school setting. It was good for him at the time and I\u2019m grateful he went there. Here in Toronto, however, I haven\u2019t found a truly \u201cInclusive\u201d scholastic setting. We have integrative settings where an autistic child is segregated for part of the day and reintegrated into a \u201cregular\u201d classroom for another part of it, if I can describe it swiftly. The problem with these settings is that the onus is always on the autistic or special needs child to conform to the \u201cregular\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d setting. That setting usually has one curriculum and is rarely adapted. The work is usually completed in the same way by all the students. The Inclusive setting, ideally, would not only adapt and accommodate a program to the needs and capabilities of the child but also teach the \u201cnormal\u201d students the innate value of the \u201cspecial\u201d students. Ideally, we would regard everyone as different, but equal \u2014 not ghetto-ize, or make them \u201cterminally unique,\u201d if I may reuse a term from  Amanda Baggs  that she used a few years ago at M.I.T in Boston. A subject can be taught uniformly (about, say, Volcanoes), but the students might manifest their comprehension of the subject in different formats depending on their interests, talents and capabilities. All these manifestations or expressions would be highly valued. This doesn\u2019t exist here in Toronto (to my knowledge). So, I\u2019ve put Adam in a school where he is with a variety of different kids, not just autistic kids. There are kids who are mentors there to him (he really likes that and looks up to the older boys), has social skills and life skills classes in addition to his academics that are built to suit his needs. Like many other special needs kids, he now has an I.E.P. (Independent Education Plan).  A year of big transitions, including a change of schools, has definitely taken its toll on Adam, but he is still a gentle child. He can become frustrated, but he doesn\u2019t act out on others. When he is anxious it is very difficult for him to communicate his needs.  As I often say, because little things are major around here (although we don\u2019t overdo it with fanfare), I have to tell the story of driving Adam home today, when the language was easier. It is an indication that he is making sense of things again. \u201cHow was your day, Adam?\u201d \u201cGoud,\u201d he said in an almost Swedish-sounding accent. \u201cWhat did you do today.\u201d \u201cWalk.\u201d He did go on a nature walk today. \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d I said smiling, giggling a little, trying to keep my eye on the road while turning my head slightly to see him from the corner of my eye as he was sitting in the back seat. \u201cWhat else did you do?\u201d \u201cArt.\u201d Indeed he did that too. He made me a Thanksgiving turkey out of construction paper that is now taped on our kitchen window.  \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask me what mommy did today?\u201d I suggested, thinking that he has a right to ask me questions \u2014 our kids get so \u201cgrilled\u201d by them. \u201cSay, Mommy what did you do?\u201d  \u201cMommy what didyoudo?\u201d he said it so quickly that the last three words sounded as if they were one. He said it without hesitation, looking straight at me. \u201cI went grocery shopping and did some work today at my computer,\u201d I replied. And so it was. Just another day.

{"date": "2010/10/14", "body": "As Adam begins to get older and the more options that become available to him, like overnight camps and aide workers, I  am more attuned to the many stories I hear regarding the abuse of autistic people . There was a time when Adam and this blog were younger, that I had followed a website that tracked nearly every case of murder and abuse. It\u2019s hard to get wrapped up in that for too long. One has to know when to look and when to carry on. There is fear and then there is awareness. I never bought into the \u201crecovery\u201d model of autism \u2014 that the onus was on us and our children to \u201cbecome normal.\u201d  To blame the autistic person or a family for a child not being able to talk is ludicrous and unsupportive. Rather, I believe we have to keep aware of the many cases where vulnerability lies, and provide the finanical support so that families can hire the aides  they  trust. While nothing is fool-proof and many of our children can be susceptible to abusers, autistic or not, it is helpful when parents have the right to choose a school aide or any type of support worker. A parent or primary caregiver should have the right to turn down someone they do not feel comfortable with. I say this because many children are ascribed workers and Educational Assistants here in Ontario. It might be assumed that if one needs financial support, then one must accept the individual ascribed to them. If it\u2019s an issue for the family, that is if they want to change the worker, there seems to be a lot of red tape. I want to reiterate that the right to a support worker, that both the autistic and the family are comfortable with and trust, is an accommodation and should therefore be a right for autistic individuals. More and more, I believe that autistic people, including our non verbal children, and parents must be central to the process in building our support teams. As I\u2019m seeking camps and other activities for Adam to grow more independent and enjoy his life, I want to try my best to ensure he is protected. I\u2019m not sure I can at all times, and maybe that is the most frightening part. Yet, Adam can indicate to me when he\u2019s distressed by virtue of his behaviour. Just transitioning to a new home and a new school, he indicated to me that it was very difficult by body-jerking and losing some of his words. He was disorganized and needed more physical stimulation. He also expressed more repetitive behaviours during this time. Of course, Adam is still learning how to communicate in a typical way by typing on his computer and his devices. These behaviours, however, were such important examples for me to see how Adam can express himself during stressful times. It is something I am tuned into now as he grows older and perhaps will express other distressing things to me where he needs more of my intervention and support.

{"date": "2010/10/15", "body": "Tonight has been a most remarkable night. Adam has probably talked the most he has in his lifetime.  I have no answers why. We\u2019ve supported him, taught him, spent six years fine-tuning, changing and adapting things. By \u201cthings\u201d I mean his therapies and education, devices, strategies, habits, you name it. We made sure he didn\u2019t do things too soon, trying to be attune to Adam\u2019s needs, which have been many.  His needs keep changing. It\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s a dance where the steps keep changing, a jazz troupe with a new riff or musician every few weeks. We aim for consistency yet nothing stays the same. Adam never stays the same. As I said in  The Autism Acceptance Project  video a few years ago, \u201cwhen a children are happy, they can learn.\u201d Sometimes I had doubts.  Should I have pushed Adam harder? , I asked myself after he lay sound asleep after a difficult day, or a day when I was challenged by others who insinuated I was not doing enough for my child (while not really knowing us). I\u2019m not here trying to give myself kudos or to dismiss the choices of others. Yet, there is a part of me tonight that is  proud that I stuck to my guns by doing what I felt was right for Adam as well as my needs and values as his mother.  Our lives, as that saying goes, are comprised of the choices we make.  I\u2019m quite certain I\u2019ll continue to make mistakes like all parents, but overall I\u2019ve always believed that being as sensitive to Adam as he is senstive to his environment and to others has been a necessity. By viewing it as such, I made the choices accordingly. For those of you who don\u2019t know us, this started Adam was only 18-19 months old. By the way, I expect my ideas and parenting style to be continuously challenged. It seems to go along with the territory of being a parent. It is gratifying that once in a while we get some kind of affirmation about the choices we have made. That is what this blog post is, in part, about. But really, it\u2019s more about the need to be sensitive and to be open to change as well as our ability to adapt. These are the \u201cthings\u201d I have to continuously re-learn. I hope I\u2019ll get better at it. Adam has had quite a year, not to mention years of going through \u201cpeople\u201d in his life because of the education and support he has required. His life has been pretty consistent, mind you,  but not without upset, as life is for everyone one way or another. This year, he began a new school and the change took a few weeks of getting used to. He lost his words and he engaged in more \u201cOCD\u201d or ritualistic behaviour, desperate to create order out of chaos.  Over the course of four weeks, this has abated. He still has some difficulty letting go of some of the rituals that he began as a result of the change. \u201cI can\u2019t stop. I can\u2019t stop,\u201d he told me tonight after I silently redirected him towards my bed. Too many words from adults can be irritating not to mention too many \u201cno\u2019s.\u201d He has taken to getting in and out of two bath-tubs in my home. He wasn\u2019t that happy with me, but the crying was brief, about two minutes. I turned on the soft music, helped a rash that was bothering him to soothe Adam a little more, and we just hugged. \u201cI can\u2019t stop,\u201d he said again calmly. \u201cI understand you are telling me you can\u2019t stop,\u201d I repeated so he would know that I was listening. His body relaxed and he lay deeper into my arms.  That was the only challenging part of the evening. The rest was a night of Adam  telling  me that he went to the zoo today, that he saw a Gorilla and a Lion, that his rash was \u201citchy\u2026it is bothering me,\u201d to what he wanted to eat, in full sentences \u2014 not the usual two or three word phrases. On his walk he said things like, \u201cI want to go this way,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d Perfectly. In the evening he asked for certain lights to be turned off. When I was getting it wrong several times over (there were a few lights on and it took a while to figure this one out), he pointed towards the hallway. \u201cTurn the light off  outside !\u201d he said forcefully. Phew. Glad I finally got that one right! He was asking for books unseen (therefore unprompted\u2026 all of this was not prompted in any way), and we read quite a few, of course ending with Dr. Seuss. Tonight was  Horton Hears A Who  \u2026\u201da person\u2019s a person no matter how small\u2026\u201d Change is hard. Change can be good. We can\u2019t stop change. Finding the right time to teach certain \u201cthings\u201d has been a challenge because Adam is bright but very sensitive. Knowing when to push and when to back off is based on the uniqueness of Adam, not solely on Adam\u2019s autism. I thank the team who keep sticking with us on this remarkable journey.

{"date": "2010/09/13", "body": "From the time Adam came into the world, he could shift my mood. His distress became mine, his happines set me aglow. I remember when he cried and my stomach clenched. I thought it was because I was (and am) a first-time mother. I physically reacted to Adam\u2019s every cry as if I was to dive right in and save him. Adam is older now. Manifestions of discomfort are different. He has just started a new school and much like it was when he moved with me into our new home, his body jerks as if there is a word behind each abrupt movement. When Adam gets anxious, he can speak less. Instead I get a twitch, a jump and maybe an  um hmm  kind of grunt. We thought, a few months ago, that Adam was having seizures. Now that we know (via an EEG) that he is not having them, and I am significantly calmer than before. I remember that the twitching passed and so I expect they will again. It seems that with Adam, there are always many steps back before he takes another leap forward. Yet, even in knowing this, with every grunt, I can\u2019t help feel the exact same way I did when Adam was born. It feels like that early maternal instinct, perhaps. I feel I have to be there to help him, to soothe him. The issue is, it\u2019s getting less possible for me to do it the way I once did. Adam cannot be comforted by the things that soothed him when he was an infant. All I can do is practice being not only a calm parent, but one who can teach him how to manage himself in these times of stress. For any parent, I imagine \u201cbeing a calm parent,\u201d takes practice. On those sleepless nights, I\u2019ve managed to teach Adam to read alone quietly in his room and he seems content there. I am trying to teach him to go to the equipment he has for squishing and climbing when he needs this, and he can go on walks for up to three hours to calm his nervous system. While he can\u2019t do those walks on his own yet, at least there are some outlets he has that are self-empowering. Lots of physical activity can also be extremely calming. Even though I know Adam will be okay in a couple of weeks, and his words and phrases may come back even stronger than before, I just can\u2019t seem to help myself from feeling his discomfort. I simply try not to let in infiltrate everything and the way I interact with him. Yet I yearn for a smile and a giggle during these times. It is no wonder then, as I walked in the door today, that Adam changed my mood in an instant with a smile. I got him ready for bed, read him a couple of books and he turned over angelically onto his pillow to go to sleep. As I turned out the light, he grabbed my arm to put it around his small body and nestled his soft head in the crook of my neck.  I understood his message loud and clear this evening.  Mommy, I need you. Stay with me , I imagine he would say if he had the words to say it.  Something so simple helps me understand everything.

{"date": "2010/10/28", "body": "I am remembering the days when Adam watched endless reruns of  The Sound of Music . I actually think he had a crush on Maria, with her sweet voice and blonde hair. From the time he was a year old, some of you might remember this story from  Between Interruptions: 30 Women Tell The Truth About Mothehood ,  Adam watched Maria and the Von Trapp family intensely during his first birthday party. He still relaxes everytime I sing songs from that movie, usually as he tries to get to sleep. I\u2019ve written a lot about Adam over the years, carefully finding the right vignettes to maintain some semblance of privacy and dignity. Sometimes I simply gush. While there are some struggles, as a one-time-mom, I cannot help but relish in everything Adam does. He is, and I\u2019ve heard this someplace else, my heart literally walking about the earth. Although autism is important \u2014 we\u2019ve had many valuable discussions through our blogs \u2014 it also doesn\u2019t matter in the way I love my child. Adam is Adam, and he has brought me great joy. Forgive me for the slow-coming blog posts these days. I have been thinking a lot about Adam and this explosion of language, his talking, communication \u2014 his expression of feeling and will.  I\u2019ve also written occasionally on how to write about our children and of course I am thinking a lot about this now. I acknowledge that Adam is not a willing participant in this, although I\u2019ve tried to get his \u201cpermission\u201d to write about certain things. It seemed tenuous in that his communication was difficult to come by. I would ask Adam to type a  yes  or  no  to certain things I wanted to make public. It was sometimes difficult to tell if his  yes  was intentional as he would either quickly point, type or even say a \u201cyes,\u201d in an effort to fulfill my need for an answer. This has changed in the last while. Adam\u2019s intention is much clearer now.  In my last post, I wrote about watching Adam express his will in \u201cearly intensive\u201d therapy. Although I was emotionally attuned to him,  I see his intention even  more  now watching videos in retrospect. Therapists talked too loud. They didn\u2019t sit and listen. They didn\u2019t join in with him, early on, in his version of games and communication. Amidst a mish-mash of discrete trials and play therapy, I heard a faint \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d in the video when a therapist tickled him. I am certain, as much as I like to think I am listening to Adam, that I spoke too much and didn\u2019t give him a chance. I\u2019m certain there are moments I also didn\u2019t hear him. Children are often not listened to. Non-verbal autistic children are, for the most part, ignored. Still, while I must lay down some rules for his safety, Adam also needs a safe place where he can express himself, to me. For Adam who may read this when he gets older, I hope he will understand (and perhaps forgive\u2026or maybe he will cherish  me  for this, I cannot predict) his mother\u2019s need to express herself. I began blogging in 2005 (fomerly joyofautism.blogspot.com) during a time period that was highly volatile and polemic in autism, and in an atmosphere where everyone wanted to change Adam, simply because he is autistic. I\u2019m not saying this atmosphere has changed. I have, however, changed. As Adam\u2019s mother, I value the learning of discipline, rules, and being educated equally as much as finding one\u2019s own way, creativity and uniqueness. We all must learn it and so, Adam was born perfect.  Although I still wish to feel his feather-like hair brush against my face, and although I still want to hold him like my baby, he is no longer. He is expressing his sincere need for independence and his need to be heard. I search his face for that baby I birthed and I see an older boy take his place.  I want to say farewell, not to blogging or writing about autism necessarily, but perhaps to a type of blogging where I made certain assumptions, and a type of writing that talks about one\u2019s child as a cherished baby. Adam and I, in addition to all the changes we have experienced that have formed us today, have entered an entirely new phase. I\u2019m watching how both my outlook and writing will too. So, I will continue to choose my words carefully.  Here, I mark a new era.

{"date": "2010/10/18", "body": "\u201cTurn it off!\u201d I had been watching some old videos of Adam before he was even two years old. Adam, now eight-years-old, stood in front of the television and watched for two minutes intensely before he told me what to do. There are two therapists in that video, in front of him talking fast and loud. He is sitting in a chair and they insist that he stay there \u2014 he small enough that every time he tries to escape they physically replace him onto the chair. The video begins with Adam crying, squirming and trying to get  away. He is so small, such a baby. He is saying many things, although they are hard to hear because the therapists are talking so loudly compared to his forming, warbled articulation. As one of the therapists replaces his tiny body in the chair, she tickles his stomach.  \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I hear him say in a super tiny voice. I hear him say it now re-watching these, but I may not have heard it back then. I may have not heard it in the frantic effort to get Adam to do and say what the therapists wanted him to say. I would have not heard it over their loud voices.  I am watching these videos six years later, as Adam has developed and changed so much. I feel we have very much entered a new phase of life together, a new phase of understanding our lives as an autistic family.  Adam then went to his  Vanguard device  after telling me to shut off the TV.  \u201cI am uncomfortable,\u201d he pressed. I suppose I can say,  said . We call  it his  talk box . The Vanguard device, which is a series of pictures and words can be programmed to make sentences. Things like verbs, feelings, activities are all categorized on it so Adam can tell us many things. Sometimes Adam can type sentences on his computer, sometimes he uses the Vanguard and sometimes, especially this past weekend, Adam can talk. Adam talked more this past weekend than I can remember in his lifetime. I have set out to watch those videos on my own without Adam present. As I watch them now, I am highly disturbed. We made him sit so young, and forced him to watch the therapists. Although this was NOT a strict ABA program, we did attempt to \u201cprogramme\u201d Adam in an ABA format. The therapists talked, they wanted him to answer, they dangled coloured circles over his head so he would repeat the colours, blew in his face, repositioned him on the chair \u2014 all at a roaring rate. I cannot imagine how completely overwhelming that experience was for Adam. All I had in the beginning was ABA therapy. Then came along RDI (Relationship Development Intervention). I thought I kept helping Adam better each time I learned about something new because no one offered us any other solution. While I tried to follow my instinct, what was available to us wasn\u2019t keeping pace with the values I was forming about Adam as an autistic person.  Still, Adam was forced to \u201cconform\u201d no matter how much we said it was to \u201cengage\u201d him. Later, we became more adept at involving ourselves in his games. Later, we became quieter with him.  As Adam\u2019s mother, I sometimes want to cry when I watch these videos. He was bombarded. In no way was he respected as an autistic person from the get-go. A couple years after that I definitely learned more and tried harder. Yet I wonder, since we are still talking about finding genes in autism and intervening earlier, what kind of life experience our autistic children will have and remember, when they are programmed to be typical.   I find it so ironic that Adam talked the most he had in his lifetime this weekend, and he told me to turn off one of those \u201cearly intervention\u201d videos. I suspect he does not feel good about it at all. What makes me feel so guilty, because I love Adam so much, is that even though I searched for ways of assisting him while trying to respect him, he may have not been in those earlier years when he was so vulnerable. He couldn\u2019t really communicate in words then. He has severe difficulties, even now, to do so consistently. As Adam becomes his own self-advocate, I just found it so striking to have this juxtaposition between the old videos against the Adam of today. Even back then, just because he wasn\u2019t talking, he was still a person. I suppose I could say  he  was ignored like the moment when he said in a voice so quiet, \u201cdon\u2019t.\u201d I think if someone had shown me this when we received the diagnosis, if autistic people could recount their stories and be available to all \u201cnew\u201d autism parents, my life may have been calmer and Adam may have had better supports that accepted him as autistic. I write this with forboding, wondering what kinds of early interventions are being concocted for infant autistics. Certainly, I changed the approaches after those first two years, and he became happier for it. He has had many challenges, but he is also now talking. As he does so, while it is nice to know what our children are thinking, I can tell you it is not a solution. It is not the Holy Grail.  We will have many years ahead of dealing with Adam\u2019s unique way of functioning in the world, and I don\u2019t always expect it to be easy. Communication is important. Acceptance is vital.

{"date": "2010/09/09", "body": "\nThis picture is of Adam covering his ears while I\u2019m doing a song and dance trying to keep him awake!  Say what , you might ask?  Doesn\u2019t Adam have problems staying asleep?   Well yes, sometimes, which is why I found this evening so ironic that I have to write about it. Adam was up since two in the morning at his dad\u2019s. When he came home, he was unusually pooped and fell asleep around 5 o\u2019clock. I didn\u2019t have the heart to wake the poor little guy so I let him take a short nap which could spell trouble again at two a.m. It was at this thought that  I decided to try and wake him forty-five minutes later. I tried so hard to keep him awake that I found myself creating a kooky song and dance routine to make him laugh. If it hadn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have kept it up for a full hour.  While Adam laughed and smiled at me most of the way through it, this moment, which I captured here, signified the end (with no encore). \u201cGo away, mum,\u201d he said, his small hand swooshing me away. Since Adam was born, I was sleep deprived nearly every night for three years straight! My infant rarely napped and if he did it wasn\u2019t for long. When I attempted to put him down to sleep, it took me about three hours in a darkened room, all by myself, (just think what three hours means!), only to have him wake an hour and a half or so later.  I need about seven hours of sleep a night.  Adam is good on sleep too \u2014 more focussed and happy, generally, but his body doesn\u2019t always comply in either falling or staying asleep. As he gets older, sleep is more manageable  (when I say manage I mean mostly for me as Adam can still function on little of it) around here and on tougher nights, a small dose melatonin has saved an evening or two. Some days, it has had zero effect. It seems to have little effect if there is a lot going on in Adam\u2019s life. In 2010 alone, Adam has moved homes, has learned to live in two households (since 2008), and has now changed schools after having been settled in one since Kindergarten \u2014 that was four years ago. He started his new school on Tuesday and he has been body-twitching so I am not surprised at the sleep difficulty. Add to that a holiday event last night, well, it\u2019s just so much. I imagine Adam in his new school trying to figure out his environment, the new people, the new expectations and being completely overloaded. I think of it a little like Tourettes syndrome where individuals who try to \u201cperform\u201d and keep their bodies calm all day long claim that they have to come home and tick like mad. We all do it, as a matter of fact. We all get overloaded and find ways to block out the stimuli. Many of us also wake up in the middle of the night when our lives are disrupted. It is not any different for Adam so while we talk about autism and sleep, much like we do food sensitivities and autism, I believe we have to remember that while many autistic people may claim to not need a lot of sleep in general, it might also be the manifestation of receiving certain stimuli that we are really talking about. In other words, in most of us, we respond to changes, transitions and other matters of life in our sleep and behaviours. Typical kids might also be having nightmares, or cry in Adam\u2019s current circumstance. The specific sensory sensitivity of Adam, however,  manifests, we might say, in an autistic way.  Similarly, many of us non autistic individuals are gluten and casein sensitive. We just don\u2019t all hand flap (as but one example) when we feel uncomfortable. Some of the ways we try to ensure good sleeps around here are really cool to cold room temperatures, a dark bedroom, calm soft music and low lights before bed. No computers, no televisions, no noise. I learned early to keep Adam\u2019s personal environment as calm as possible \u2014 his \u201csafe haven,\u201d if you will. It\u2019s not always a sure thing, but I\u2019ve noticed that it helps Adam out a great deal. Yet after school today was quite a different day for us, which is why I am writing this. \nAdam is happy now, I\u2019m certain \u2014 safe and sound in his bed\u2026 and fast asleep. \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2010/09/09/autism-and-sleep-again/", "title": "Autism and Sleep (again)"},
{"date": "2010/09/06", "body": "Safety is a big concern for many autistic people. Sometimes, it\u2019s just not possible to walk across the street by oneself, even though one might be extremely intelligent and capable in other areas. I think of this often so as not to be disappointed if Adam will need assistance in the future. As a parent, I consider it one of my obligations to Adam to ensure his safety. I therefore do everything I can, with the help of others too, to teach Adam safety skills. In the event I cannot, I try to ensure his safety in other ways.  One thing Adam loves to do is go for long walks. On the verge of beginning a new school tomorrow that will teach him safety, social and other life skills in addition to academics, Adam and I took a walk after dinner to his favorite icecream joint.  Adam does not run off into the street, so lately I\u2019ve made sure that he walks alongside me without holding my hand. This way I can see how he can walk pretty much on his own.  It would be his tendency to flap his hands and look to the ground, and I have no issues with hand-flapping except when he is in an area where he really needs to be paying attention to his surroundings.  \u201cWalk safely,\u201d I repeat. I have chosen this instead of \u201cnicely.\u201d This is not about looking appropriate or \u201cnice.\u201d This is truly about keeping one\u2019s eye on the cars and other hazards. Adam listens. He knows what this means now and he is walking and looking around him. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming up?\u201d I ask Adam approaching an intersection and prompt him with \u201cin.\u201d \u201cWhat do you have to do here?\u201d \u201cStop,\u201d he says abruptly.  \u201cStop and?\u201d \u201cLook bot ways,\u201d he says, his words staccato, unfinished, and somewhat robotic-sounding. \u201cRight. And what are you looking for?\u201d \u201cCars,\u201d he says loudly.  \u201cIs there a car coming?\u201d I crouch down to his level pointing around us.

I have to yawn. While I haven\u2019t look at the actual study itself, it seems that \u201cThe diminished tendency to engage in a contagious yawn suggests autistic kids\u2019 may miss subtle cues that tie them emotionally to others,\u2019 the researchers write in the  Journal of Child Development .\u201d ( The Globe and Mail , p. L5, September 17, 2010). I\u2019ll just say this: While autistic kids may have some difficulty with their imitation skills,  yawning seems spawned by something more physiological.  Adam yawns when I yawn\u2026 a LOT.  Perhaps he\u2019s part of that 11 % of autistic children who do yawn according to Geraldine Dawson.  Adam will not yawn, however, \u201con command.\u201d Sometimes I wonder if my little autie just doesn\u2019t see the sense of it. I mean, some things we ask our children to imitate can be kind of silly. Therefore, I would not compare contagious yawning skills to pure imitation skills.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m not certain if the comparison should be used in determining if autistic children can figure out those \u201csubtle cues.\u201d As I said, natural contagious yawning for Adam comes, well, naturally. Science has not at all discovered the nature of yawning. I feel compelled to qualify this just in case our autistic children may be prematurely described by yet another, interesting, but perhaps not quite precise theory.\u00a0Yet, that\u2019s what we get in the autism community, don\u2019t we?

As for myself as Adam\u2019s mother, it settles me. For the first time ever, Adam has a desk that flips open, and I\u2019ve already had a chance to see the stacks of binders in his desk. I can\u2019t imagine his little body, for he is the smallest kid in his class, carrying those big things. He has a\u00a0cumbersome communication device (Vanguard), because he cannot talk fluently. There\u00a0are always many things for him to take wherever he goes now.\u00a0It is not a light load. As Adam becomes more independent, my views of him, of our lives and parenthood are shifting. This is not a journey I\u00a0will\u00a0ever attempt to predict.\u00a0So much has changed in our lives, and now that Adam has\u00a0switched schools, these feelings are\u00a0 punctuated.\u00a0I\u00a0feel that we have reached the second phase or our autism journey, if we can parse life into phases. These\u00a0past couple of weeks\u00a0we\u00a0have been\u00a0reading an array of Dr. Seuss\u2019 stories. Every night, I ask Adam to choose which one\u00a0he wants me to read to him.

I thought I\u2019d copy some of the lines because\u00a0I became rather pensive with all of\u00a0these changes going on \u2014\u00a0with Adam\u2019s growth, \u00a0maturity and the road ahead.

What an important a lesson it is for Adam, as it is for us as parents who sometimes get caught up in the idea that our children won\u2019t end up doing or being anything, to think again; how critical it is\u00a0to see all the autistic adults contributing to\u00a0society in their own unique way, while also re-evaluating what \u201csuccess\u201d really\u00a0means to us. It reminds me, also, of how important it is to have mountains to climb. \u00a0Enjoy this abridged version as food for thought: You have brains in your head. \nYou have feet in your shoes. \nYou can steer yourself \nany direction you choose. \nYou\u2019re on your own. And you know what you know. \nAnd  YOU  are the guy who\u2019ll decide where to go\u2026 \u2026You\u2019ll be on your way up! \nYou\u2019ll be seeing great sights! \nYou\u2019ll join the high fliers \nwho soar to high heights. You won\u2019t lag behind, because you\u2019ll have the speed \nYou\u2019ll pass the whole gang and you\u2019ll soon take the lead. \nWherever you fly, you\u2019ll be the best of the best. \nWherever you go, you will top all the rest. Except when you don\u2019t. \nBecause, sometimes you won\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry to say so \nbut, sadly, it\u2019s true \nthat Bang-ups \nand Hang-ups \n can  happen to you. You can get all hung up in a prickle-ly perch. \nAnd your gang will fly on. \nYou\u2019ll be left in the Lurch. You\u2019ll come down from the Lurch \nwith an unpleasant bump. \nAnd the chances are, then, \nthat you\u2019ll be in a Slump. And when you\u2019re in a Slump, \nyou\u2019re not in for much fun. \nUn-slumping yourself \nis not easily done. You will come to a place where the streets are not marked. \nSome windows are lighted. But mostly they\u2019re darked. \nA place you could sprain both your elbow and chin! \nDo you dare stay out? Do you dare go in? \nHow much can you lose? How much can you win? And IF you go in, should you turn left or right\u2026 \nor right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite? \nOr go around back and sneak in from behind? \nSimple it\u2019s not, I\u2019m afraid you will find, \nfor a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind. \u2026Oh, the places you\u2019ll go! There is fun to be done! \nThere are points to be scored. There are games to be won. \nAnd the magical things you can do with that ball \nwill make you the winning-est winner of all. \n Fame!  You\u2019ll be famous as famous can be, \nwith the whole wide world watching you win on TV.

{"date": "2010/06/13", "body": "I have to admit that I\u2019m adjusting to my new role, still, as single mother. There are lovely days, like yesterday, when I want to spend my time with Adam. We awaited a thunderstorm that never came, but watched Disney\u2019s  Mulan  anyway \u2014 a movie Adam has not yet seen. Adam is more interested in watching movies from start to finish now that his attention is stronger, his awareness keen. In the \u201cearly days,\u201d Adam could only sit still for about ten or so minutes and movies were simply not possible. These are rather nice days, like the time today we spent walking around the Scarborough Bluffs, listening to the waves gently swell upon the shore and watching the geese fly off as elegantly as immaculately set-up dominoes. Adam lead me to the shore-side restaurant and we ate together. I\u2019ll admit that sometimes I miss having someone to share this with us, and then again I cherish every moment now because I have learned that life changes in a moment.  Sometimes we spend our afternoons by the pool and he is content in what I have called his nest (see picture) \u2014 I have this chair outside even though the rain is determined to wither the wicker away. He will curl up after a swim and stare at the maple leaves hanging above him in the sunlight, reluctant to depart at my declarations that he must be getting cold and it\u2019s time for a hot shower. No, he prefers to cuddle up and listen to the birds. I don\u2019t blame him \u2014 it was the same chair I healed in after surgeries a couple of years ago and I dragged it outside because it\u2019s far better to heal outside than in.  As his treat, I purchased Adam a new nest for his room today so I could put it in the corner where he has come to read his books. I placed it under a canopy I also created for him with twinkling lights when I set up his room in his new house. Like all things these days, it was over-wrapped. We arrived home and I was determined to get this simple task done for him. He helped me lug a bag inside and I asked him to play on his own nearby. He wanted to eat, he wanted to do something else \u2014 he wanted my help.  \u201cAdam, mommy doesn\u2019t have any help so you have to be my helper today,\u201d I said. New single-mother talk, I\u2019m thinking. But I\u2019m also thinking how frustrated I am over trying to do everything as quickly as possible, wishing right now, in this moment, that I had someone to do it for me so I can turn to Adam instead.  \u201cJust wait, Adam,\u201d I say with irritated breath, unraveling yards of ties and cardboard with an inappropriate pair of kiddie scissors that were handy. It\u2019s me that I realize I\u2019m telling to wait, though. Adam is doing just fine. I struggle to carry the big hoop of the chair to the upstairs and set the chair up, going as fast as I can. \u201cCome see, Adam. Come upstairs,\u201d I am now asking after I just told him to stay put. I imagine my son thinks I\u2019m nuts. He obliges me and goes into the chair and curls into it contentedly reading his series of  I Spy  phonics books, reminding me that \u201cit\u2019s not a horse; it\u2019s a duck.\u201d His language skills have improved. He talks in more sentences, in particular to tell me everything he sees.  I suck in some air and sit on the edge of his bed, enjoying him enjoying the chair. I like to watch Adam happy and calm. Heck, I like to experience myself happy and calm.  I know I have to prepare dinner. The grandparents are coming soon, Adam was searching hi and lo in my kitchen for something, as usual, to eat. It\u2019s a wonder the boy is so slim with all he eats. I am breathing more calmly thinking that I know I can\u2019t do everything at every moment I want to. I know that something\u2019s gotta give; of some things I must let go at certain moments, and maybe even for life. I am still in that growing phase of learning to be on my own as a parent. Although life isn\u2019t bad, it isn\u2019t the same when you have to do everything yourself. I am learning, still, after two years to be okay with this. While I get a lot of snuggles from Adam and a lot of kisses too, I realized that I don\u2019t get a lot of \u201chow are you\u2019s?\u201d from anyone, really. I don\u2019t get the \u201chow are you  really  doing?\u201d kind of caring-talk. I suddenly realize it when Adam pops out of his room and hollers from the top of the stairs, \u201cI wub you!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I ask loudly as I am in the kitchen preparing food.  \u201cI wub you mum!\u201d All his words were spoken with force but with the same intonation. Then, I hear him go back into the room and shut the door.  I am stunned. I think Adam is saying thank you for the chair, for his little nest.  I think he totally knows how much I love him.

{"date": "2010/07/01", "body": "One of the most talked about issues in autism is the issue of verbal communication or \u201cfunctional\u201d speech. That is, speech that is reciprocal, social, conversational. For Adam, there have been major challenges in this area and he has had to use augmentative forms in order to communicate many things, yet for the person who understands his communication, he is communicating all the time. I do not find it too difficult to understand and the one shortcoming I may have is the tendency to feel frustrated when he is \u2014 when he cannot get a more complex message across. Adam turned eight this year and much of this is beginning to change. Adam began to talk in sentences, began to show me things and started to become \u201cthe teacher,\u201d in the sense that he would test me on the things he wanted to talk about in books. He learned certain concepts such as what something was NOT as opposed to what it was, among other concepts.  There are a couple of things I want to write with respect to progress in communication ability, quite unscientifically, in this post, for I have not yet found some good citations to support my theories about autism and development. So take it for what it\u2019s worth and perhaps you may see some more of my posts deal with this \u2014 with citations. I\u2019ve been reading how to teach philosophy to children through children\u2019s books:  Big Ideas for Little Kids: Teaching Philosophy Through Children\u2019s Literature , by Thomas E. Wartenberg. When we refer to teaching \u201ccritical thinking\u201d to autistic children, it usually has to deal with teaching the more functional types like putting puzzles together or teaching Feature, Function and Class \u2014 for those familiar you know what I mean. These are the basic skills we believe are absent in autistic children because their very expression is difficult to manifest \u2014 be it for attentional reasons or motor planning issues, or both. We do not address for the \u201cprofoundly autistic,\u201d \u201cseverely autistic\u201d or any autistic child, for that matter, often enough,  how  to read books, how to question and how to think abstractly because we have decided that autistic people learn literally. While this may be in part true, we miss an opportunity to help along the critical aspects to being human \u2014 the ability to question. I\u2019ve read many a time how we wish to teach some flexibility in thinking in autism. To me, teaching through books and by taking a lead in creative ways to view things from different angles is not only an exercise for Adam, but also for myself. We would all stand to gain from working to think in ways that may not be familiar to us. We are more often concerned with our children knowing how to read the words (certainly this is the first step to reading at all). We do not learn how to talk to an autistic child who has difficulty with that reciprocity, how to really push forward, even though their manifestation of understanding is not what we expect. In my view, I feel it is dangerous to assume that Adam does not understand as much as it is to take for granted that he can just learn the way a typical child does. Yet all those years of puzzles, functional skills and communication issues makes me worried that Adam is missing the most important component of life learning, that is, to ask questions about everything. I\u2019m quite sure I will be writing more about my in-house experiments here. That said, I have a short story to tell. With some severe weather hovering around Toronto, there was a downburst, or a tornado. Both Adam and I enjoy watching the weather reports. With bad weather, we are glued to the TV. I was talking about funnel clouds and how they are dangerous.  \u201cWhy?\u201d Adam asked. \u201cBecause they can rip down houses and trees,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked again. I am thinking about a three-year-old I once knew when I was an older kid and how every answer to a question he had ended up with yet another \u201cwhy?\u201d Like that, the conversation went on a bit between Adam and I. He kept asking me \u201cwhy?\u201d until I ran out of answers! For a typical child, asking \u201cwhy?\u201d is expected. For an eight-year-old developing autistic child, it was another one of our milestones.  With that \u201cwhy?\u201d also came a series of sentences and conversations this week. With those conversations came difficulty falling asleep and some body jerks. Also interesting that along with an increased in verbal expression came an improvement on his fine-motor skills at the dining table as well as gross motor skills I noticed while watching him outside climbing structures I\u2019ve never seen him climb before. Could this be a reason for the sleeping issues? Could his body be a-buzz? Again, I am making a possible correlation that needs to be tested because dad let him sleep in over the weekend (school was out) and this is reason enough for not being able to go to sleep the following day and, perhaps lack of sleep and other frustrations lead to more body jerks. Yet I also wonder, only because I\u2019ve seen it before, if sleep issues and body jerks have to do with an increased output of communication and other \u201cmanifestions,\u201d \u2014   overall \u201cprogress.\u201d So often we view \u201cissues\u201d as a result of \u201cdelay\u201d and \u201cbehaviours\u201d and we label it as if it is something we have to get rid of or something that worries us.  Yet, with this example, Adam is trying so hard to express himself and his body may be following him as it attempts to process the steps we have taken for granted. If we take a view that such preservations, behaviours, sleep problems might have to do with processing, progress and development, how might we address and teach autistic children differently? It\u2019s something to think about when we study autism and when we rethink the, perhaps, very \u201cnormal\u201d path of autistic development.

Adam just did that on his own. With all of this activity, one would imagine that  child would sleep well.  Like many autistic folks, however, Adam doesn\u2019t always need a lot of sleep. I, on the other hand, need my seven hours. He\u2019s still so young, I am unable to teach him at this point to do work, go onto the computer and let me get what I need. In many ways, it can be like having an infant, still.  If I left him to his own devices at this particular age, he would turn his room into a gymnasium, climbing all the furniture (which thankfully I bolted down).  It might have been the storm last night that woke him, I\u2019ll grant him that. I heard him yelp. As Adam begins to talk more and find his \u201cvoice,\u201d he is also becoming much LOUDER.

Occasionally I tried to persuade him with a \u201csleep,\u201d word or two, and he would at least quiet down for a bit. At six this morning I gave up trying.

{"date": "2010/07/06", "body": "In the sweltering heat, Adam has returned to the camp he has attended for several years now. \u201cHey Adam!\u201d the counselors greeted, eager to embrace him under a tent yesterday which did not quell the wall of heat in Toronto. Adam processed the swarm quietly, standing before the semi-circle of enthused pubescents taking his time to assess the environment and some new faces, let alone the emotional excitement and kindness before him. Sometimes it just takes some time before Adam is ready to jump into their arms with a like embrace. Before yesterday, Adam and I spent the week together \u2014 that space and time between the end of school and the beginning of camp. Long, hot days needed to be filled because Adam doesn\u2019t love to stay at home. He loves to go out and explore new places all the time. He likes to walk and walk, and if there is an intriguing pathway or staircase, he might convince me to go along with him. Sometimes I can convince him to come with me too, and so \u201cwell-behaved\u201d is he with his now single mom who needs to get \u201cstuff\u201d done. I find myself, in my newer role, asking for his patience with me and he obliges generously. I realized that we have become quite a dynamic duo in our new circumstance, although I admit that being a single mother of an autistic child isn\u2019t always easy in the sense of Adam\u2019s differences and my need to always check my beliefs and expectations at the door. It also occurred to me that my mother, in a different time and circumstance, spent a significant amount of time with me. She lugged me to the grocery store, her doctor\u2019s appointments. Where-ever she went, I accompanied and I recall what an important life lesson this was. I got to see how my mom acted around the doctor and the dentist; how she interacted with the butcher, the neighbour, the banker, and how she negotiated with life.  In this day and age of programs \u2014 and don\u2019t get me wrong, I believe children benefit by them \u2014 I not only thought about how children lack going outside to play the way we did when we were kids, but that I tend to get things done only when Adam is in his programs or in school. My parents didn\u2019t have the benefit of such programs. Nor were they considered as necessary in the day-and-age of \u201cgo outside and play until the sun goes down.\u201d I suppose our parents got things done when we were out of the house too, but I remember being more connected to their activities overall. Certainly it\u2019s not safe these days to let our children out all day long without supervision. The world is a changed place indeed. For my autistic boy, safety is of vital concern, friendships are not made easily, and he would wander off and get lost if left to his own devices. Adam\u2019s playmates are aides and kids with aides, camp-mates and like children in music, art or sports programs. Sigh\u2026 the world today. Yet last week, that dear week, I had Adam to myself. Adam accompanied me (almost) everywhere and didn\u2019t complain, in fact, he seemed to  enjoy  every moment with me.   When someone stepped in for a bit to see him, he took me by the hand to insist I come with. All parents know those days when the babysitter arrives and the child doesn\u2019t want mom or dad to leave. My son Adam didn\u2019t express that all too much when he was two and three-years-old.  At eight, he is able to show it more. And so, last week when I left to do some more grocery shopping on my own Adam asked his aide, \u201cwhere\u2019s my mother?\u201d For a child only beginning to talk in sentences, and ones that are still very hard to come by, it\u2019s quite a question.  Perhaps he had been thinking that all along. In those earlier days, we parents may be inclined to think that just because our autistic children are not verbally articulate, that they are not wondering, thinking or understanding so many things the way a typical child might.  Surely this sentence, relayed by his aide to me, was music to my ears, but I\u2019ve never ignored the fact that I think Adam often wondered many things. As I walked into the house carrying a load of groceries, overheated and glad to be home, I saw Adam at the end of the hallway in my kitchen, eating his snack looking at me, beaming from ear-to-ear.

These attributes become ever-more important when we decide to start a family. I might suggest, as a woman with some experience, that a serious review of some of these attributes in ourselves as well our partners, and an agreement of some kind, is of prime importance before starting a family. Instead we get swept up, probably because most of us are young, in the idea of what a marriage should be instead of looking at the practicalities of construction. Naively, we come to believe that having a baby is romantic and naturally, all we want to do is proliferate the romance. In an age where we are encouraged, and should to some degree, go with the flow, we may have swung too far. Perhaps we do not consider our partners in construction carefully enough because it seems too \u201cbusiness-like.\u201d Yet real life seems to be that fine balance between the two. As the saying goes, all we have at the end are the relationships we\u2019ve built, and might I add, maintained. In a society that values Individualism, it seems to me that many of us have forgotten that it takes a community to not only raise a child, but to also sustain us as adults, so we better be paying attention to how and what we build. As Thoreau said, \u201cbuild [those] castles in the sky\u2026\u201d but it helps to place the foundations under them. It behooves us to try our best to ensure they are strong. Let me clarify here that I am a woman writing in retrospect as I am now a single mother of an autistic child. I\u2019ve seen that when relationships fall apart, we blame it on other things. No matter what, external factors will impact a life and a marriage \u2014 illness, disability, death and other unfortunate occurrences. We hear it in the marriage vows (for better or for worse, in sickness and in health), yet it seems few of us care to consider the meaning of those words which, in my view, can apply to our friendships and other types of partnerships. I mean, no one can really scoff at those marriage vows even if one doesn\u2019t believe in the institution. We all want someone to see us for who we are, and to love us until the end. Yet, sometimes the two people who came together with the best of intentions cannot endure the stress and do not function well as a team when challenged. In an era of extreme autism fascination and fear we can be ultimately challenged. As such, it is also assumed, and often written, that autism is a main cause of divorce. The unknowing, innocent autistic child is then targeted by society as a result, and it is yet one more reason added to an exhaustive list of why we must cure and change the autistic child as quickly as possible. Instead of considering that all children are a test \u2014 that in fact, all of life is one big test \u2014 we yet again blame the autism. I have always found the idea of blaming the autistic child for the deterioration of marriage as something unfair to autistic people. Yet, when my own marriage ended, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if any of those ideas behind the eighty per-cent divorce rates and autism might even in some small way be true. There can be more stress because our children have atypical needs that are not easily accommodated in our communities. In North America, we are still in the process of legislating what the rights of disabled (including autistic) people must be. We have acknowledged that the rights of autistic people are about thirty years behind of how we regard and grant rights to people with other disabilities. In other words, there is still a journey ahead. As a parent also living in an age when governments do not understand autism and the accommodations autistic people need to contribute as autistic people, there is more stress when we have to fight to get our kids into schools, obtain financial support, acquire respite help, augmentative communication devices, social skills and vocational training and later, appropriate housing accommodations, access to community colleges and universities with aides and supports that allow our adult children to continue to learn and contribute. By default, we\u2019ve become activists, advocates by no choice of our own. Daily, in some way shape or form, we always seem to be negotiating prejudice in order to get our children and our families what they need. Yes, it can be exhausting in the beginning. I believe all parents need to pace themselves for like life, the journey is long. I\u2019ve heard that some spouses complain about mothers (let me clarify that the bulk of writings on the topic seem to address the mothers) who take on such a role. \u201cIf only the child was \u201cnormal,\u201d then the mother would be able to attend to her husband more often. I\u2019ve also heard single moms of more than one autistic child claim that their entire identities are entwined in autism, and as you can see from the laundry list above, it is with good reason. Further, some families that are mixed with typical and autistic children also seem to experience more stress because the autistic child is held up against the typical one and there might be some unhealthy comparisons. As a mother of only one child, I have to consider that some of my stress may be alleviated by the fact that I know of no other way to live. I have no other child to compare mine against. I consider this one of my many blessings. It might be true that some husbands (and this can also apply to mothers, I do not wish to target husbands, so let me clarify this here even if I do state either \u201cfathers\u201d or \u201cmothers\u201d) do not care to participate in the intensive initial learning curve of raising an autistic child. It is true that some partners bail and leave the brunt of the work to the mother. It is true that in the first years after a diagnosis, and in our new age of autism fascination and fear, autism required a lot of reading, research and self-enquiry. Yet, life evolves, our children mature and we move beyond that \u201ccrisis\u201d phase. One can only hope that our partners will hang on until we get there. Still, blaming the mother for the failed marriage is an old idea \u2014 we\u2019re either as cold-as-ice- Bettelheim- Refrigerator-Mothers or we are terrible wives. Misogynistic ideas flagellate us and the ideas run so deep they are tough to beat. While there are single mothers truly struggling and are in need of respite, access to services and financial support, I also suggest that these are the caregivers who should be at the top of the list for such support. For after all, it is true that if a mother does not explore herself and her own needs, she will not be able to give herself to her family. I also think there are all kinds of mothers, those with special needs or typical children. Some are the ones always carpooling, always talking about their children at social functions \u2014 forgive me please if you are one of them for it\u2019s your right, but it\u2019s just not my style. Although I spoke a lot about autism in the early years as I tried to figure it out for myself, and I often write about my son on my blog, I do not always wish to talk about him or about autism and I never wanted a bucket full of kids. In short, I\u2019ve seen more women of typical children get so caught up in their motherhood roles that I find it so ironic that mothers of autistic children get blamed for failed marriages because we get so involved in our \u201cautistic\u201d children\u2019s lives! Indirectly of course, the autism, or autistic child is also blamed. In all of my years I\u2019ve tried to always enjoy my passions, even if I\u2019ve had to sometimes put them on hold at various points in my life. Even while my autistic child is a huge source of happiness for me, I recognize that in order to be a good mother, I have to explore and live my own life. I believe that by being my   non -super-mom (hence the lack of carpooling) very basic self, I am setting a good example for my son. Mothers of autistic children are also professors and other professionals with successful partnerships and marriages and others are struggling to care for the children on their own while trying to make ends meet. Like everyone, we are also a diverse community. No matter where we are at, finding the balance is an art we seem to always be working at. A new study debunks the incorrect divorce rate and some of the assumptions that we have mustered that belong to the myth.  Dr. Brian Freedman of the Kennedy Krieger Institute  found that a child\u2019s autism \u201chad no effect on the family structure.\u201d In fact, he found that 64 per cent of children with autism belong to a family with two married biological or adoptive parents compared to 65 per cent of children who do not have ASD. Freedman\u2019s study acknowledges that parenting an autistic child may be more stressful and it may put pressure on the marriage, which he found in past studies. As I looked back to reference this, I found one executed in the  Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (Vol. 19, No. 1, 1989): Brief Report: Psychological Effects of Parenting Stress on Parents of Autistic Children  (Wolf, Noh, Fisman, Speechly). What was noteworthy to me in this study was an assumption that parents felt that their own personal goals were delayed or forfeited (Kohut, 1966), disappointments with delayed developmental milestones (Howard, 1978), worry regarding future self-sufficiency (Wing, 1985; Wolf & Goldberg, 1986), and the unpredictable, ambiguous nature of autism as important sources of life stress that impose physical and emotional strains on parents exceeding levels experienced by parents of normal children (Bristol & Schopler, 1984; Korn, Chess, & Fernandez, 1978). Freedman seems to have used these assumptions when citing that parents of autistic children suffer a greater amount of stress than parents of children with Down Syndrome or typical children; that mothers report more depression and fathers deal with stress by distancing themselves and becoming less involved with the family. (Source: Kennedy Krieger Institute). Yet, in an analysis of the  National Survey of Children\u2019s Health , data showed that other factors can contribute to divorce, \u201csuch has having a child with particularly challenging behaviors  with and without autism  [bold mine]. For some families, the challenges of parenting a child with special needs may indeed result in straining the marriage to the breaking point.\u201d Freedman wishes to conduct more longitudinal studies to find out how relationships can survive such stressors and what factors may enable the successful marriage. Alison Singer, founder of  The Autism Science Foundation  agrees that it would be helpful to find the \u201cnet stress reducers,\u201d for families, noting also that the 80% divorce-rate myth may have added to our stress as parents and marriage partners. It might help to add here that Canadian researcher Lonnie Zwaigenbaum in his paper A  Qualitative Investigation of Changes in the Belief Systems of Families of Children With Autism or Down Syndrome  (Child: Care, Health and Development, 2006,32: 353-369) concluded that families with autistic and Down syndrome children resulted in a reconstruction of values, expectations and actually added to a sense of overall happiness and joy. His team noted that most families believed that their children improved their quality of life. I will concur. Having an autistic child, even with the challenges, has brought me down to earth and made me appreciate many more aspects and people that are currently in my life. My son Adam has been my most profound teacher in helping me see not only the realities of life, but in living with them to the best possible degree. Still, I thought it really important to discover why so many people believe that families with autistic children in them, are subject to higher divorce rates. They seem to be based in our beliefs and fears, whether they are real or not. We are told many negative things when we first hear the word autism and the idea of having a difficult marriage is not a welcome message. As a single parent, I also have to consider what of those negative messages permeate societal thoughts and the potential for future relationships as society (and potential partners within it) believes that life is so hard for us that we do not have time for the pursuit of happiness. We learned the extraordinary lengths we would have to take to help or \u201ccure\u201d our children \u2014 the strain on our financial resources and time \u2014 but the future, even with such investments, looked uncertain. When I consider stress, I have to account for some of the images I have had in my own journey, particularly the early ones. Thoughts like: thwarted dreams, a curbed schedule, shiny white hospitals with fluorescent lights, and spare cots (as seen in the neglected institutions of the 1960\u2019s) popped into my head as I lay putting my autistic son to bed, his hair still baby-soft and face so sweet. The images did not fit with my reality, yet, I wondered how these haunted thoughts would effect the way I dealt with my son. Those images collide against the perfect Hollywood glam of serial daters and spouses with their perfectly coiffed children in gleaming black limousines. Let me quickly add that you will find me often blaming Hollywood for our warped self-images. By taking a serious look at these narratives and images, it is possible to come back down to reality and back away from feelings of doom. Not only do I know my marriage did not dissolve because of my autistic child, but I became interested in the underlying fears that may prohibit some people from believing that future relationships with autistic children are possible. In other words, I think there is a correlation between our idea that autistic families must have higher divorce rates because, \u2013 we believe we suffer more stress because we feel we devote much more time to the autistic child than the neurotypical child, possibly without considering the issues that many typical children have that can also put a strain on marriages and the outcome of all children is uncertain; \u2013 we have automatically concluded without further inquiry into our belief systems, that single parents of autistic children have it tougher and therefore have less time for current or future relationships (as compared to families with typical children); \u2013 and that our historical view of the disabled as asexual non persons is inherited in how we view ourselves as parents and human beings. The stigma facing the disabled community still lingers. We see a person with real physical or cognitive issues, and a slew of ideas and images cross our minds. I find it helps to always catch myself in these moments of thought and question the immediately. It\u2019s not that most of us really know anything about the disabled person\u2019s life, for many of us have never had a family member or lived with a disability. History continues to pulse through our veins and when we view disabled persons, we think of institutions, hardship and poverty \u2014 not the typical attractive traits we think of when exploring sexual relationships. In autism in particular, we are all too familiar with the head-banging narrative. It was the first thing we envisioned when we heard the word AUTISM. Whether our children were diagnosed at the age of two, three, four or beyond, that very word altered our perspectives of both our children, and our futures. I can think of no image associated with a word more powerful in my lifetime. It takes so much time and self enquiry to unravel the fear and begin to find that balance again. In addition to unraveling and reconstructing our expectations for our children, we need time to discover what we need as parents to live a full and \u201cbalanced\u201d life. As a newly single parent who has spent two years thinking hard about this, I can think of nothing as important as taking care of myself and having an important relationship (one can be happy being single \u2014 everyone has to find their own path, of course) as not only setting the right example for my autistic child, but for my own happiness which is as much as my right to have as it is my son\u2019s. It is said that the most successful people in life are the ones who are most adaptable. We are put to the test time and again. We try to build strong foundations and sometimes the end result doesn\u2019t turn out the way we expect. So we keep trying. I\u2019ve given myself some space and time to create a positive atmosphere and peace around myself and my son. This painful time has been precious and with every day comes an awareness that life is neither perfect nor predictable. We cannot predict the outcome of the autistic or the typical child, as much as we would like to think that we can and for that reason I believe things are meant to fall apart so we can rebuild them again with more wisdom and a healthier outlook.  I share this story in hopes that we can all exchange our experiences and become a little wiser. Today, we are so fortunate to have the benefit of more autistic adults showing us what they need to contribute to society. We have more positive examples to live by and this by its very nature gives parents more hope. I find it quite relieving to see that there is a sort of \u201cnormal\u201d path of autistic development.  We are made more aware of the stigma that influences our thinking and can choose to move away from it. The outcome of divorce and lack of support can fall on single parents with all kinds of children. Yes, autistic children need more support in a world that doesn\u2019t value them as they are.  In a recent conference called  Autism, Ethics and Society , based in the U.K., the introduction to the sessions read: \u201cAutism is a  common  [italics mine] neurodevelopmental condition that has dramatically captured attention in the last decade.\u201d While there is much concern about further stigma regarding genetic testing and other scientific discoveries, there is comfort in common-ness, commune and community. Might we be coming to a new decade where autism isn\u2019t as scary and we as parents receive more moral and practical support (like getting into schools), that ease the mental stress that seems to going along with both marriage and single parenting? I definitely believe that  along with new people that will come into our lives, this is the new frontier for Adam and myself. At least it\u2019s my castle in the sky. I\u2019m in the process of rebuilding the foundation underneath it. \u2014\u2013 \nA little postscript today: After writing this, I received a note from Adam\u2019s camp counsellors describing him. It says, \u201cAdam brings charm to the senior 24 group. Like the gentle Snorlax Pokeman, he maintains peace with everyone and shows a love for nature. If it was not for him, we would have never found all the golden eggs.\u201d All I can say is\u2026. exactly.

{"date": "2010/07/28", "body": "Using the title from Kat Kelland\u2019s article in today\u2019s Globe and Mail, she suggests that experts are worried that, with the extended array of defined disorders in the soon-to-be-released DSM V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual), no normal person will continue to exist. \n \u201cCiting examples of new additions like \u2018mild anxiety depression, \u2018psychosis risk syndrome,\u2019 and \u2018temper dysregulation disorder\u2019\u2026many people previously seen as perfectly healthy could in future be told they are ill\u2026.\u2019It\u2019s leaking into normality. It is shrinking the pool of what is normal to a puddle\u2026 Dr. Wykes and colleagues, Felicity Callard, also of Kings Institute of Psychiatry, and Nick Craddock of Cardiff University\u2019s department of psychological medicine and neurology said many in the psychiatric community are worried that the further guidelines are expanded, the more likely it will become that nobody be classed as normal anymore.\u201d  Well, it\u2019s about time. Perhaps ironically, I\u2019m not one for self-help aisles and a belief that we all suffer from some made-up ailment that can be remedied with expensive quackery. At the same time, I also understand that there is a widespread concern that if we simply\u00a0dilute\u00a0human differences and challenges\u00a0we do not address\u00a0serious \u00a0medical and practical needs. In other words, some people fear that a complete distillation of humankind will take away much needed work towards attaining the\u00a0services, medical attention, and accommodations that we continue to need in order to replace the treacherous world of asylums.  This article in The New York Times, cites some of the other concerns specific to the autism diagnostics proposed for the new manual. What the  Globe and Mail  article assumes quite simply, however, is that there are only two kinds of people: normal and abnormal. We know that in history that it is  this  whitewash, this binary,\u00a0that is the most dangerous because it has\u00a0 subjugated individuals with differing needs, thinking ability and functioning levels to not only the margins of society, but to maltreatment and exclusion\u00a0of all kinds. Until\u00a0 recently, disabled people have had no rights. Still today,\u00a0seen as non-persons despite\u00a0 legislation and the ADA ,\u00a0disabled and autistic individuals continue to struggle for their right to have a voice at policy-making tables, and to be accepted and accommodated for their needs while contributing as autistic and disabled people. Not a day goes by that the notion of cures and getting \u201cbetter\u201d (that is \u201cmore normal\u201d), underlies the purpose of teaching autistic people at all, as opposed to teaching them to their strengths and abilities as well as with a regard to the value of autistic contribution. As a committe works to redefine the characteristics of autism, the questions that the committee ask in the panels are well worth reading. \u00a0 I cannot help but wonder how getting an autism diagnosis may change for parents and autistic people, and consider that the future could be brighter. In my view, we seem to be asking some of the right questions with regard to the spectrum of autism and the fallacy of the association between intelligence and functioning levels. So I guess I\u2019m saying that as I read the  Globe  article this morning, I was sort of nodding my head. Yes, there is no normal\u2026.that\u2019s right. Why fear that? What is it that we must do and how must we think differently in order to finally obliterate that binary? It is here that \u00a0I have to refer to  Wendy Lawson\u2019s book  Concepts of Normality: The Autistic And Typical Spectrum  (Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 2008).  In it she states, \u201cCurrently the debate about \u2018what is normal\u2019 is causing some heated exchange; this is not new. In particular the debate concerning autism, disability, neuro-diversity and typicality poses some ongoing challenges. Disability presents itself in a variety of ways, and for most of us living with disability, who we are is normal for us. For many people on the autism spectrum, which is certainly very disability in a world that does not accept, value or accomodate \u2018difference,\u2019 being handicapped is an everyday reality\u2026Having a respectful understanding of one another should include accessibility to appropriate resources, support, safe places and sincere appreciation of difference. Anything less is not acceptable.\u201d  (Introduction) Recently,  Thomas Armstrong released his book,  Neurodiversity: Discovering the Extraordinary Gifts of Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia and Other Brain Differences , (De Capo Press, Cambridge, 2010).  In his first chapter \u201cNeurodiversity: A Concept Whose Time Has Come,\u201d he has cleverly quoted Margaret Mead: \u201cIf we are to achieve a richer culture, rich in contrasting values, we must recognize the whole gamut of human potentialities, and so eave a less arbitrary social fabric, one in which each human gift will fall into place.\u201d  (from  Sex and Temperment in Three Primitive Societies ). Thomas goes on:  \u201cIn 1952 the first edition of the Diagnostic and\u00a0Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association listed one hundred categories of psychiatric illness. By 2000 this number has tripled. We\u2019ve become accustomed as a culture to the idea that significant segments of the population are afflicted with neurologically based disorders such as \u2018learning disabilities,\u2019 \u2018attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,\u2019 and \u2018Aspergers syndrome,\u2019 conditions that were unheard of sixty years ago. Now, even newer disabilities are being considered for the next DSM in 2010, including relational disorder, sexual behaviour disorders, and video game addiction.\u201d \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d Thomas asks. He cites things like a greater knowledge of the human brain and research into the area, a growth of advocacy movements that push for \u201cawareness,\u201d (alas, is it no wonder why most of us shudder at \u201cAutism Awareness Month?). Mostly, the need for the advocacy marketing plan is the way to raise money for things like remedies and therapies. No family wishes to envision their children in asylums and mental hospitals (another topic because they were set up with all of the good intentions we have today for many of our \u201ccentres,\u201d but ended up so overpopulated that the patients within them were neglected and abused). While there has been a valid reason for advocacy movements, perhaps an acknowledgement that all humans are interdependent and need different supports (no matter the severity of their handicaps), may be a very welcome change. While we keep tripping over the question of what is normal, I\u00a0wonder if we\u00a0need a supplementary manual\u00a0that cites abilities, suggestions for inclusion, education, and the like.\u00a0\u00a0Perhpas we need not define handicaps as disorders, but very real challenges and acknowledge them against the social stigma of having any kind of disability. I have to question that if the stigma didn\u2019t exist, would we also be a society that tends towards over-medicalization? For I do acknowledge that heading into a doctor\u2019s office these days one wonders why so many meds are offered so readily for what I feel to be the way in which we respond to life \u2014 anti-depressants and meds like Ritalin come to mind. To me, this need not be a question of what is the right or the wrong way to be human, but how to support  all ways in which to be  human. A DSM can only do so much. It is up to us to ensure that we cultivate the society that treats and regards each person individually, for although we are united in our lack of normality, we are also unique.  It\u2019s a complicated matter indeed, but in the end, all we wish is to be seen and loved\u2026blemishes and all.

As a parent to an autistic person this means a lot to me \u2014 attempting to understand Adam\u2019s perception. Autism \u201cexperts\u201d write prolifically on describing what autistic behaviours \u201cmean\u201d and these behaviours, observed by non autistic people, get interpreted and become at best, anemic descriptions of a kind of human experience. Autistic people do better at such descriptions, for obvious reasons. Yet so often, words fail.  I thought I\u2019d post this video by musician John Cage as it provokes some thought on trying to describe the meaning of sound, that which is sensory and pleasurable, and for some autistic people, painful.  As we know that so much of autistic experience is sensory, it got me thinking about the sensory experience \u2014 how life (that is, our \u201csensory life\u201d ) is experienced differently by some and how others who do not understand human difference might attempt to explain inadequately. Cage goes on to say that sound has no meaning \u2014 it just is. I thought this video was not only interesting for the purposes of thinking about perception, but also how we experience and attempt to describe autistic people.

{"date": "2010/05/04", "body": "Thanks to a friend who passed along  this paper (titled above) by Dawn Eddings Prince (formerly known as Dawn Prince Hughes) published in ETHOS.  It is an endearing story of a mother with Aspergers to her autistic son. Unlike Dawn, I am not a woman with Aspergers nor a primate anthropologist who has garnered much of what she has learned about humanity through primates. If you have not read her book,  Songs of A Gorilla Nation  it is a must-read. It has left its imprint upon me for years now. No, I am a mother of an autistic child, similar but not just like, her child, relating to my son in unexpected ways, finding my points of context from art and my own awkward experiences growing up \u2014 trying to overlay those in helping me understand Adam\u2019s path. My stress has mainly come from outsiders who have put the pressure on us to change and be something other than what we are. I am glad to understand this stress and pressure in order to better help Adam chart his course. From the time I began  The Joy of Autism  blog  \u2014 and been downright attacked for it when it first started in 2005 (see right margin for the archive) \u2014  I was incapable of viewing Adam as that \u201cblight\u201d and \u201cburden\u201d that autistics were named. Everything Adam did was a downright miracle to me. Today, Adam \u2014 a kind, affable, giggly boy, has developed a curiousity and way of learning that never ceases to expand my own world and way of seeing things. Like Dawn\u2019s son, however, Adam is changing, developing tics. He is growing into a world that he is beginning to understand in ways that I knew (and feared) he would. One could say it happens to all parents. Yet Dawn\u2019s essay, however, cites a few exceptionalities to the growth. People fear each other. The flavor of distance seems to me to be how a community organizes itself. The codes of distance constitute the law\u2014for the living and the dead, so people close the lid on the toilet when they sit down to talk to someone else in the bathroom, signaling that they don\u2019t intend to dominantly mark their territory in the midst of the other; and men can\u2019t pick up and hold a crying child who is a stranger. This is why people always smile and say hello more often when they are on a trail in the forest, far from help, than when they are on a city street. Unfortunately, the chief danger and distance he was learning is that people can tell you that what you are isn\u2019t what you should be. I knew that the children at school were teasing him for talking to plants and bugs and rocks. His teacher told us he had a learning disability and had some attention deficit problems. He was starting to not be able to sleep at night and had anxiety attacks. Where he had always been an easy child he started to throw himself to the floor and scream over the smallest challenges. He started to be unable to go to restaurants because the lights hurt his eyes and the normal noise of conversation hurt his ears\u2014he would cover them with his hands and rock, trying to get under the table. He developed strict routines and would fall apart if something unexpected happened. He started to develop tics. He was becoming contextually autistic. This essay is beautifully written. Remembering Teryk, her son, playing in the prototype sensory room set up at The Sheraton Hotel in Toronto, where I introduced myself to Dawn and received such a warm hug from her, I feel we share a bond beyond that introduction by way of this piece on the special privilege of raising an autistic child. It is the bond of easing ourselves into the world as both autistic people and as their parents amidst the deluge of questions, quandaries and challenges that continue to face our children all the while loving them and  getting  them for who they are. And who better than Dawn?

{"date": "2010/05/13", "body": "What do Michel Foucault, who taught at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and Edward Scissorhands have in common? What do they both teach us in relation to how people with cognitive differences are treated by the legal system? Foucault\u2019s lectures from 1974-1975, compiled in the book  Abnormal  (Edited by Valerio Marchetti and Antonella Salomoni), suggest that our legal system is a mechanism of exclusion. Foucault argues that the emergence of abnormal in the nineteenth century constitutes the basis of human as: \u201cthe monster, the individual to be corrected, and the onanist.\u201d It was the nineteenth century that saw the system of \u201cnormal\u201d birth in the way we understand it today. Adolphe Quetelet established a measure of the stars that was also used as a model to create a \u201cstatistical norm\u201d of humans for political purposes during this period. It should not be surprising then, that this system of \u201cregularities\u201d was used in medico-legal practice, and \u201cproduced a psychologico-moral double of the legal offense [thus] creating [a model] of the \u2018dangerous individual.'\u201d Just how do we determine who is dangerous? The question is important since people with cognitive differences have been marginalized, feared and unjustly incarcerated. I do not think it needs rementioning that this fear underlies, even, the many media reports about autism and the fierce quest for a cure. Foucault, further, cites legal examples of how we exclude, judge, fear and incarcerate individuals who MAY BE a danger to society. \u201cThe examination is that form of knowledge and power that gives rise to the \u2018human sciences,\u2019 and thus that contributes to the constitution of the domain of the abnormal. The examination of the \u2018dangerous individual,\u2019 for example, implied a control not primarily of what individuals did, but of what they  might  do. [italics mine], what they are capable of doing. \u2018Dangerousness\u2019 meant that the individual \u2018must be considered by society at the level of his potentialities and not at the level of his acts,\u2019 not as someone who had actually violated a law, but as someone whose potential behavior had to be subject to control and correction.\u201d Foucault has also said, \u201cExpert opinion shows how the individual already resembles his crime before he has committed it.\u201d He also said in his lectures,  \u201cThe first property is the power to determine, directly or indirectly, a decision of justice that ultimately concerns a person\u2019s freedom or detention, or, if it comes to it, life and death. So, these are the discourses that ultimately have the power of life and death. Second property: From what does this power of life and death derive? From the judicial system, perhaps, but these discourses also have this power by virtue of the fact that they function as discourses of truth within the judicial system. They function as discourses of truth because they are discourses within a scientific status or discourses expressed exclusively by qualified people within a scientific institution. Discourses that can kill, discourses of truth, and, the third property, discourses \u2014 you yourselves are the proof and witnesses of this \u2014 that make you laugh. And discourses of truth that provoke laughter and have the institutional power to kill, are, after all, in a society like ours, discourses that deserve some attention\u2026These everyday discourses of truth that kill and provoke laughter are at the very heart of our judicial system.\u201d As Foucault cites specific legal cases, it becomes clear that the  least element of proof  has been enough to entail a certain element of penalty.\u00a0 I do not think I need to cite specific cases in autism where autistic people are marginalized, assumed to be dangerous, and who often are mistreated by those in law enforcement. These stories are in the news every month. Stories of how autistic people are feared manifest in our treatment of them and the burden of proof lies heavy upon the autistic person.  As I watched Edward Scissorhands again last night, which should be a cult film of the disability genre, I want you to pay specific attention to the court scene and the \u201cexpert\u201d opinion and then the group of women perpetuating fear. As autism is diagnosed by observation only, I hope to illustrate the bias that underlies our thinking and permeates our society and how it effects the treatment of autistic individuals not only by our formal institutions, but as Foucault takes further, in the law: \u2014- \n References: Michel Foucault,  Abnormal: Lectures At The Coll\u00e8ge De France , 1974-1975, New York: Picador, 1999.

{"date": "2010/05/16", "body": "The nice thing about art is that it is a language without words. It\u2019s why I believe strongly that it is an important (not nice and trite,  isn\u2019t-the-Autie-a-genius)  approach to appreciating not only how autistic people may see and develop, but of course of understanding humanity \u2014 a very broad statement, I know, but art is a way to bridge the barriers of looking at people with neurological differences as \u201cabnormal,\u201d \u201cretarded\u201d and the like. It is also highly ironic that I write about art and that the art world seeks so many words to critique and analyze it. Yet, at the end of the day, we have a gut response to art before we have an intellectual one. I was thinking about this as Adam has turned to art. This is not just peripheral observation\u2026it goes deeper. Adam studies all the elements of things with ferocity and concentration. He will hold any object in his hand \u2014 even a part of an object, turn it around and study it, tap it and consider all of it\u2019s physical properties. He may or may not label it, as he has done since he was eleven months of age (labeling, that is), but I consider that his sharing in this manner is simply his way of sharing with me because he has trouble with words. Yet, his understanding goes far beyond the label. W.J.T. Mitchell, in his essay  Visual Literacy or Literary Visualcy?  (excerpted from  Visual Literacy  edited by James Elkins) asks how seeing is different from reading. \u201cEven more interesting, what would happen if we reversed the positions of tenor and vehicle in the metaphor, and treated reading as \u2018tenor\u2019 \u2014 the thing to be explained \u2014 and vision as the vehicle that might help explain it? What would happen, in other words, if we thought of our task as one of research and teaching in reading, based in models drawn from seeing and the visual system?\u201d (p.11). It is in this vein that I believe we can begin to explain our words about autism and challenge our very basic assumptions. For instance, consider the two drawings below. Adam, at the age of 8 has fine motor planning difficulties. It is very hard for him to hold a pencil or crayon, but in the first drawing one can see it\u2019s coming and that he is trying extremely hard to express himself. The drawing beside it, also a Lion, was executed by a same-aged \u201ctypical\u201d peer. By contrast, one can see the marks in this drawing made with strength and certainty whereby Adam\u2019s drawing seems a little tentative and soft by virtue of his motor planning difficulty. Take another look. Adam took great care and time rendering that drawing. So much so, he even walked away, came back to reconsider it and lightly put the finishing touches carefully on the tail several minutes after it seemed finished. It was so lightly drawn that it was difficult to photograph. Look at the perspective and how he tries to implement it. It is not a flat drawing. He can see how the body has several dimensions. Compare it to the \u201csame-aged typical peer\u201d drawing \u2014 wonderful in its own rite but by contrast, there is, as of yet, no conception of perspective. In one drawing the earth is round, in the other, flat. Adam's \"Lion King\" A drawing of a lion from a same-aged \"typical\" peer It is interesting to me to watch Adam\u2019s \u201cvisualcy\u201d manifest.  It is interesting because he does not fit into any developmental mold.  While his hand his light, he is ahead of the curve by way of his perception. One might mistake motor-planning difficulty with Adam\u2019s \u201cretardation,\u201d as it was formerly labeled. Now how dangerous is this when we consider how to teach an autistic person? What assumptions about his intelligence are we making? When I think of schools I get extremely nervous about moving him too slow or too fast.

As we discuss the idea of healing, I\u2019m wondering if we are able to view autism in this way \u2014 to not just create a revisionist view of autism, but even to reintegrate the experience \u2014 being a parent or a person with autism.

I come across traits in \u201ctypical\u201d people who are able to discuss their atypicalities and sensory abilities that seem outstandingly similar to autistic people, although some more major handicaps may not be present in some of these artists such as motor planning issues or an inability to talk. Yet the atypicalities are certainly present. What I like about the following video is the way healing is discussed by integrating experience. Acceptance is like an integration of experience, and the expressions we make both scientifically and creatively become manifestations of how we re-integrate the understanding of this into our consciousness.

This is because, too often, ground rules that are put in place, whether by an educator/facilitator or by participants, privilege the already-privileged groups in a dialogical experience.

When we consider who is protected by ground rules like \u201cdo not express anger,\u201d it becomes apparent that, intentionally or not, they protect the participants representing privileged groups. While I do not advocate dropping ground rules altogether; I do support the idea of seriously studying these issues and the possible ramifications of ground rules that might ultimately support the status quo by providing safety and comfort for those who, for the sake of their own learning, most desperately need to be made to feel uncomfortable.

Most writers know this is not so. While I\u2019m not a new writer, I\u2019ve not yet written a book. Much like how we view people and autism \u2014 that there is a goal that must be reached \u2014 that only one end result is desirable or feasible \u2014 we forget the journey and the process as the greatest creation of all. When all is said and done and the product is finished perhaps a few people will read our work, perhaps fewer will remember it (or as Elizabeth Gilbert and J.K. Rowling will attest \u2014 sometimes there is \u201cfreakish\u201d success). But that does not make the doing, the making, any less significant. An act of creation is no waste of time. It pains me sometimes when I watch a culture so invested in the end result that we continue to churn out less creators and more factory-line producers in business administrators and lawyers (but let us not forget that there are wonderful creators in these professions as well). I have a real issue with \u201cprofessionals\u201d being churned out of universities, as I find that those without such degrees can be equally, if not more competent, in business. I believe university is an opportunity to receive the Universal Education \u2013 not a place to learn a trade.

I believe learning a craft is equally as important as learning philosophy, literature, art, and the sciences. My real point is, life is more than the products we produce. It is the intricacies, decisions, confusions and the work in between that is often more meaningful and interesting to us in the end. The \u201cwax on, wax off\u201d of the  Karate Kid  was more important than the rush to learn Karate.\u00a0 If the process of our lives wasn\u2019t important, we wouldn\u2019t be writing and producing biographies of people and their private lives \u2014 we just wouldn\u2019t be that interested in them.

Alone and sick (thus feeling particularly so\u2026it always happens when we\u2019re not feeling well), I yearned to speak Adam more often and to ask how his day went.\u00a0 I was yearning for connection and I was also feeling guilty of not being able to take Adam back on Sunday night, when I would typically after a full weekend with his dad.\u00a0 I wished to explain this to him, but Adam does not love sticking the telephone to his ear. In fact, he is exceptionally averse to it. My mother says Adam lives in the right era with all the technology that can help him. I\u2019m not certain it is as good as we yet want it to be, but one thing\u2019s for sure \u2014 thank goodness for Skype. Skype is a recent life-saver. Adam\u2019s dad and I have begun using it often and Adam holds his attention longer than using a telephone, as the visual is easier for him to understand. I can see him and he can see me and I feel a sense of huge relief. Then I wondered if Adam did too as he had to stay two extra nights with his dad because I did not want him to catch this outrageous flu. He loves his dad, but I wondered if he had natural questions about what was happening to his routine, and his mommy. It was in Eustacia\u2019s introduction that I tried to seek solace from this weekend. She said,  \u201cI\u2019ve learned how the parents of autistic children suffer from a loss of their own sense of self. We all know that a baby needs a mother to know she\u2019s a baby, but, equally true, a mother needs a baby to know she\u2019s a mother.\u201d My friends and family, even my ex, all assure me that Adam knows I\u2019m his mother during my more vulnerable moments, like this past weekend. I asked his aide today to help him understand that Adam would have to wait one more day to see mommy\u00a0 \u2014 as I was hoping he could come home, but I am still too ill (do you understand how worried I was about this yet?). Adam texted me the following, I\u2019m fairly sure, with a few reminders from his aide: hi mommy i like mommy i like dinosaurs mommy feeling sick. Feel happy. Feel better i had chocolate after lunch bye mommy love you Adam I\u2019ll take it. Yet I wondered today if Adam really missed me. It\u2019s a natural wonder, I think. Even parents of neurotypical children might wonder the same when their children are with another parent, or with friends. We too need to receive love. We need these expressions of love that we have become so used to. Later on Skype this afternoon and evening, I had a virtual \u201cdinner\u201d with Adam, thanks to his dad who put the camera straight on him.\u00a0 After he became upset later in the evening, his dad put him in front of the camera. When he saw me, he calmed right down and smiled again. I spoke to him softly in my mother-voice, reminding him that I will see him again tomorrow. Again another smile; crying abated. That is the mother\u2019s reward \u2014 her ability to calm her child. I completely understand the angst mothers feel when they do not feel they can appease their child\u2019s pain or distress because I too have been through that. So I am elated for it\u2019s what I get \u2014 not yet the long drawn out conversations about what is happening, what may be confusing him, what he is excited about. Yet I think I can decipher it enough. We are communicating. Indeed, I need to remind myself of this in such times when I think of Adam as a person and his future, and my future as Adam\u2019s mother. \u201cThink of me as your future,\u201d  says Eustacia.  \u201cI am where you will be many years from now, when you know how it all played out, when \u2018what will be\u2019 has turned into \u2018what was,\u2019 and you will have to come to terms with it. Perhaps not in the way you thought you would, but you\u2019ll no longer feel trapped in a morass of angst and guilt. You will have resolved your child\u2019s future and your own. You\u2019ll know you\u2019ve given full measure, and the measure you\u2019re given has never been pointless.  I offer you my story as a promise of that: an overall insight to carry with you as a talisman. And I promise that, in the future, to your surprise, your dreams will have changed and changed you. I know that\u2019s not what you want. What you want is a real talisman, a magic something you think I conjured up to coax Temple into joining life, as you hope your child will. There was no magic; there was just doing the best I could. That\u2019s the point; that\u2019s the talisman.\u201d I\u2019ve understood my son. Maybe he understands me better than I can know in the obvious, typical way. For certain, love goes deeper. And it is louder than words.

{"date": "2010/03/12", "body": "I was taking a forced break this week. I contracted that nasty stomach flu last Friday and today is the first day I\u2019m feeling better. It\u2019ll knock you down off your feet if you get it.  I realized too that it was a forced break and how I push myself too hard. I had been moving and fixing this new house for a year, I\u2019m still doing it, I tried (with success) to transition Adam through a difficult time moving homes and then I suppose I should not be surprised that I got that nasty flu bug.  I got to thinking about how we push through things and quality of life. I\u2019m a real doer by nature and compulsive at that. I often put way too much on my plate until I realize I simply cannot complete all the things I set out for myself. I don\u2019t like to call it \u2018setting myself up for failure,\u2019 but rather just that I still need to learn that compulsive  doing  is perhaps a way to avoid other things (which granted, I\u2019ve been dealing with), and it\u2019s just time to slow down and catch my breath.  We do it with our children too. We can throw so many things at them and change the course too soon. We doubt their schooling, their programs and we throw, oftentimes, too much at them to see \u201cwhat will work\u201d  (to make them \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cprogress\u201d). Despite my intellectual knowing that this can create stress on children as well as adults and stress hinders any kind of progress, I\u2019ll admit that I have the same feelings as many other parents out there. Thankfully, for the most part with Adam, I\u2019ve stayed the course, that is, once we found the course that seemed right for him. Adam and I are due for a break soon \u2014 to enjoy our new house, take leisurely walks in our new neighbourhood \u2014 to learn the routes that Adam enjoys creating to soothe himself and feel at home. We need to play a board game and some more  Go Fish . We were doing nicely with that game. I helped Adam turn-take by using visual cues and the joy of this is, we are enjoying each other\u2019s company in playing it.  I am feeling better now and Adam has been smiling a lot in his new home. One of my strategies was to bring Adam home early from school with his aide and surround him with familiar people, and this helped a great deal. It took three weeks before I really saw him begin to settle in. As you may remember from previous posts, he was having severe spasms that made us very worried about him, not to mention extreme sleep difficulties. Anxiety will create sleep difficulties in anyone, not just autistic people. In order to ease his anxiety, I\u2019ve followed Adam\u2019s lead and have tried to stay on top of when he is about to become over-aroused so I can redirect him to something less upsetting. Adam is pretty good at trying to do all of this for himself, but there are simply times, as he is still a child remember, that he needs some guidance and support. It strikes me as odd that we expect our autistic children to \u201cbehave better,\u201d and do not consider the stressors in their lives with more deliberation and compassion.  It was when I wrote down many notes about Adam\u2019s behaviour during this transition, for there came a point that I didn\u2019t know what else to do,  that I not only came to see the patterns clearly, but I, as his parent, could settle down myself. My worries and expectations about Adam may have been so high, that I forgot to slow down for him too. I thought I had charted a pretty good course, but it wasn\u2019t exactly what he had needed. It was at this point I decided to bring him home early from school for two weeks and enable him to have fun in his new home. It was also at this point that we began to see positive results. Transitions are one thing \u2014 they are very difficult for all children, autistic people and especially for Adam. During these times, we have to take more time out of our \u201cregular\u201d routines to accommodate our autistic children. Sometimes we think we are doing everything we can and we can become frustrated with our efforts as parents. When we take the time to look carefully, it becomes easier to alter the accommodation to meet the person\u2019s needs. So we\u2019ve come this far, and indeed I\u2019ve learned another valuable lesson. Now\u2026.BREAK TIME! (Or maybe some  Go Fish ).

Do you think it\u2019s the lips?\u2019 \u2018Of course,\u2019 I said. That\u2019s exactly what it is!\u2019 Then he looked very grave, indeed, and said, \u2018I think you must have been giving too many kisses.\u2019 \u2018Well, I said, \u2018I did give one kiss to baby child, a little friend of mine.\u2019 \u2018Think again,\u2019 he said. \u2018Are you sure it was only one?\u2019 I thought again and said, \u2018Perhaps it was eleven times.\u2019 Then the doctor said, \u2018You must not give her any more till your lips are quite rested again.\u2019 \u2018But what am I to do?\u2019 I said, \u2018Because you see, I owe her a hundred and eighty-two more.\u2019 Then he looked so grave that tears ran down his cheeks and he said, \u2018You may send them to her in a box.\u2019 Then I remembered a little box that I once bought at Dover and thought I would someday give it to some little girl or other.

{"date": "2010/03/18", "body": "\nHeck we need to laugh. Or at least I do. In fact, I think most autism parents needs to laugh as do autistic people about autism.  I was with my friend from the National charity  Unity for Autism  today, Kathy Deschenes who, like me, completely volunteers her time to her charity. Kathy has written as of yet, an unpublished book on all the funny stories about herself and her autistic son.  Kathy is not only a dynamo in pulling people together, but her charity this year is raising money to provide mentors at York University \u2014 something that I am personally  thrilled  about. Kathy is exuberant and she has the levity that we all need when it comes to thinking about autism and raising our children. I think her book would be a boon to the existence of us all because fair laughter often takes the stigma away. When we laugh, we come closer together and laughter can dispel fear. We are talking about how her son Lee, now seventeen, had few words like my son Adam at the age of eight. Lee has been accepted to attend a college for Art and Design but wants to get into another college for computer animation.  Kathy is relaying to me over coffee how frustrated we can become as parents, thinking that our children\u2019s distress is caused by one thing (like how I\u2019m worried a marital separation may have effected Adam) and how, when our children can tell us, what we thought was the cause of stress was/is not the culprit at all. Sometimes the media images and messages about autism can get us so down that we forget that there  is  a bright future and while it may be a little different, it isn\u2019t any less hopeful or humourous than life itself.  It is a welcome message as the tendency I have is to blame myself as so many other parents do. So here is the story: Lee, at the age of 8 1/2, still with very few words was given an option for dinner one evening. Kathy said, \u201cLee, what would you like for dinner: macaroni and cheese or grilled cheese?\u201d Lee replied, \u201cPizza, pizza, PIZZA!\u201d \u201cNo Lee,\u201d she said, trying to get him back on track, \u201cyour choices are macaroni and cheese or grilled cheese.\u201d \u201cPIZZA!\u201d he replied again. A battle of wills ensued and Lee was sent to his room. Two minutes later, the doorbell rang. It was pizza delivery. How on earth did he order a pizza?  Kathy thought. How can a non verbal autistic child order a pizza?  Industrious Kathy got down to investigating. She called the pizza company. \u201cWe thought it was a little strange,\u201d they told her. \u201cBut we called back and it was the correct phone number.\u201d Kathy had not heard the telephone ring. Lee had managed to turn off all the ringers. So little Lee, now big seventeen-year-old Lee, then with very few words knew some essential scripts for ordering that pizza.  \u201cCash, yes, that will be cash.\u201d   His ability to learn scripts coupled with resourcefulness got the job done. Now that Adam is willful this story makes me relax and I can laugh a little more. Adam is at an age where he is beginning to test me. He will want things I do not want him to have.  He will do things that can really tick me off and I have had a tendency to worry too much. Instead, I should consider that he may even end up ordering his own pizza some day soon (or some other online delivery I imagine, since Adam is incredibly adept at figuring out the computer\u2026perhaps I should watch my credit card!). The moral of this story? Not only is it good to have a belly laugh at some of the antics of our children, but also, maybe both Lee and Adam will order their pizza and get to eat it too.

{"date": "2010/03/22", "body": "Adam and I have birthdays fairly close together. It\u2019s my birthday today and Adam and I spent the entire weekend celebrating.  Our first excursion was to   Canada Blooms  at Toronto\u2019s Exhibition Place. We spent about an hour-and-a-half strolling and looking at garden constructions (which I love), and Adam seemed to enjoy it too. He loved the many water features and water falls and in particular, a tunnel made out of leaves in a children\u2019s garden where little fairies were tucked into trees and other flora. Little surprises abounded like an Alice in Wonderland world \u2014 wine glasses embedded in wood logs, a tunnel made out of leaves, and other neat objects for the imagination. In our new garden at our new house, I\u2019ve tucked away similar items for Adam to find \u2014 mostly animal and Buddhas. I think I may be hiding a few more things to make it more magical. There\u2019s nothing better than watching a child intrigued and delighted by such things \u2014 simpler things that we can create rather than those we must buy. As you can see from the photos above, this was the first time that Adam ever allowed his face to be painted. He chose the \u201cred lady-bug,\u201d he said specifically.  \u201cRed.\u201d  He smiled and tilted his head a little at the tickling feeling of the paint brush against his skin. I am thinking of how crowded it was and the little guy enshrouded by taller people. I specifically remember that feeling as a child \u2014 in malls and other crowded places where adults felt like a dense jungle above and around me that eventually I\u2019d feel overheated and get a headache. While we left before it became too much for him, I\u2019d say an hour-and-a-half was a pretty good chunk of time! The following day we spent out for lunch and a walk, and finding ingredients for the recipe of (red) tomato soup he wanted to cook (he is reading a lot of cookbooks). So we made a list and went to the grocery store where I asked Adam to push the cart, and find each item on the list. He really enjoyed this even though he only spent about ten minutes with me in the kitchen because, frankly, I do not want Adam chopping onions and garlic for the handling of the kitchen knife. Instead, he got to stir the pot. Just the smile on his face from being able to do his own shopping was enough gift for me. Adam so wants to do many things and his pleasures are mine. Then, we went to Riverdale Farm to see the animals. The Clydesdale horse came to see us and the cow\u2019s face was so close Adam was enthralled. He watched it chew its cud for a long time and like watching him shop for groceries, I enjoyed watching him watch the cow. He reached out his little hand and I lifted him so he could pet the cow along its nose. He was also interested in the sheep. I reminded him of the sheep in   Babe  \u2014 the movie he watched almost every day when he was a toddler and wonder if he was thinking about them too. We walked around Riverdale and then came home to make dinner for my folks. So it has been a simple birthday for me, full of earthly delights. And as for the ladybugs, let me quote Francis in  Under the Tuscan Sun  \u2014 may there be \u201clots and lots of ladybugs\u201d in the coming year.

The early bird catches the worm indeed, but you have to be prepared to be sleepy for the rest of the day. As I turned on a movie for Adam and I to watch together, this silent caption came on the screen and he read it, fully understandable to me. Adam\u2019s speech over the past several weeks is becoming markedly clearer. Then, something suddenly went wrong with my cable box (as it has all year long \u2014 I need to write a separate post on the ABSOLUTE  RIDICULOUSNESS OF TELEVISION TECHNOLOGY AND HOW FRUSTRATED IT MAKES ME, but let me save that for another day), and then the sound went mute. \u201cOh my God!\u201d exclaimed Adam. \u201c Oh my God ,\u201d he said again like a Valley Girl. It is something that I say when I\u2019m COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS NONSENSICAL TECHNOLOGY, and my boy is listening indeed. Coming out that cherub mouth, that voice that still sounds so very tiny let alone the mouth that says so little, I am of course ecstatic and laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re right Adam,\u201d I affirmed by hugging him and scruffing up his dark blonde hair, \u201cMommy is really fed up with Rogers Cable. Just wait and I\u2019ll see if I can fix it.\u201d  I attempted changing inputs, mumbling my frustrations to myself lest Adam learn some words I\u2019d prefer he learn later on in life, checking cables and rebooting several times \u2014 all which seem smart and logical attempts at fixing the sound problem. Instead, Grandpa, who studied electrical engineering no less,  jiggled the box and  voila \u2026 the came sound back. If only I had thought of that. There is irony in this, I hope you see. Sometimes we try so hard to fix things when all it needs is a little jiggle. I have to say that this Monday morning, the day after Adam\u2019s 8th birthday and back to work and school, I am kinda floating on air. It was very apparent to me how much Adam needed me during this trip and how happy he was to see his mother happy again.  Something has shifted during the heavy period of separation and we seem to be settling in. I think it started when I created my own space, made it mine and began to live in it. I knew that fixing a house was a process of also fixing me. I had thrown every effort and last bit of energy making it Adam\u2019s and mine \u2014 a place where we could be happy again, and it saved me during this most difficult time. Yet by throwing myself into this, Adam was also needing me.  While I was still living in the matrimonial home during the process of fixing up this house,  the weight of it felt as heavy as being buried six feet under. The house I had built with my ex now came to represent loss. The foundation that had been faulty in that house and needed rebuilding, so symbolic.  So how fortunate I was to have the time to create something new for Adam and I \u2014 something now that I have come to appreciate so much.  So blessed do I feel today with spring upon us and having finally made that move so that we can move on with other things. The house has a lot of light which was important to me when I found it. I wanted Adam to feel the light and the air as well. Moving was tough, as many of you already read in previous posts. For Adam, security is found in environments. It takes him time to adjust and this was extremely difficult beginning from late last fall. Every time I thought we were over a hump, we were right back where we started with really bad-looking spasms. I did not see Adam smile very much during this period, and it made my sadness and worry ever more pressing. Despite having the house prepared, there is always more work once one moves in \u2014 things don\u2019t work properly and living in the house day and night, I began to feel how it wanted to live. The house asked me to learn all of its idiosyncrasies. It asked me to support it and work with it. It has been a couple of months now since we moved in and I believe I am getting to know her well. I think the house is certainly feminine because she is beginning to support us. In Florida I was relaxed and didn\u2019t worry about the house or anything back home as I had in the past. I had completely relished in taking Adam many places, and swimming with him every day. I noticed his great huge smile returning, the way he listened and talked to me more than ever before. It seems every year and every trip and every new experience (even after hard ones) sends us forward again. Adam wanted to be with me so much as he grabbed my hand or told me what he wanted to do, looking up at me, smiling. All he wanted was his mother back and all to himself. Going through divorce I know I had tried even harder to be present for Adam, feeling so guilty about the breakup and upsetting his life. Such contrast in my states of being seem so stark now that time has passed and I am feeling relaxed again. Returning from the airport was a little strange as this was the first time we would return from Florida to our new home and I realized it when we took the new route. I was concerned that the house would feel foreign again after nearly two years of hard labour and emotional work. Yet, when Adam ran up the stairs towards the front door, threw off his shoes and ran into the kitchen with a great big smile, that was it.  I did it , I thought.  I made this house a home.   Adam\u2019s smile and getting right back into his routines was testament to this and his being here with me upon a return was one of those markers in my life that I will never forget. It was as if he gave me further permission to relax as he stuck in his metaphorical flag in our family-room floor.  We belong here and we belong together. \n The following day I set out hurriedly to prepare a birthday party for Adam that was suitable for him \u2014 the chocolate birthday cake, the sparkler, his favorite friend and cousin, and some family. Presents came next. The boy who never understood that there were presents underneath that paper several years ago (the paper had been entertainment enough back then) has learned to open them with greater anticipation. He was happily answering questions and hanging out with people, and took his favourite friend by the hand to show him his room. When we parents checked in on them, they shut the door on us, not wanting us to disturb their playing.  Adam\u2019s happiness clearly has a direct effect on mine, and mine seems to have an effect on his. His happiness over the past twelve days has helped me and his feeling at home in his new house makes me feel as if I\u2019ve earned, and learned, something important.  Both the house and Adam pulled me out of my head during one of the toughest times of my life. Adam needed me every day and it was every morning that he got me out of bed during the first six months of my separation. Then, it was the house and a vision of Adam and I being happy together again that became a necessary obsession. Working on the house was the promise of hope. While I have not written about my situation, and my deadline for finishing my manuscript is the end of this year, I\u2019ve come to realize that even writing about writing here is a little difficult because I\u2019ve been so close to intense emotions. I\u2019m not so certain that no matter how a divorce happens, that the details matter in the end, although they make for my truth and the story itself.  A marriage is so utterly complex that it is difficult to pinpoint one exact reason for it not working, and it is simply too easy to cast blame on people. For now, that\u2019s all I say about the subject, except that like I always talk about in autism, life is supposed to be filled with challenges and joys. We so often want to avoid the things that are difficult but we forget that all of life\u2019s events are unavoidable so we might as well live them well and let them build us. For that reason that I must be an optimist by nature and I will always be a risk-taker. I will always believe in love, partnership, marriage \u2014 whatever works. I believe in it even when I have tripped and fallen on marriage before. I am still on a path on my own  and  with Adam. I am finding out where and who I am again. These are two separate things \u2014 this healing from divorce as well as raising a son with autism, yet I cannot avoid intertwining the experiences as Adam and I grow together. I do find it difficult to relate to other people who are divorced, for they do not have autistic children, and going online to talk about parenting children with autism is a little difficult when the parents are not divorced. Like my house, our lives are unique and we are growing into them every day. While I\u2019d love to find easy answers on some days, or support networks on others, they never quite hit the mark and then I realize that I am truly on my own, no matter how supportive and uplifting friends are. After all the guests left after chocolate cake on a sunny spring day, I remembered the day Adam was born and showed him a picture that sits at the entry of his bedroom with his birth announcement. His dad was equally excited the moment Adam was born and it felt a little odd that he was not with us yesterday, but I plugged on knowing that this absence is now permanent, at least for me, and our relationship as co-parents is also evolving and growing \u2014 all another step in accepting what is and what makes Adam and I a  complete  family. I let the moment pass through me thinking back to those eight years and quietly asked Adam to the wall where I could measure how tall he was. I miss the old measures in our old house where I marked the wall there beside his bathroom. I no longer have the measures when he turned two, three-years-old and so forth and something about that makes me feel a more profound loss, as simple as markings on a wall beside a bathroom may seem. So at twilight I asked Adam to stand next to the rocket-ship measure I placed on the wall beside his new bathroom. He stood against the wall and I put a book on his head to mark it right, saying very little, feeling hushed by this moment: 47 inches \nAdam, 8 years old \nApril 11, 2010. Right there, on the wall of his bedroom. Like the flag being put into the ground.

{"date": "2010/04/02", "body": "I had a very important job today. One that surpasses all administration, bills, and the like. My mandate for the day? Make Adam giggle\u2026 a LOT. I realized that he hasn\u2019t been giggling as much as he used to. Adam, who is about to turn eight, is becoming a much more serious little boy, but he is also a little boy who is experiencing so many changes. Adam is on vacation and as usual, we head to his home away from home: Miami. I haven\u2019t been away with Adam since December and we are both having a really good time. Adam looks up at me often and smiles, hugs me, grabs my leg and is a lot more verbal down here. He seems glad to be spending lots of one-on-one time with his mother who is not otherwise distracted getting our lives back on track.  I realized, while walking along the edge of the ocean hand-in-hand with a contented little boy, that in between school and programs and the big move, we have been drifting through our days trying to survive all of the changes of separation and divorce. While it\u2019s a part of living, may it only be temporary! Adam sure likes his mother happy (and so it goes, mother likes Adam happy too). Sometimes we just keep doing things day-after-day and we forget about the sun, the ocean and the importance of doing very little in order to make room for all of the possibilities. In the sea of change, we try so hard to find the lifeboat forgetting that all of this too is what life is about. Change is the only thing certain \u2014 so goes the saying. With change, opportunities.   When the sun shines and Adam smiles, there seem to be so many more of them.

{"date": "2010/04/05", "body": "A continuance of my last post  \u201cMy Very Important Job,\u201d  I want to talk about how Adam becomes very relaxed by the ocean. The sound of the waves, of course and that beautiful sunshine \u2014 everyone was out on the beach yesterday on Easter Sunday, digging in the sand and laying around like beached whales. Adam I spend our days together and I take him to restaurants and new places to explore.  I take Adam many places in order for him to become accustomed to them. He also enjoys new places especially when he\u2019s relaxed. It is my goal as Adam is able to travel \u2014 although we have had difficult moments in our eight years. Yet I\u2019d have to say that the difficult ones are rather rare, which might be why I tend to spotlight them when they occur. It\u2019s funny, really, because as I talk to other parents, it seems to me that other \u201ctypical\u201d children have had heart-wrenching tantrums. When Adam is distressed, what is heart-wrenching for me is not the \u201cbehaviour\u201d but rather the fact that he can\u2019t tell me with words what he needs. As his mother, I\u2019ve had to learn to never take Adam\u2019s movements, gestures, even types of cries for granted. They are all important pieces of information to me. The kind of transitions that have been happening such as moving into a new home during a divorced situation is not fun for any child. Adam had his moments of extreme anxiety. In fact, it went on from the late fall until late February. A long stretch like that made me wonder if I\u2019d ever see him smile again. Even though I knew it deep down in my heart, I did experience those moments of absolute panic. Being in the south with Adam reminds me how anchored he is to me; how much he needs and wants me, not to mention how much he wants to see his mother smile.  Watching how much he reciprocates, plays with me, wants to go everywhere with me, and talks (yes talks \u2014 he is very verbal down here this trip), is testament to the need for quality time spent with mom doing easy things. It\u2019s also proof to me that I have to work on my own happiness and spend time doing the things I need to do to nurture it because I am not just doing it for myself. It has taken me two years to begin to realize this. During that transition from fall to late February, there were days when he was so stressed that Adam didn\u2019t even seem like Adam anymore. If I were a parent who would use this kind of lingo (which of course many of you know I am not), it may have seemed like \u201che wasn\u2019t even in the room,\u201d (which we know that of course autistic people are aware despite what others think of their behaviour, but this seemed like the appearance of a what  Kristina Chew has coined the \u201cneurological storm,\u201d  and I like that expression very much in terms of describing what these moments are like). For others who distill autism into that robot-type of cold person, Adam may have appeared \u201cdistant\u201d \u2014 that we were \u201closing\u201d him.  He had lost all of his words, even. For Adam in particular, who is very affable and connected to people he knows well, this was a stark contrast. Yet, maybe mom was similar. Maybe it seemed like mom wasn\u2019t really in the room anymore as I was trying to find the ground beneath my feet again after separation. I wonder how I may have appeared to my son. Here, happy, relaxed and spending all of our time together, Adam has spoken the following: Scenario 1: Browsing through a  Payless  Shoe Store looking straight at us: \u201cAre you done yet?\u201d Now for a parent with a more verbal child, this might seem like a nagging comment. For a parent with a child with few phrases, we were so happy, laughing hysterically! Scenario 2: Getting ready to go but mom is trying to find her keys: \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go! Time to go, mom!!!\u201d Scenario 3: As he is doing something contentedly and I am trying to rush him out the front door: \u201cBe patient with me.\u201d Scenario 4: After swimming and tugging on a wet bathing suit: \u201cIt hurts me.\u201d There are many more phrases coming out of his mouth down here in South Florida. He is not speaking in paragraphs, but such sentences are really nice surprises that this mom obviously doesn\u2019t take for granted.  Of course, Adam also has lots of physical activity down here. For a child like Adam who always needs to move around, a full day of swimming, running on the beach, climbing and swinging at the park, and going for long walks all seem to be another key to organizing that precious neurological system of his. Mind you, I\u2019m not sure how to replicate the extent of this \u2014 the sheer quantity of exercise back in Toronto. Yet it\u2019s another clue into how Adam needs to organize his neurology and attests to the things that make him feel happy and calm.

{"date": "2010/04/13", "body": " \u201cForever can be undone in a second,\u201d says Stacy Morrison, author of     Falling Apart in One Piece: One Optimist\u2019s Journey Through The Hell of Divorce  (Simon And Schuster). Stacy is a successful editor of Redbook Magazine. She begins at \u201cthe end,\u201d she says \u2014 when her husband declares without counseling or any other clue, that \u201che\u2019s done.\u201d He leaves Stacy to piece together all the possible reasons for his leaving (over 300 of them apparently, which she has numbered), as well as the pieces of her life and very being. She is left to raise her three-year-old son Zack and learns to become a single parent, throughout trying to figure out where she belongs. Chris, her ex, hangs around a bit, although he clearly doesn\u2019t take a role in parenting in the beginning. With all of her obligations, her job, her type A personality, Stacy stumbles, crashes, falls, and then swims into new existence for as long as two-years post divorce.  She finds she does not fit into old social networks, is struggling to keep all the balls in the air, while dealing with an \u201cevil\u201d house that gushes water in the basement which she must repair before selling it post-separation. The theme of gushing water runs throughout her memoir as she finds a new home for herself and for Zack. The sound of water (and she even experiences the gush in her new apartment from a leaky toilet) haunts her in her dreams even as she has moved into her new place and it serves as a metaphor for her feeling of drowning post-divorce. \u201c I was still afraid of my not-quite-ex-husband and the way he seemed to hate me. And I still had to start over on starting over, because here I was almost two years later still stuck, still falling apart, still floundering, still drowning, goddammit. Still under water.\u201d (p.205) What was startling to me was to read how such a confident, capable woman, similar to most women I know, was so scared and disabled by having been left. It was striking because no matter how competent we believe we are, the dissolution of a relationship, especially one with a child, can be so debilitating and take years of recovery. It is endemic of our society that we think we can plan everything. It is this belief that we can actually be in control that leaves us standing dumbstruck at the aftermath, wondering why it all didn\u2019t work out. Chris, her ex, seems supportive of this book, wherein she regards his unfulfilled dreams having been one of the reasons for their divorce.  \u201cHe hated me for being capable. For dealing. For buckling down and handling the stress of life. For being someone who attracted stress into our life. For being someone who liked challenges. For being the person who would step in when he had to step out.\u201d (p. 63)  For letting Stacy write this, I give Chris so much credit and it attests to his strength. It must be difficult to read about your short-comings from your ex, your unfulfilled business dreams (which I hope have since been fulfilled). Yet, on balance, Stacy lists a multitude of her own shortcomings and she has to work through the perceptions of Chris about her as well as of herself. \u201cAt night I could feel other reasons sneaking into my head. I caught glimpses of where Chris and I didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye, the parts to me that I didn\u2019t necessarily even like myself, the instances in our marriage in which I had been selfish or mean or ungenerous, the moments when I had doubted our relationship. Maybe I was a bad person. Maybe I wasn\u2019t who I thought I was. Maybe I was unlovable.\u201d (p. 40) \u201cEvery single piece of who I thought I was was being called into question as I sifted through our shared history, looking for my answers.\u201d  Stacy talks about how he called her an \u201cunhappy person\u201d and \u201ccrazy,\u201d which seems to be, as she notes later on, Chris\u2019 issue. Yet it effects her to her very core as she tries to heal from the breakup. In one exchange, she gathers her wits and says to Chris,  \u201c\u2018I am sorry that is how you see me and how you experience me. And I know that you do. But I know in my heart that I am a generous and loving person.\u2019 It was the turning point, the moment I realized that I didn\u2019t have to meet anger with anger, that I didn\u2019t have to marinate all the terrible things he wanted me to feel\u2026.I could also see that Chris was lashing ot at me partly because leaving me hadn\u2019t cleared him of his responsibilities to me and Zack, but I knew that whatever anger he was feeling about that was for Chris to deal with on his own. In that moment of vulnerability, of being open to his anger, I sensed a strength in myself that I knew I could trust.\u201d (p. 121) Stacy shares so much of herself and of her struggle to stay afloat emotionally for herself and her son and she learns to grow into a new relationship with Chris while letting go of the dynamic they once shared. She lets go of all the \u201ccomplicated reasons a marriage starts to fray,\u201d and reflects on her friends and colleagues need for a reason \u2014  did someone have an affair? Who was at fault?   Although she was the one who \u201cwas left,\u201d she doesn\u2019t have a high opinion of how onlookers need to find reason or blame, and postulates that perhaps finding those easy reasons (at least easy in terms of logic) shields them from the many cracks in their own relationships. All one has to do is to look at Elizabeth Edwards and not feel terrible after what she has been through. The fact that a woman has to be blamed for \u201cemasculating\u201d her man if he has an affair or two is just but one example of how society wants to find a simple reason for a failed marriage. Certainly we all want to believe that we are untouchable by the possibility of breakups. We all want to believe that what happened to our friend, that politician or celebrity would never happen to us. Stacy\u2019s moral is that no life can be planned, and as a arch-planner, this was one of her lessons. She says,  \u201cLife is good. Life is hard. These two truths are unrelated\u2026Everyone has pain in their life. It counts all the same.\u201d (p. 230)  The truth is, it can happen to anyone. There don\u2019t seem to be any rules we can abide that can truly determine a successful relationship. There are too many factors in life, too many circumstances, too many turns to be able to determine a cause for either success of failure. Perhaps too, there is no such thing. Perhaps we are simply fortunate to have had a relationship at all \u2014 no matter what the duration. While she becomes successful at learning to leave Chris\u2019 opinions of her behind and leaves him to sort out his own issues, I once again applaud Chris for allowing Stacy to write this memoir so honestly. There is not a hint of self-pity in this book and for every one of her perspectives, I believe she is fair and she cites many of her own \u201cfaults.\u201d  It is simply an honest tale of how two people have grown apart and their need to find their own paths. In writing it five years post-divorce, she also calls her own situation \u201cfortunate\u201d in that she and Chris are still raising Zack together.  \u201cI think about how Chris is a much better partner now than he could ever have been if we had stayed married,\u201d she says. When reading her memoir, I think back to how excited I was to marry Adam\u2019s father and how we spent our thirteen years together as a couple and all the joyous  and  challenging days. I think about how proud I am of having had that relationship and having Adam come from it. I had always called Adam our \u201clove child,\u201d as he was conceived right after our marriage.  I remember the courting, the planning and how excited we were from all of that and how the whole family got involved and how important it was for me. It saddens me, however, that we still, in a liberal day and age when we are learning to get along in many different familial configurations, that divorce can still become so acrimonious, and how it can end so abruptly. It is devastating for so many people \u2014 family and friends combined.  While anger is natural, it is just but one stage in the process of divorce.  It was this paragraph by Stacy that I liked that I feel could help people heal better, in order to honour a partnership so significant: \u201cI believe there has to be a better, more connected, more compassionate way to help people around us honor the end of one of life\u2019s most beautiful leaps of faith.\u201d  And that is what marriage is. It is a beautiful leap of faith against all odds, and like Stacy, I\u2019m still glad I did it. By being glad, by honouring the time we spend with someone, we permit ourselves to move forward with evermore hope and joy in our lives. It seems that both Chris, Stacy and Zack have been able to do just that.

{"date": "2010/04/23", "body": "Here in Toronto, I sit on Inclusion Committees. My son has  been included in a Montessori classroom but we are going to leave after June. The school gave Adam loads of acceptance and enabled him to bring his aide, his adapted programs, his computer laptop and the like. The school was wonderful in that it was a calm environment that had concrete Montessori materials for him to use.  We had to adapt his program, ourselves, while staying within the structure of the classroom. He worked alongside the other kids and the other kids loved him. He learned how to engage with them and they learned how to engage with him. It was very important at the time we made the move to a Montessori school that Adam be with peers and be able to learn to tolerate them, the noise, and being able to play and learn with others. It was the right move for him. My wish is that schools would provide more education about people with disabilities: how to be more patient, tolerant and accommodating, and there are programs in Toronto that are attempting to achieve such goals. Last night, I attended Inclusion Awards night in Toronto and spoke briefly with  The Honourable David Onley  (Governor General of Ontario) who is himself disabled. It was a successful experience and I have to admit, we\u2019ve not had any problems with our school choices like so many other families who must endure the public school system, the IPRC process and assigned E.A\u2019s. In addition, too many \u201cspecial needs\u201d schools ironically turn down autistic children with behavioural challenges or children like Adam, who have difficulty talking. I understand that that is very difficult, heart-wrenching and it seems we sit on pins and needles waiting to see if we either get the luck of the draw or if we have to endure another heart-wrenching process as I have also been privy to it. This is the most unjust process I can think of as no child should be turned down from any school, let alone the \u201cspecial needs\u201d schools, but this is the reality right now. Here in Ontario so far, Inclusion is only as successful as the person who is leading the process within the school. A teacher is only as good who understands the child as a unique and whole human being, and is willing to go the extra mile. But for those of us who live through this daily, I\u2019m not saying anything new. Although I am thankful for our successful early years, our weekends were left struggling to find play-dates from many of these children.  Adam always gravitates to the other students with special needs anyway, so it became easier to enroll him in social programs for special needs children. It\u2019s a common story: like attracts like. We feel more comfortable with the people who may understand us and with whom we may understand, and we have to allow room for all of this in the Inclusion process. Adam\u2019s school was a brilliant jumping board for Adam to graduate to the next level, so he will be attending a school that will be able to accommodate his learning needs more appropriate to his new found curiousity. Or so I\u2019m hoping. Inclusion is nascent in the Toronto community. Still, there are attitudes to hurdle, not to mention a reluctance to invest time, money and training, perhaps because these attitudes are not really up-to-speed. If a question I received yesterday from another parent with a child with another disability was any indication  (\u201cis your son violent?\u201d ), one may begin to understand the many general assumptions that exist out in the world about autism and wonder if fear is the biggest barrier to Inclusion. I certainly don\u2019t blame anyone for asking such questions \u2014  there  are people with many challenges out there.  Adam is not violent. He is affable, social (for an autie \u2014 he just does it differently but often craves being with others even if he may engage in the \u201cAdam way\u201d), and he  wants  to learn, even if he struggles with what appears to us like distraction (or should I rephrase that and say it is also us as the parents and teachers who struggle with it because it challenges us to have to learn and see the way our children might?). Adam is talking more now and he was approved for a new device which will enable him to communicate even more. He is bright, able in so many ways. He has a handicap in a world where his  style of being  is the minority, mind you, but this doesn\u2019t stop him, or me, from moving ahead.  This is the first year I\u2019ve engaged Adam in more special needs programs \u2014 for social skills, life-skills and general leisure. He is still Included in a \u201cregular\u201d summer camp, but Adam now needs a different kind of support as he grows into the world. I am very happy for him that he will be gaining these new skills and looking forward to his ability to help others, as I believe it is crucial in life that we all find our areas in which to swagger. In fact, as I\u2019ve sat with it for a few days now, I\u2019m thrilled. I still have no doubt that he will be able to do contribute and go on to further education in his future. It\u2019s not an outrageous expectation: I\u2019m basing it on the person I see in front of me who is utterly capable and who is a privileged boy in that he is being given two healthy, willing parents who enable opportunities for him in his life. I still work in Inclusion because I want to see more opportunities for Adam by the time he reaches his twenties.  We have to work at all angles \u2014 both in Special Education and Inclusion. The trainings co-exist and are not exclusive of each other.   This lead to another thought I had this morning as I still read the many pleas for money for \u201cEarly Intervention.\u201d I wondered why, after I\u2019ve come so far in my own thinking, the term still bothers me to the extent that it does. So here\u2019s my answer: Adam doesn\u2019t need intervention. I may be lucky that Adam is an only child as I have nothing and no-one to compare him to except for my own childhood. I figure we have made our own normal. Our weekends are full \u2014 yes, we do visit friends and other children, we have programs to attend, concerts and plays to see \u2014 and yes, these have to be pre-planned (but then again, what family doesn\u2019t organize a play-date?). No, I cannot drop him off and leave him alone in someone else\u2019s house yet, but like all things Adam, he will do things his way and his own time. I could sit here and cry and bemoan that fact that he is not doing all of the \u201ctypical\u201d things other boys his age might do, or imagine that he is somehow lonelier for it. But is he? He has no siblings to compare himself to.  He is competent in our home, a burgeoning artist, musician and cook. He enjoys other children and will likely gain a long-time friend when he is ready.  Like myself as an only-child, he has learned to entertain himself or play with me or spend time with his grandparents or much older half-siblings when they return from university. For us, our normal was early engagement and we grew into acceptance. For certain when Adam was two years old, I believed all this engagement would make him more \u201cnormal,\u201d whatever that meant to me at the time. Six years later, I can see that our life  is  normal. It is normal to us and aside from our personal struggles recently with life transitions, I really love our life. I figure that one of the many gifts I might be able to give to Adam is my belief in this. All I have to do to believe it, is to let go. The idea that one has to intervene still suggests that something is wrong.  The other day, my best friend\u2019s niece was on the A&E show called Intervention. Amy suffers from aneorexia/bulimia and is in serious trouble . The family asked for the show\u2019s help in getting Amy the help she really needed. If not, Amy would die. To me, this is the seriousness of that word Intervention: it suggests that something is seriously wrong and is akin to the analogy that autism is like \u201ca fate worse than cancer.\u201d  It is not. Autism is our normal. Autism simply means that I needed to engage differently at those early stages of growth, not employ the tactics of early intervention. I wish I had had someone to tell me this when Adam was first diagnosed as it has taken me time to grow into my thoughts and words.  Adam was not ready for the forty hours of ABA that was suggested back in those days, and we all know that even with all that ABA and all those promises, our children are still autistic.  When I hear parents complain about autism ( see this blog on Kim Stagliano and her recent tirade on blaming autism for Aiden Johnson  death), I can feel myself being sucked into a vortex and I do not see how that helps us become better parents to our children. Yet I suppose if certain parents truly feel empowered by believing autism is like cancer, if that gives them some kind of hope as the walks, marathons, runs do to defeat disease, then they will work and talk hard. They will use fighting-words.  I am of the belief that by fighting, one is defeating the child, not the autism. I am of the belief that by attacking the child from every angle like a huge dose of chemo sends a message to that child with a different perspective and manner of engaging in the world, that THEY are wrong. I see autistic children as they grow older with those beliefs surrounding them, absorbing the idea that autism is a disease and that \u201cthey are more than their autism.\u201d What does that mean other than a denial that autism has truly effected the way one perceives and engages with others and the environment? Why  not  be proud of that and learn ways to take advantage of it?? I\u2019m so sad to see parents fight so hard and then become so despondent. I propose that while we are changing schools next term, that we again look at the terms we use. Had I intervened with Adam in an aggressive way, I truly believe he would have regressed into himself and perhaps with more aggressive behaviours. Instead, I propose we act gently. We have to challenge ourselves everyday with the notion that there are many kinds of normal in this world and while the world may not yet totally get it, it is through our use of terms and our actions that will enable the rest of our communities to jump aboard.  I am very uncomfortable using the term early intervention for assisting autistic children. I believe we have to work to change not only our attitudes, but our terms have to catch up.  Perhaps we can use terms such as early engagement and early promotion of the different forms of play that we can engage autistic toddlers in the same respect and presentation we promote play for typical toddlers. Of course, the earlier we can do this, the earlier parents may be able to accept their autistic toddlers, and this supports everyone.

I\u2019m too tired to write too much at the moment \u2014 the sedative was so strong I could not leave Adam\u2019s side all day \u2014 but, I do have to say that I get asked a lot of questions about autism when I go to Sick Kids. As I try to soothe my son from a stinging needle in his muscle, I get asked When was he diagnosed? \nHow did you know? \nHow did it look? \nWas he detached from you from birth? \nDid he line his toys up? Yada yada. Please don\u2019t get me wrong. I do not mind answering questions, but I also need to attend to my son. I suppose I should say I do not mind in the appropriate context.  I would rather come in and answer any question on another day rather than be asked with Adam listening as if he\u2019s not in the room. Indeed, I did mention something as politely as I could.  It\u2019s a bit of an issue for us parents and for autistic people, this having to answer all of these questions  all  of the time. Yes, I mean  every time  we step out the door. Yet others have to understand that part of our willingness to answer such questions is also an attempt to be able to move on in our lives  without  having to explain ourselves \u2014 \u201cus\u201d being parents of autistic people or autistic people themselves.   Sometimes I wonder how far we\u2019ve come in autism \u201cadvocacy\u201d  \u2014 if we are doing more harm than good. If people were not classified in the first place, if a statistical norm was never invented (indeed it was in the nineteenth century by the medical and legal communities in order to deem who might be dangerous in society \u2014 all based on possibility, not on facts\u2026read Foucault), if autism and autistic people were not as targetted in the media as \u201cabnormal,\u201d if we were truly a more accepting society of all forms of human, we might not have to live our lives constantly having to answer how we exist and how we came to be.

{"date": "2011/09/08", "body": "The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.  I heard this term used by someone today.  It is often used in ABA-speak \u2014 that  every minute of every day must be a form of \u201ctherapy\u201d for the autistic child.  Some believe this is necessary because there is a belief that autistic children are not learning unless they are doing it in a way that that we can understand\u2026measurable. This made me think of Sisyphus and the futile attempts we make in trying to normalize an autistic person. The truth is, we take comfort in measures. Yet as I wrote in my essay/presentation  The Mismeasure of Autism , we cannot hold autistic people up against the same measures as we do of people with typical people. Not all brains are wired in the same way.  For example, women have quickly discovered that when we compare ourselves to men in the workplace, or try to behave like men, we fail.  In pretending to be like men, we can undergo a great deal of stress because we are working against our nature. When we are valued for the manner in which we can accomplish the same tasks as men, but in our own way, we discover that our differences can be beneficial to the workplace. Women to men are as autistic people to neurotypical ones: different and equal. I  was reminded of the contributions of those who are different from the film titled  Journey Into Dyslexia , which profiles accomplished people with dyslexia.   The trailer can be seen by clicking here.  During the film, dyslexic individuals describe their trauma with the education system \u2014 how no one appreciated the unique wiring of their brain and tried to make the dyslexic students learn like typical ones. I was so saddened by the life-long adverse effects this had on them.  In another segment, a researcher discusses how dyslexic individuals have unique abilities and pattern recognition and explain that our world would not be the same without such thinkers. This reminded me of the research being done which shows  advanced perceptual ability in autistic individuals of all functioning levels.  It should be said that in the film about dyslexia, individuals do not  appear  disabled. In autism, this isn\u2019t always the case. While some individuals do not physically appear different, others are distiguishable by their various eye-gaze, facial expression, gait and idiosyncratic body movements (which serve most often to regulate or feel the body in space), referred to as self-stimulatory behaviour.  I thought to myself that in our (still) disabled-adverse society, it is easier to accept dyslexic people, that is, sadly easier to accept people who do not have any obvious appearance of disability. Yet, dyslexics did not always have the same recognition and status. Dyslexic students were labeled and marginalized \u2014 called stupid \u2014 and not much was expected from them in the future. Time changed that. Studies of the brain and achievements and activism by dyslexic individuals changed it too.  So I had to wonder, as I always do when I watch such movies, why it is taking so long for the autistic community to receive such recognition and access? There are scientific studies that demonstrate advanced perceptual abilities, patterning skills in autistic individuals despite the labels of \u201cfunctioning levels.\u201d There is anecdotal evidence that autistic individuals are exceptional employees \u2014 reliable, honest, able to do detailed and repetitive work, and perhaps even able to  design world-renowned facilities (think Temple Grandin).  Still, we as an autistic community (meaning parents, researchers and autistic people) tend to discount the mounting evidence. While I don\u2019t wish to go into yet another lengthy about high and low functioning labels, but I will reiterate that they are unreliable in determining intelligence levels. Not all intelligences can be measured the same way, as demonstrated by many of the neurological differences which now have labels out there. This is also explained brilliantly in the film. We can learn from our fellow disability communities. We can turn to ones, like the dyslexic community, in learning how to advocate for autistic individuals. We can definitely acknowledge that it is natural for the human speicies to have differently-wired brains and that these \u201cdifferent\u201d brains are integral to the survival of our speicies (watch the movie for an advanced argument on that point). That is the reason why the idea that \u201cevery minute should be therapy\u201d for the autistic person is a form of discrimination. Underneath the premise is the idea that autistic people need to learn and act like those who are different from them.  I cannot imagine the anguish of that experience, and every day I try to feel what Adam must have to go through and what he may come to say of it when he grows older.  Before the hyper-programmed generation (that is, my generation), we had many bored moments when our parents let us figure out what to do on our own. We stared at clouds, talked to ourselves and created laboratories out of our mother\u2019s cosmetic bottles and the contents therein. When I look back, I remember creating many imaginary worlds. Adam\u2019s chatter is considered abnormal to many behaviourists, although I\u2019ve never stopped him. I\u2019ve now learned how valuable that self-chatter is to autistic children for language acquisition.  Compare the way we let typical children play to the existence of the autistic child today. It is said that autistic children can\u2019t learn on their own, let alone imagine, without our intervention. Autistic free time is not valued.  Autistic nature is not valued. Autistic learning is not valued and the autistic person is more often than not, underestimated.  I tend to use the story of how Adam  taught himself  how to read and count in an argument such as this.  A more recent example I would use is how he has taught himself how to search for what he wants on the computer. You see, those are the things we see and measure, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to determine how he came to do it. I can\u2019t measure the exact process he went through. I can wait until he is able to explain some of it to me, unscientifically maybe, and I am certain now that he will as his verbal and typing skills catapulted again this summer along with his long days in the fresh air.  If I had turned each and every one of Adam\u2019s minutes \u2014 nay existence \u2014 into \u201ctherapy,\u201d not only would I become completely exhausted and dismayed, but I\u2019m quite certain that Adam would not be has happy and as well adjusted as any young autistic individual can wish to be.  He will have his complaints, I am certain. He is up against so much more than I have ever been. I am thankful for my attitude of late and for the balanced approach that time and experience has given us.  It is not always easy to maintain this attitude consistently in our community where autistic children are not taught to their needs or potential, let alone accepted into many schools and taught well. For many autism parents, it is the fear of the future that is the driving force behind the idea that every moment needs to be a therapeutic one. I completely understand that fear.  It is in these very moments when we need to turn to autistic adults and call upon all of our autism societies to spotlight the achievements of autistic individuals of all functioning levels, and their contributions to society.  In autism we have Temple Grandin, Vernon Smith (Nobel Prize Winner), Stephen Wiltshire, Daniel Tammet, Donna Williams, Michelle Dawson, Matt Savage, Amanda Baggs, Larry Bissonnette, and so many more autistic contributors.  In so many of their stories, we have heard how they have learned and achieved by virtue of their autistic brains and societal accommodation, not from minute-by-minute therapy.  We should do everything to celebrate the achievements of our comrades, as this will enable better services and accommodations for the next generation of autistic people to contribute. If we do not stand up for our own community, what chances will our children have to prove themselves? What chances for acceptance? Everyone has something to contribute.

{"date": "2011/11/17", "body": "I haven\u2019t written in a long time. Since we changed schools I decided to focus solely on Adam. I\u2019m also very cautious of what I write about, because while it\u2019s important for me to do this, it\u2019s important to protect Adam\u2019s dignity as he is maturing fast. We made the official switch to an ABA school.  Frankly, it was getting exhausting trying to find an inclusive school to support Adam\u2019s needs. Adam needs understanding, lots of structure, lots of practice for the work that\u2019s difficult for him, and people who greet him every day with a wide smile. I have been struggling on how to write this because I\u2019ve been so critical of ABA. I have come to peace with this decision for now. We didn\u2019t have good early experiences. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not just some ABA therapists who didn\u2019t accommodate or treat Adam with respect. Understanding autism, accommodating, accepting isn\u2019t reserved for the non ABA teacher. Maybe times are changing. Adam has Occupational Therapy equipment and goes to the gym every day at his school. He gets his sensory breaks. He uses a Vantage Lite and now the iPad \u2014 from the notebook, to text-to-speech for typing, which he is doing more independently. He also enjoys using the Vantage Lite. Adam also started using the  Vital Links headphones  which help him be able to calm his body and sit at a desk and do work. This works by choosing various MP3 music chips. He can sit and work and still hear and listen to his teachers. It\u2019s a much better option than the Ritalin we once tried in his other school \u2014 a nightmarish experience.  After June, Adam went also to a new camp. We lost our aide worker of seven years. For the first time I had to let Adam \u201cgo.\u201d I had to learn to trust that others would treat him well and I had to trust that Adam would rise to the occasion.  He did, although his new obsession with exploration and doors took over. He typed to me in the summer that \u201cdoor is a question.\u201d A question so powerful, in fact, that sometimes he seems to have little control over his insatiable curiousity. We incorporated exploration time at the end of each day, with supervision. He was still adored at his new camp as he was at his older camp. Both camps are fully inclusive. He needed a bit more support after incidents at the end of his the year at his other school.  I called the summer \u201coperation calm down\u201d as Adam was highly stressed and the door obsession began. As the summer unfolded, he calmed. By the end of it, his ability to speak reliably soared in ways we had not yet experienced. He was relaxed and happy and of course, we always try and type a little more each day at home since he got his iPad. This was the biggest change in Adam\u2019s communication \u2014 his verbal ability increased and between typed and verbal, I could trust that what he said, he meant.  Instead of echoing or saying things he learned elsewhere, Adam began telling me real things and he still does \u2014 from how he is feeling, to what happened to him, and what he does and doesn\u2019t like or want. Some days I will get an interesting full blown description of something I didn\u2019t quite ask for, with language full of imagery that I have to interpret, which gives me clues into the way Adam sees things. I have asked the school to verify things I do not know, in order to test myself as Adam\u2019s communication partner. I am always trying to ensure that I enable Adam by testing myself and watching for his cues. I am a work in progress. Adam writes emails to me every day \u2014 something I still insist as part of reciprocal communication (and a safety necessity in my view). Yesterday, he independently wrote me that his tummy was sick. I had to call the school to verify and the senior therapist ran down to check on him. \u201cIsn\u2019t this a wonderful call?\u201d  I said. Sure, my son could have been barfing, but hell, he could tell me! Adam is assertive when he can speak. I can see more clearly now that he has a fighter spirit.  Yesterday, Adam was unusually upset in his OT appointment and I had to intervene. I brought in the iPad and he typed \u201cI want dinner!\u201d As he typed, he said the sentence before he finished typing the word dinner.  When Adam is anxious, like so many autistic individuals express, it can be harder for him to access language. Sometimes it\u2019s not, so there are no clear cut \u201crules\u201d here. Yet, as soon as he was able to have access to the device to type, he immediately calmed down.  The same thing happened this morning. He was quite upset. I brought out the iPad to type on the text to speech application, which he really likes. I asked him if he was feeling tired or sick. He wrote back, \u201cNo school because I tired.\u201d He smiled because he obviously feels more empowered when he can tell me what he really wants to say. I get asked a lot from parents on how I taught Adam how to type. Believe me, I was criticized by people who believed that supported, or facilitated communication, was a hoax. I simply kept it up (I started when Adam was around four years old). Now Adam can type unsupported most of the time. My priority with his school is following up with is literacy and unsupported typing. At home, we play poetry games and type in the nuanced ways that are difficult to explain without writing it out in a longer essay or post. It is always best to see Adam and I doing this a few times to see how varied it can be. Today, I promised myself I would write again, and I\u2019m enjoying writing about Adam\u2019s writing, which is much more interesting than mine. Sometimes I feel that I am climbing a never-ending mountain when I say it is Adam\u2019s neurology, not behaviour, that make it difficult for him to communicate and do tasks consistently. So I stopped writing and talking for a while and just lived our lives. This is one of the reasons I had to take a break. I needed to be with Adam, go through all the changes, and just be. So far, I like what I see as Adam happily runs to the school door every morning.  We went through some difficult days with certain ABA therapists when Adam was a baby.  It is now, as he\u2019s older, that I see that consistent  practice is important and helpful to him, as well as a structured day that he can predict and have some control over. For Adam, I am still convinced that the early engagement was very important through a play-based method. He always had a combination of methods that are currently out there.  Being with other children was wonderful. I wish he could still be with all kinds of children, of course, especially since he typed a couple of weeks ago, \u201cI want friends.\u201d But when schools do not fully understand and accept autistic kids, I had to pull back and ask myself where Adam might be treated better. In this case, he\u2019s in a place where the staff seem open minded and we work together on planning Adam\u2019s programs and various teaching methods. Adam\u2019s extracurricular activities include now skiing, a Friendship Club, piano lessons, and an art class.  I am hopeful because I know that Adam will progress because of maturity and because of finding the environments, support and methods that best suit him, and these may or may not change. I am also hopeful for myself that be it good or bad, writing and talking about Adam in respectful ways is still very important to how I support myself as his mother. Both Adam and Estee find writing really important, and I know Adam would tell you so.  Every parent has a dream and an expectation for their children, and expectations never quite turn out how we envision. I always had a dream that Adam and I will tour around and he will be able to tell you many things on how he grew up and learned all by himself and I can talk about the journey I took to try and help him. I can imagine Adam and writing to each other, because that\u2019s what we are doing! Maybe soon I\u2019ll find the energy to show you. I believe Adam the fighter will want to show you for himself.

I\u2019ve always been a traveler, and Adam has been a traveler because of it. He has been to quite a few places for a little guy. I remember my first trip on an airplane was when I was nine years old. My grandparents took me to Germany for the first time. Adam is going to be ten this year and has been on an airplane every year since he\u2019s been a baby. I always advocate taking an autistic child places, no matter where, with readiness and preparedness. I\u2019ve always packed a special bag for Adam and I talk him through every aspect of our travel. These days I get compliments just about every flight: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a child so well-behaved.\u201d I want to laugh and announce, \u201cand he\u2019s autsitic too!\u201d  People don\u2019t expect autistic children to be well-behaved on flights.

I also know I\u2019ll miss Adam as much as he will miss me. I will send him pictures of myself as I always do, prepare a calender of days until mom is home, and talk to him once in a while. These feelings do not stop me from persuing my interests now. I know I am a full-on mom with him and doing my best. I know that it is also important to let children go to manage their own feelings. It\u2019s a good lesson to let children know they are not being abandoned \u2014 that parents can go out for dinner or on vacation, and will return. I know I have to calibrate, to have this time to do what I love as much as I try to nurture what Adam loves. For some people it might be a hobby.

I\u2019ll miss my little guy, but as in a small of resemblance to mom Rahna Reiko Rizzuto, who wrote  Hiroshima In The Morning , it is my need to fulfill the other bits of me that need filling. I really appreciated the way Rizzuto was honest. I feel the book is important in redefining what mothers are expected to do as opposed to fathers. She continues to be a good mom to her children \u2014 something the press failed to really discuss in the whirl of controversey \u2014  except that her arrangement is more like a man\u2019s. She sees her children once a week and every-other weekend. I\u2019m not at all suggesting I do not wish to be a mother by mentioning her book.  I wanted Adam so badly and I continue to want to mother him. I think her book is important for women to read, though, in making sure that we don\u2019t lose sight of ourselves. A man would not feel so guilty leaving his child for work or travel. A mother on the other hand,  feels compelled to write a blog post like this one.

{"date": "2012/06/08", "body": "It has been a busy week of winding down the school year, preparing for camp and\u2026 Adam\u2019s eldest sister is getting married on Sunday. My boy will be walking down the aisle in front of hundreds of people in a tuxedo. How do we prepare our kids for a large wedding like this, never mind one in which he will be looked at by many people? That\u2019s nerve-wracking for most of us. I don\u2019t have a formula, but can only tell you what I\u2019ve been doing. Adam and I visited the site and took pictures of it on his iPad together \u2014 from outside the building into the foyer, up the elevators \u2014 the whole part. It is a very big facility so I know he will be tempted to run to every dark nook and cranny. Using the pictures we took, which won\u2019t look at all like the facility when it\u2019s decorated, I wrote a story about the entire schedule of the event and what Adam will be doing\u2026 Adam\u2019s own little visual wedding book. I say to Adam that there will be doors and he will be okay if he doesn\u2019t go through them. For him it\u2019s a huge curiousity and an area of anxiety if he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s behind a door. Adam has been practicing walking down the aisle, and I\u2019ve tried to glean aspects of the ceremony from his dad and sister so I can prepare Adam as much as I can. Lots of visuals, including a schedule on his iPad, discussions and practice are key to making Adam not only a part of the wedding, but hopefully, in making it work for him as well. There will be a lot of waiting too. I\u2019ve had to back Adam out of some of the family photographs and arrange to accommodate him so he doesn\u2019t have to wait around for hours. It\u2019s not important to be at every scheduled photo \u2014 he could be photoshopped in, and there will be other photo opportunities. It\u2019s not important that he stay at the party, either, which will be hundreds of adults. He typically loves a good party \u2014 the flashing lights on the dance floor and he can really cut the rug. In this case, being on a Sunday night, we\u2019ll play it by ear after the ceremony. He might hang for a bit, and if he can\u2019t that\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve got someone on standby to whisk him home. A bag of food, his iPad and the things he likes will help for a while. I try not to get anxious about making it for every single part of the event.  One has to also ask what\u2019s really important with events such as these. It\u2019s important to make his sister happy and for him to participate in the way that he can. He\u2019s been asked to do it in a typical fashion, and with the help of his two brothers, I think it will work for Adam. For me, the goal is keeping Adam happy and calm for his walk down the aisle.  We can\u2019t prepare for everything, but we can prepare to a certain extent. I am excited to see Adam in his tuxedo and report back here. I am also excited that he will be a part and he will have a memory of participating in his big sister\u2019s, big wedding.

{"date": "2011/12/05", "body": "Adam and I went to see  Seussical  at  Young People\u2019s Theatre  in Toronto. Adam likes the theatre more than he does movies. I\u2019ve always refused to stay isolated and Adam doesn\u2019t like to be, either. He likes people and outings and even though we\u2019ve been through ups and downs of anxiety, we tend to overcome our obstacles \u2014 our own and the ones that seem outside of us. But as usual, I digress. Adam was his usual attentive self to the play. There were a series of questions afterwards and the theatre writes them out in the program for parents to work on at home. I also sent the questions to school today. I always wonder why there are not more field trips and plays for autistic children. Thankfully, Adam is going to the library a couple of times a week. Many people don\u2019t think autistic people understand or \u201cget it,\u201d and that taking them to a play or an outing would be a useless endeavour\u2013 one that would require too much effort, or parental fortitude and heartbreak to withstand stares. I\u2019ve never been to  Young People\u2019s Theatre  when a young person doesn\u2019t make a whoop or two. Adam\u2019s not yet a whooper, he\u2019s more of a giggler. Perhaps because I see some parents of typical children sternly turn their disturbed heads (yes, my perception and interpretation\u2026my bias), I refuse to look around. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m actually thinking to myself  hey, who\u2019s the cool kid having the really great time! Adam\u2019s eyes were glued. His grin was wide, his eyes beaming. It feels so good to watch him enjoying himself. Since he\u2019s been young, even though he has real challenges with expressive communication, he\u2019s given me fantastic glimpses into his perception and understanding. His very attention to the play was proof- positive. Today he wrote me an email (the school lets him email me). One of his teachers asked him what he did on the weekend, not knowing the play at all. Adam replied by typing \u201celephant sat egg.\u201d Horton was the guardian of the egg. He would not leave the egg or abandon the  Whos  on that little speck of dust in this mix of Dr. Seuss stories, no matter how awful and skeptcial the Wickersham brothers and other townspeople are to him. He endures the abuse, the naysayers, the people who call him a chump. I know I have to keep working with others to show how to get more typed communication out of Adam and not give up. At the same time, I\u2019m also thrilled that people are trying and doing. I know I need more patience. I worry and wonder how many hours in the day autistic kids are working on labels, mands and putting together Mr. Potato Head. Even though practice is always essential, and the goals are about attention and things other than the label or putting together a head,  the work it takes to collect the expressive communication is big and we need to focus more on exposing autistic kids to interesting material, even when we don\u2019t get immediate reward of a child\u2019s recognition. I think our kids should be asked more complicated questions and working on really interesting age appropriate material. Of course, there\u2019s also the fact that the stuff autistic kids are interested in can seem boring or useless to the rest of us. We need to learn how to nurture these interests. Also beware of objects that autistic children become attached to. Clinginess to baby books doesn\u2019t mean an autistic child doesn\u2019t want to read chapter books. I am reading  Diary of a Wimpy Kid  to Adam (he giggles), and have no idea yet what he\u2019s getting from it. Although I do know, as but one example, that when we get wild weather, he\u2019ll reach and start reading a book for teens on weather systems. The baby books are a form of familiar for Adam. He uses them to comfort himself and to create order in a world that can often be overwhelming. They don\u2019t indicate what he\u2019s also interested in, or what he\u2019s capable of. Readiness is essential but there can also be many opinions on what makes an autistic person \u201cready.\u201d Is it the ability to sit still, act normal, attend for long periods of time? If so, an autistic person may never be deemed totally \u201cready.\u201d If these are some of the prerequisites to \u201creadiness,\u201d how far held back is the autistic person who\u2019s otherwise sopping up so much in the environment? Adam got his musical notation, to his music teacher\u2019s surprise, very quickly.  Learning to \u201cattend\u201d is a social \u201cnorm\u201d imposed to people who find that really challenging. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think Adam shouldn\u2019t learn that, but it\u2019s not the only thing he needs to learn. Adam needs to learn things that interest him, and like other children, we don\u2019t know what interests our children unless they get exposed to things. His movement and activity is likely the way he learns best, and despite my repetition in life and here on the blog, he is often treated like that round peg being squeezed into a square hole, no matter what my beliefs. Help, hello. Is anyone there?  I\u2019m trying to write with the greatest of care. As I convey ideas about Adam over and over, we need to settle him down safe, on a soft bed of clover. I guess you can say I\u2019m holding on to  this  egg. ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2011/12/05/patience-with-that-egg/", "title": "Patience With That Egg"},
{"date": "2012/02/02", "body": "As I begin to come out of my jet-lagged delirium from my thirty hour flight from Sri Lanka, I can talk more about my trip. I realized that yesterday when I was answering a friend\u2019s questions about it. As I talk, the thoughts crystallize. It is only now that I\u2019m beginning to realize that I was on the other half of the world; only now that I realize how much I miss it and want to see more.  \u201cYou can do it again,\u201d said my friend, shifting her briefcase from one hand to the other at the doorway. I am sitting waiting for Adam to finish his O.T. session. She is also an occupational therapist who worked with Adam for several years, but I regard her as a friend since I\u2019ve known her for so long. I suddenly felt a quiver inside my belly, a sick feeling. I realized, as I heard Adam laughing in the next room, that I longed to go back as much as I long to hear that laughter. When I travel, I long to be back with Adam. Later at home, I found myself googling \u201cmother\u2019s guilt over taking vacations.\u201d  I\u2019m pretty good at dealing with mother-guilt, that is, I can put things in perspective. Adam\u2019s father and I discussed Adam going to Disney with him to break up the time I was going to be away. On the one hand, I was a bit sad that I wasn\u2019t able to see Adam\u2019s reactions to his first visit, yet on the other, I did not want to deprive Adam of the opportunity. I have to be honest \u2014 it, in part, appeased my guilt and anxiety over leaving him. While I was away, I was so happy to see beaming pictures of Adam there. Apparently Adam had some difficulty adjusting to the hotel room, but he loved the rides. It is but one of the issues arising from moving houses especially since the divorce \u2014 Adam\u2019s issues with his environments really started at this time. While at a place called Ulpotha in Sri Lanka, there were two European children running around. They had arrived after a visit to Israel, where their mother was from. Ulpotha is a yoga retreat in the jungle run by the villagers. The parents were hired to manage the guests for six weeks (Ulpotha is only open to the public for a small part of the year).  I watched the children play freely, despite the poisonous snakes and other creatures. They were having a ball and socialized with the guests. I had wished and wondered about whether Adam could make the trip. What would living with monkeys and villagers who take care of this self-sustaining village be able to provide for him, I thought?  I can\u2019t say that I wasn\u2019t having some \u201cthe rice patty is greener on the other side\u201d moments. What would getting away from the pressures and superficialities of Western life teach Adam? What would cultivating food and housing and belonging to a community provide for us? I kept thinking of the isolated box we live in back home, and how neighbours rarely talk to each other, and felt dismayed. What kind of community do we really have, I ask myself as an adult who in part continues to perpetuate the kind of city I live in. While we have our conveniences, I believe all of us feel this lack. I kept wondering about my own ability to live in such circumstances and felt in awe of Rupert Isaccson, the author of  Horseboy , who traveled all the way to Mongolia with his autistic son, Rowan.  I did have moments of longing for Adam more when I saw the children, as much as I knew that I deserved and needed my time away. When one of the parent\u2019s asked why I didn\u2019t bring Adam, I didn\u2019t want to get into a lengthy explanation about parent schedules or how such a short trip would make it difficult to travel with him as an autistic person. Traveling across the globe with him would require more practice on longer flights, breaking up the journey and longer stays in each location. The diet is different too, so it would take a lot of preparation.  So I guess there a are a couple of issues here: imagining some future travel with Adam in order to expand our experience, and feeling guilty or even guilty for not feeling guilty. Perhaps there are so many lessons for me to learn for myself and the way I live, and in my efforts to create a meaninful life with Adam.\n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.horseboymovie.com/Book.php"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2012/02/02/guilty-or-not-guilty-that-is-the-question/", "title": "Guilty Or Not Guilty?

{"date": "2012/05/18", "body": "This is my first IMFAR 2012 in my hometown, Toronto. Let me just say, I think that everyone who attends IMFAR should attend AUTCOM and AUTREAT and be exposed to autism conferences run by autistic people.  Temple Grandin, in receipt of her Advocate Award yesterday stated \u201cResearchers, you must do more work in sensory processing and visual thinking in order to improve our quality of life.\u201d She noted that there are already hundreds of papers on Face Recognition.  I want to extend that thought.  While we are trying to understand autism, we are not much advancing the understanding of how autistic people think and learn and how we can assist autistic people live and thrive in our society as autistic people. As I sit watching sliced brains all it up in orange, blue and yellow, I twitch. Autistic people are referred to as THE OTHER. \u201cResearch provides the foundation for reports about and representations of \u2018The Other.\u2019 In the colonial context, research becomes an objective way of representing the dark-skinned Other to the white world. Colonizing nations relied on teh human disciplines, especially sociology and anthropology, to produce knowledge about strange and foreign worlds. This close involvement with the colonial project contributed, in significant ways, to qualitative research\u2019s long and anguished history and to its becoming a dirty word.\u201d  (From:  The Landscape of Qualitative Research , Norman Denzin & Yvonne Lincoln). There are quantitative and qualitative studies here, and I\u2019m very interested in the how autistic people are  being studied . The research uses the typical population for comparative analysis. Autistic people are being measured against the typical population therefore cannot be seen as they are. All I\u2019m learning is what I\u2019ve already been told over and over again: autistic people cannot measure up in the same way and manner as typical people, and that we view typicality and normalcy as our goal. The studies here that I\u2019ve seen use groups with High Functioning Autism, a term which is highly interpretive. Let\u2019s assume, however, that this HFA group must be verbal and must be able to function fairly close to the typical population. This immediately rules out my son who is has limited verbal ability, has pronunciation differences, and some idiosyncratic language. Also, the study groups would exclude him becuase he has many neurological \u201ctics\u201d and \u201cstereotypy,\u201d and has very limited \u201ctypical social skills.\u201d As such, it would eliminate the contributions of most of the autistic population who contribute through writing, music, art and more.  What of autistic narration? How is that important and valuable instead of merely fascinating? What kinds of insights do autistic people have that some of the typical population may not? It is hard for me to find such presentations here at IMFAR. Today I did attend sessions on Brain Imaging and fMRI Cognition, Motion Perception and Function and Reward Processing. The most valuable presentations, to me, were two: Using Visual Strategies to Remember Verbal Information: An fMRI Study of Working Memory in Children with and Without Autism,  E.J. Carter, D.L. Williams, J.F. Lehman and N.J. Minshew. and, Increased Attentional Activation During Reading in ASCAn fMRI Study of Visual Language , J.R. Cooperrider, J.A. Neilsen, J.S. Anderson, A. Froehlich, M.B. Dubray, A. Cariello, A. Alexander, E.D. Bigler, N. Lange, and J.E. Lainhart. While I\u2019m uncertain of the reliability of fMRI studies, I am very interested in the results. In summary, autistic people have compensatory reading and decoding strategies. I asked the researchers if they\u2019ve ever compared the autistic population to the dyslexic one (one that I tend to do). I am often tired of the comparison of autistic individuals to the typical population as the only measure. Rather, because we know that the Dyslexic community faced many social challenges including marginalization, stigma, exclusion, and becuase it took the school systems a while to understand Dyslexia in order to teach dyslexics, how can we study and understand autistic visual perception and conceptual understanding and the way they utilize the visual in order to decode language and the verbal? I\u2019m off to the \u201cStakeholder\u2019s Luncheon\u201d now where Stephen Shore will be one of a few speakers. There are a few autistic individuals here, but nearly not enough.  How do we get these scientists at IMFAR to collaborate with autistic people more? How do we move from using autistic people as \u201csubjects\u201d to including autistic people as collaborators? We have a lot of work to do. Apologies in advance for any typos as I sit in a crowded foyer.

{"date": "2012/08/07", "body": "Adam\u2019s iPad wasn\u2019t working for a few hours over the weekend. It has been also phasing in and out \u2014 photos disappear then reappear. He uses his camera for his Pictello stories. Meet a non verbal person \u2014 autistic or otherwise, and you\u2019ll see an array of devices at their disposal. Some are more convenient to talk with, often one conks out or something happens. It\u2019s technology. We need more than a reliance on the iPad. I love the iPad. I\u2019ve been teaching Adam to read a clock on and off for a while now. A sole reliance on \u201cverbal behaviour\u201d or output is not reliable. I had asked Adam to tell me the time. Now that I have the iPad, there is a \u201cshow me 4:30,\u201d etc, and he can pick from an array of five possibilities. He gets 100%. I do, however, have to tell him to \u201cpick only one.\u201d That instruction works like a charm as he then understands that I\u2019m not asking him to fool around and listen to kurplunks of wrong answers just for the fun of it.  I work between the iPad and the \u201chard copy.\u201d The iPad and computer programs are very helpful to teach and now to refine Adam\u2019s ability to listen to the instruction. As his part-time teacher, I model the correct response for him, and this makes it easier.  I\u2019ve often noted that multiple choices are the way to go to determine his knowledge, as well as presentation.  I believe Adam has taught himself many \u201csubjects\u201d and I get this confirmation every day. Here\u2019s another example:  I used to ask Adam to do word searches with me on paper. You have to read the word and find it in a jumble of letters across, down or diagonally. Adam would seem never to be able to do it. Now on the iPad, he scans and finds the words faster than I can. I didn\u2019t know he knew how to do it and I used to think he didn\u2019t understand when it was just those paper-kind of word-searches. I also consider that having to draw a circle around a word was very challenging for him. He is still working on his fine motor control. I think about all the effort it must take to circle a word, that then that becomes enough. That action in itself distracts from the actual word search game. It\u2019s like asking a non verbal autistic child to \u201ctell time.\u201d It\u2019s just so hard to get out, then when the answer comes out, it may be incorrect. Another anechdote from the movie  The Brain: A Secret History (the title of the episode here reads \u201cThe Broken Brain\u201d so I\u2019m going to ignore the ignorance of that title for that is a social judgment of that which we still do not fully understand)  A brain injured patient is asked to show, on his fingers, what number is being shown. On his fingers, the individual answers correctly by showing four fingers. Then, he is asked to say the number he says six. It\u2019s to me, exactly the same thing that happens to an autistic individual with verbal communication challenges, well, of Adam anyway. Often he knows the right answer but he just can\u2019t say it, or it comes out as the wrong answer. I know that teaching has to be fun and interactive. I\u2019m now at a stage where I\u2019m going to have Adam tell me all about a story he has read with me. After that, I\u2019ll be working on some narration of his own. It\u2019s a process of picking up what I\u2019ve read, using what I have at our disposal, some common sense and love at watching him grow and develop. Over the course of this summer, I\u2019ve also noted that when we educate autistic children, we forego the academics for controlling the behaviour. I\u2019m starting to believe again that attention can be accomplished through active engagement, following the interests of the child, no matter how \u201codd\u201d they may seem, and building the necessary skills this way through visual suppport, parental and teacher support, love and yes, devices. Feel free to add to this list. The iPad reminded me that to rely on it alone is risky. We need the support, back-ups and a variety of presentations that help with learning and communicating.

{"date": "2012/06/12", "body": "Adam happily skipped down the aisle at his sister\u2019s wedding. He didn\u2019t sleep the night before, mind you, so I had to go with the flow. The question I asked myself was what was really important in this affair? First Adam, of course. If he were to have fallen apart that day, I would have aborted the mission. That didn\u2019t happen so my goal for him was to be calm and walk down that aisle. I was going to forget the photographs but he seemed happy enough to leave for the wedding on schedule. I made sure we arrived at the tail-end of the photographs to avoid long waits. I prepared his bag of tricks \u2014 food, fidget toys \u2013and a schedule on his iPad using the  First Then app . I used the photographs from our visit to the facility earlier in the week, and wrote sentences from the time we entered to the end of his wedding duty. I recorded my voice with the pictures, and he loved that. He reviewed it many times before we left the house.  Arriving to the photography session, there was excitement and fuss \u2014 tightening his bow tie, buttoning his jacket, and he didn\u2019t like that much. He wasn\u2019t given any processing time. Then, Adam was lugged by the hand from this photo to that. He wasn\u2019t happy with that either, but maybe there\u2019ll be a couple of decent photos. Dad walked him down the aisle for practice and I asked if he could be excused from the formal rehearsal thereafter so he could have a quiet room and a break. This was successful. He ate some food, sat on the couch and seemed very happy. I think this was his chance to process where he was and that he was finally at Serena\u2019s wedding, for he indeed said \u201cSerena, Serena\u2026\u201d followed by a giggle. Then we were asked to vacate the groomsmen\u2019s room. We walked about the facility slowly, saying hello to people coming in. We were to wait around near the room where the wedding party would gather prior to walking down the aisle. Dad came when it was time to collect Adam and I took my seat.  Finally, what felt like a mile-long aisle, Adam walked down in the hands of his two older brothers and I fought back my tears. He started to skip a bit\u2026Adam likes skipping more than walking. His brothers brought him to me and he sat down for the rest of the ceremony until the end, noshing on lollipops and a bag of grapes. He was picked up and driven home after the ceremony as I knew he would be exhausted from a sleepless night. Otherwise, he might have stayed at the party a little longer. Later that evening, I looked at my phone and read \u201cambulance.\u201d I quickly rose from my seat and called home. My parents, who took Adam after the ceremony, were with him at my home. They heard a sudden crash and went to check on Adam. He seemed okay so my father looked out the window. Their car was totaled in my driveway from an elderly man who lost control of his car (and tried to get away). I was so relieved to hear that no one was hurt, but I felt sick to my stomach that they had helped Adam out to make it possible for all the intricate wedding scheduling to happen, only to have their car wrecked. I know, it could have happened anywhere, but still. ~ The wedding is now over and after decompressing, Adam is back in school. I\u2019m going through reports as I prepare for this summer and his next school year, as I will be returning to grad school in September in Critical Disability Studies, hopefully to help Adam, and to answer the many questions and issues I raise on this blog. There are so many that I would like to make a contribution to the body of work on what kinds of help autistic people need in order to contribute to society as autistic people. I thank many autistic people for helping me with that question when I first created  The Autism Acceptance Project . These conversations happened years ago when I was seeking input from autistic adults in creating an autism organization. Many parents want to get involved and for good reason. Yet, I thought that the charity models weren\u2019t supporting autistic individuals well, and wanted to discuss this. I feel it\u2019s now time for me to go back to the drawing board and contribute to the science. ~ Adam recently had a series of standardized academic tests. The testers acknowledged in the report that these standardized tests do not accurately reflect Adam\u2019s \u201ctrue potential,\u201d and they have ordered the  Ravens  for him. Still, the report puts him in well-below average ranges. I don\u2019t think there is any typical parent, who came home with a report card without at least a B, who hasn\u2019t inherited the same feelings of what it means to be \u201csuccessful.\u201d My little guy who stims a lot, who can\u2019t sit still, was placed in a little room for three days and expected to work for two hours at a table \u2014 while some painful teeth were coming in. While the testers acknowledge the many limitations for testing autistic folk like Adam, changes have not yet been made in terms of how we evaluate the autistic population. The testers stated that there should be computerized tests and I would add, there should be a sensory room and tools such as seating pads, and even a trampoline if necessary. It was suggested that Adam have lots of breaks in school, use the iPad and computers for learning, yet the tests to determine autistic ability, intelligence, as well as areas that need to be further supported, don\u2019t yet accommodate this learning style. They noted that in some areas Adam functions at a 13-year-old level and in others (like Math) at a grade one level. When I was in the testing room with him, I also realized that the many items they were asking Adam about, have NEVER BEEN TAUGHT  to  him. How, I thought, could he answer so many questions accurately when no one has even taught him these very specific things? I realize that no matter how much I talk about this, my comments seem to fall on deaf ears.  Yet, this is an important link and a reflection of how Adam can teach himself. In this alone, we have to acknowledge an autistic learning pattern and ability to learn overall. In particular, Adam had excellent pattern recognition, and he knew sophisticated words that I know he has never been taught in school. Since he\u2019s been very little one can always catch him reading a book, although I think most people don\u2019t believe he was actually reading. When I hear on the news of an autistic person having disappeared with a description of their functioning level, it frightens and disturbs me.  I cringe when I hear that the person \u201cfunctions at a five-year-old level\u201d when they are 16. True, there is real disability here. But if I know Adam well, and I do, watch him type what he wants for a YouTube video, or something on the Internet. Listen to the teachers who also see Adam \u201cperform\u201d with 100 per cent accuracy one moment, only to unravel to \u201ca four-year-old level\u201d the next. That to me is the nature of Adam\u2019s autism. Having people understand the variances is so difficult and it\u2019s tempting to want to give up. Making sure Adam is not placed in a class where he puts the same puzzle together seems to take enormous fortitude. We have to continue to serve, to address disability not as something to be ashamed of, but respected and accommodated, while ensuring autistic people receive the education that they rightfully deserve. This has to start at understanding not only the impairments but in the pathways and methods that are successful to learning. In addition, our charities and scientists have to work harder in promoting the value of the autistic population. Without this premise, we won\u2019t be able to accomplish our important goals. Going from theory to practice takes a long time. We also have to also start in the testing room with the tools we have now.

{"date": "2012/08/13", "body": "Like many of you, I watched the closing of the Olympic ceremonies. Today\u2019s notes from the ghetto weave some thoughts about the Olympics, a book, a documentary, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  In a waiting room this past week,  Sports Illustrated  lay limp and wrinkled on the table in front of me. An title about how the games were more inclusive this year caught my eye and I read it with disappointment. There was no mention of people with mental disabilities. I didn\u2019t take the copy of the article because it wasn\u2019t mine, and now I can\u2019t find it to cite. You\u2019ll just have to take my word for it unless you can find it for me. I wanted to write a post remarking again how people with cognitive disabilities weren\u2019t visible or participating in the games. As much as I watch the Olympics, I can\u2019t help but see it as a symbol of our admiration of the able-bodied. Including some disabled people in the opening ceremonies and a Para-Olympian is supposed to change that view. The \u201cmain\u201d Olympics gets the bulk of the media attention. In talking about the Olympics, then, the media coverage is a reflection of what the consumer wants to see. I\u2019m not blaming the athletes for being able-bodied and I congratulate everyone for their remarkable achievements. I am, however, spotlighting the acceptance of exclusion. Today I also finished Melanie Panitch\u2019s  Disability, Mothers and Organization : Accidental Activists  and read about the three mothers who worked tediously to get their children out of insitutions in Canada and close them all down: Jo Dicky, Audrey Cole and Paulette Berthiaume.  I read how these women lived in a time of not only gender inequality \u2014 \u201cbusy men\u201d on boards versus women knocking door-to-door as volunteers \u2014 but also in a trail of institutions born from the eugenics movement. The first institution in Canada was the Huronia Regional Centre in Orillia, pictured above, which opened in 1876. Ironically, as I finished reading the final chapter this morning,  I tuned into the CBC documentary  The Gristle in The Stew  and listened to the stories of horrific abuse of the people who were labeled mentally \u201cretarded\u201d by professionals.  These professionals told parents to just \u201cforget about [their] children and move on.\u201d The government film  \u201cOne On Every Street\u201d  told parents that 1 in 33 children had mental retardation and described insitutions as happy places where children would be educated and rehabilitated in the name of getting them back into their communities. Not so for Paulette\u2019s son and others like him. Her son Louis lived in an institution for thirty years before she could get him out.  Audrey, Paulette and Jo were made to feel guilty for not only having disabled children, but were also pressured to put their children into institutions and be \u201cgood mothers\u201d for doing so.  Many families lived in fear of not placing their children in institutions because they did not have access to other services so they turned a blind eye to the abuse. There was no \u201cunity\u201d in their struggle, for these fearful parents criticized activists against the campaign to close institutions in Canada.   While these three mothers fought (and won) to get all people out of insitutions in the name of their children, they were excluded and marginalized as \u201cemotional\u201d and \u201ctrouble-makers\u201d along the way, often excluded from participating on major boards and committees. But they did not desist.  These three women managed to close all institutions down in Canada, and worked arduously for over twenty years to do so. They worked in 1981 to include the disabled who were then omitted from Section 15, which dealt with equality, and secured human rights for the disabled in The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They won an unprecedented $1,400,000 in personal dmages for 88 former residents of Saint-Theophile in Quebec in 1990 (pardon the omission of accents that I can\u2019t access on this blog), among many of their accomplishments. They did so as volunteers. One reviewer, Susan DeLaurier says of the book, \u201cDisability is often viewed as a narrow field of social policy, programs and services that leads to a set of parallel social arrangements that have isolated disabled people in segregated systems. By looking at the mothers of children with disabilities and their insights and researching their activism, it is hoped that disability will be viewed as a broad-based inquiry commanding social and political analysis.\u201d  A class action law suit of $3 billion for the plaintiffs incarcerated and abused in Institutions in Canada, simply for having a mental disability, will happen in September 2013. Listening  to Patricia Seth and Maria Slark, two of the plaintiffs in the documentary,  made me shudder. As a mother, I already know of gender discrimination \u2014 domestic and public as a mother of an autistic child and an activist \u2014 and there are challenges with this in helping Adam. To imagine how the \u201caccidental activists\u201d had to wait for so long to see their children free again, reminds me why I feel anxious so often. I feel I am always looking over my shoulder and can never rest where Adam is concerned. We have to respond when advocates for any \u201ctreatment\u201d or \u201ctherapy\u201d which uses the same language and logic that incarcerated innocent people just a short time ago.  In the ABA movement which started in Canada in the early 1990\u2019s many of the campaign phrases and threads of logic echo like the halls of institutions. The ABA movement was founded on the premise that autistic children would recover by age six with the treatment (and now the argument extends to older ages) and would therefore no longer require \u201cstate\u201d funding. At the time, the estimated costs of funding an individual in an institution was $85,000 a year. In 2012, I relate to the same feelings as these mothers and share their experiences even after feminism has evolved. The challenges and the way to help Adam become increasingly complex, there is resistence and fear of progress, old arguments persist and the \u201cbusy men\u201d still exist. Our situation remains fragile. Despite statutes, we have not achieved Inclusion for people with autism. Society does not see autistic or other mentally handicapped persons as truly valuable to our communities where definitions of \u201ccapacity\u201d and \u201cproductivity\u201d seem exclusive and informed by implacable economic theory. We see it at the most basic level as in extraordinary red tape in our education system and, after all, I\u2019m \u201cjust a mother.\u201d Despite detailed notes and expertise about our children, the public system will hardly pay attention to it. They prefer a report from a professional using standardized tests which is an exclusive and unjust method of testing an autistic person.  I talked about some of this in another post about the many ways we experience exclusion.  \u201cThe briefing notes by the Community Association for Community Living in 1993 noted the same: \u201cdespite the protection afforded to people with disabilities in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, many barriers to participation still exist in employment, immigration, education and the criminal justice system.\u201d (Panitch, p. 145).  There is another group who tell us to \u201cnever forget,\u201d and this same standard must be advocated for the disabled who have experienced formidable abuse in their lifetimes. When Pierre Berton reported about the abuses at the Huronia Regional Centre in Orillia (pictured above) in The Toronto Star, Berton noted that after Hitler fell, \u201cmany Germans excused themselves because they said they did not know what went on behind those walls. No one had told them. Well, you have been told about Orillia.\u201d Now I, along with others, am telling you about echoes; of the history that could repeat itself. The Olympics is just one more timely, everyday example of using people as footnotes and keeping them in the ghetto. It is time to include all the Olympic events \u2014 special, para and everything else, under one umbrella. I work for the day when I can witness Adam attaining his full citizenship rights. Audrey Cole wrote a Manifesto with her two lawyers called A Manifesto of the Canadian Association for the Mentally Retarded in 1982: \u201cThe Manifesto equated how the renewed constitution established the full autonomy of Canada within the community of nations with how the provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms introduced a new history for people with disabilities as valued, participating members of the community. It concluded cautiously: \u2018The Charter of Rights and Freedoms obviously has very important implications for Canadians who live with a mental handicap. It is not possible to determine fully what those implications might be until the provisions of the Charter are considered by the courts in the contest [sic] of real life situations.\u201d (Panitch, p. 133). Audrey Cole said in her interviews with author Melanie Panitch: \u201cOur struggle is long-standing. It will not only continue but will gain strength with every denial of a fundamental right to any person of any age with or without disabilities in this country\u2026Outrage, as you know, can be a unifying force for the achievement of social justice.\u201d (ibid, p. 69).

{"date": "2013/02/07", "body": "Today, I was informed that the name of the organization founded by myself but built with many autistic people, both verbal and non verbal, was  taken by the creator at this site here.  Ms. Zalzal, the creator of this pretty site is a web designer and built it as part of her senior exhibition project for Troy University\u2019s Design Technology Innovation Program. This site was created in October 2012. The only problem is, the name belongs to  the original Autism Acceptance Project, founded in 2005. After trying a few portals to contact the creator, Ms. Jennifer Zalzal, I heard from her this evening. Honestly, many of us were not happy with her site. At the moment I cannot link you to the home page, which I have printed and screen-shotted (it\u2019s no longer on her site), which reads: \u201cThrough my research I have come across a similar campaign with the same name as the one I am branding/promoting. The Autism Acceptance Project (TAAP). Their mission statement works to promote acceptance of and accommodations for autistic people in society. The Autism Acceptance Project will bring forth a different and positive view about autism to the public in order to create tolerance and acceptance in teh community and to empower parents and autistic people.\u201d  She then goes on to say, \u201cI think this is a wonderful statement and cause, but I would like to specify how my campaign differs to confirm my motive. My acceptance campaign is devoted to promote the acceptance and accommodations for people and parents suffering with the spectrum, similar in some ways to TAAP. The research and information I provide on my website is fully based on personal interviews with medical professionals and most importantly parents of autistic children. I want to give the viewers of my site a look at autism from behind closed doors and through the voices of those who know them best\u2026.I want to educate people on the truth of the matter.\u201d Today in an email from Ms. Zalzal to me, she stated that when she did her research she \u201cdid not come across your site.\u201d  I have been in email correspondence and am trying to explain to Ms. Zalzal why this is so problematic, and in the meantime, hope to support her in her efforts to accept autism\u2026that is, before I realized this discrepancy. Her site is ableist in nature, so we find it difficult to support her premise. Let her do so on her own platform and identity, not ours! As a critical disability scholar, I have to also be critical of our own agenda. When we wrote \u201cpositive\u201d views about autism, this was in 2005. No one was saying anything positive about autism at the time and autistic adults had started something called The Autistic Adult Picture Project in order to project the image of real autistic people and living in society. Jim Sinclair, Frank Klein, and so many others wrote seminal pieces towards autistic equality and inclusion.  Dr. Dinah Murray, autistic herself, created a video You Tube Channel called PosAutive  which accepted submissions from autistic people of positive contributions in order to upstage the miserable portrayals of autistic people that were rampant in parent autism campaigns as well as by autism societies and Autism Speaks. Let me be clear as well that although I\u2019m a non autistic parent who founded TAAP, I took a lot of critiques myself from autistic folks when I had the idea to start it. Critique is essential. It helps us to learn and grow. My commitment towards my son\u2019s inclusion and acceptance in society reminds me everyday to look deeply at issues and my own internal bias\u2019. I think it\u2019s also important to send this reminder that  many  people were working assiduously (and still do today) to counter the portrayals that were, and are, seen by autistic people as oppressive and a threat to substantive equality or equality of opportunity and well-being. These ends are not served when we speak of parent\u2019s suffering, which then leads to the discourse of burden.  These movements in the early 2000\u2019s, along with other disability rights activism, was an important shift to the view about autism acceptance, and in a minute, you\u2019ll see how Ms. Zalzal threatens to undercut it.  And this folks, is how \u201cinnocently\u201d discrimination is materialized. Surely every experience is complex, and critical disability discourse enables this conversation, but let me reiterate that positive portrayals at the time were a necessary counter-speak to the misery-speak so predominant at the time. A few years later, many more people speak to inclusion and acceptance, although we haven\u2019t yet attained it as a legal right in society.  I\u2019ve also critiqued the way notions of acceptance are interpreted, and as we see on Ms. Zalzal\u2019s version, it\u2019s not quite acceptance when the \u201ctruth\u201d as she puts it, comes from \u201cparents and medical professionals.\u201d Truth is a really sticky thing. Hang a sticky strip of truth and you\u2019ll catch a lot of  flies and they\u2019ll just die. What is truth? Whose truth? It\u2019s not a static concept! The other fundamental problem with her presentation of \u201cautism acceptance\u201d is that it excludes autistic people. Apparently, according Ms. Zalzal\u2019s preamble, parent-truth is more important truth, and autistic truth is not necessarily that important.  In a world that has worked so hard for disability rights and inclusion through various Human Rights Acts and international policy instruments, excluding autistic \u201cvoices,\u201d is a violation of these fundamental rights. But hey, people trample on them all the time, right? Does it make it right to know something exists and pretend it\u2019s not there?  When something very problematic comes up, it\u2019s important for us to talk about it.  I\u2019ve asked her to please change her brand and return the TAAP identity to us as so many autistic people worked on this not to mention the years it took! Ironically, taking identity so easily is a fitting metaphor to autistic people having their identity taken from them by people who are not autistic. This to me speaks volumes about her other site/campaign.  Also, last year our website  www.taaproject.com  was hacked (not in connection to this) so this was another blow to hear that someone just saw our name and said \u201chey I\u2019m just going to take it and make my own campaign because I think I can do this all by myself.\u201d Advocates who can endure the criticism of their good intentions have the potential to be better advocates. Many people have ideas and they think they can run their own campaigns. When they press up against resistance from the community they claim to represent, it\u2019s really important for them to listen. As one of my profs said to the class, \u201ctake it in the chin!\u201d The problem is, Ms. Zalzal\u2019s campaign rests on nothing save for her own ideas.  Excluding voices does not make for a campaign. If people wish to join campaigns or make them, there are some fundmental rules: 1. Don\u2019t take other people\u2019s intellectual property and admit your\u2019e doing it on your homepage and then write an email claiming you didn\u2019t see us in your research; \n2. Get involved with the community you are claiming acceptance for. Don\u2019t speak on their behalf; \n3. Recognize the problems of representing the medical model and parent model in a movement that has struggled with years of oppression by these very models. From a critical disability standpoint, although I do believe all voices are important, Ms. Zalzal\u2019s campaign is heavily weighted on hearing from the parents who \u201csuffer\u201d and hearing from medical professionals (in the name of \u201ctruth\u201d about autism) who we need of course, but whose history with disabled people are complicated and paternalistic. Please see my blog post yesterday. I care about parents. I really care about autistic people as I have a wonderful autistic son in my life. I live with the complexities every day and I have chosen to live with them carefully and reflexively. I have not chosen the easy path. And believe me, I\u2019ve taken it in the chin, and I\u2019m quite certain I\u2019ll have to again. I still support Ms. Zalzal in her growing process and to join the larger autism acceptance movement through various organizations and rights activists. I hope we can all encourage it.

I didn\u2019t have great internet access. I managed to rest, read a lot (Susan Sontag, Derrida, Barthes\u2026and ended my journal with Oliver Sack\u2019s own  Oaxaca Journal .). Before I left for vacation, I did a bit of writing on Sacks, and am working on the essay for publication.  The last day in Oaxaca, we wondered the markets and mingled with locals. I would have loved to have stayed longer as I wanted to engage with one man in particular begging for money with a severe disability. I wanted to talk and engage, not just hand out money and walk away. I knew our langauge differences would have been challenging. We looked at each other I stopped and said \u201cOla,\u201d and he did so in return. I would have lingered but my Spanish is terrible. Then, the Saturday crowd, market smells and heat carried us away.  When I woke up in Toronto this morning I thought of how our autism \u201ccharities\u201d need to engage in ethical discussions about how we relate to people with disabilities; how we need to do it in real time and in our discussions on websites. Autism charities are not experts in autism (I\u2019m talking more of the ones lead by non autistic people. We don\u2019t have a solid theory about what autism is, per se. I contend that it is a social construction and while we have an obligation to assist many people in a variety of ways). We should not espouse answers for autistic people without them. We have a collective responsibility to engage and to discuss the ethical implications of the Autism Genome Project, about Inclusion, rights, social justice, \u201ctreatment\u201d and education. Autism and disability charities can engage with greater ethical discussions with the disability organizations that engage in these issues. We need autism organizations to interact with them.

In the meantime, Adam and I feel co-joined. What do I mean? Well, as always I adore him. I need to put more of my own words to how I may move around him and how I see him move around me, how we can make each other happy (or sad).  I never stopped joining him, nor him, me. Is this simply a mother\u2019s love talking? The nuances of our communication \u2014 this is what I try to put words to. My language doesn\u2019t do this justice. In lay terms, we interact with our surroundings, we \u201cdance\u201d around each other in a type of language. What is language anyway? \u201cThe forest thinks in trees,\u201d I\u2019m reminded.  I\u2019m not a philosopher, yet find myself needing to enter. I\u2019m trying to resist names-of-things, for things; to reify. Adam doesn\u2019t do this. Why must I? I stand and wait in a grocery line. I hear people talking about the autism spread in  The Toronto Star  today. I haven\u2019t read it yet. I will. Like a car accident I am compelled to look. We are teaming up with China on autism science? What will genetics do to one\u2019s right to live and be? How will this shape us? \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d I hear someone say. I\u2019m not so certain it\u2019s great. Viscerally, there\u2019s something wrong. I feel it, and it\u2019s not with Adam, not with autism.  There is something amiss with how we value, who we value, who gets to value\u2026 people.  I am intrigued with Barnbaum\u2019s analysis of theory of mind theory. I am still thinking about it in creative terms \u2014 the way I feel and interact with Adam, typical English language failing me, of course. Is it possible to create a new language with my translations and his?  While the following premise rests on the theory, I feel it can be also applied in general terms. In other words, I feel that people have a right to be disabled. Everyone has a right to equal citizenship and we need to unpack how we arrive at capacity/competency citizenship-notions because at the moment, autistic people are not considered (or treated as) equal members of society: \u2026persons with autism are individuals, with personalities and preferences just as varied as those of the non-autistic population. It is a similar moral wrong\u2026 that persons with autism should be valued because they make non-autistic people better\u2026to foist a \u201ccure\u201d on a person with autism fails to recongnize him as a person in his own right, because that cure assumes that the person would be better off cured. There is no reason to assume that once theory of mind is restored that an adults with a mature set of prefences would undergo a personality shift such that he would suddenly come to enjoy the world of mentalizing. If a member of the non-autistic population were confronted with a comparable option \u2014 \u2018Let us change you fundamentally, and trust us, you will come to love your new life\u2019 \u2014 we would find this a horrific violation of that person\u2019s autonomy.

{"date": "2012/12/17", "body": "I have to tell you that I predicted the autism label would be used to describe the perpetrator Adam Lanza and the horrific shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Before I proceed, let me please contribute my heart-felt condolences to everyone who has suffered by this, and who have lost their dear loved ones. As I read through my Facebook page this evening, autistic people are frightened for themselves.  When I hear of a crime like this, I hold my breath just waiting for someone to spill out the A-word. When I go to the doctor now, he says that when my son will become an adolescent he will become violent. A doctor?! This, my dear readers, is the level of ignorance most families experience.  When we conflate violence with a type of person (race or gender) or disability is not only unethical \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous to the welfare of autistic people.  We must work to differentiate \u201cmental illness\u201d with Aspergers or autism. Even that term is riddled with blame and stigma. I guess I have to say here that any person is capable of violence. You can be neurotypical and be violent. You can be anything or anyone and be violent. Violence is not a blanket trait of autism. Our human history is laden with the criminalization and demonization of people with disabilities. When society fears something \u2013 be it environmental changes, our fears of what a fast-paced technological society is doing to humanity or now this (the increase of violence as characterizing the perpetrator as \u201cisolated\u201d)  \u2013 we point the finger at autistic people. Autism is a human construction. It is a label made by people and its definitions keep changing over time. I will soon put a couple of essays here on this blog to show how autism as a construction has evolved in the twentieth century, and how we have had autistic people in our history (other authors have also written much more about this).  From the blog Left Brain/Right Brain , I copied this comment from the  CBS story  illustrating the prejudice that abounds. I urge you to read this blog post for more information on how autistic people are being stereotyped and targeted: \u201c most people with Asperger\u2019s can function normally in society\u201d, this is a false statement! They cannot function normally! That is why they give the condition a name, as to differentiate them from the \u201cnormal\u201d and accepted social behavioral. We have a large and growing population of people with these behavioral conditions that will hinder our public and social progress. I am afraid that we will continue to see these types of violent episodes, these conditions prevent the individual from using \u201creflective thought\u201d, actions are sudden and instinctual, almost animal like. If you would like know more, go read a BOOK! don\u2019t look it up on the internet, think for your self! Again, please go to that blog and help to stand up against unethical reporting and mischaracterization of autistic people as violent people (CNN had been reporting that Lanza had Aspergers and then retracted it). I have many autistic friends and a loving child with the autism label. There are many more issues to discuss regarding gun control, the role of the media. Autistic people seem to be the moving target for everything. Please, let\u2019s stop the shooting.

{"date": "2012/09/04", "body": "It is the first day of school for just about everyone. Most discussions about autism has to do with learning and inclusion \u2014 keeping our children integrated, or keeping them home-schooled when appropriate, or even better for their needs, developing social skills, academics, life and communication skills. No matter what methodology \u2014 or school \u2014 we may consider, this question lingers\u2013what we are trying to accomplish and how is equality reflected (or not) in our school systems? I still struggle to fit it all in \u2014 a list of goals for Adam measured against the hours of the day and his own abilities, pace and interests.  \u201cFollowing Adam\u2019s lead\u201d seems like an easier solution, and the ideas of  \u201cpushing\u201d him, or any child for that matter to reach their \u201cpotential\u201d and \u201cfollowing his interests,\u201d are ideas in constant tension in the autism community. Add to that the idea of \u201cnormalizing\u201dor becoming a \u201cproductive member of society\u201d against our ideas of what productivity means for a variety of different people, and we come up with more important questions about how we should help autistic people. Some might contend that our current notion of productivity has more to do with amassing material goods than about contributing to society. Autistic education is located within our ideas, and conflicts about the idea of what we feel a school should be in this economics-as-material-consumption sense. Zander Sherman explores this and looks at the development of schools in Prussia which prepared students to become part of a strong army. He looks at testing, private schools, the military. His new book is called The  Curiosity of School: Education and the Dark Side of Enlightenment.   The Globe and Mail reviewer, Ben Levin says that Sherman\u2019s thesis seems to be a quote from Einstein that he uses at the beginning of his book, \u201cIt is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.\u201d Sherman was home-schooled himself until the age of 13 and thinks \u201cthat mass education is excessively focussed on the wrong things \u2014 compliance, a narrow curriculum, preparation to fit into a society and economy \u2014 and thereby does not give sufficient attention to real education, the pursuit of curiosity and personal challenge.\u201d (Saturday\u2019s Globe, page R15). It would be interested to review the book against others like  Elusive Justice  by Abu El-Haj and others that deal with education, equality and social justice. I have to ask, how do we nurture and promote Adam\u2019s own curiosity? Do we recognize and value it if it appears different to us? Isn\u2019t this value we attribute part of his right to be equal and different? Adam is back at school as am I.  We have always used the modes of learning that we have at our disposal, that seem to suit him best, but we have to admit our limitations in understanding our children. We try, they try, and as his mom in thinking about his whole life and the \u201cquality\u201d of it, and even how we define that, I feel it\u2019s my duty to him to ask myself the harder questions.

{"date": "2012/11/14", "body": "I just want to make a brief comment regarding The Toronto Star\u2019s reference to how iPads are changing the face (or might) of the education of individuals with the autism label. Briget Taylor was quoted as stating that the iPads could increase isolation of children with autism. I want to break that down a bit. I\u2019m not sure how that quote may have been taken down by The Star. Here are a few things off the top that jumped out at me immediately. Before I do, here\u2019s a brief background that has shaped my view. Prior to the advent of the iPad, I began teaching Adam how to type on label makers, computers and the Alphasmart Neo which is simply a lightweight qwerty board with a small screen. Teaching Adam how to type with support was difficult for all kinds of reasons (many of them motor-planning ones), but it has enabled his emerging independence. I need to keep learning how to support him and I\u2019ve been at it for a few years now. I also take the advice from others to help me and we share information. If you click on technology and communication tags on this blog, you will see some of my posts which talk about this more. It\u2019s a process. The iPad (and computers and the Internet prior to the iPad) has enabled\u201dvoice.\u201d That word is used very often because we don\u2019t have a better one as of yet. Many people see it as problematic as \u201cvoice \u201d implies capacity, intelligence and competence (and independence) coming through the verbal. The deaf community has made plenty of references to this and it is still used in Verbal Behaviour today \u2014 \u201cwe have to teach him the  power  of words,\u201d in terms of discussing ways in which to motivate autistic  people to speak (even if they cannot). So, we might want to consider this in terms of autism and social justice and human rights overall,  but this is not what today\u2019s post is going to talk about today. When thinking about the iPad and how to use it as a teaching tool, and an enabler of self-expression, how can we consider it as a supportive of autistic agency? I put that question up because I am worried it will be seen as a panacea for creating nomates, and we have so much difficulty accepting (or understanding?) human difference. The idea that the iPad will isolate autistic children as Ms. Taylor was quoted, presumes that autistic people are, or want to be, isolated. It harkens an \u201cideal\u201d way to be human  \u2014 to be an adept social (typical) communicator. It also builds upon the notion that autistic children are \u201clocked in their own world.\u201d I think we have to be very careful in talking about autistic people and locating ourselves while we do. When making statements like that we are talking from a different standpoint.  When I write about disability, I am also writing from an outsider standpoint with a view that I need to always question my own thoughts and ideas about what it means to be human. I do think teaching social skills, among other skills is important, but it\u2019s not an end in itself. We still have to address autistic difference which also can mean different ways of being social. Sometimes, Adam needs his time alone on his iPad. He needs reprieve and he is teaching himself by discovering. When he\u2019s had enough, he can also be very social, in need of people. He loves to play. Like all of us, we need down time, right? Further, autistic individuals who also use programs like Second Life, the blogs and other self-advocacy organizations to socialize. Now we are all on Facebook (okay most of us) and other social media. As autistic people have written valuable books and blogs that have helped our understanding, I would like to see schools hiring autistic people to enable education. So, I don\u2019t think the premise that autistic children will be more isolated is a reason to limit iPad use, necessarily. That premise is used by some university professors who don\u2019t want screens in their classrooms. Based on limiting screentime-arguments, how could a person with a disability who needs to use a computer be able to participate, attend university? Isn\u2019t  that  isolating? That is what concerns me with the quote as written in The Toronto Star.  Instead, how can we consider how to use the iPad to enhance learning opportunities for autistic children and further, how can we transfer the learning on the screen to learning in real time and space? Can autistic people shed some light here? What is a preferred autistic social style or \u201cspace\u201d (I assume it is varied)? I find socializing sometimes exhausting. I can imagine that for many autistic people, it can be much more difficult. Now that we have an amazing tool, we have to still do the work to learn how to teach to autistic strengths with it. We have to recognize and respect the differences. We have to be supportive and we need autistic people to help us. ~~ \n Omom22 has commented on The Star and iPads here.

{"date": "2012/11/10", "body": "The Toronto Star has dedicated a series of stories about autism. It\u2019s cheaper to hire a scientist in China \u2014 about $16,700 a year reports the Star\u2019s Tanya Talaga. Autism\u2026the \u201ccreeping, silent epidemic,\u201d (yes that language is still being used which should tell us that the reporters aren\u2019t reporting from a critical perspective), and it \u201cneeds to be cured like cancer.\u201d Bring on more puzzle-washing \u2013  Autism Speaks still runs its campaigns like the very controversial cancer charities (aka: Pink Washing). There\u2019s no mention of how the autism category keeps changing with the years and changes with society\u2019s fears and imaginings. There\u2019s no interviews with autistic individuals (yet), and noon from the disability rights movement to support autistic people. I\u2019m hoping they will come out to support us. Like our economy, we focus mapping autism genes now to China \u2014 the company BGI has apparently very big machines running twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week to break down DNA. BGI has \u201cmapped the genetic code of the giant panda, a grain of rice, a silkworm, soy, tomatoes, chickens\u2026\u201d Dog gone it, let\u2019s find the hundreds of genes to cure autism and then the economy will be well again. I mean, isn\u2019t this what it\u2019s about? It\u2019s certainly on our minds with the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d just ahead.  \u201cMost children with autism are rejected by kindergartens and schools\u2026staying home becomes the only option for a large majority of these children\u2026by leaving them on their own, these children lose all chances of developing their potential talents that they originally might have,\u201d reports Tanya from the Star. Let\u2019s break that down. Yes, access to schools is a big problem. The Supreme Court of Canada just ruled that public schools now have an obligation to accommodate to which  The Globe and Mail editors reported would \u201cbleed\u201d from other programs.  The Globe editors stated that the Supreme Court \u201coverstepped their authority,\u201d but I wonder if they would have said the same had the ruling be in favour of segregating children with special needs. After all, the Toronto District School Board just cut its special education programs and Educational Assistants as a cost-saving measure. Children with special needs are expendable. It seems children with special needs are a huge economic burden, or so think the Globe editors and a whole bunch of other people. Next, I\u2019m wondering about those talents, after all. The Star says that autistic children have \u201cpotential talents\u201d that they might \u201coriginally\u201d have. Is the writer suggesting that autistic people have talents if they were to become normalized or that autistic talents in and of themselves are not being nurtured and educated? Is the journalist accepting that autistic people have any talents or potential? If so, it would go against Globe Editor notions of talent and shall we say, productivity \u2014 so central to our epistemological understandings of shall I put it, the industrious person serving the economic well-being of the state. Finally, and I will be writing more posts in response to The Star\u2019s one-sided, unbalanced reporting so far, is this then the reason to cure autistic people; because it\u2019s hard to get into schools? This for me is the most frightening absurdity of the article. It is the notion that the blame (and we\u2019ve tried to blame mothers, and now it\u2019s the old fathers), on the individual body. The onus is on our bodies to change, not on society to change it\u2019s attitudes and systems to support autistic individuality and yes, potential \u2014 body-politics indeed. Further, the fact that we\u2019ve exported this work to China where people are worked to the bone in huge factories, does nothing to soothe me or make me happy about finding the autism genes. It points so strongly to the fact that we have exported to China the creation of the great Newgenics machine, and we do it gaily. Think of China and sex selection and then to the issues that if say, autism is found to be more common in boys than in girls, that would make sex selection likely, okay. I think that the autistic self-advocacy movement and allies have to do something much greater now . We are doing the hard work for sure, but these large spread gigantic projects without equal critical reflection makes me worried and I hope you are too. I think we have to gather to run a critical reflection campaign devoid of propoganda. We want society to not just see us and help us for who we are, but consider our rights to be who we are and to have assistance. First, we may wish to begin by using The Autism Project as a platform as the  creators  of the autism \u201cproblem,\u201d not autistic people. Autistic people and families require a set of complex supports and understandings also because not every autistic person or family is alike. I would like to ask reporters to do a finer job of doing real, even emancipatory journalism and not spectacular reporting from a neurotypcial birds-eye view in the name of selling more papers.  Upcoming in The Toronto Star\u2019s Autism focus will be topics on \u201cdiagnostic odyssey, navigating school, transition to adulthood, mothers on the spectrum, ageing with autism.\u201d We\u2019ll soon see how the stories are covered, and I\u2019m sure there will be stories that we can all relate to. I want you to watch, however, for  who  and  what  will be blamed in order to solve the autism \u201cproblem.\u201d  ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/editorials/supreme-court-ruling-on-special-education-opens-pandoras-box/article5169193/"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2012/11/10/exporting-the-autism-genome-project-to-china/", "title": "Exporting The Autism Genome Project To China"},
{"date": "2012/11/11", "body": "How can  The Toronto Star  and by many autism charities address the diverse needs and views of the autism community? My concern is that there is little (if not any) of critical disability perspectives. Typically, journalists run to autism \u201cexperts\u201d with medical backgrounds and this becomes the only lens through which we have come to understand and view autism. Autism, a classification imagined and made by humans, has become reified. This essentialist view is the most troubling for our community.  My questions of late are:  How can we facilitate a respectful discourse among autistic people with different experiences? How can we include non-autistic family members into the dialogue who are also stakeholders, but whose very involvement in autism charity (which directs research) can be considered based in positivism and reflective of an imbalance of power? In other words, concerning the latter, as non-autistic parents and medical \u201cexperts,\u201d we impose a concept of normalcy that we are discovering through autistic communication of experience that, in fact, is different from how many of us non-autistic people view things.  We (typicals) consider our viewpoint over and above the experiences of autistic people. We produce knowledge that is language-based and that is taken as more true and accurate. I\u2019m also very curious how we all appropriate such impositions upon our own identities? For instance, if you are given a narrative about yourself (autistic or not) and how you must be, do you then turn it inward (this has also been refered to as  internalized ableism or oppression )? How does this effect the questions posed here? Autism charities, researchers and news media need to consider these questions to reflect the broader autism discourse, even when many views run counter to their marketing campaigns and economic research interests (or should I say,  especially when ). By doing so, we may discover ways to better address the real needs of autisic people specifically. I\u2019d like to see autism charities take up this dialectic discourse. It doesn\u2019t have deadlines or meet fundraising goals, but this is what our community needs the most. I get concerned when autistic individuals are folded into big charities largely populated by non-autistic interests.  Feminist research has pointed to a constructive confrontation. \u201cbell hooks (1990) declares the need for \u2018meaningful contestation and constructive confrontation between different perspectives and urges the creation of safe spaces where critical dialogues can take place between individuals who have not traditionally been compelled\u2026to speak with one another.\u201d(Hess Biber, Leavy, 2007)\u2026 constructing a space that is open to dialogue across\u2026 voices are granted equal air time, we actually build community\u2026\u201d This comes from feminist research methods which has changed the way we have been able to do research. Both feminist empiricism and emancipatory methodology can provide useful examples to the way we approach autism research and community.

{"date": "2013/01/09", "body": "I\u2019ve started my next semester of my Master\u2019s studies, now taking law and cultural studies at the same time, hoping to engage the law through an arts-based approach. Sitting in class yesterday discussing various issues around pain and physiotherapy, the issue of Occupational Therapy also entered the discussion.  It started as a discussion regarding a study conducted by a person with CP about a person with CP who took a superior position over her subject and seemed to take a neo-liberal stance \u2013 the subject was not doing their exercises to mitigate/manage their pain and the implication of blame took the perspective of an obligation to become a citizen by managing oneself (arguably to become more normalized). The hidden bias was that we must look after our health for the purposes of becoming productive citizens of the state, and we are less valuable if we do not do so. There are elegant counter-arguments, namely Sunny Taylor\u2019s  The Right Not to Work , which I would encourage you to read if you have the time. I will continue to write on something I picked up from  Carol Tavris  and included in my essay  The Mismeasure of Autism  \u2013 that autistic citizens are different  and  equal. Marcia Rioux also utilizes this notion in speaking of the law for people with disabilities: \u201cIf equality depends on sameness or on being similarly situated, then the fact of difference warrants unequal treatment. A concept of equality that requires that likes be treated alike and unlikes be treated differently presumes the impartial enforcement of legal and social rights. It makes no difference to attempt to clarify what makes people equal in particular circumstances or for particular purposes. There is no prescriptive element to the principle on which governments might base their decisions about which people are to be accorded unequal treatment. The principle simply establishes the generally accepted rule of law that  procedural  fairness must be applied for law to be legitimate. Neutrality in the application of the law and the absence of different treatment are presumed to result in equality. For example, people who cannot fill out forms are deined the right to vote, while others, who can read and write, are afforded that right. The law is equally applied to all those who cannot provide the information; therefore the fact that it has a differential impact on those with intellectual disabilities is insignificant. So are extraneous causes for such lack of ability; neither the systemic, legal exclusion of those with intellectual disabilties from the regular education system nor the means of eliciting the information, which is in a mode of communication less accessible to them than to others, are taken into account in determining justified and unjustified distinctions.\u201d (Rioux, 1994). Rioux contends that the law assumes here that justice is safeguarded on this premise of sameness as it is appropriated to the notion of equality. We still tend to utilize the arguments that all humans are the \u201csame,\u201d even with their disabilities, despite the complexities and different needs among, for the purposes of this blog, autistic individuals. Which leads me to quickly elaborate on my point made in my previous posts that autism is a social construction. It is if we consider that the diagnositc criteria is created by teams of people and the notions and conceptions evolve with changes in society and over time. Arguments can be made for and against these constructions. Yet, the communities that have been created as a result of the construction have been helpful for many people. It can often help to relate to others. This collectivism, however, does not assume that all autistic people share the exact same experiences or share the same feelings about their lives, or about autism itself. What we can value is the many and varied experiences that people may share with us. This can avoide a possible damaging reification and over-generalization about autism, indviduals, experience and needs. It does not consider the complex cultural, socio-economic, gender-based and other intersections that also effect individual experience. Let me go back to the beginning of my thoughts about the CP (Cerebral Palsy) article. It was the idea of various therapies that struck me and an autistic person\u2019s right to deny treatment, and to deny being touched. I think back to when Adam was much younger \u2013 when some therapists thought to rough and tumble him would normalize him, or that touching him for therapeutic reasons was simply okay. Occupational therapists do this all the time. I never thought twice about it. I always thought that OT was helpful for Adam, and I do think it was helpful for his motor-planning and sensory needs.  It was the manner and the respect of therapists towards Adam\u2019s dignity that I continue to seek out for him. Over time, I came to ask these questions:  Is he being respected? Do people attempt to teach him on the premise of \u201cbeing less than competent\u201d than a so-called \u201cnormal\u201dpopulation? Do those who engage with him respect him in all ways or feel he must always be taught to be normal? Do we play on his terms as well as asking him to play on ours? Is the relationship reciprocal? Complicating matters regarding the autistic child is the matter of how we treat and regard children in general. Yet we all know that the fully verbal child has the ability to say no (even if not listened to) and the autistic child may say no in their behaviour, or that there may be ways of judging \u201cno\u201d if we are patient and willing to pick up the many subtle communications outside of typical langauge systems. The focus of my work continues along the different and equal premise in all forms and continues to explore emanciaptory research and participation of non-verbal autistic individuals, often deemed the least valuable and able in our society, therefore leading to continued normalization treatments, exclusion, and sadly, abuse. \u201cSetting the equality standard as an outcome measure removes the need for each disadvantaged group to demonstrate discrimination. It replaces the capacity to compete as the basis for political obligation. It takes into account the social reality of the disabled and non-disabled as well as their biological differences. And it thus makes the achievement of social justice dependent on a recognition of those differences that must be accommodated to achieve equality of well-being.\u201d (Rioux, 1994).  Now with The Autism Genome Project seeking ways to isolate and identify the autistic person in vitro, and considering the date of Rioux\u2019s article (1994), I wonder how much longer it will take for the different and equal premise to take hold in law so that autistic people can be considered valued Canadian citizens.

{"date": "2013/01/17", "body": "Listening to  CBC Radio 2  this morning is a special report on autism and work. Interviewed is  Thorkhil Sonne, Chairman of Special People Foundation.  He has built an I.T. company,  Specilaisterne  that I wrote about a few years ago which hires autistic people. Citing some of the skills that belong to some autistic people \u2013 attention to detail, pattern-recognition skills and honesty \u2013 Sonne makes a great case for why he only hires autistic people.  It is no wonder that we must think about creating jobs for autistic people. In reality, we live in a labour market economy where making a living is a necessity and independence is highly valued. Yet, there could be some future challenges that we need to address when creating such opportunities lest we harken back to the Poor Laws and work houses for the disabled that have lead to sheltered workshops that still exist in Canada today where a \u201cworker,\u201d is paid thirty cents an hour. We are talking true sweatshops that are in operation right now in Canada. Sonne seeks to better that but there are still issues that we as a community must continue to discuss. That we live in a market-economy in the first place will challenge the equity notions that I posit. First off, let us not reify autism and its skills. Autistic people have a variety of skills that are indeed useful in market economy as Sonne mentions. My concern however, is that the general population will now view ALL autistic peoples being the same.  All  autistic people are \u201clove computers, are good at detail and are honest.\u201d  Such overgeneralizations can serve to further discriminate against individuals with autism.While applaud these needed efforts to provide equal pay for equal work, this does not preclude further discussions about our socially-constructed ideas regarding autism and people. Many good folks are working hard to provide opportunities for autistc individuals. We must support these efforts while at the same time, bring these issues that  continue to this day, to light. Autistic individuals are at risk of abuse in the workplace. Notions about perserverence where \u201ctypical people\u201d don\u2019t have the same attention, risks overworking the autistic individual  (I\u2019m thinking of Chinese workers here and crazy  hours, choking on their own \u201cproduction\u201d). Perhaps we have to discuss that many autistic people tend to be sequestered and over-prompted from the time they are children and learn to comply with ABA therapy. Compliance may extend to the workplace where an employer may expect a certain way of working and attention and the autistic individual may not, by virtue of challenged social interaction skills, know how to negotiate. Perhaps this is one area teachers can look towards \u2013 self-empowerment and esteem building opportunities for children as we do for the typical population. We must discuss supported decision-making and other aides and guardians to attend to the needs and desires of people with autism. If we are not willing to finance these supports and allow aide workers in the workplace or at schools, colleges and universities, we are further disabling environments for people with autism. We have to continue working for equity. While we must keep moving forward, we have to ensure safe-guards are in place and that autistic people are not all expected to be I.T. workers. What oher kinds of work might individuals in our community want? What is \u201ccontribution to society?\u201d There are many ways, shapes and forms of contribution that must be considered, valued and supported.

{"date": "2012/10/07", "body": "\u201cThe voice of disabled people should be present in both disability studies and applied approaches to disabled people, but the voice should take different form in each. The influence and direction of disabled people should permeate the applied fields. If rehabilitation professionals really believe in self-determination for disabled people, they should practice what they teach by adhering to an active affirmitive action program in their own departments; by adopting the books and essays of disabled people into their curricula; and by demanding that disabled people have an active voice in conference planning and on the platform at conferences. In the liberal-arts active voice, the creative voice, the narrative, can be articulated in the humanities, and in qualitative and intepretative research in the social sciences.\u201d \u2014 Simi Linton,  Disability Studies/Not Disability Studies , (p. 141-142). I would like to  very  briefly discuss the current qualifications of becoming a Board Certified Behavioural Analysis \u2013 the practitioners of the most popular therapy for autistic children in Canada which is Applied Behavioural Analysis. It is an excellent topic for further discussions and research into clincial and educational rehabilitation in the field of autism in Canada which support a medico-pedgogical approach that has become problematic for autistic agency. This from  The Insitute for Applied Behavioural Analysis : DEGREE VERIFICATION: ALL applicants for eligibility to sit for the examination for Board Certified Behavior Analyst MUST attach documentation that they have a graduate level degree (master\u2019s or doctorate level) in behaviour analysis or a related field, as recommended by  ONTABA .    An example reading list which is telling of the area of focus is here. Here is a description of ABA from  ABA International Org:   As in other experimental sciences, research is usually classified as basic or applied. In behavior analysis, basic research attempts to identify principles underlying behavior change. For example, basic research may attempt to improve our understanding of reinforcement or shaping. \n Applied research attempts to identify effective ways of dealing with behavior problems in schools, clinics, workplaces, and other settings. Recently, I had a private discussion with someone who is to become a Board Certified Behavioural Analysis who has a personal interest in critical theory and interpretations of disability. This person was having some major difficulty with the attitudes and procedures surrounding the approach and decided to take the interests further. There are a few people in ABA who have endeavoured to study critical interpretations of disability studies for similar reasons. While this individual remains a practitioner, it was conveyed to me that allegedly, a Master\u2019s degree in  Critical  Disability Studies (or I gather any Liberal Arts studies) will no longer be accepted. (Note that CDS falls under the Faculty of Health at York University, but is a multidiscplinary area of study). Rather degrees in support of the pshyc-sciences are necessary for becoming a BCBA (as they are for other rehabilitative professions). I think it would be an important research direction for someone to examine this further, and to invite those within the field to engage in discussions why a critical study of disability is important to the field of autism education and inclusion and social equity in the same way Simi Linton discusses in the quote I began with in this post. The criteria for acquiring a BCBA certification is a Masters degree. However, the BCBA programs now direct it\u2019s applicants seemingly away from Critical Disability Studies towards  \u201cApplied Disability Studies\u201d in some academic institutions like  Brock University .  Linton\u2019s article is titled  Critical Disability Studies/Not Disability Studies  to highlight areas of difference between the clinical practice/approaches between one where the voices of the disabled are included, not objectified. In thinking about inclusion in making clinical practice better, she says, \u201cfeminist scholarship has also turned the entire academic curriculum inside out to reveal the epistemological consequences of the androcentric biases in the knowledge base\u201d (p. 142). She also highlights the objectification of disabled people through the sciences and that it \u201ccan be redressed by developing scholarship from the position of the disabled subject; by developing alternative methodologies to the empiricist approaches that have dominated the study of disability; by developing an active voice in the humanities; and by breaking down stereotypes through the analysis of metaphors, images, and all representations of disability in the academic and popular cultures.\u201d (ibid). Do ABA practices continue to perpetuate bio-determinist views; to \u201cexplain human behaviour and achievement in terms of biology?\u201d (ibid). While I would argue  that yes it does, I would also like to suggest ways and open up the discussion with clinical practitioners to not simply objectify the literature, performances, art, and other contributions for  analysis , but to consider ways of including both critical interpretations and the inclusion of autistic people as part of our learning and practice, and in shaping the practices that have been so often used  on  people with autism. I agree with Linton that there are many people in clinical fields working for political change for the disabled, but as she importantly notes, it\u2019s not because of the knowledge acquired from the applied sciences, but from a \u201cpersonal and moral commitment to improve the lives of disabled people.\u201d (p.148). Futher consideration into multidisciplinary curricula in the area of clinical practice should be discussed. Including autistic people and work is a way towards creating supports that could lead to more effective and supportive methods that also acknowledge autistic challenges, strengths, and inherent civil rights. \n Reference: Linton, Simi. \u201cDisability Studies/Not Disability Studies\u201d in  Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity , pp. 132-156, 1998, New York University Press.

Here\u2019s a thought on the NRA and their blaming (and stigmatizing) of people with \u201cmental illness\u201d (the term in and of itself is problematic).  I strongly urge you (and applaud) Paul Applebaum\u2019s response (he is from Columbia U).  A psychiartrist himself, he notes that statistically, people with mental health issues are not inclined to violence. Yet, society seeks someone or something to blame and the NRA is leading the way.  On with my thought. If you have registered your child in autism services (think Adam Lanzer as I continue to write and that violence just a few weeks ago was blamed on autism) your child is on the state roster. If groups like the NRA succeed in having outside \u201cexperts,\u201d who are never experts really, report to the state who is at risk of enacting violence, lots of bad things can happen to your child or adult family member with autism, as well as you as a parent. This is the complex situation with needing support for enablement versus how government support can turn against us. Now on to more stigma and Margaret Wente of the  Globe & Mail . First, why does she still have a job? On the cover of Globe T.O today is Chris Spence, the director of the Toronto District Board of Education who plagarized his speech. He was fired. Margaret Wente, also found out for plagarism, still has her opinion column job at The Globe. How do other hard-working journalists feel about her cheating? I for one have had enough of her naivete. She has written one too many comments on autism today in her foolish column on  The Awful Truth About Being Single , mentioning that the only people who don\u2019t mind being alone are autistic and asexual people. Another Wente blunder, not to mention a discriminatory remark that can further isolate people with autism who want to be social but find doing so with typical individuals often difficult. I think it\u2019s time Ms. Wente get an education on disability rights and meets a lot of autistic people before she continues to write about things she doesn\u2019t know anything about. To end my little post today is a quote from the Court in the  Granovsky decision: \u201cExclusion and margainalization are generally not created by the invidiual with disabilities but are created by the economic and social environment and unfortunately, by the state itself.\u201d (From Ena Chadha\u2019s \u201cThe Social Phenomena of Handicapping\u201d in Elizabeth Sheey\u2019s  Adding Feminism to the Law: The Contributions to Justice, Claire L\u2019Heureux Dube , Toronto: Irwin Law, 2004) ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2013/01/18/gun-violence-mental-illness/", "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/the-awful-truth-about-being-single/article7536781/", "http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jwl/summary/v017/17.1sampson.html"], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2013/01/19/gun-violence-mental-health-stigma-blame-and-the-state/", "title": "The NRA, Mental Health Stigma, Blame, Services and the State"},
{"date": "2012/10/06", "body": "Is there a place for the disabled in society? The purpose of the title is from historical readings that the disabled in history were displaced and living on the margins of society. Who were considered/are considered valued members of society?  Socities have been obsessed with placing the disabled into a variety of contexts that justifies human existence, or fears (demons, monsters, mad, deviants) making the normal the privileged members. Without a comparative measure, as it were, what would we humans deem ourselves to be?  I have a series of questions that I\u2019ll be considering (probably for a lifetime). Feel free to try and contribute thoughts in the comment box. Pro/claiming Autistic Identity: Is claiming biological identify leading to another possible eugenics movement? Is there a danger to biological self-identification? How important are self-identification and self-advocacy and pride-movements?  Are pride movements perpetuating the dis/abled dichotomies that already oppress? Do you think they have a positive purpose? Should there be a point at which we stop advancing pride movements, in other words, move beyond them? When is a good time to do so? How important is the label autism to accommodation if autism is a social construct? (It is). Where \u201cspecial\u201d and enforcing \u201cinclusion\u201d have already proved challenging, maybe even impossible thus far, is it so because we continue to place the disabled out of the confines of the norm. In other words, are we continuing to perpetuate a false dichotomy that does little to value and serve, but more to segregate and isolate? By wanting inclusion, we are saying we are excluded? Does this stance further the goal itself, or not any longer? Who Gets To Produce Knowledge About Autism? The DSMV, behavioural analysis and observation, and the categorization of people.  Who gets to diagnose whom? Who gets to produce knowledge and categories about autism? In the past, and to a large extent today, it is non-autistic or \u201cnormal\u201d people and we now witness a gradual inclusion of disabled \u201cvoices\u201d to this mix. Do disabled individuals appropriate notions of impairment and abnormality enforced by long-held categories made originally by people who have not had disabilities? After all, autistic people are still largely tokenized minorities among autism charities, autism committees, and as participants in autism research studies. Accommodation and Acceptance: To what extent is the citing of needs/impairments an important part (or not) of acknowledging that we are all part of the abled-disabled continuum, which herein, I have already parsed?  Do you think the term autism and/or disability will exist one hundred years from now? Or are we a society that simply wears the same dress, just in different colours?  Have we learned anything from autistic self-advocates that assist us to simply accept autistic individuals and value the right of all people to exist, be educated, and be valued, no matter what level of disability, in society? Utopias and ideals have perpetuated individual and societal notions about what we should be \u2013 what we are versus what we aspire to be. To what extent may this continue to be a driving force (as in survivial of the fittest) under an capitalist/economic lens, and where are we now with this \u201cforce\u201d in viewing the disabled as part of this? As disability has always been a part of human existence, despite eugenics movement\u2019s attempts at normalizing society and eradicating \u201cdeviant\u201d people from the norms, how far have we come to accepting, embracing and valuing human difference? After all, while the eugenicists caused great harm to many people, and have continued to do so as a legacy, they didn\u2019t succeed in eradicating human difference.* Reference: *In reference to the eugenics movement from Davis, \u201cConstructing Normalcy\u201d in  Enforcing Normalcy: Disability Deafness and the Body , pp. 23-49, 1995: \u201cThe conflation of disability with depravity itself expressed itself in the formulation \u2018defective class.\u2019 As the president of the University of Wisconsin declared after World War One, \u2018we know enough about eugenics so that if the knowledge were applied, the defective classes would disappear within a generation.\u2019 At it must be reiterated that the eugenics movement was not stocked with eccentrics\u2026Rockefeller, Churchill, Roosevelt, H.G.

{"date": "2013/01/23", "body": "I have an autistic son who is bright and who requires many accommodations in order to fulfill his Canadian right to an education. At my university, the concept of independence and work overrides the need some accommodations that are required for many disabled individuals. Drawing on my graduate student  experience, where we share ideas in class discourse, where we write in dialogue with ideas expressed in other articles, it becomes immediately apparent that none of our work is truly original. Ideas are collaborative. I help my colleagues figure out things and they help me. I\u2019ve never been happier.  The  Canadian Human Rights Commission  invokes the  duty to accommodate  concept: The duty to accommodate refers to the obligation of an employer or service provider to take measures to eliminate disadvantages to employees, prospective employees or clients that result from a rule, practice or physical barrier that has or may have an adverse impact on individuals or groups protected under the  Canadian Human Rights Act  or identified as a designated group under the  Employment Equity Act . In employment, the duty to accommodate means the employer must implement whatever measures necessary to allow its employees to work to the best of their ability. In the provision of services, the provider must implement whatever measures necessary to allow clients to access its services. Unions are also obligated to facilitate the accommodation of the needs of their members by not impeding the reasonable efforts of the employer to accommodate an employee. The duty to accommodate recognizes that true equality means respecting people\u2019s different needs. Needs that must be accommodated could be related to a person\u2019s gender, age, disability, family or marital status, ethnic or cultural origin, religion or any of the other human attributes identified in the two federal acts.  (From Canadian Human Rights Commission website). It takes work to express how a human aide worker is a necessary accommodation for many people, and for the purposes of this blog, autistic people. What can an aide worker enable, in this case higher education? S/he can help take notes, rearrange assignments in tandem with a professor to enable the student to create work and respond to it, assist walking to and from various locations (I am thinking of a few people I know who are scholars and who require such assistance), organize deadlines and assist with a confusing array of university deadlines and procedures. I myself need lots of help with this. Yet, there is a perpetuating myth that I am an independent scholar; that somehow I exist in a vacuum and am able to navigate all on my own. I can tell you that this is surely not the case and thank goodness it is not. In my Critical Disability Studies classrooms, I share and gain knowledge and insight from people who are blind, autistic and who are deaf. We have note-takers in our classrooms, guide dogs, wheelchairs and ASL interpreters. As I consider the latter, it seems reasonable, in the duty to accommodate notion and the \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d notion in the  Ontario Human Rights Code , that human aide workers also be permitted in classrooms. Yet, Ashif Jaffer was not permitted to stay at York University (see J affer v. York) .  He is now at Ryerson. At no point in time, reports his mother, did she ever imagine Ashif unable to attend university. I have always felt the same about my son Adam. I do not think that human development is linear as a result of having him in my life and meeting all the people I\u2019ve met. I myself am not a linear learner and I don\u2019t do well with age-imposed deadlines (eg.; one must achieve X by age Y).  I am attending grad school later in life. Are we not the result of a post-industrial era? Must we leave school and get a job at eighteen? Of course not. We know that this has changed.  I urge you to watch the BBC report of Ashif Jaffer and his work at Ryerson here.  In so watching, I hope you spend the time to think about, and perhaps if you have the time, to enter into a dialogue here about what \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d means to you? Would you share your thoughts with me and with others in order to help? What are your visions for your \u201cseverely autistic\u201d or what-ever label you might have, child?  I also do not wish to suggest that college or university is the holy grail of human achievement. This would of course perpetuate the notion that all people must achieve (in the same fashion) it to be valued. This would contradict the achievements made by the  Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and the  Human Rights Commission  and substantive equity. We do not wish to lose the gains we try to make by suggesting that all people must be the same. Rather, what might we achieve in our quest for such accommodations (think also of our public school system) on the different and equal premise. For this, also see the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s recent decision  Moore v. British Columbia . I look forward to sharing more with you, and you with me, on our work to get people with autism the education and inclusion they so deserve.

Those in the videos, they claim, aren\u2019t autistic at all. They are fakers. They don\u2019t have it as bad.  There are people who continue to parse hierarchies of suffering in order to make a case that they are more right and the rest are wrong. Those who claim priviledge of declaring a \u201ctruth\u201d or \u201creality\u201d should be approached with caution.  To that end, I invite you to consider what makes a social movement? What makes a culture? If shared experience, arts, space, embodiment, to name a few attributes we might use to describe them, then I think the continued affirmation of autistic existence that has created a neurodiverse culture or movement (that is the label as it stands today anyway, so let\u2019s go with it) can expand our understanding of human difference and the challenges that many of us, or our loved ones, face.  We are all on the ability-disability continuum by viture of life, ageing.  While I do not claim to share the exact embodiment and experience of my son, I  share the effects of his disablement in society every day. Considering the personal and shared experience of disability might be a way that we can forge empathy, sensitivity and new understandings. We have so much to share and discuss and there are many serious issues facing us. I introduce (to those who haven\u2019t discovered them yet) two new autistic self-advocacy organizations (this first one is a project OF The Autistic Self Advocacy Network),  The Loud Hands Project, and Autistic Intelligence Org, a mix of autistic self advocates and allies. Also check out the  Autistic Passing Project I\u2019m enthusiastic also about the age group of some of the new autistic self advocacy orgs, projects and blogs that are sprouting into public view. It\u2019s not going to be easy. Autism organizations have racked up a questionable history, and there are many issues that we need to trouble and talk a lot about. Claiming identity and being proud of it is something personal as well as communal. Self identity and embodiment is also shaped by challenges, pain and even suffering \u2014 within the body and outside of it by the barriers we claim to belong to social construction. Organizing can be a way to welcome more people into the discourse. Embracing all of the aspects of being disabled or impaired is a way to be inclusive of everyone who has a stake in this.   I think all of us should encourage and support the efforts by autistic people. Projects help us to work out the way we think and feel about our situation as well as working for needed supports and asserting rights. If we are to critique them, let\u2019s do so with respect. I think the purpose of self-advocacy movements has been largely misconstrued (or not even understood in a culture that both raises money for curing just about everything and proclaims that other bodies outside of their familiar own are \u201ctragic\u201d). We need to work on improving our efforts at enabling respect for all human life without demeaning or belittling an assertion of an autsitic identity (if one chooses to self-identify as such) or reinforcing the power structures that have oppressed disabled people for hundreds of years.

{"date": "2012/09/10", "body": "We are The Adam Family. As we grow into our lives with autism, it becomes increasingly difficult to see the \u201cnormal\u201d world as the actual opposite of what it purports to be by that label. The more on the margins of society we seem sit, the more absurd \u201cthe rules\u201d seem to be. In thinking more about Inclusion and The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, I realized that the idea of Adam having his own family, therefore, is not a sight-out-of-reach. It is a possibility, his choice, and right which must be enabled and protected. How, on earth, if you are a new parent to an autistic child, particularly one like mine who has limited verbal ability, could this be possible? Well, it may seem a bit quirky, and some would be up-in-arms against us citing us as a future social welfare burden, but first let share this take on The Addam\u2019s Family series:  Much of the humor derives from their culture clash with the rest of the world. They invariably treat normal visitors with great warmth and courtesy, even though their guests often have evil intentions. They are puzzled by the horrified reactions to their (to them) good-natured and normal behavior since they are under the impression that their tastes are shared by most of society. Accordingly they view \u201cconventional\u201d tastes with generally tolerant suspicion. For example, Fester once cites a neighboring family\u2019s meticulously maintained petunia patches as evidence that they are \u201cnothing but riff-raff.\u201d A recurring theme in the epilogue of many episodes was the Addamses getting an update on the most recent visitor to their home, either via something in the newspaper or a phone call. Invariably, as a result of their visit to the Addamses, the visitor would be institutionalized, change professions, move out of the country, or have some other negative life-changing event. The Addamses would always misinterpret the update and see it as good news for that most recent visitor.  (Wikipedia) I wish we could all live with the same conviction. When parents get frightened about autism, it\u2019s usually because of fear for the future \u2013 will my child get married, go to school, have friends? The pressure to conform the unconformable is immense. For many years I quietly shared the same worries, although I feel my worries were more rooted in society\u2019s acceptance of Adam. My viewpoint is shared with the more widespread social model of disability \u2014 that our modern definition of disabled is a term to describe the social barriers that make a life living with an impairment exclusive/segregated. There are naturally going to be times in the beginning of having an autism diagnosis, most-likely if we\u2019ve never experienced disability before, that we will be thinking in terms of our own lives, how we grew up, went to school, made friends, had our first boy/girlfriends and later, maybe even got married and had families of our own. When we don\u2019t see our children doing the same things in typical ways, we worry for them and maybe even for ourselves. The life trajectory is one that our society uses to plan every stage of our lives from how we go to school, to what we are supposed to become, to building our retirement nest-egg.  We expect to be on a path that is economically driven. We are raised to comply, to be a part of society. About a century ago, the formation of \u201cschool\u201d was intended to prepare children for later entrance to the military.  Today, we plan for our babies at the get-go with pre-school and envision them at Harvard \u2013 the ultimate preparation for a new kind of regime. We prepare our little ones for the economic march into consumerist culture. Our frame of reference for understanding is capitalist.  Erich Fromm  believed that we tend to categorize individuals \u201caccording to various types of status, to glorify superiors, and to look down on those who are regarded as of lower rank (e.g. persons belonging to other \u2018races\u2019) \u2013 must be understood in light of an authoritarian upbringing, which in turn is associated with other general authoritarian tendencies in the workplace and society in general.\u201d (Alvesson and Sk\u00f6ldberg). That \u201cauthority\u201d well, to coin James Carville, is \u201cthe economy, stupid.\u201d (I\u2019m using Carville\u2019s words and am not implying anyone is stupid. I want to acknowledge the sensitivity I actually have when people use words that can be used violently). While resources are an issue for supporting autistic individuals, others site Libreralism as a issue as it put great stake in \u201cliberty, automony and choice\u2026 Given the reality that some persons with disabilities will necessarily be in situations of intense dependency and reliance, can liberty and autonomy \u2014 with their emphasis on freedom from \u2014 really be the lodestars liberalism has assumed?\u201d (Devlin and Pothier). When we bring an autistic child into the world, we don\u2019t fit the model pretty much from day one and especially after our children receive their first official diagnosis. We try to squeeze into charitable models for definitions of our existence, but they feel uncomfortable, placing us in (again) subordinate positions yielding to the \u201cpower\u201d of the do-gooder/philanthropist and the \u201cexperts\u201d in receipt of their research funds \u2013 an unequal relationship. Our families collide with ideologies that we are forced to question. Not \u201cfitting in\u201d is another way of describing how we are placed on the margins of society, or discriminated against. Relatively recent disability laws are made to protect us from exclusion, giving our children full citizenship rights.  Still, we struggle find such justice for them within their daily lives. We first look to school systems and are met with the red-tape of the process of getting IEP\u2019s and special accommodations and quickly realize it\u2019s a legal issue and process. I often wonder which \u201cside\u201d that law protects. We parents (I am writing as a mother so I have to assume that if you are disabled/autistic reading this, you will understand that I recognize this also as your issue) don\u2019t count on having to fill in reams of paper applications, spending hours in meetings, navigating government support systems and administration when we are swaddling our new bundles-of-joy.  The navigation to be special \u2013 not that it\u2019s our choice \u2013 indicates from the start that we\u2019re not supposed to be this way. Our children aren\u2019t supposed to be autistic and public schools protect themselves from us with the red-tape, and we have to fight for our children to be included, not marginally integrated or tokenized. Most of us don\u2019t \u201cfight,\u201d we become diplomatic contortionists and try to get our kids \u201cin\u201d to the extent we can. While it\u2019s a worthy fight, it\u2019s still one that we\u2019d rather not spend our time on. We look forward to the day when autism \u2013 about twenty to thirty years behind our recongition of other disabilities, including intellectual disabilities \u2013 is widely accepted and welcomed in society. With that welcoming is also a recognition of the intersections between race, culture, gender among other interlocking connections, that make up experience. As I let Adam go into the world, with the support he needs in order to be an equal citizen, I am always working on my visions for him as a parent. The other day, I thought long and hard about a photo I collected from Toronto\u2019s  Abilities Arts Festival  a few years ago.  It is a photo where two intellectually disabled parents sit on the couch with their three typical children \u2014 a \u201cnormal\u201d family photo called \u201cLucky Strike.\u201d The subjects also wrote a paragraph about how they got married and had a family with the help of their support workers. It dawned on me about Adam and his family: there is no reason why Adam may not have a family of his own, by accident or by choice as is the cycle of life for many a typical person. There is no reason why he cannot attend higher-education as an adult. There is no reason why he cannot participate in whatever he wants. It is, after all, the law, granted, subject to enforcement as well as interpretation and dominant social attitudes that are still weighted against the disabled person.  We also know that not all our rights are enacted and there is a hesitancy by many families and individuals to go through the legal process. Not all universities understand the need and function of the aide worker. Although York University accommodates people with disabilities,  it found itself in a legal dispute with Ashif Jaffer, a student with Down syndrome, because he claimed the university did not accommodate his needs . For these reasons, we have to keep on working hard, and likely take a few risks, for the rights of our beloved family members to be included with the accommodations that they require. This means also the help of aide workers and various technologies, among many other individualized needs. People can have families and also be  supported by others. Our children, even our non-verbal ones, can have a say in their plans and lives with guided decision-making practices. Non-verbal people may be able to type or write visual essays and participate in research about autism, and all autistic people have a right to both participate in research and have results disseminated to them in ways they can use and understand. Check out  websites on emancipatory research  and visual essay formats. No it\u2019s not easy to do, but we\u2019re starting to do it and we are inevitably going to learn by doing. An \u201cemancipatory\u201d life requires support and that support requires a vision of possibility, enablement, democracy and a plan. As a paraplegic requires a wheelchair, many an autistic person requires people in their lives to support them getting to and from destinations, to having families, to making decisions, to managing the many details of life. Some of this right now is a privilege for the families that can afford them.  It is, however, everyone\u2019s right and I for one want to hear more stories about how families and autistic people are helping to let autistic people live their lives as autistic people. For the families who are able to provide the supports we seek from society and governments, we need to hear your stories in order to provide more buidling blocks of enablement.  What is independence? I can\u2019t work on the technology of my computer on my own. I need tons of help with it. I need extra hands to help me around the house and in managing a schedule as a single mother. I need teachers, handy-men and someone to help me when I\u2019m ill. I build my human network as a result of necessity. Others also need me and I am able to lend my hand or my special skill set. For reasons revolving around Adam, I am sensitive to our capitalist notions of independence and how that seems to relate to the family and school. Are we creating communities of people who are interdependent on each other, or human silos? How \u201chappy\u201d does that latter future look like sitting there all alone in them? Here\u2019s a future that I can see unraveling before my eyes, despite the struggles, tensions and issues we presently encounter and grapple with:  I see more people employed in these areas to assist and guide, but further than this, to balance the power that can be offset by the \u201cabled versus the disabled.\u201d Ergo the terms \u201cassistants and aide-workers,\u201d not therapists. I see more effort towards emancipatory lives for the autistic, of all \u201cfunctioning\u201d levels. I see our growing ability to understand and respect one another, to honour the visual way and other modes of learning and communicating, presenting and even reading the materials by individuals with autism. It is a reciprocal human economy with autistic people in it. For the first time since I\u2019ve had Adam, I imagine that it might be possible, as Adam is my only-child, that I could one day be a grandmother after-all. It was actually one thing that made me a little sad when Adam was diagnosed  \u2014 the world seemed to be locking its doors to us so soon. Of course, all of this is Adam\u2019s choice, hopefully. It\u2019s the choice that matters. The principles upon which I now imagine and locate our lives, in practice as well as principle, is one of possibility and of how our lives can be enriched, even made better, by including autistic people in them.  Adam\u2019s life should be one of his own making, and I am here to support him down his many paths. The questions I now ask more often, are not only about how much work does Adam must do (as the onus has, to-date, largely be on the autistic person to become more normal  before  s/he can participate in society), but how can I help him obtain for himself not just a \u201cquality of life,\u201d but a  vibrancy,  of life \u2014 the excitement of possibility and choice \u2014   that many of us took for granted while we were growing up? This also belongs to him.  This can be our future \u2014 for our children and even for us as parents of autistic children. This  is   our  Adam Family.

{"date": "2012/09/06", "body": "I\u2019m back at York U and have taken it upon myself to persue my M.A. in Critical Disability Studies and focusing on autism in every context I have time for. Outside of general readings, I noticed two books I\u2019ve pre-ordered and eagerly await to devour: Far From The Tree: Parents, Children & The Search for Identity  by Andrew Solomon and  Autism: A Social and Medical History  by Mitzi Waltz. \u201cDisabilty\u201d is a relatively new word in our language set to describe the social barriers that render some people unable to participate. It isn\u2019t a word that we will find in historical records about disability. Rather, we find words like \u201clunatic, idiot, leper, cripple,\u201d to name a few historical references to disability. While the history of disability is a burgeoning subject now, my generation never studied it in school.  Some of us may not have even studied civil rights history. While we can locate histories in texts, records, art, and now through oral histories, we are just beginning to recognize that uncovering history is a very important aspect to identity. All of our histories are important and so many of them go unrecognized and untold.  I remember learning British History in elementary school, and feeling valueless because my history was ignored, not validated, and considered not worthy of digging into. So many immigrants or different ethnicities feel the same way, although we have growing bodies of history that are now being taught in schools.  While autism memoirs are a way of telling our history now, we can do more to reach back and find autism in history.  Uta Frith  and  Harlan Lane  are two authors that come to mind who have written about specific autistic individuals in history. Autism in history is a subject that requires much more attention. I\u2019m hoping that the simple binary of \u201cmedical versus social model\u201d of autism history will be avoided in the books about to be released. \u201cRethinking this polarity is what historical research and methodologies has to offer disability studies.\u201d (Anderson and Arden Coyne). In terms of identity, autistic identity or the identity of families with an autistic member, it is important to avoid the stereotypes of this binary that we encounter, especially in autism \u201cadvocacy,\u201d although it would be an important a study unto itself of how we view autism today.  Our identities are complex, located within race, gender, income, nationality, culture, and so much more. We need to challenge ourselves to move away from the idea that all experiences of people with disablities, or their family members, are \u201cconflated.\u201d (Anderson & Coyne). History must also be viewed through the prevalent views of the time period, and we cannot impose of modern views upon it, for our interrpretations would be skewed. It\u2019s more enlightening to look at history and compare it to our views today and in how we might improve as a society. I hope for more literature on autism and history. I\u2019m not of the belief that we all need to be autistic to write histories about autism but the practice of locating ourselves in any research must be something we undertake more rigorously, upfront, by stating our own views, considering our bias, and offering our biographies. I\u2019d like to see this not only in social research, but also in medical research. We need to promote further studies to help define autistic identity.  If we do it carefully and ethically, we could assisst with the rights of the autistic person in our society.

{"date": "2012/09/13", "body": "Attending IMFAR for me this year raised many more questions, if not affirmed some of my assumptions about the extent (or not) to which autistic individuals are involved in research as well as autism organizations. While more autistic people may be in attendance at conferences, or may sit as board members, issues about \u201ctokenism\u201d arise; to what extent do we enable autistic individuals to create a meaninful autism agenda? That is, who is establishing the questions about autism to be researched? Who is directing the goals of an autism organization?  Temple Grandin spoke at IMFAR at Toronto this year by webcam/Skype. She urged autism researchers to look at issues effecting autistic quality of life, rather than more studies on \u201cface recognition.\u201d Yet she did not acknowledge that many of these researchers are, a) not autistic or, b) do not practice emancipatory or participatory research. Was this done for politcial reasons, or was it a gentle nudge to send more accepted research paradigms in directions that may be of use to autistic people, or perhaps an oversight?  By definition,  \u201cEmacipatory research (that is research which seeks to alleviate oppression) is critical in exposing the mechanisms for producing, maintaining and leigtimising social inequities and domination.\u201d (Ayesha Vernon, \u201cReflexivity: The dilemmas of researching from the inside\u201d in The Disability Press.) My assumption is that while Grandin is urging the researchers to reflect on what is important to autistic people, the model is more challenging at IMFAR which is largely based on a non autistic view of how autistic people think, perceive, function. The research was largely targetted to the \u201chigh-functioning\u201d autistic population, likely, because this was the most effective, cost-efficient and timely way to complete the research projects. They did not employ emancipatory methods which may not use more common research designs.  It is non autistic people largely determining what\u2019s best for autistic people and the balance of power is clearly skewed  \u2014 it is the researcher directing the goal of the reserach and the relationship of researcher-subject is established. Some quantitative research by autistic researchers has been presented at IMFAR, and we do need more in support of the issues and needs that are produced and articulated by people with autism. As non autistic people, charity organizers and researchers we have to acknowledge when we are looking from the outside-in, and consider changing our approaches in order to provide services that are directed by the autistic community. Issues arise when thinking of involving autistic participants in establishing the research question, or the agenda of an organization. Sitting on boards with non verbal participants with significant challenges, non autistic members have to exercise patience and understanding with the length of time and the various outputs that enable an autistic person to participate, as an example. Some individuals communicate by typing very slowly, or using other text-to-speech devices. For others who do not have an organized communciation system, the issue of involvement and later, dissemination of the research that is useful to autistic people becomes complex. Some have worked around the issue by stating that the autistic with the more proficient communication system is at least accomplishing part of the task of inclusion. We have to work on offering solutions to participation and autistic direction. As the founder of The Autism Acceptance Project, I experienced these tensions of working as a non autistic person in an autistic space and tried to resist controling the agenda, and admittedly while I sought a lot of direction from autistic people, this was very difficult to do. As an organized and fairly driven person, setting my own assumptions aside still requires me to slow down and think about my design of the TAAProject website: from to how to include autistic individuals in a way that they can direct the project while using my skills, and theirs, to developing the tools to perhaps target some of the issues that are barriers for all organizations that do not fully integrate and employ the needs and issues of our autistic community.  In addition to the intensive labour and time required to set up empancipatory research projects and the change the structure of autism organizations  \u2014 both which seek to amelieorate the social oppression of autistic people \u2014  their is little capital out there for this. The larger autism charities focus more on causation research and are better capitalized as opposed to volunteer autism organizations more often led by autistic people (Arnold). So, if you are a researcher endeavouring to do this kind of research in autism, The Autism Acceptance Project would like to hear from you. \u201cDisability research should not be seen as a set of technical objective procedures carried out by \u2018experts\u2019 but part of the struggle by disabled people to challenge the oppression they currently experience in their lives.\u201d (Oliver, 1992).

{"date": "2012/09/28", "body": "This video from CNN, sadly, is just part of the abundance of abuse that autistic people face every day. While we watch the acts disclosed to us here, it is important to note this perverse normalcy of our culture of abuse and ask ourselves the question, to what extent are attitudes about autism contributing to systemic \u201csickness.\u201d In other words, to what extent has neo-liberal society, the one that values independence under a capitalist system, promoted maltreatment and abuse? To that end, in what ways has \u201cnormal\u201d society become sick? A few more reflections after you watch this:    \nIn my critical disability studies, I discuss these issues alongside disabled people who have also experienced abuse. I also sit in classrooms where people who work within the systems, including Applied Behavioural Therapy (ABA) have listened to the accounts of inside operations. I\u2019m so glad members of the ABA community, btw, are looking at autism education from a critical disability studies perspective. By way of these first-person accounts, and by case studies such as Paul Cambridge\u2019s  The First Hit: a case study of the psychical abuse of people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviours  (1999), it is clearly evident that caregiver service providers do not have a proper system for the protection of whistle-blowers; that the caregiving industry is vastly undertrained and underpaid. The service delivery system requires a major audit. Here a quote from a service provider: \u201cI was told to do the first hit and then it would be OK\u2026X never expressed any feelings of liking for the people and had complete control over them. [this meaning the intimidation practice of the more seniored staff to the newer staff]. You weren\u2019t allowed to show openly that you cared.\u201d (Cambridge, 1999)\u2026.  \n \u201cNewly-appointed staff were placed in difficult situations, where the risk of failure was high. They also often lacked the necessary competence or experience to perform essential care tasks well. Their abilities were then challenged and they were emotionally underminded by the principal alleged abuser, a practice that was sustained by other staff in the core group who had moved from the old institution.\u201d (Cambridge, 1999). In Toronto, we\u2019ve heard of lots of abuse situations in residential living facilities. The scope of one blog post/reflection cannot encompass all the issues that are endemic/sick in our society that has laid the foundations for the way in which we employ, provide serivce and regard employment for clients with disabilities. If we do not value people with disabilities, we will not value the people who work within the service system which is an essential accommodation for the participation of many severely disabled people in our society. It is important to say here that I\u2019m not at all excusing the individual acts of the abusers by stating it\u2019s just a systemic problem! We still sequester the severely disabled. We don\u2019t want to see them. They provoke anxiety within us, and we rather turn away. Or, we\u2019ll throw charitable money at \u201cthe problem\u201d to temporarily make ourselves feel better. This is one side of the coin. What we need is a service system we can trust, and that values the disabled (among many other points I could make here). The way we value (or don\u2019t value) all members of our society is the linchpin of the future (bright or dismal) for pretty much all of us, not just the severely disabled. Consider that ability-disability is a continuum and that most of us will become disabled in our lifetime in one way or another (even ageing is in many ways a disabling condition), how are we supporting or even not supporting ourselves? Do we only think in terms of the individual \u2014 each one for himself? Or are are bodies not only part of this continnum but also permeable bodies, that is bodies that effect each other; responsible for and to each other? Today, I broke down in tears, which happens often when I meet prejudice face-to-face. Adam\u2019s regular doctor was not around to see him today. Adam was complaining that his ear hurt. Yet, he is terrified (and sensory defensive) of his ears being checked. Some doctors have more empathy and are better at getting Adam to agree to have his ears checked. Adam doesn\u2019t love this doctor \u2014 his memory is vivid and we\u2019ve seen this one before, and he seems a little more nervous around him than I\u2019ve seen him around others. It\u2019s important to note that he\u2019s not a \u201cbad man,\u201d or anything of the sort that is so simplistic. This is to highlight the subtle nature of the prejudice and attitudes that paint \u201call\u201d people with autism as one in the same. When I was there, I also wanted to discuss puberty and adolescence as I would if I had any other son.  I received this response: \u201cDo you have any autsitic doctors?\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ve seen everybody. I sort of know of everyone here in the field,\u201d I responded a little disturbed, wondering where he was heading with the term \u201cautistic doctors,\u201d as if they proliferate the field as answers to everything autistic. \u201cWell, what we know about autistics when they go into adolescence is that they become violent and agressive. Like today. We had to hold Adam down today [to get his ears checked]. I can\u2019t do that again. He could hurt me.\u201d I walked out, Adam in hand. When I got to the car, tears streamed. First, the doctor doesn\u2019t even  know  Adam save for the petite bundle of nerves when Adam sees him. All he saw was Adam\u2019s fear and resistance. Adam has never hurt anyone. Adam is kind-hearted, loving and happy, save for his anxiety and all that he must deal with in a world where normal is the top of the hierarchy. Adam will go through puberty like everyone else. I can\u2019t predict what will happen, except that I know who he is. I know how I was and that I was as moody as shit. Somehow, I even seem to know in my heart that everything, up and down as it will go, will be okay. I cried for the parents who don\u2019t have the time to enter a disability studies program, or have the time to study philosophy or read about things or get in touch with other disabled people and their complex stories, although there are more access people and resources than there ever were, so I\u2019m grateful for that. Autistic people are available, their books are also on the shelves, their blogs accessible to all of us. Some of them will empower, many of them caution. I thought, if I didn\u2019t have my armour, what would I have made of that comment from a \u201cmedical expert\u201d who actually knows less about autism than I do? I say that with confidence even though I stop at the point when I am fully aware I am not autistic and cannot appropriate the experience of being autistic in a highly prejudiced world. To what end do bias and ignorance  (lack of understanding and knowledged about people with autism that is dangerously over-generalized and misunderstood) espoused by some members of the medical community (and it is also important to note that not all of the medical community would say something so stupid),  create  a culture of abuse? After all, Mr. Doc gave me fair warning and can\u2019t check Adam\u2019s ears again\u2026don\u2019t get me started on how the disabled don\u2019t get proper health care\u2026 Reference (and I encourage you to find this one): Cambridge, Paul (1999) The First Hit: a case study of the physical abuse of people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviours in a residential service,  Disability & Society , 14:3 285-308.

{"date": "2012/09/17", "body": "Introduction: You can\u2019t find a history of autism, or the term, prior to 1911 when Eugen Bleuler defined autism as a detachment from reality in terms of understanding schizophrenia. Try reaching for an autism history into the 19th century and beyond, and you won\u2019t find it, necessarily. Historians of autism, and there are few, draw upon historical figures that possess our modern understanding of autistic traits as presented in the DSM IV. Some of these historians include Uta Frith, Mitzi Waltz, Harlan Lane and Michael Fitzgerald. Waltz\u2019s book  Autism: A Social and Medical History , is about to be released.  It has been said that the practice of identifying autistic people in history is a bit like diagnosing the dead. Skepticism around the practice, perhaps assisted by current autism hype and politics, I would argue, might deter some historians from venturing into it. In this post, I will cite the work of disability historian Geoffrey Reaume and his call for more research into the history of disability, and the proper saving of it amidst the tenuous nature of information located on the Internet. I will point out how autism history is relatively modern, how it can be in jeopardy by virtue of the \u201cmovement\u201d for rights and recognition occuring online. To this latter point, I will mention The Autism Acceptance Project (TAAP) and its event  The Joy of Autism: Redefining Ability and Quality of Life  (2007) to illustrate how I, as its organizer and curator working with autistic board members and an autistic advisory committee, attempted to capture a recent autism history/movement by illustrating a few of the steps of assembly and dissemination as an historical exercise in itself. I attempt to illustrate potential issues and pitfalls in archiving a modern autism history. From reading Reaume, documenting thoughts, method and people is an important part of documenting history. This is already a long blog post and the topic deserves more attention than this format can provide. Finally, I will suggest that autism is still largely absent in the wider disability discourse, which might be more widely accepted if more research is done into the history of autism. \n \nCollecting Autism History \u2014 Choices and Cautions: The history of autism does not need to be limited to autistic people.  As Geoffrey Reaume points out in his paper,  Disability History in Canada: Present Work In the Field and Future Prospects , we need more research into the history of all disabilities including sensory disabilities, intellectual disabilities, physical disabilities, disability and eugenics, disability history as it intersects with race and immigration (and gender I would add), mad-people\u2019s history, and activist histories.  He does not, however, cite autism history, specifically. As I mentioned, because autism is a very recent diagnosis (1993), oral histories and autistic memoir have coincided with a recent disability rights movement of the 1960\u2019s. These have contributed to a rapidly burgeoning Autism Rights Movement.  We understand autism, therefore, in very modern terms and autism is still largely missing among a more vast body of disability history. \u201cIn order to have a fuller sense of history, including where disabled people lead lives that are as mundane and full of contradictions as that of most people who are not disabled, a wide variety of sources need to be preserved and a wide variety of histories need to be told.\u201d Reaume cautions us that the bulk of modern history, as it were, is locked up in our computers.  One day, he argues, those computers will break down. The internet will dump our information; our emails are not printed on paper to be saved. Such correspondences have contributed to our understanding of how the disabled were treated and regarded by the medical profession. They also have illuminated the private lives and struggles of the disabled, as two examples. This brings me to the thought of how much of our autism history, and the history of the Autism Rights Movement exploded online. Due to the very nature of computing and ease of use to communicate in this format for many autistic people, we also run the risk of losing it. It was one of the reasons I curated the exhibition during the event  The Joy of Autism: Redefining Ability and Quality of Life  in 2007. This comprised a series of events, lectures and visual exhibits. Organizing TAAP and The Events: As curator, (note, a non-autistic person) I attempted to capture the YouTube videos, the blogs by autistic people and autistic allies, the political debates and the resistance of autistic people to others ascribing an identity to them that was based in fascination and fear. Accounts had been recorded online as personal stories about behavioural treatment, schools, and institutionalization, parent abuse, infanticide, as well as statements about autistic perspective and personal strengths went unrecognized by the medical research community and the media. These usually took an online blog-form, although autistic people began socializing in online chat rooms and social games before then.  Much of this was aimed at refuting popular mythologies that were proliferating about autism and people with autism as unaware and \u201cnot even in the room,\u201d to describe a vacuous, unintelligent nature of autistic people. We (interested volunteers and autistic people) exhibited important new websites and their content in a more traditional gallery-exhibition format. The exhibit was mixed with video, artwork, published work executed by autistic people on large signage, some printed on fibre glass as floating; thoughts, by autistic people, about how they had been treated and regarded. Different aspects were located in different gallery rooms at The Lonsdale Gallery in Toronto. Videos produced by autistic people and activists played on a loop so that the audience could watch as well as hear the voices of autistic people, some of them who used text-to-speech devices. YouTube was new at the time where people uploaded their videos. The generous size of the gallery befitted the echo of the videos \u2014 an autistic echo as the videos kept playing while the audience read signage and looked at artwork;  a continual reminder of autistic presence. A room full of conference materials (conferences organized by and that included autistic people, such as Autism Network International\u2019s AUTREAT) was made available so that visitors could conduct their own research. A glossy magazine full of writings and artwork by autistic people as well as interviews of two major artists in the exhibition, Larry Bissonnette and Jonathan Lerman, was distributed.  To accompany the exhibition, the lecture series was held at the Al Green Theatre in downtown Toronto. We produced a glossy brochure with the artwork and the presentations of our autistic and non-autistic presenters along with the purpose of the event.  We intentionally located the event in the middle of the medicalization of autism and the \u201ctragedy\u201d model of disability and positioned autistic lives as a \u201cjoy.\u201d This was done by writing title ideas down and distributing among the autistic advisory committee for comment and approval. The final decision for the event/exhibition title was reached by consensus of fifteen autistic people. The predominant othering of the autistic person was countered in the  \u201credefining autism\u201d part of the title in order to reaffirm agency and made the event activist in nature. It meant to  stare back  as a result of being  stared at . Just recently, The Autism Acceptance Project which staged the events, has been recognized by The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) as \u201cone of the most important events in the history of autism acceptance.\u201d This is a step to autistic people claiming their own histiory. The Importance of Record Keeping: With respect to record-keeping, we keep originals and make, then  bind copies of newspaper ads and articles that gleaned a great deal of media and public attention at the time. All the lectures were taped and we will get permissions to get them posted online in an upcoming new iteration of the TAAP website. As for the exhibition, the content was photographed, so we have a few records in this format, although there are not enough to reflect the depth and scope of the exhibition itself. It is here I would recommend better photo and video recording and more thought into saving, archiving and disseminating the results and content of events.  I had posted the limited exhibition photos online at The Autism Acceptance Project website (www.taaproject.com) , along with the submitted artwork and writings by autistic people. Recently, as Reaume predicted in his essay, we lost that information when the website was hacked earlier this year. Not all of our content is recoverable. Also important is the abundance of resources and contributions at  Neurodiversity.com , the work of  ASAN  (The Autistic Self-Advocacy Network) as well as other major agencies and projects run by autistic people prior to and after TAAP. Specifically, nerodiversity.com remains one of the websites containing and assembling significant autism history that is at risk of being jeopardized if not kept in hard-copy. Specific and notable to Canadian autism history is Michelle Dawson, a Canadian autistic researcher. Her work, under the umbrella-title,  The Misbehaviour of Behaviourists,  is a significant piece of the history of how autistic people are mistreated in Canada (The Auton Case, The Human Rights Tribunal, and her exclusion at Autism Society of Canada). She has recorded her work at the website  No Autistics Allowed  ( www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_03.html ).  These are only three examples of many more autistic-run online organizations and individuals  \u2014 all which must be preserved, recorded and interpreted. This is something that more researchers may wish to consider. Can An Autism History Really Exist?  \u201c\u2026we have to value all aspects of our past and to instil this value in others who keep these records so that future disability histories can be preserved, written and debated for generations to come,\u201d says Reaume. \u201cIn doing so, the historical memory of our collective past can, one would hope, make for a better future where disabled people are not marginalized and oppressed as has so often happened in Canadian history. The history can influence a collective sense of identity and political engagement. It can also influence public policies that have a direct impact on people with disabilities as policy-makers learn from the past while being influenced to improve practices in the present.\u201d I would wager that most people don\u2019t acknowledge that a history of autism either exists, or could exist. When autistic people take note that they \u201cdon\u2019t exist\u201d in the consciousness of society, it would be difficult to own a history. In an activist vein, neither the term autism nor the recognition of autistics as valuable or capable, even within the context of severe impairments, exists as a widely accepted definition or understanding of autism. Within Critical Disability Studies, there is a lack of use of the term autism as we otherwise hear of the deaf and blind communities, one might argue, precisely because there is little written about autism in history.  This connotes that there is still not enough citation of autistic identity and history, even within Critical Disability Studies programs, although there is acceptance that this is an area in need of development. As someone invested in autism, rights, inclusion and autistic citizenship and identity, I feel this absence when reading Reaume\u2019s citations of particular disabilities written in historical contexts, likely in light of a recent diagnostic label. In Critical Disability Studies, autism is lumped under the broader label of intellectual disabilities. Yet this lumping often ignores the particular needs and struggles within this community. While labeling can be dangerous and problematic, it can also lend itself to assisting and accommodating the unique needs of this population. Autism is unique in many respects, and requires a unique set of teaching methods, not analogous to, but parallel in terms of customization of education as we do for the blind, deaf or dyslexic communities. Autism also shares its history with the wider disability movement. It also intersects with race, gender, cultural, and socio-economic factors. It is important to note that while we share history within the context of our times, and with groups that may share discrimination issues, needs and histories are still unique. Further, not every autistic person shares the same experience, personal history, or opinion.  In keeping with Reaume\u2019s call, these are some more reasons to pursue historical autism research. So we need to keep telling our stories. Reaume cautions us, however, not to exclude or revise history. Problematic approaches to history can include hagiography (making disabled heroes), presenting disabled activists as \u201cdevoid of flaws,\u201d or histories which reduce medical interventions as \u201cautomatically oppressive.\u201d To this he reminds us to value \u201call aspects \u201cof our history. I would add, an \u201cinclusive history.\u201d Research in autism is dense with analyses of cause and behaviour. I often wonder how far we\u2019ve come from The Age of Enlightenment which uses its scientific subjects to deduce not only the nature of man, but its abnormalities thereby reinforcing the concept of normalcy and perpetuating our binary understanding of disability \u2014 the normal versus the abnormal. Neuroscience inspires us with a promise of understanding our intrinsic nature and raises bioethical concerns. Typical to how we\u2019ve acquired knowledge to-date in research, we use comparative scientific methods. Counter to research that merely objectifies autistic people as subjects, and normal-abnormal viewpoints, we have vibrant autistic community who argue that we are not just the sum of our genomes. Researchers often overlook autistic voices \u2013 in the various forms that autistic voice rises up \u2014 and perhaps unwittingly threaten autistic agency. It will be curious to look back at our history, if only we interpret it ethically and save it for future generations. We have to begin with the research of autism history in many contexts and keep records, preserving them from the threat of losing information on the Internet, and assert the existence and the complex lives of autistic people. \n Reference:  \nReaume, Geoffrey. \u201cDisability History in Canada: Present Work in the Field and Future Prospects,\u201d  Canadian Journal of Disability Studies  1:1 (2012): 35-81.\n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2012/09/17/the-importance-of-collecting-and-preserving-autism-history/", "title": "The Importance Of Collecting And Preserving Autism History"},

Our job is to figure out how a student should be participating.\u201d This is a line from Paula Kluth\u2019s DVD, author of  You\u2019re Going to Love This Kid on inclusion in the schools. \nWe are on the brink of another school year. Many parents struggle with finding not only a placement for their autistic child, but the right placement. In Canada, as is for many places in the world where children are more likely than ever to be included, children and parents with autism are still some of the most excluded in our society. I often find it shocking the lack of support in my country where we seem to have otherwise great social supports. Despite there being many great and willing teachers, the school system is still one of the most unjust insitutions for autistic students. While many of us work to change attitudes and policy in Canada and the US, I want to reiterate what an important step integration and inclusion is for all of us.  Watching Adam at camp and even younger people with disabilities, the younger generation already has much more exposure to kids with disabilities than my generation ever did. Many a parent I\u2019ve met will register their child into an integrated school in order for their children to respect and value everyone. After kindergarten, however, the segregation typically begins. While we may have seen more effort towards inclusion, we are still teetering between the two extremes. Watching Adam with other children and their patience and acceptance shouldn\u2019t just happen once in a while or at summer camp. Adam has developed so much this summer, as he does every year, and his peers do too. They are much more tolerant and accepting than I can remember of my generation. It is an indication of how important it is to start inclusion young and from the get go. I believe it is the older generations like mine who simply let old habits get in the way. Watching how easy it is for children to accept human difference is proof to me that inclusion is good for everyone. This post is dedicated a couple of submissions I received this summer for review: Paula Kluth\u2019s website, DVD and book I\u2019ve mentioned before,  You\u2019re Going to Love This Kid ; Eileen Riley Hall\u2019s  Parenting Girls on the Autism Spectrum.  The key for teachers is to learn how to include. This involved adaptations in the presentation of lessons, to how a child can respond to lessons. Adam, for example, responds to multiple modalities, but the main way of teaching him and transferring his learning is through the visual \u2014 computers, iPads, manipulatives and actual experience in the field. Accommodations also include sensory breaks, exercise, and other adaptations to a classroom. For instance, Adam can focus better on a ball chair. Otherwise, he needs to move his entire body so this provides the feedback he needs right now in order to attend to his lessons.  While the pressure to \u201cbe normal\u201d in its elusive forms and definitions was more difficult when Adam was younger, we have grown into another comfort level with our lives and ourselves. Adaptation is simply a wonderful way to make learning accessible to Adam and it\u2019s a joy to watch him grow and learn. Paula has many tips on adapting lessons and changing attitudes so that teachers and schools can adopt full inclusion. She makes it sensible and inspiring. I suggest you check out Paula\u2019s YouTube channel for more information. __ Eileen Riley-Hall is the mother of two autistic teenage girls and the author of  Parenting Girls on the Autistic Spectrum: Overcoming Challenges and Celebrating Gifts  (Jessica Kingsley Publishers). As the mother of a boy, I was wondering what I\u2019d learn from Eileen, but knowing so many parents with young autistic girls, I had to recommend her book. Sometimes we just want to refer to another book by another parent for that down-to-earth advice.  I would also recommend along with a how-to book such as this, all the books by autistic women including Donna Williams, Lucy Blackman, Dawn Prince, Temple Grandin, Jasmin O\u2019Neill (among others)  \u2014 some of the first autistic women to write from their own unique perspectives. I like to pair my parent-memoirs with those also written by other autistic people. What I found most refreshing in Riley-Hall\u2019s book was Chapter 8 on \u201cThe World Wide Web.\u201d Most books written by moms of autistic children usually contain lists of therapies and websites that can seem overly-diplomatic, noting down every therapy out there for the parent to sift through without any critical analysis of the therapy, the way it came to be in the vast array of (and history) autism \u201ctreatments,\u201d and the controversies and potential dangers surrounding them.  In contrast, Riley-Hall offers some warnings and states the pros and cons of the many websites that parents must navigate when entering the autism community. \u201cThere are very distinct divisions within the autism community. So you have to know that whatever you read is fueled by an underlying position or philosophy about autism: what it is, what causes it, and how best to treat it..unfortunately there is very little middle ground in between.\u201d (p.131). When I first started reading books about autism by parents ten years ago, I wish someone had provided me with that caveat.  In reviewing her list, it is apparent that Riley-Hall is recommending sites that support and accommodate the autistic as \u201ccomplete,\u201d an encourages society to value the autistic person. This book is part \u201chow to\u201d book and part memoir that makes Riley-Hall\u2019s book accessible for the parent of an autistic girl. Best of all, it\u2019s all about acceptance.

{"date": "2012/09/29", "body": "I love my City of Toronto where I was born and have lived for most of my life. I\u2019ve lived on the outerskirts and downtown and midtown and I never loose interest or discover new pockets of Toronto.  I never liked \u201cbedroom communities\u201d and I don\u2019t thrive well in them. As an art curator, I used to cite the many aesthetic issues as well as social consequences of bedroom communities when I had my own newspaper column, even though most of us don\u2019t have any choice  to live in them, as was the situation with my family. Others claim they prefer not to live in \u201cthe big city,\u201d and that\u2019s fine too. For me, however, I enjoy being able to walk out the door and take a few steps to the corner to get what I need, to walk or bike to, and be among people. When I talk about my city, I\u2019m really talking about community and there are many notions of community that are important in discussing inclusion and people with disabilities. After a divorce, I had to move back uptown. My partner and parents live downtown and I am backing-and-forthing. I\u2019ve envisioned Adam\u2019s future downtown, where transportation is accessible, where the chances of having employment could be easier because of accessibility to them; where support in the way of people may be more readily available, and for him to also feel a part of the daily pulse of life among his fellow citizens. I take it for granted, perhaps as a matter of necessity or as a premise unto itself, that he is a valued member of this community, even though we encounter many barriers and prejudices \u2014 sometimes subtle and other times overt. It\u2019s an ideal, of course. At some point in the near or distant future, when our lives don\u2019t demand the need to be uptown, I will move us mid or downtown again. Accessibility and being with people is key for me, my vision for Adam, and for our growth as a family that fit with my values.  Along Christie (it\u2019s a street in Toronto), a quote from Jane Jacobs remained unfinished graffiti on a cement partition along the sidewalk. For nearly a year, only half the sentence was written, waiting for someone to bring a can of spray paint and fill it in. \u201cCities have the capability of providing something \u2026\u201d I felt compelled to drive up and down Christie for the past several years not only because it seems to be one of my favorite areas in Toronto, and one of the first points of arrival when my dad immigrated to Canada, but also because I wanted to see if the sentence would ever read complete. About this time last year, someone filled it in, but it was incorrect. A few weeks later, it was erased. I waited again and kept driving. In the true Jane Jacob spirit, the practice of finishing the sentence, albeit a quote from her, had to be accessible and inclusive. (Thank goodness Mayor Rob Ford\u2019s attempts at erasing all graffiti from the city didn\u2019t strike this wall). Finally, a few months ago, the sentence was completed: \u201cCities have the capability of providing something for everybody only because, and only when, they are created by everybody.\u201d The notion of creating and including everybody is appealing to me, and I gather for this reason, an idea was germinating. How can we cooperate and create our communities that support and include autistic people? Is there a way to use Jane Jacob\u2019s model and discuss the pitfalls and possibilities of creating what we need for ourselves, outside of the systems that can sometimes oppress us? Is there a value to doing both? These are some of the questions I have in disability policy. I\u2019d like to use this blog as a little laborartory for discussing these ideas, and for practicing them. In Michael Prince\u2019s paper,  Inclusive City Life: Person\u2019s of Disabilities and the Politics of Difference  (Disability Studies Quarterly), he highlights some of the issues raised by a citizen in an open letter to Canadian politicans:  I used to adore Toronto. As an able-bodied person, it was relatively simple to get around and I appreciated having access to all Toronto had to offer. I didn\u2019t pay attention to the lack of elevators, escalators and ramps. I am 30 years old and have multiple sclerosis now. I am no longer able-bodied but disabled. These days I use a cane or walker to aid my gait, making uncomplicated things more demanding. I now despise Toronto due to its lack of accessibility. I miss the things I once loved and want to enjoy them again but I cannot because establishments are inaccessible. Why am I being penalized for a disease that caused me to become disabled? Why is this kind of discrimination allowed? His article highlights the ideas of various civic leaders and thinkers and some of the issues that confront people with disabilities in cities. One of them he cites is Iris Marion Young, the author of  Justice and the Politics of Difference  to present a series of interesting premises\u2019 in the creation of accessible cities/communities: \u201cIn the city,\u201d writes Young, \u201cpersons and groups interact within spaces and institutions they all experience themselves as belonging to, but without those interactions dissolving into unity of commonness\u201d (1990: 237). Several premises are contained in this statement. One is that people, as individuals and in groups, have the capacity and opportunity to participate and interact with other people. A second is that sufficient and accessible public spaces and institutions exist throughout cities to enable the being together. A democratic politics, Young stresses \u201ccrucially depends on the existence of spaces and forums to which everyone has access\u201d to participate \u2014 to speak, listen and bear witness (1990: 240). A third premise is that such interactions generate common experiences of belonging, a basic component of citizenship according to most commentators on the topic. Certainly, for people with disabilities, these public spaces require supports, services and likely adaptations to enable all to speak, to listen and bear witness, regardless of their abilities and capacities. The fourth premise is that individuals and groups participating in such public places and institutions are able, at the same time, to maintain a sense of their own distinctiveness, special status or group identity. Perspective 4 therefore contains, as do the other perspectives, a number of empirical perquisites, behavioural expectations and normative claims. While the ideals of Jane Jacobs may not as of yet have reached our cities and communities, I think her notion of \u201ccreation by everyone\u201d is a vital link to thinking about how we build them.

{"date": "2013/02/11", "body": "It is interesting to see how many versions of \u201cautism acceptance\u201d there are out there. In my classes, filled with people with various disabilities including autism, autistic people say that they want to be accepted. This generally means that people with the autism label want equality of opportunity and equality of well-being (Rioux, 1999), the latter noting that not all individuals are able to live fully indepedent lives, and that the level of their disability should not take away these rights. Here is how  The Autism Acceptance Project  was acknowledged  in a letter to the United Nations for being but one of the organizations important in the history of autism acceptance:  Paula C. Durbin-Westby, who wanted a corrective to the negative images of autism that have been prevalent in many autism \u201cawareness\u201d media pieces and events during April, organized the first Autism Acceptance Day celebration on April 1, 2011. She wrote that it was pro-neurodiversity, pro-supports and services, against \u201ccures\u201d and not about fundraising or other agendas. Autism Acceptance Day and Autism Acceptance Month quickly became popular in the Autistic community as participants spread the word through Facebook and other media. \n A growing number of organizations and disability rights advocates now participate in Autism Acceptance Day and Autism Acceptance Month observances, which highlight both social acceptance of Autistic people and the need for appropriate supports to enable full participation in the community. Autistic advocates have taken the lead in bringing about this much-needed cultural shift by working for systems change and by sharing our stories and perspectives, not only during the April events but also throughout the year. The acceptance movement was built by autistic individuals who have done the activist work in struggling for understanding of an autistic-point-of-view. This has been lacking in recent years. I will argue, however, that charity, parent and scientific \u201cvoices\u201d are the predominant ones leading the autism discussion and appropriating the term \u201cautism acceptance.\u201d There is also lots written on the philosophy and semiotics of science which demonstrates how our language creates issues and problems, and these are important areas for critical disability research in the field of autism. I think while everyone wants to be accepted, we have to consider decolonizing the notion. The one area of on-going concern is the triviality with which people marry any movement with their own \u201cdo-good\u201d intentions. We are guided by a current economic framework which encourages colonization of people for profit (this can come in many forms). I\u2019m very concerned how young people are encouraged to do charitable work today. I\u2019m not saying here that there\u2019s not work to be done. Yet walking into a university hall, watching young people have a good time in the name of raising money for a cause they have probably not reserached well should be something that we as a society should think about. What about travel charity where students are encouraged to fly in and out of emerging world countries for a week? It\u2019s a complicated matter and these issues have been taken on by others more aware than I am by third-world issues. What we lack is a critical questioning of charity and \u201cacceptance,\u201d particularly when we go forward and create our own definitions of it. Perhaps because or world is growing smaller and denser by the day, we need serious discussions about how we \u201chelp.\u201d  To return to the autism community, for instance, an acceptance campaign movement that focusses on parents as \u201csufferers\u201d and the \u201cmost important\u201d people to talk to in addition to medical professionals, perpetuates the very oppressive, dominant voices that autistic people work so hard  to be heard over.   I don\u2019t think there are \u201cversions\u201d of acceptance out there. There are critical, life-threatening discussions revolving around The Genome Project and who gets the right to decide and just who is important? Who gets to live? The issues extend far beyond the simple act of doing good when, in fact, we might be doing harm. I don\u2019t think those of us who are not autistic have the right to really say what acceptance  is  exactly \u2014  what it means for the community living with the autism label. To add to the matter, the opinions within that community of autistic people are also varied and need to be sorted out. As parents and professionals our role is to engage with these discussions, but by thinking critically and muting our volume. It\u2019s not that parents do not need support. TAAP used to run parent support groups lead by autstic people. I would encourage other organizations and schools to hire autistic people to do this work.  The volume of dominant non-autistic voices leading the movements and charities has been of issue for a long time and we need to understand that we tend to operate under normative perspectives. For me personally, I wake up every day asking myself these questions of how I might be harming when I\u2019m trying to enable and they literally make my stomach clench, and I\u2019m not trying to be self-righteous when I say that. Ah, the perilous business of words. I was thinking of two books this morning regarding these challenges. First, in thinking of the theme of colonization, I extended the notion to colonizing acceptance, which means to say that people are taking the term and skewing it, possibly, to fit their own normative needs and definitions. I was also thinking of organization as a methodology, if you will, and of  Linda Tuhiwai Smith\u2019s  Decolonizing Methodologies. \u201cThe research agenda is conceptualized here as constituting a programme and set of approaches that are situated within the decolonization of politics of the indigenous peoples\u2019 movement. The agenda focused strategically on the goal of self-determination of indigenous peoples. Self-determination in a research agenda becomes something more than a political goal. It becomes the goal of social justice which is expressed through and across a wide range of psychological, social, cultural and economic terrains. It necessarily involves the process of transformation, of decolonization, of healing and of mobilization as peoples\u2026indigenous peoples are deeply cynical about the capacity, motives or methodologies of Western research to deliver any benefits to indigenous peoples whom science has long regarded, indeed has classified as being \u2018not human.'\u201d (pp.116-118).  Smith\u2019s book is used by disability scholars to consider how this translates to the colonization of movements, research and charities which claim to work \u201con behalf of\u201d people with autism in the name of normalizing them, not always for the sake of helping them in their own expressed ways of asking to be enabled and supported in society, or even medically assisted. For parents and all reserachers and supporters, this is an excellent read in terms of how we can enable emancipatory practice as facilitators, not as leaders or experts. This is a must read by all people working in the autism field. I\u2019ve also attached a few links here for those of you interested in the problems with charity and disabiltiy rights:  There are many papers and scholarly work done on the perils of the charity model and disability. Here\u2019s but one I found quickly on the Internet.   Here\u2019s one from Disabilityplanet.co.uk  I would like to extend my future research to discuss the issues of organization within our current economic system, and the challenges we face. Finally, Lisa Cartwright came to mind and her book  Moral Spectatorship.   This book is an important read for organizers, allies and supporters to consider our hands in the arena of autism and respresentation, particularly if we build websites, ad campaigns, autism campaigns and reserach labs. This speaks to the need for interdependence and facilitated support and decision making, and how carefully we must tread. I have a much longer reading list, but let\u2019s start here.  I find her book important to discuss relational ethics in this field.  Here\u2019s a little bit from the introduction to lead you in: \u201cAt the basis of this entire book is a concept of intersubjectivity that Levinas develops, in which the copresence of two hands, belonging to the same body, is extended to the other person. This idea of intersubjectivity as the other person and I as \u2018elements of incorporeity\u2019 and as a \u2018borrowing of myself from the other\u2019 (Levinas, 1993, 100 alluding to Merleau-Ponty) is demonstrated over and over in  Moral Spectatorship  as a relationship into which always enters the problematic of \u2018hands\u2019 that cannot always reach, feel, and express in ways that are intended and desired by either I or the other. The \u2018intropathy of intellectual communication\u2019 theorized by both philosophers is idealized on the basis of a whole body that has the capacity to reach, to touch, to feel in normative ways. This model continually fails in the face of what we might call sensory deficits, or emotional deficits \u2013 or, rather, differences in the organization of sensory and emotional pathways within and between subjects\u2026As I will show throughout this book, to borrow oneself from an other in order to have voice in the world has been regarded with suspicion, has been pathologized, because it proposes a model a subjectivity that flies in the face of the liberal autonomous subject. Dependency and nonisomorphic relationships of power are anathema to notions of the autonomous individual.\u201d  \n Further, \u201cVoice is a central concept throughout this book that is linked to this coproduction of an \u2018I.\u2019 The term \u201cvoice\u201d has a wide range and mix of meanings. The most important one for this work is the political use of the word \u201cvoice\u201d as a figure of speech connoting agency and power\u2026\u2019Coming to voice\u2019 is a figure of speech in a range of political movements connoting the achievement of agency, usually belatedly or through political struggle before which the individual or collective subject who speaks is understood to have been \u2018silent\u2019 or \u2018invisible\u2019\u2026when Kohut (1984,82) described empathy as a kind of \u2018vicarious introspection\u2019 in which one thinks and feels oneself into the inner life of another person, he was referring to the psychoanalyst\u2019s necessary relationship to a client in the process of a cure. This is a fundamentally moral relationship. It is this type of caregiving that structures the relationships of identification and spectatorship discussed\u2026\u201d(introduction). The idea expressed here is that our engagement/relationship in the name of helping or curing is asymmetrical, not equal. We take the normative stance and decide, semiotically, morally and even legally, what is abnormal and needs our remedy. I feel a great responsibility when I consider Cartwright\u2019s premise. I feel responsible as Adam\u2019s parent to enable him by my quiet facilitation and patience, which is not often accepted in this world that sees capacity and competence in terms of independence, or that is impatient for quick words and answers. It is our interdependence that offers arrays of possibility, if autistic \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cagency\u201d is respected and not forced to normalcy when it cannot be forced. In terms of \u201cautism acceptance\u201d being appropriated these days where it\u2019s meaning seems to be erased or essentialized, we have to consider the normative paradigms and the motives behind our design, knowingly or unknowingly. As I write here, with words of course, as a parent and organizer, we have to put ourselves under the lens, not autistic people. We are still at this stage.

{"date": "2012/08/21", "body": "ICT = Information and Communication Technology School is fast approaching and some autistic children get access to inclusive schools and others do not. One of the barriers to inclusion is access to technology and other supports that can enable and autistic person to participate and become successful. Many camps and schools have boycotted the use of iPads for fear it detracts from a student\u2019s attention. Some schools prefer \u201ctraditional\u201d methods, and argue that technology takes away from that experience. In the case for inclusion and access, these are some of the antiquated attitudinal barriers we must work to deconstruct. Many non verbal autistic individuals, and other autistic individuals who learn better with computers for visual reasons as well as reasons to do with less distractive stimuli that can impede learning, need technology (and other accommodations) not just for school, but for vital communication and everyday functioning. In an effort to break down barriers to access, \u201cThe Council of Canadians with Disabilities (CCD), a national organization working for an accessible and inclusive Canada, recently consulted people with disabilities about ICT use and recommendations on barrier removal and prevention.\u201d Although there is a duty to accommodate, most schools and camps will not do so, especially for the autistic person. Here\u2019s some more examples: Stumbling Blocks \nAlthough accessible ICT is available in the marketplace, it can take an incredible amount of self-advocacy and persistence for an individual to obtain it. Doreen Demas, who has vision impairment, discovered this when seeking an accessible cellphone from the Manitoba Telephone System (MTS). For customers without a disability, acquiring a cellphone that meets their needs is a relatively straightforward consumer activity. MTS\u2019s original offer to Doreen was an inaccessible BlackBerry. Over a period of several years, it took numerous frustrating sessions with MTS representatives and a complaint to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for her to obtain a contract, with reasonable terms and conditions, for an accessible iPhone. The CRTC has a policy requiring that Canadian cellphone service providers include an accessible product in their catalogue of devices on offer to the public. \n Some post-secondary students with disabilities encounter barriers related to ICT. While a student intern, who requires large print, may be most comfortable using a particular program to enlarge text, the intern\u2019s field placement agency may think it is reasonable to expect that person to use whatever programs are available on the in-house system. Although educational institutions and employers have a duty to accommodate disability-related needs, individuals continue to struggle to have such accommodations provided. The other barrier is poverty. Most of our disabled population, due to so many barriers to employment and educational institutions, end up living beneath the poverty line. This also make access to essential communication and technologies expensive: Like everything in the marketplace, ICT comes with a price tag. People with disabilities experience a disproportionate level of poverty. People with disabilities of working age are about twice as likely to live on a low income as their counterparts without disabilities. \u201cThere is the assumption that everybody can afford a computer. That\u2019s an assumption. It is not a fact,\u201d says Marie White, Chairperson of CCD\u2019s Social Policy Committee. \u201cOur most challenging issue is poverty.\u201d Some people with disabilities face additional costs because they have to buy ICT, and they also must purchase adaptive technology to make inaccessible technology usable. In some provinces, provincial programs provide people with disabilities access to technology. While some autism organizations endeavour to provide some grants to autistic people for access to iPads and the government subsidizes other communication devices, there are wait lists and rental fees can still be expensive  (you can seek some assistance through the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care). For Adam\u2019s sake and like many other parent advocates, I\u2019ve had to learn a lot about AAC (Assistive Augmentative Communication) and how to use it by myself through courses and \u201cold-fashioned\u201d book-learnng. In turn, I train many of Adam\u2019s teachers and support workers in his use of the iPad and with typing. Finding SLP\u2019s trained well in the field is difficult but necessary, and there are a precious few who do it exceptionally well. While SLP\u2019s are typically trained in \u201cspeech\u201d functioning, there is tremendous value in their teaching to the ways and means of autistic communication, literacy and the use of devices for advancing skills. The device is often referred to as the individual\u2019s own \u201cvoice\u201d or \u201ctalk box,\u201d and should be treated with the same care and respect.  It\u2019s tough to still get people on board at the school level, to see devices as a necessity for many autistic people, and to include them with the same value and respect as we would the voice of any other child. I hope you have some success in using this information when you approach the school boards and other support workers.

{"date": "2012/07/06", "body": "\u201c It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, or how high you rise. One day you will get the call. The question is, how will you respond?\u201d  \u2014 African American U, Senior Administrator Adam left for camp this morning. Last week, he did well at his piano recital. His lessons have been adapted for him \u2014 colour coding left and right hands, bass and treble clef lines, to give a sense of the many adaptations we\u2019ve learned. Not only have we adapted lessons for him so that he may learn in \u201ctypical\u201d ways, but I also asked the teacher to let him explore the piano on his own, as well as have her play for him. I became a musician when I was very young, and a neighbour let me bang away at the keys doing whatever I wanted. I was proud that Adam was able to attend and play well at his recital. I asked that he make his little bow, and sure, everyone thought that was sweet. Afterwards, as there was another special needs person as part of the concert, I was noticing faces as he sang \u2014 his articulation was challenged. I didn\u2019t see gleaming \u201cain\u2019t that sweet\u201d smiles. I saw strained faces. Not until the children who were fluent with well-pitched voices were singing did the \u201cain\u2019t that adorable\u201d look beam as high as the church rafters. That effected me a lot, and I pay attention to these subtleties every day. I don\u2019t think people realize the subversive effects of a mere countenance. I, at least, read faces well. Adam seems to pick up on vibes, but that\u2019s my assumption after knowing him for so long. Last week, Adam was more verbal  \u2014 asking me \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d when I was at work at my desk and he wanted to play. In addition to a successful recital and these questions, we had a \u201cgood\u201d week. Having Adam ask me a rare question is exciting. I am happy when he gets more verbal, types on his iPad, and now, starts to ask me questions. When the camp bus came for a visit last week and Adam got upset afterwards, he typed (independently), \u201cwhy is bus going?\u201d It shows that his world is expanding by his growing ability to communicate. I find myself relieved because I think it will make his life more fulfilling, if not easier in a world that favours the able-bodied and the fluently verbal. Two days after his verbal \u201cspike,\u201d however, something that comes and goes but improves steadily all the time (akin to a graph with a steady climb overall, but with monthly plateaus and slight dips), and also possibly correlating to the end of school, the transition to camp, a possible cold or allergies (get the picture?), Adam began to twitch more and he lost his ability to talk for a couple of days. He is better at being able to type a few words when he is under stress. He couldn\u2019t do that at all before. While I still worry, mostly if I see him uncomfortable when it happens,  I\u2019m getting better at waiting him out. Whatever is effecting him needs to be processed by him in his own way. Within a couple of days, although the twitching slowly abated. He started to smile and become more verbal after a couple of days of the most intense part of it. I really do not understand what is happening to him neurologically and neither does anyone else. Only some autistic people can give me a sense of it. There is no guru or expert or scientist who has truly \u201cdiscovered\u201d what causes Adam to tic and twitch the way he does. We know of similarities in other disabilities. Adam was tested for seizures and at least on the day he was tested, it showed negative. These are but some of the things we don\u2019t fully understand about Adam and what we refer to as his autism. As his mother, I\u2019m well aware of my bias, in spite of my enduring \u201cacceptance\u201d of him. Bias and ideas are so deep-rooted in us that acceptance is something we have to work on every day.  (Boy, would I love to read that caveat in someone\u2019s research paper on autism). As Adam\u2019s mother, I realize that although I love him dearly and accept him as he is, it is still difficult to resist the temptation to praise Adam\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d feats and accomplishments only, and not recognize his autistic ones. Like all of us, we are under such a strong ableist or \u201cnormalist\u201d influence that we don\u2019t praise, cite, recognize autistic-ness as often as we need to. We need so much more of a new kind of autism research \u2014 one that captures autistic accomplishment without sensationalizing autism. Too often any achievement by an autistic individual gets refered to as \u201cgenius.\u201d While in some cases in may be extraordinary, we do this because we are still not looking at autism as a whole in the way we should look at all of humanity. We fracture autism into little bits and pieces as much as we end up doing people. When I attended  Autreat  too long ago now (I am due for a revisit), I purchased fifteen years of workshop notes and presentations. I remember when I attended being giddy that there were workshops for autistic kids on how to make their own stim toys. Autreat, founded by Jim Sinclair, who is also autistic, is run by and for autistic people.  For months now since he started in an autism school especiallly, despite my praise of Adam for his feats, I still wonder how I can nurture his autistic-self. So I went downstairs and dug the old material up. Here\u2019s a clue of what I wish to study more about:  How to Play With Dolls: For Kids and Adults Jim Sinclair, disability educator and consultant, coordinator of Autism Network International \n For purposes of this workshop, a \u201cdoll\u201d may be any inanimate object that we play with by imagining it to have aspects of personhood. This includes the traditional toy-human type of doll, as well as toy animals, and any other toys or objects that our imaginations transform into living entities. In this intergenerational workshop, we will share and explore different ways that autistic people can use doll play for fun and for learning, and ways that parents, educators, and therapists can use doll play to help autistic people in developing skills and understanding\u2026\u201d \n Music: What Is It, What Does It Mean To Us, and How Can We Use It? \nKatja Gottschewski, musician and music therapist, Bodo, Norway \n In this workshop, we will explore different aspects of music. We will look at differences and similarities in how we as individuals or as AC\u2019s and NT\u2019s [autistics and neurotypicals] define and experience music. It will be discussed how we can communicate through music. How is music different than language? Can music be a bridge between AC\u2019s and NT\u2019s? Understanding How Plants Can Facilitate Connection in Autistic Children and Adults \nGeorge Salamunec, HTR, COTA/L, Certified Master Gardener, Susan Golubock, M.Ed., OTR/L \nAutreat 2004 \n Working with, and understanding about, plants can be an effective tool for developing the senses, reducing stress, and learning to make new connections in autistic children and adults. Matching plants to one\u2019s personality and needs is an important first step. Plants provide opportunities for autistic children to explore life, nurturing, modulation, non aggressive options and choices for dealing with natural adversities, and why learning about other life (and people) outside of ourselves is so important\u2026 Making Employment Fit: Accommodations and Other Dirty Words \nJoel Smith, Autreat 2004 \n Employment is difficult for many autistic people. We are square pegs who dont fit nicely into round holes. Rather than forcing the autistic into a job, would it be possible to change the job to better fit the autistic? In this presentation, ideas and real-life examples are presented of how jobs can be modified to best accommodate autistic sensitivities. We will also discuss how to modify your job without alientating your boss and co-workers. That was from Autreat 2000 and 2004. Twelve years later, I am concerned (especially after attending  IMFAR ), how we hardly research autistic ways of being. We usually do it framed in a bias \u2014 comparative research against the \u201cnormal,\u201d population. We really don\u2019t value what makes up the true and different, \u201cnot less,\u201d accomplishments of the autistic person. I\u2019ve read blogs where \u201cexperts\u201d bluntly claim that there is \u201cno value\u201d in lining objects up. I\u2019m not going to target the scientist specifically here, but I wonder how many readers of this may have at one time or another thought the same thing? Other than people like Temple Grandin, how can we all study the value of object-organization and how that is transferable into learning at school and later, in the workplace? I don\u2019t think this is a trivial skill that needs to be solely relegated to the OCD side of the human column. Just because we don\u2019t see the value doesn\u2019t mean it ain\u2019t there. We don\u2019t understand. We are viewing under a comparative, normal versus abnormal one, and that\u2019s so limiting. While I try to make the \u201cleast dangerous assumption,\u201d a term first coined by Dr. Anne Donnellan, I realize that I must  work  to continue to see Adam for who he is in all contexts. It\u2019s a absolute daily task and obligation of mine as his parent. I wake up every morning thinking about this, more than I pander to alarmism. In fact, next time an autism commercial brings you to tears, please ask what buttons are being pressed and why, and if there\u2019s a better way to achieve a quality of life for us all? I\u2019m also reading Anne Donnellan and Martha Leary\u2019s newly released book  Autism: Sensory-Movement Difference and Diversity  and I would highly recommend it. I liked especially this example: According to Oliver Sack\u2019s book,  Seeing Voices , in learning sign in infancy he will develop brain patterns remarkably different from his \u2018normal\u2019 peers. And he will continue to develop in different ways, but we can in no way call those differences \u2018deficiencies.\u2019 He will develop different social and cultural skills. If given the most standardized IQ tests, even with a signing interpreter, he will perform differently, and possibly less well, than his speaking/hearing peers. On tests that tap the developmental experiences of deaf people he would probably score far higher than his hearing friends. Yet it is no surprise but nonetheless sad to learn that for decades deaf children were routinely diagnosed as mentally retarded. Still today, they are often considered to have diminished capacity relative to their hearing peers, even when we clearly know that they can flourish if given the appropriate education and experiences. (p. 33). Consider that, for the deaf which we think we\u2019ve come, arguably, to understand and accept, of how far behind we are in autism to apply this level of consideration. Think how far behind!  Thankfully, a small pool (and I hope a growing one) of researchers are taking up this call. In Steven Kapp\u2019s (et al) paper  Deficit, Difference of Both? Autism and Neurodiversity , there is also a call to discover the state of autism acceptance and \u201cpotential areas of common ground in research and practice regarding [how] autism [is] discussed.\u201d  Scientists, working with the community, can help stakeholders with competing agendas make informed choices between rights, responsibilities, and needs at personal, social, and political levels by affirming that diverse societies respect multiple perspectives. I\u2019d like to see us all work towards the question of how to nurture autistic strengths and learning and balancing the real need to cope in this world as a minority, as well as continuing to value autistic contribution and being in society. A Whole Better World  \nAutreat, May 2000, \nClay Adams \n I can imagine a whole better world, \nWhere people don\u2019t laugh at each other\u2019s pain \nA world where the sun shines on every one \nAnd one\u2019s well-being is everyone\u2019s gain \n Must we, in fact, feed off each other? \nFool the unwary, to sell our wares?

Parents should be the base of not just survival, but of love. When we entrust schools to care for our children, it is disturbing to see how long Matthew Israel and others have defended the use of painful shock treatment because it\u2019s \u201ceffective.\u201d Sure it is. Abusers can get children to submit to anything with the infliction of pain.  It\u2019s just wrong. Yet my version of black and white becomes perplexingly gray in the name of what\u2019s effective for \u201cthese kids\u201d  \u2014 these \u201cautistic/emotional challenged kids.\u201d It leads me to wonder where the line is drawn. While The Judge Rotenberg Center is the extreme of how to \u201cnormalize\u201d behaviour or allegedly stop self-injury, the implications of how we view autism, the meaning and communication of behaviours, and how we value autistic people become more insidious with what we see there. As a more common example or possibility, what of the autistic child who may come out of any school who can\u2019t speak, but may have mysterious marks on their body? There are no cameras in other autism schools that I\u2019m aware of. Shouldn\u2019t we, as parents and community, have the right to see what\u2019s going on when our children can\u2019t tell us for themselves?  I think all of us parents and teachers who love to teach, need to advocate for full transparency. We need cameras in classrooms, perhaps even webcams. Schools can protect themselves from teachers who may not be able to handle a situation well.  If we believe in the value of autistic people, even with the challenges, transparency should not be an issue at all. We grow and become better with it. For any therapist or teacher who may wonder why we autism parents fret every single day, it is because of not only stories like these at the Judge Rotenberg Center, but because our children cannot tell us how they are being treated. If we think of a typical child, they come home and tell their parents who is nice, who they don\u2019t like, and who may be bullying them. It is their intrinsic right to express themselves. For children who have more difficulty doing so, it is their right to be protected. I, for one, will advocate for cameras in the classroom and the stop of abuse of autistic children.

{"date": "2012/06/21", "body": "Should I be looking over my shoulder? As autism mom and son are confronted with many obstacles, feeling settled seems like something that will be stolen from us at any moment. Nevertheless, I\u2019m going to write about how happy I feel today because I recollect the difficult June we had last year when Adam\u2019s former school shut down his class. They tried to place him elsewhere after we were given notice, but it didn\u2019t work out. We scrambled to find Adam a new school, and that school is an ABA school. I fretted, of course. While we\u2019ve always done some ABA alongside play-based and other programs that were very effective in Adam\u2019s early years, we had good and not-so-good experiences. I learned that no matter what form of \u201ctherapy,\u201d you decide to use for your child, it can all go south if people believe autism can be cured, or that autism is something that is an unfortunate act of nature (or whatever). Adam is a person-first and there is a fine line between nurturing the person \u2014 their strengths and challenges \u2014 versus viewing autism as just a \u201cproblem\u201d that should be fixed at any cost.  I realized during a camp meeting today that it is a year later since the difficulties of the last one. After working with the head of Adam\u2019s school, I feel we\u2019ve got a pretty good thing going. We\u2019ve worked together and with Adam\u2019s excellent team which has been quilted together over the past decade. I am able to provide a lot of input, and Adam\u2019s team go into the school to contribute to his typed communication, and other needs. Along with the structure that his type of school can provide, this is what makes it work for us because we can bring in the academic programs that Adam also needs and they are customized. We cobble our program together. Adam seems more relaxed, cooperative, happier, and it feels like he\u2019s getting ready to spread his wings a bit farther. Every day, Adam takes his own iPad pictures and sends me an indepedently written recount of his day. I get this by email. I sometimes send pictures to the school of things they don\u2019t know anything about, and Adam recounts his weekend activities, for instance, on his own. They are still short sentences, and some days they are more detailed than others, but they are his. He has moved beyond sight-reading to phonetic reading and spelling, and this is pretty huge. He approaches his peers and wants to play with them in the way he never has before. He doesn\u2019t know how yet to ask \u201cplay with me,\u201d but it\u2019s the first time he consistently wants to be with other kids, and not just the adults. We have our mini-conversations on our way home from school in the car, and on some days, he sustains his eye contact and talks to me with such engagement and intention that he commands mine. He still struggles with spoken language, but he speaks a lot more now and it always improves, although he is inconsistent. I know this sounds confusing, but Adam is complex. He says some pretty neat and funny stuff too, attesting to his sense of humour. It\u2019s amazing what the man of few words is able to communicate and make us understand. Today at the camp meeting \u2014 an inclusive camp \u2014 it was pure pleasure seeing everyone so excited to see Adam again. This is a camp that really cares about accommodating him and communicates well with us. I thanked my lucky stars to have such a wonderful group of people helping us out every single day as I sat around the table. For all the mountains I feel we climb, I just want to savour this.  I want to thank all the fabulous people who make this happen for Adam which seems like a stark contrast to what the public system will offer us. In such good moments, I feel I must remind myself of how important it is to change the way we approach public education for autistic children. It is so disappointing how  the system wants to cut back Educational Assistants here in Toronto, and Special Ed , and inclusion seems a priviledge for the verbal and \u201cwell-behaved.\u201d The system is sick, not autistic children. I keep wondering why the cut-backs here, and have to assume (lest I use a less polite word) it\u2019s because of the \u201ccost,\u201d and the doubt that autistic people can contribute or be of any value to society\u2013 a ratio that tips the economic scales against us. It seems to boil down to that. To close, I end with a more optimistic tone \u2014 how the camp head revealed that many counsellors asked to work with Adam this year. Apparently, so many people at camp always want to come over and say hello to Adam that they have to ask them to hold off in order that Adam can get on with what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s like a \u201ccamp celebrity\u201d (their words, not mine). Here\u2019s a kid who can\u2019t speak fluently and who has many challenges; a child for whom standardized tests do not serve, and the public system underestimates.  This morning, Adam was chanting \u201cHappy OM,\u201d before he left for school, and I for the camp meeting. I didn\u2019t know it was prophetic about the day so far. I hope for other positive signs. Happy OM\u2026happy OM\u2026.happy OMMMM.

{"date": "2012/07/10", "body": "I have a comment on comments, either in comment boxes or full blog posts about other writers and bloggers. Usually I won\u2019t write about it, but I decided to write in my own defence. In so doing, I\u2019ve had other thoughts about the various ways of being excluded, as either autistic people, or as autistic allies.  Recently, I did a self-search on Google. I am sad to say that I get used to disrespetful commenters who seem to create a narrative about me that is unfamiliar to me.  I am also delighted, however, by comments that build upon a constructive dialogue about autism and disabiltiy and how we can remove the barriers for autistic individuals. I happen-stanced upon a post from 2008 about my blog \u2014 that mostly I \u201cget it right,\u201d but advocate for doing \u201cnothing\u201d for the autistic person.  If you\u2019ve been reading my blog since 2005 I\u2019ve done nothing but critically evaluate everything that Adam and I have come across in terms of therapy, education, autistic/social value, and opportunities, and the lack thereof. While the nature of blogs has changed since 2005, many of which have become syndicated journalism, I\u2019ve kept mine in journal-mode, writing about my own growth and development as an autism parent to my beloved Adam. Adam has been in \u201ctherapy\u201d since he\u2019s been 20 months of age and I have reams of notes and binders I have taken to create his programs, track his progress, develop his plans.  I have created his programs along with other professionals that use ABA, RDI, Floortime and other methods. I have a decade of experience of autism education and various therapies, many of them dubious. I\u2019ve witnessed improvements in the field where I continue to have a watchful eye. I predicted that we would be forced into an ABA program, and here we are, in an segregated school for autistic children. Not that it\u2019s a \u201cbad\u201d thing. I am actually grateful not to be in a system that completely disregards him, but is set up more  for  him. Adam, for now, is happy there and he is learning, but it\u2019s a fact that it\u2019s still exclusion which we mitigate with other inclusive programs. ABA is something that we\u2019ve had to contribute to improve upon because it\u2019s really hard to change the system. To me it is in part a method and in part a label for a type of education that in some schools, uses other methods in addition to it. Adam and I have to \u201cfit\u201d into a mold and make it the best for him \u2014 those are our barriers and limitations for now. We work to fill in the gaps ourselves. I learned and taught Adam how to type\u2026by myself \u2014 by reading, studying and consulting others who have other expertise to add.  Now his school builds upon what I started. Recently, I was asked to write a book about it, and may do so after this year of finishing my M.A. in Critical Disability Studies. I have now five years of typed dialogues between Adam and myself, methods and back story of how it all began. He would never had had this opportunity had I not taken his education and communication upon myself, and I\u2019m not shy to admit it because I hope it will become more mainstream. I am not alone in this among many autism parents. We make our own roads and  other parents will share the work they\u2019ve done. We still work towards Inclusion, but  when I made a recent query within the public system, as  predicted, it ended up that Adam would be put in the \u201clowest functioning class\u201d (their term, not mine). His cognition and \u201ccapacity\u201d was determined by his limited verbal ability and results on standardized tests (which we know do not befit the autistic person as much as a dyslexic person cannot read typical text).  How many students in these classes, no matter what their label, are not getting the education they deserve? Whose to decide on someone\u2019s functioning level and \u201ccapacity\u201d when we give unsuitable tests? Who has the right to decide who is normal and abnormal and how do semantics and labels effect people\u2019s lives?  Finally, if we decide to write off a \u201cclass\u201d of people from the get-go, where do we end up? We are all effected, autistic or not. How we treat our collective members of society is a reflection of how we think about ourselves. It seems there is a group of people who don\u2019t understand (or want to set others astray) on the meaning of neurodiversity, which basically acknowledges that different people have different neurologies that make them learn and interact in the world in various ways.  Myths are spun because it is assumed that if we \u201cembrace\u201d autistic people (some of us have been labeled \u201cNeurodiversity Advocates\u201d in a negative context) it will not serve their politics. I suppose, in the system we currently have which are so exclusive and politically limiting to us, we can understand the method, but I think it\u2019s ultimately detrimental. An exclusive, \u201ctragic\u201d and medical approach to disability limits community membership and opportunity. Until recently, as autism parents, we have had to feed into the \u201cautism tragedy\u201d model in the belief that this is the only way to garner financial support and services. Despite inroads against the medical and disability-is-tragic models, there are many new parenting studies which seem intent on proving that autism causes families to break apart, which to-date, cannot be proven. This is another way of excluding autistic people and their families \u2014 by seeking something to blame, researching etiology and causation instead of spending money on understanding autistic individuals and bettering their quality of life. If we accept and believe in our children and don\u2019t get tragically depressed, we are written off (as I have been on numerous ocassions) as being in denial. I have been labled a neglectful parent, and a \u201cmental case,\u201d (a revelation of the prejudiced inclination of the autism \u201cadvocate\u201d who stated that about me).\u201dThose who stray from the this prescribed script [the tragic or depression 5-staged model from grief to acceptance] \u2014 for example, by not being as depressed as predicted \u2014 run the risk of being regarded as in a state of denial and in need of further psychological guidance and counselling (Oliver, 1995; Reeve, 2000; S. Wilson, 2003).\u201d I think life is all about struggle and we have to work with it. Nevertheless, when we write publically, we leave ourselves open to criticism of all kinds. I embrace that too, but I will also take it on. It has been challenging to write this blog for the past few years. I\u2019m not allowed, according to some autism parents, to take joy in my son for who he is as an autistic person. My own ups and downs are disregarded if I do not publically lament in the same  fashion as everyone else. I opted not to do this because I always kept my son and his community in mind. If I were an autistic person, I thought, how might I wish to be regarded? I don\u2019t criticize others for their depression because each one of us has to take our own unique journey. I simply believe that I, personally, have to exercise a discipline in my thoughts and feelings, which is not to say I don\u2019t have the same kind as everyone else. I have imposed this upon myself. I have always kept Adam in mind when writing publically because I believe one day he may read this. I also wish to embrace and listen to the autistic community (that is, autistic people). It\u2019s unfortunate when others feel they have to \u201cspin\u201d for political reasons or their own benefit. The other political debates and controversies lie in semantics and definitions. Words are important as they reflect our thoughts about the way in which we see ourselves. We work against traditional systems that have to-date, been oppressive and exclusive agianst the disabled. Paul Hunt first challenged what we call today \u2018abelism\u2019 (a society that favours the able-bodied), in his 1966 book,  Stigma: The Experience Of Disability .  He said, \u201cWe are challenging society to take account of us, to listen to what we have to say, to acknowledge us as an integral part of society itself. We do not want ourselves, or anyone else, treated as second-class citizens, and put away out of sight and mind.\u201d (p. 158). The Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) was formed in 1974.  They re-defined the distinction between \u201cimpairment\u2019 and \u201cdisability\u201d as part of their mandate to \u201ccriticize organizations control-led by non-disabled \u2018experts\u2019 for their failure to address the social barriers central to disabled people\u2019s exclusion from mainstream economic and social activity and their lack of accountability to the disabled community.\u201d (p.29) \u2013  impairment : lacking part of all of a limb, or having a defective limb, organisim or mechanism of the body; \n \u2013  disability : the disadvantage or restriction of activity caused by a contemporary social organization which takes no or little account of people who have physical impairments and thus excludes them from participation in the mainstream of social activities. (UPIAS 1976z, p. 14). \n This social model approach breaks the traditional causal link between impairment and disability. The \u2018reality\u2019 of impairment is not denied, but it is not necessarily a sufficient condition of disability.(p. 30). Writing about autism as a joy, my absolute love of my son for who he is, my personal struggles without pandering to the pressure to lament in typical ways while embracing other\u2019s need to make their own unique autism journey, is about inclusion of everyone. It begins with the fundamental acceptance and belief, however, that all autistic individuals are worthy and valuable members of our collective. It\u2019s a necessary premise. The social model is not about showing that every dysfunction in our bodies can be compensated for by a gadget, or good design, so that everybody can work an 8-hour day and play badminton in the evenings. It\u2019s a way of demonstrating that everyone \u2014 even someone who has no movement, no sensory function and who is going to die tomorrow \u2014 has the right to a certain standard of living and be treated with respect.

I don\u2019t take video because I want to be there in the moment with him, not \u2018virtually there\u2019 by making sure I got great photos. Grandfather is better at that anyway. When his teacher called him up to play (she\u2019s standing behind him in the photo)  The Muffin Man  he walked up to the Grand Piano and played. Save for a few glances towards swirling fans high above in the church\u2019s ceiling, he got through it just fine. Two years ago he was completely distracted by a piano painted with butterflies, a \u201chey this is cool\u2026 nope wait\u2026 hey look at that one\u201d distraction that derailed his performance. I never took him to the site ahead of time to get used to it.  Live and learn. Adam can read his notes now and play with both hands. We started by colour coding his hands and the keyboard and notes with numbers and moved on from there. Now he\u2019s learning his half notes and on we go, thanks also to his patient teacher and her assistant, Adam\u2019s grandmother, who does exceptional preparation for Adam\u2019s lessons. Just before the concert, I kept Adam quiet and well fed. I wrote a quick schedule by hand listing the things we were going to do to prepare for the afternoon and we re-read it together. Then we practiced ahead of time \u2014 the walk, the playing, the bow. We arrived thirty minutes before the concert to walk inside and outside the building. He pulled at me when we arrived, wanting to explore. I purposefully stopped many times in hallways with lots of doors, which has caused Adam him lots of anxiety in the past \u2014 a compulsion to run off and open them. I then asked him to wait and talked him through it all quietly. I checked my phone, dug around his bag and I didn\u2019t hold on to Adam\u2019s hand. He waited with me even though I could feel he wanted to move on. When Adam calmly explored, and knew that he was going to get the chance with me, he was cool. He also accepted change of direction and areas that were off limits. By the time it was time to sit down in his row for the performance, Adam was just fine. The sanctuary was hushed. He sat for the entire performance, bored sometimes and clapped others. When one of the boys got a little talkative, Adam laughed and wanted to talk back by repeating the last word he heard, \u201cagain.\u201d  He\u2019s a giddy rule-breaker at heart.

As we\u2019ve both been recuperating on opposite ends of the couch \u2014 me with my copy of Betty ,  The Fountain of Age , and Adam with his iPad \u2014 I\u2019ve been thinking what I saw at IMFAR and what I read on Facebook, and all the articles I read about autism. All that fretting and advice on what to do and what not to do, parents can drown in this stuff.  I offer a small insight to keep us afloat. One of the sessions at IMFAR was about how the use of computers is bad for autistic children because it takes away from socialization. We seem to really fret about keeping our children engaged all of the time, and we particularly target the autistic ones. This post is about just letting things be some of the time. As I tell everyone these days, we are \u201cnormally autistic\u201d around here. During our last two days on the couch, Adam keeps checking in on me. He smiles, he tells me his ears and mouth hurt (his words). In between watching meaningless movies to eat up the hours, and when I have the energy to re-read Betty\u2019s take on the media\u2019s representation of the ageing population as a \u201cburden\u201d (ugh), I\u2019m watching Adam and how he uses all this free time. He\u2019s cuddly, he has watched a few meaningless videos, tutorials on YouTube on the game Mindcraft, and he has been making up his own words on his iPad \u2014 \u201chotgod,\u201d and \u201ciceswim,\u201d among others. He\u2019s checked out his math programs, and tries hard, without my prodding, to draw shapes on it (he is particularly challenged with fine motor here unless he uses a weighted pencil). My child who required supported communication and who was once \u201ca sight reader,\u201d now spells phonetically and types independently. My child who has limited verbal ability can navigate Mindcraft and the Web. My child who \u201cneeds to be engaged all the time,\u201d has used his time, well, pretty much the way I have.

{"date": "2012/05/29", "body": "At IMFAR and with other researchers I meet, I am confronted with many requests to participate in \u201cparent studies.\u201d The purpose is to study what levels of stress, and how different it is to parent and autistic child.  I am reticient to participate. What about parenting are the researchers trying to find? Are we attempting to affirm that life is harder with an autistic child? Of course, we have to ask what the researchers are hoping to find. Is the purpose to support parents, the autistic child, or both? Or is there a more insidious angle to this kind of research, that is to say, that autism itself is the problem? I know, that may sound blunt and provocative, but think about it. To what end are we really getting on with the business of helping autistic people contribute to society as autistic people? How are we really helping autistic people and their families with their quality of life? Honestly, I don\u2019t see the purpose in trying to affirm that life might be tougher with an autistic child in it, and  I\u2019ve written about that with the unconfirmed (by research) assumption that autism is the cause of increasing divorce rates here.  All I know is that when Adam is happy and accommodated, I am very happy. If he is excluded, I too feel isolated. What is it that makes the perception of life harder, then? What about society could assist in supporting us all? These are some of the questions I wish the research would tackle. A few parents and some commenters on other blog posts have stated that some parents, myself included, are in a state of denial by insisting that we find joy in our children. Asserting that your child is a joy is not a denial of the challenges that we all face. The act of assertion is the affirmation that our children\u2019s lives are important and valuable. On all counts, Adam has been my greatest joy. Yes, I get stressed in trying to understand his discomfort. No parent wants to see their child in distress, and we can focus on that in some of our research.  Most of the stress we faced lived in incompatible circumstances. Once I could see that our environment had to be calm, and that there was no time for compromise with people who had no interest in supporting us, life became a little smoother. I\u2019ve had four years to wrap ourselves in the warmth of the people who really care about us. Let\u2019s face it, our plates are full and we don\u2019t have time for everyone. Energy must be spent wisely.  I dont\u2019 like to give advice, but I\u2019ve had a few thoughts over the past few years about parenting an autistic child. If there is parenting stress, perhaps evaluate the other underlying factors that could be relating to the stress instead of just focussing on the autistic person in the family. This would include all of your relationships, including the one with yourself. Think about how you communicate about autism, and consider changing your thought patterns, attitude and language surrounding it. I know that as a mom of Adam, I\u2019ve had to work, and continue to work, daily at my expectations and putting them in check. I look at my own anxiety levels and what I do to add or detract from the stress. Even when I\u2019m at my limit, I accept bad thoughts and let them go through me. I express them in private and then my head is clear again to see Adam for the beautiful boy he is. My attitude is very important. Loving and accepting Adam has also helped me to love and accept myself, which wasn\u2019t (and sometimes still isn\u2019t easy). Yet what\u2019s the point in having a double standard? When others have accused me of being in denial of other people\u2019s stress or autism itself, I came to learn that my approach was my way, the way I was raised  and  my survival mechanism. There is absolutely no one who can tell you how you should raise your autistic child, and the assistance out there is on the journey as much as we are as parents. And, by the way, we all have a right to enjoy our children for who and what they are! It is up to us completely to advocate for our children \u2014 our right to have and enjoy them, to be included in society, for a good and suitable education, for accommodation, for respect, equality, and excellent opportunities and living environments into our children\u2019s adulthood. There\u2019s no getting around it and no excuses. It sucks some days, but we can\u2019t complain. We have to stick together and stop the urge of research and the typical population to pity us. Pity won\u2019t get is the services we deserve. If we continue on the path, we\u2019ll just get the dusty old van and the group home. Not to knock some of the individuals there who sacrafice and provide for our children on a daily basis. It\u2019s just that I think people with disabilities don\u2019t deserve dusty vans and the poverty line. I just think we all deserve better. Parents feel stress because of the lack of support, accommodation and acceptance. We feel it because we are stared out in the check-out line, or at the park, or while waiting to get into school. We feel it when someone marks \u201cretard\u201d on the picnic table outside our kid\u2019s school. Can you add ot the list? Yes, our children indeed have challenges. Stigma makes these challenges a whole lot more difficult. Now think of how the autistic person must feel. On the up side, there are many couples and single parents who have found their niche and who have pulled together with stronger families because of the challenges that an Abelist society brings to us every day. There are friends who really pull for us and who believe in us as a whole, not a fractured, family. There are people rooting for us in every way. Here\u2019s where to put our focus. I have only one child. Sometimes I think the time I spend on Adam may be like raising a group of children, but he\u2019s worth it. He\u2019s worth doing the IEP, organizing programs, doing advocacy work, managing teams, people because there are so few autism services and programs suited for the autistic person. It\u2019s like inventing the wheel over here.  I don\u2019t have to manage the jealousies of same-aged siblings who don\u2019t understand why so much more time is spent with the special-needs child in the house, and even the sudden \u201cadult\u201d responsibilities they may feel. I know of many parents who do. We all have our own package of issues, though. I hope that researchers doing parent-studies have these points in mind. Society\u2019s view of disability has a great deal to do with how we parent, how we view our lives, how we convey autism and disability to our communities and future generations, and how we are supported. It\u2019s not the fault of autism or the autistic child. We must be so cautious in slanting any research in this direction.

{"date": "2012/03/25", "body": "I\u2019ve got days when I worry about Adam and how his distress is for him. The one thing that\u2019s the most difficult for me to cope with as a parent is watching my son go through distress. Any parent wants to take a cold or the \u201cthing\u201d that\u2019s distressing unto themselves instead of on their child.  As I try to experience the journey with Adam, I\u2019m going out for a jog for him (he\u2019s with his dad this weekend). It\u2019s part of my new regime of not just being with him, but helping him cope with his buzzing, moving body. I\u2019m running as fast I can so I can be with him.  I was really upset with myself on Thursday. Typically, we go to a grocery store after school and we try to do a different errand every day. When we went to the store, Adam reached for the candy. I let him put in in the basket. When he wasn\u2019t looking, I put the candy back on the shelf. I\u2019ve done it before and he hadn\u2019t noticed. Did I think that he just misses things? Had I devolved to that? We continued our shopping for healthy food and went to our usual check out lady, Leda, who always has time for Adam. Leda is like my island of calm and acceptance at the checkout as more people stare at us lately. We chit chat and she talks to Adam in between his jumping and hand-flapping. I\u2019m not going to stop Adam from hand-flapping (although there\u2019s enough pressure from those glaring eyes that I often think about it) and there\u2019s no reason to explain him in a check-out line, so people will just have to deal with it, okay? Sometimes if Adam\u2019s hands are occupied, he won\u2019t flap, but there\u2019s something in me that hates doing that for the sake of not being stared at!  This is but one aspect of Abelism we live with every day.  When we got home, Adam helped me carry the grocery bags into the house. He\u2019s good with hauling weight now and I think it must be good for his active, buzzing body. \u201cGroceries!\u201d he implored and the crinkling of plastic bags sounded urgent. Adam looked through every bag over and over again. \u201cGrocery bag!\u201d he said, looking at me, then quickly moving on in his search. I realized he was looking for the bird-egg blue gummies he found on the shelf.  When he couldn\u2019t find them, he began rummaging through all my kitchen cupboards, since I tend to hide food in odd places so he won\u2019t keep eating the junk. \u201cOh Adam, I didn\u2019t buy the gummies. I put them back,\u201d I said. He wasn\u2019t satisfied, and kept looking. \u201cNo Adam, mummy didn\u2019t buy the candy,\u201d as I tried to stop his frenzied body from moving fast from cupboard to cupboard.  Adam\u2019s face looked desperate, his anxiety mounted quickly and I was worried. \u201cHere Adam, we have lots of candy. Have a gummy bear.\u201d I pulled them from the top shelf, hoping this would satisfy him and I could sit him down to dinner, because when he\u2019s hungry, he becomes more anxious. He pushed them away. \u201cNo\u2026.groceries!\u201d he insisted. He tailspinned.  I felt horrible. How could I have been so sneaky and put something back on the shelf without telling him either  no , or showing him I was putting it back? I know I have to always work on myself as autism mom, no matter how much I think I accept my son. I have to respect him more. During the flatspin, though, I found the parachute. It was music. When I could coax his writhing, lanky body onto my knee, I held him and sang. I got a smile. Then, we ate dinner.

{"date": "2012/03/11", "body": "Adam jumped up and down in the airport waiting area, furiously flapping his hands over his head and humming loudly.  \u201cGo ahead, Adam,\u201d I said with people looking but trying not to stare. You know what I mean. People are generally pretty good about it. Human beings are wired to pay attention to the distressed, and we take it on when others are not feeling well. \u201cJump now because on the plane we will have to sit,\u201d I muttered out loud. There is part of me that needs to justify his actions. I want to \u201cgive permission,\u201d to validate it. I feel if I responded aversely for the sake of sparing everyone else, I would increase the anxiety in the room for everyone, and I\u2019d stigmatize my own son. I\u2019m always trying to do right by Adam. I\u2019m not sure if this was right, though. I wonder if I should just let it be and not say anything, which I then did for the rest of the delay. I felt the pressure of the eyes upon us.  Watching my son\u2019s anxiety ratchet up isn\u2019t easy. I like to solve all of his problems for him, I\u2019ll admit. Yet here in public, I had to let him be, and guide him when I could. There was little I could say or do to appease this anxiety \u2014 this need for him to just arrive and walk right on the plane. I turned on the Timer on his iPad. That worked for a bit. A walk, the bathroom, a treat at the store. Our bag of tricks and distractions wasn\u2019t working in the usual way. Trying to explain the reasons for the flight delay didn\u2019t seem to help. It just made Adam angrier. He understood what I was saying. He just didn\u2019t like it. For a brief moment, I absorbed the negative part of anxiety. I stopped myself from getting angry and firmly asked, \u201cAdam do you want to get on the plane, or go home?\u201d I don\u2019t usually give up, but I was about to this time. He stopped jumping with his square Buzz Light Year lunch box flapping in his right hand while his left was in the air.  \u201cGet on the plane!\u201d He looked at me assertively. He was certain. \u201cThat\u2019s clear,\u201d I said. So we moved to the front of the line. The attendants were understanding and scanned our tickets.  \u201cWe\u2019re not quite ready for you to board. It may be another ten minutes,\u201d said the male attendant. He smiled empathetically. Adam stood squarely facing the long walkway that leads to the airplane door. He could have bolted down but he didn\u2019t, and I was not about to hold him back. I simply coached him in a very soft voice that no one else could hear: \u201cWe can go soon Adam, when the man tells us we can go. We have to wait here until the man tells us we can go.\u201d I repeated like a soft Buddhist chant. As I stood behind Adam, his lunchbox looking like a little briefcase, I had a flash vision of him as a young man. I began thinking of the times he will face delays, and not getting what he wants when he needs it. Likely, an expression of seriousness passed over me. I was thinking of how now is the time I really have to focus on helping Adam with patience and the many inevitable delays and disappointments of life. As I wondered if I was up for the task, I was looking at all the other faces in the waiting area; all the impatient ones. Adam manifested the frustration of everyone in that room. Maybe we say he hasn\u2019t learned to \u201cemotionally regulate,\u201d but we all have to continue to practice patience. \u201cOkay you can go,\u201d said the attendant, finally.  Adam walked calmly down the corridor and once to his seat, he was all smiles.

{"date": "2012/03/19", "body": "Adam is going through another phase and it\u2019s time for me to be very hands-on again \u2014 new routines that may help his body and anxiety. He\u2019s entering the pre-teen phase, and discovering things that can get him into trouble. I\u2019ve started a running routine with Adam which helps his body calm down. Adam likes to jog (see photo). Yet like the time when we moved homes and Adam started severe spasming, he is now getting physically stuck \u2014 his body won\u2019t let him get beyond a repeated movement. I can hear Adam start to whimper and I\u2019m right there. Last night, it quickly became a loud cry. His face looked distressed and it took me a while to get him out of his chair. \u201cAre you stuck?\u201d I asked \u201cYes!\u201d he yelled. Adam is not always able to respond when he\u2019s experiencing this.  He looked into my eyes, his body all sweaty, cheeks reddening. He let me hug him one moment, and pushed me away the next. I wanted to cry with him.  \u201cOne, two, three, four\u2026walking out the door we go.\u201d I sang my usual  Feist tune  which helps Adam move. Sometimes I hear him using it himself, which is a good sign that he can somedays. We make it to the shower where he has a \u201chelp me\u201d look in his eye. He cried hard and I held him close.  My heart breaks when he\u2019s like this. Sometimes I get scared and I have to leave the room. I have to collect myself so I can comfort him, which I managed to do last night.  Many times Adam will need to take a toy from on room in order to move on to the next thing. This he will do when he\u2019s calmer but I realized it was a way for him to manage transitions, so I encourage it. The distress, though \u2014  is it the new teeth punching through his gums? The lack of routine from vacation (he usually loves his vacation)? Growing pains? Another issue he cannot yet tell me about? These are some of the things we must guess as parents when communication falls apart. Sometimes he can speak in full sentences. Other days he can barely say a word. Some days he can type independently, while other days, or even moments, he will do anything to avoid typing. Adam is a neurological roller coaster ride and I\u2019m on it with him. We can see what he is able to do and how intelligent he is, when his body permits him. When it doesn\u2019t, Adam will become upset and frustrated. He is not in control of it. This is not behavioural. On the weekened when he was drumming, he showed another flash of brillance \u2014 jamming in rhythm.  It lasted a few seconds. Then his body took off in another direction and I had to help him focus again.  Martha Leary and David Hill wrote about autism and movement disturbance and I am going to revisit it.  Lorna Wing wrote about autism and catatonia. Catatonia is usally later onset \u2014 late teens, so I\u2019m not sure if what I\u2019m seeing with Adam is catatonia right now. In thinking about autism and movement, I remembered  Amanda Bagg\u2019s  video  How to Boil Water the Easy Way  (and she\u2019s wearing the  Joy of Autism: Redefining Ability and Quality of Life event  T-shirt). I remembered this video in order to remind myself what Adam is going through and in trying hard to relate to his experience. This is meant to be respectfully comedic. Please be patient with it and watch the entire video to really understand: Of course, I\u2019ve made the usual calls to investigate ways to assist Adam, and I am always in doubt. Medications are another roller coaster ride \u2014 perhaps the monster coaster that I\u2019ve been avoiding, but I also know that I need to find ways to assist Adam with this type of pain. As for me, I often think that while I\u2019ve assisted other people in their journey as an activist and advocate, it is in part to also help myself. I learn so much from others.  I\u2019m doing this alone in my home.  Being a single parent, at night especially, has taught me that for all the times I think I can\u2019t do it, I manage to. For all the times I think I may want to give up, I don\u2019t. The thought of not being with Adam hurts me more.  Talking it out or writing about it is helpful and for all the dark days, a good sleep and a new dawn sheds a new perspective. Adam woke up this morning with a smile on his face again, asking for bread and mustard for breakfast. There is still joy in autism and my son. He\u2019s a fabulous human being! Yet like any parent, I have heartache when I see him in distress.

{"date": "2012/03/21", "body": "It\u2019s my birthday in a few hours. Adam is happy because there will be cake.  Tonight, I took Adam to the park. It has been exceptionally warm and summer-like here in Toronto and he seemed happy that I was yammering on about my birthday.  With the sun comes another realization of the gifts I receive everyday and that these that I\u2019m about to describe is all I would ever want. Adam of course is one of them. Before I go on with my list I have to say that every time I write, I\u2019m trying so hard not to elicit pity. The challenges Adam and I face are the \u201cregular\u201d part of our lives. I make choices every day to stick with him, even if I\u2019m feeling pitiful. By dawn, my head always clears if I\u2019ve had a challenging day before. I work on my self, rather than trying to change Adam, to remember what I always have believed about his  value, his sweet nature, his ability. I do it because like many autism parents and people with disabilities, there\u2019s a lot of pressure out there to be normal in every way. We can feel so isolated some days, and I often do. Then, I\u2019m determined not to let it beat me up; that it\u2019s for Adam that I also keep writing, thinking, trying to change the educational and other opportunities for him.  Just before the clock turns twelve, I think of all the people who are the real gifts in my life. You have all been a part of my growth as Adam\u2019s parent:  My own parents who are a phone call away; the relatives who reach out just to let me know they are there if I need them; my friends who offer to watch Adam or want to spend time with him and with whom I spend my time with enjoying life; my best friends who always pull me out for a coffee no matter how busy I am; my boyfriend who is patient and kind, who taught me about love, and who is so gentle with Adam; my overseas friends who I went to school with \u2014 it always feels like yesterday when we get the chance to be together; the people I\u2019ve met on and offline who check in on Adam and I (it\u2019s so great when we meet at conferences); the educators and clinicians who we\u2019ve been with for years, and some of them new. You are patient with me and my plentiful emails, always willing to discuss things with me. My autistic friends, some who I see, and some who are farther away but who are always so supportive of Adam and I in our journey. I hope I offer you the same support; the other parents like me with whom I\u2019m able to visit and laugh, lovingly, about ourselves in raising our autisitc children \u2014 respectful humour is an effective healer.  I know I\u2019m missing some in this list, but believe me, you are not taken for granted. You all mean so much. I am rich because of you. Happy Birthday to me\u2026 yee hee!

{"date": "2012/03/29", "body": "Adam is talking a little more again. It\u2019s the inconsistency in autism that people really have a difficult understanding. This is part of the disability that others need to learn. I\u2019ve heard some people describe the spasms and twitches as the \u201cneurological storm.\u201d I take to that description not because Adam shows aggression, but because he\u2019s all over the map with with body \u2014 his excessive need to climb, jump, move all the time, flap, jump again, spin, walk up and down the stairs, jump again\u2026the little lad as a hard time staying still, and it\u2019s not all behavioural. This is why he has a rigorous exercise program. He\u2019s also so \u201con\u201d the past few days, though, and I thought it was important to write about it in light of the recent release of  Carly\u2019s Voice . Adam also has to move and twitch. When he has a cold, his system seems suppresed enough to turn down the volume of his bodily movements that he can focus a lot better.  It\u2019s the jumbled Alphabet Soup of autism that we need to discuss here, and not every autistic person possesses the same level of tics &  movement disturbance   (read a couple of posts down from this one), which Carly and Adam seem to share to some extent. Adam is not able to talk all of the time. It\u2019s in part motor planning, \u201capraxia\u201d and his neurology that effects his consistency. These \u201cneurological inconsistencies\u201d or \u201cinconcistency in performance\u201d are, for many autistic people, a real struggle. I am often told that Adam is a \u201ccomplex\u201d child because of it \u2014 that he\u2019s \u201cintelligent but inconisistent because he cannot always focus and always needs to move.\u201d Teachers generally want to put him on meds. I am for medications if they assist the person in their own pain or distress. I\u2019m concerned about using them only for \u201ccompliance.\u201d Educators largely focus on an autistic student\u2019s inability to sit still rather than what captures the ability \u2014 what engages the autistic child. Sometimes Adam can say a perfectly clear sentence and make perfect sense, other times he mumbles like we all tend to do when we don\u2019t know the words to a song. I can tell he\u2019s trying very hard to form the words and it overjoys me. Other times he babbles and I can\u2019t make out what he is saying. I\u2019m frustrated with myself when he\u2019s intentionally asking me for something because I can\u2019t quite understand him and he\u2019s looking right at me! I still try to acknowledge his utterances no matter what.  Some parents get really frustrated with the \u201cbabbling,\u201d  but I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s an important part of language aquisition \u2014 talking to oneself, self-babble. I would say don\u2019t ever try to stop it. Even \u201cshaping\u201d it all the time can get very discouraging for the autistic person. While we can model, we don\u2019t always want to be correcting a person. Sometimes I\u2019ll just acknowledge like \u201coh\u201d or \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cI know what you mean.\u201d  I like to always remember that Adam is on a different trajectory than other kids. As I recollect our first decade now together, I relish in the fact that we have little chats, although idiosyncratic, in the car. Some people might view this still as extremely \u201cimpaired\u201d communication between us. Yet, when Adam was a toddler, I had wondered if we\u2019d ever have a chat in the car on the way home from school. There was always silence, and I wondered if all I would ever hear was my own voice. This morning, he was reading to me! \u201cClink\u201d he read from his book  Spoon  He can some days and not on others. The past couple of nights, he\u2019s been picking up \u201cage-appropriate\u201d books, although he\u2019ll also need his \u201cbaby books\u201d for security and comfort.  His recent favorite is Geronimo Stilton\u2019s  The Kingdom of Fantasy . I bought it because the chapters are short and the illustrations are great. He read the words effortlessly last night, while other days he struggles to get the words out of his mouth. He will stare at the word and utter nothing, or go to, what I call his \u201cdefault word\u201d; one which looks similar but is not the same, often triggered by the first two or three letters. I figure he\u2019s trying to access it and because he can\u2019t get it out quickly enough to appease me, he will say what first word comes to his mind.  Often, it may take up to minutes for an autstic person to process what is being asked of them and then they will answer.  Inconsistent. These inconsistencies are really important to remember with some of the non verbal autistic children, many who have motor planning difficulty. It is one of the points also which many families do not understand about  Facilitated Communication, or what is now called \u201cSupported Typing\u201d   \u2014  what it is and why it exists. There was so much controversey about this effective and important way of teaching children with motor planning difficulties and low muscle tone that the term had to be changed. It had been abused by  some  therapists, but we\u2019ve learned ways in which to avoid this abuse. When we\u2019re talking about getting devices into the hands of autistic children, I\u2019m delighted.  I\u2019ve been advocating for that for nearly a decade now.   The recently released book,  Carly\u2019s Voice  will put more of these devices into the hands of autistic children. Carly has a strong voice and she can add to the other autistic individuals like her who use typing as their main form of communication \u2014  Amanda Baggs ,  Larry Bissonnette ,  Tito Mukhopadhyay  to name only three of many. Every time another autistic person \u201ccomes out\u201d I continue to have hope that our understanding of autistic people, and the education and the services they require, will be more available to them. I believe that the more educators are interested in teaching the autistic, the better education autistic people we will have. Educators have to believe in autistic people first, and I think Carly can help with this.  The one point I wish to extend about typing and using devices that wasn\u2019t addressed in  Carly\u2019s Voice ,  is the critical role of the communication partner \u2014 particularly in the difficult beginning of learning how to use devices or in learning to type, which not all people with motor planning difficulties may be able to achieve. In the book, her dad, Arthur Fleischmann states that Carly could not initally type with her parents. When Carly was nestled in between her therapists Howard and Barb, she could type some of the time. Her father admits that he thought it \u201cincredulous\u201d when her therapists claim of her typing ability and intelligence.  Having close proximity to a communication partner  is  \u201cSupported Typing.\u201d It\u2019s a form of prompt, security and trust, and it must be used in order to get many autistic people started.  I know from Adam that typing open-ended conversations can be really hard for him. He may require reinforcers or some sort of assistance to keep going. He can type independently for things, now even some phrases, but when we have an open-ended conversation, he still needs me to sit closely. Learning how and when to push an autistic child to type is dependent on many factors that need to be carefully evaluated.  He is independent, some of the time, when motivated and when he knows what to do. He would not have started typing independently had I not began supported typing when he was four years old. When alone with YouTube, Adam can search for very sophisticated videos he wants like \u201cpsychedelic cartoons.\u201d I don\u2019t need to be there \u2014 his fingers can move as fast as lightening. He also spells on his own on his iPad spelling programs that he likes to play around with. Put him in an ABA program where he\u2019s asked to type the same word that he\u2019s known since he\u2019s been 11 months of age, however, (he was also diagnosed hyperlexic), he may not type the \u201ccorrect response\u201d one hundred per cent of the time because, I imagine, he\u2019s so bored and he can\u2019t always do what is commanded of him. Or for the reasons cited above, he\u2019s inconsistent. He\u2019s consistent, however, in many other things, like his need for movement, deep pressure, his way of learning, and, well, being autistic, which is generally undervalued. This is what I don\u2019t like about ABA programs and why I think it holds the autistic child back in the area of academics, especially. I keep telling his school they need to move on \u2014 if he\u2019s interested in YouTube or the computer, let him search and build his research and typing skills from there. ABA supervisors and therapists desperately need to learn the value of other methodologies such as supported typing and following an autistic person\u2019s interests, not to mention truly understanding the need of certain physical movements in order to achieve comfort and to learn.  Learning happens all the time, even for autistic people whom we tend to believe are not learning unless they are responding typically and \u201cattending.\u201d I struggle with the marrying of \u201clearning how to respond typically,\u201d and Adam\u2019s innate ability, I\u2019ll admit.  One strategy also that ABA\u2019ers need to learn is not only to see what an autistic person is doing on their own \u201cconsistently,\u201d even if it appears \u201catypical\u201d but also to let them respond by giving them visual multiple choice since most autistic people are visual learners. Adam will usually score 90-100 percent on this method of testing knowledge. If asked to respond without the visual prompt, he\u2019d be in a low percentile. Still, he\u2019s judged on a typical scale instead of an autistic one most of the time. Visual support is critical to autistic learning and responding and should be used in any communication program. When looking at Carly as a young child, because of her motor-planning difficulty, it is clear that she learns to press the buttons on her  Cheap Talk machine  (this is a machine loaded with PECS with a voice recording so the box is an early \u2018talk box\u2019 for very young children). Her index finger is held by the therapist and formed into a point. Her dad writes about her low muscle tone, so Carly would have needed this level of support. She is also lead to the box, which is an example of how many autistic children need to learn the purpose of these communication devices. We must not simply hand an autstic child a device and expect them to type miraculously. Watch for it in the shots where she is a little girl:   Some people don\u2019t have the full motor capability and others are effected by  movement disturbance \u2014 a form of catatonia in autism, or spasmodic-like movement  \u2014 where they need a reminder to keep moving. This can be as subtle as a command to \u201ckeep going,\u201d or a light touch on the shoulder. For more assistance, a backward pressure, or resistance, can be applied on the arm. It can servce as a physical reminder to keep moving the hand forward. If done correctly, the supporter will neutralize the users hand in the centre of the keyboard to ensure that there is no influence over the communication itself.  It is important not to acknowledge the hard work of many of autistic non verbal individuals, and their therapists, who learned to type and communicate this way. So many are independent now because of it, but just because some people cannot be fully independent is not to assume, as Carly says so well, that there is no intelligence. Carly also tells us that she worked very hard. It\u2019s not easy for an autistic person to learn how to type, nor is it for parents and therapists. I know it\u2019s not easy for Adam. As a visual learner, Adam uses the program  Pictello on his iPad  for him to practice open-ended communication. What this means is communication without a specific ending that he would come easy for us, like conversation. Adam is able to take his own pictures, or we can of him, on his own device, he can load them into Pictello, and he can write independently about each picture, and we can have a conversation about his pictures. Due to his inconsistent capability of speech, we ask him to read the sentences he writes so we can record his own voice with the program. Afterwards, he\u2019s created a story of his day and he can listen to himself narrate. His so delighted with it that he\u2019s eager to use it everyday. He loves to hear his own voice and I can hear how he\u2019s trying so hard! Before the iPad we used the  Alphasmart Neo  because it was portable, but it didn\u2019t have the text to speech output that has helped Adam also learn to talk. Now with the iPad, we have so many inexpensive options to communicate. I know the iPad isn\u2019t accessible to all autistic families, and Autcom is also working in the US to get subsidy for families for the iPad. I hope  Carly\u2019s Voice  and the many other autistic voices will continue to raise this awareness so that educators will be also eager to learn how autistic people can learn and communicate. Sometimes it takes such highly publicized success stories to get our educators even interested in our autistic kids. I am grateful that Arthur talks honestly about his own struggles as a parent, and still never giving up on Carly. Let us all be patient and believe. The onus is not solely on the autistic person. We cannot expect them to know what to do with the device  \u2014 it\u2019s not easy to learn. It may take years. From my experience, and judging from  Carly\u2019s Voice , it\u2019s well worth it.

{"date": "2012/04/07", "body": "Yesterday Adam and I had a jog, a long walk and a trip to his favorite playground apparatus, a spiderweb made out of rope which he can climb through. He\u2019s particularly enamoured with this piece of equipment as he can climb and nudge his way through the holes in the rope that make it a \u201cweb.\u201d As I watch him, he\u2019s polite to the other kids, waiting for them to move aside, or trying not to get in their way. There\u2019s an eager route happening that I can see he needs to complete. I watch his face and imagine the cogs churning and the patterns he might be making as he moves so quickly and gracefully, if not earnestly. I imagine math going on in his head as he figures out his route. He doesn\u2019t need to hesitate, like the other children, to think of where his foot should go lest he fall a few feet down to the ground. Funny because Adam will sometimes hesitate just walking down a hall. He has mastered this web. After that, we went on our long walk. As we passed an impressive Catholic school in the area, Adam spotted a path. I began to feel his body tensing as he pulled me towards it.  I let go of his hand so he didn\u2019t have to feel that I might say no. With the couple of times he bolted and his need to explore every door \u2014 \u201cdoor is a question\u201d he once typed \u2014 he seems to be afraid that someone will tell him that we can\u2019t go through every door, so he pulls at our hands. This led to some tantrums and bolting last summer when we said he couldn\u2019t go through many of those doors. He just couldn\u2019t stop himself. I felt the tension again and I wanted to see what would happen if I let go. His brow furrowed; he was serious, but he walked with me and I knew full well he didn\u2019t want to be without me. He didn\u2019t want to become lost. I took deep breaths and spoke softly, because he \u201cabsorbs\u201d my feelings, but still, I was at the ready in case he got that eager look in his eye and wanted to run. As we walked side by side he began to say \u201ccatacombs\u2026. catacombs.\u201d Adam is not being taught those words. Let\u2019s just say, he\u2019s got a lot more ability than most people can see, and leave that for now. The point is, like much \u201cautistic language\u201d I\u2019ve seen and heard, he appropriated a word he learned on his own, somewhere, to the paths he was exploring.  I was sort of glad that the forested path came full circle. I didn\u2019t want to stop him and I considered where-ever we ended up, we could take a cab home. Or at some point, I would be able to tell Adam that we had to turn around, and see how that went. This is going much much better now. Adam is less stressed when I explain it\u2019s time to turn around when my voice is soft and I give him warning. Exploring Adam\u2019s \u201ccatacombs\u201d with him can be fun, although I\u2019ll admit that I often have my own agenda and I urge him to follow me. I know very well that I must explore his, with him. We may not be able to explore every door, and I know that his environments are very important to him. Yesterday, he gave me yet another insight into the confusing world, which he is so eager to see\u2026 and master.\n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2012/04/07/catacombs/", "title": "Catacombs"},
{"date": "2012/03/30", "body": "This press release was released today. I think this is also a call to all autism parents and providers to watch the bias language that is so often used in regards to autistic people:  Canadian Association for Community Living Volume 10 Issue 5 March 2012 Contents \nDisability Rights Organizations Launch Formal Complaint \nCACL President \u2013 Laurie Larson Addresses Global Television  For Immediate Release \nMarch 30, 2012  Disability Rights Organizations Launch Formal Complaint for Biased, Damaging Media Coverage Toronto, ON \u2013 The Canadian Association for Community Living (CACL) joins other disability rights groups in calling on Global News to account for the exclusion of the voices of persons with disabilities and their families in recent programming and is launching a formal complaint in an attempt to address this issue. On Friday March 16th, Global Television aired an episode of the program 16\u00d79 accompanied by a live blog discussion featuring advocates who wish to change Canadian law in order to allow them to end the lives of their sons and daughters with disabilities. It featured a panel of convicted murderer, Robert Latimer; commentator Arthur Schafer, who has argued that Robert Latimer\u2019s sentence was \u2018unjust\u2019 and Annette Corriveau a mother from Ontario who wants the law changed to allow her to end the life of her two children who have disabilities. Laurie Larson, CACL President, stated: \u201cThere was an extreme bias represented by the program that needs to be explained. We were alarmed by Global\u2019s uncritical promotion of these views and by the blatant disregard of the voices of the movement of people with disabilities and families who would tell \u201ca different story.\u201d This programming provided a mere platform for these views\u2014not a discussion.\u201d CACL has been contacted by many in the disability community who were deeply disturbed by Global\u2019s portrayal of life with a disability as a tragic life without value. The program repeatedly suggested that parents are being unreasonably prevented by law from acting on a wish to end the life of their child. The program incorrectly stated that Canada\u2019s laws permit the removal of nutrition and hydration as a means for ending the life of a person with a disability. The uncritical presentation of such views is inflammatory and dangerous. Canada\u2019s laws are in place to protect the equal rights to life, safety and security shared by all citizens. These laws are especially critical as we enter times where people with disabilities, along with other groups such as the elderly or people with additional health care needs, are facing numerous threats to their well-being. In such times, CACL stands firmly on our vision of inclusion and principles of equality, diversity and community and will defend the equality rights of people with intellectual and other disabilities. We will continue to challenge positions that border on hate but parade in a cloak of \u2018ethics\u2019 and demand that media be held accountable for the broadcast of material that crosses the line from \u201ccontroversial\u201d to hurtful, damaging and inflammatory. We are asking Canadians to join us in holding media to a high standard for public conversation of these difficult issues\u2014not sensationalism and one-sided platforms that undermine both the moral and legal status of targeted groups, as was clearly the case here. CACL has registered a formal complaint with Global News and the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and is asking other concerned Canadians to do the same. \u2013 30 \u2013 For more information contact Michael Bach, CACL Executive Vice President, 416-209-7942; mbach@cacl.ca. CACL President \u2013 Laurie Larson Addresses Global Television  March 30, 2012 To: Global Television \nAttn: Jennifer Tryon (jennifer.tryon@globalnational.com) \nCC: Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (complaints@cbsc.ca) The Canadian Association for Community Living (CACL) is profoundly and deeply offended by recent biased and inflammatory programming aired on Global Television which broadcast views about the lives of people with disabilities that are hurtful, damaging and dangerous. On Friday March 16th, Global Television aired an episode of the program 16\u00d79 accompanied by a live blog discussion featuring advocates who wish to change Canadian law in order to allow them to end the lives of their sons and daughters with disabilities. It featured a panel of convicted murderer, Robert Latimer; commentator Arthur Schafer, who has argued that Robert Latimer\u2019s sentence was \u2018unjust\u2019 and Annette Corriveau a mother from Ontario who wants the law changed to allow her to end the life of her two children who have disabilities. CACL was shocked by the extreme bias of the panel assembled for the televised program and accompanying live blog discussion. The one-sidedness of the panel provided a platform for these views\u2014not a discussion. We are alarmed by the uncritical acceptance and promotion of these views and by the blatant disregard of the voices of the movement of people with disabilities and families who would tell \u201ca different story.\u201d There are deeply concerning shifts taking place in society whereby a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of threats are increasingly making it a dangerous time to be a person with a disability. Resource constraints, exploding demands on the health care system, the \u2018perfect baby\u2019 myth, proliferation of pre-natal screening technologies and routine termination of pregnancies involving Downs Syndrome and other disability traits are all contributing to a bigger picture conflict whereby certain groups are being singled out and targeted. Global\u2019s programming uncritically provided a platform for perpetuating profoundly devaluing and damaging views without regard for this bigger picture or providing opportunity for people with disabilities and their families to provide a different perspective. In this context, we are deeply disturbed by Global\u2019s portrayal of life with a disability as a tragic life without value. We reject the repeated and dangerous suggestion by the Global Television program that parents are being unreasonably prevented by law from acting on a wish to end the life of their child. We reject the inflammatory suggestion made in introducing the program that \u201cthe law of nature would not see their survival\u2014but here, the law of a nation keeps them alive.\u201d Further, we correct the inaccurate statement that Canada\u2019s laws permit the removal of nutrition and hydration\u2014food and water\u2014as a means for ending the life of a person with a disability. Canada\u2019s laws are in place to protect the equal rights to life, safety and security shared by all citizens. These laws are especially critical as we enter times where people with disabilities, along with other groups such as the elderly or people with additional health care needs, are being singled out and targeted. In such times, we stand firmly on our vision of inclusion and guiding principles of equality, diversity and community and will defend the equality rights of people with intellectual and other disabilities. In order to do so, it is critical that we address outrageous instances where these notions are provided a platform and demand that media be held accountable for the broadcast of material that crosses the line from \u201ccontroversial\u201d to hurtful, damaging and inflammatory. By this letter, we are registering our complaint regarding the views about people with disabilities broadcast on the program 16\u00d79. We are also registering a formal complaint with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council as we believe that this programming is in contradiction to a number of principles outlined in the Code of Ethics and Equitable Portrayal Code. We ask that Global take action to address and prevent such one sided portrayal of issues and we remain anxious to discuss how this might be achieved.

{"date": "2012/04/02", "body": "It\u2019s \u201cAutism Awareness Day.\u201d  I\u2019m not sure I like all the \u201cawareness\u201d events that still grieve the autistic person, \u201clocked inside\u201d a body. Every day is an autism awareness event in our lives, and it can be rather tiring. It seems to take a huge percentage of our time justifying our right to be in school, regarded as intelligent, included in programs, or to be viewed just as any other person would want to be regarded and treated. It\u2019s difficult to be included and accommodated without people wanting Adam to become more \u201cnormal.\u201d  It\u2019s hard to find a seat at the table. When I stood with my favorite autism moms at Adam\u2019s school the other day, their children still toddlers, I witnessed, how dreary language and media representation effects our view of ourselves as well as our children. I\u2019ve always felt that the way people make us feel for being different (aka \u201cabnormal\u201d and in need of fixing) makes life harder, not easier. It amazes me how parents lose faith so early on in the autism journey, and while it can be tiring with those sleepless nights, we have to learn that we are \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cquirky\u201d in our own right. This should be a day of celebration and acceptance. I find laughing at our autistic quirks in this house, with respect, helps us live more happily. Laughter enables us to accept ourselves. At Adam\u2019s school, they play musical chairs.  You know how musical chairs goes \u2014 the music goes on, then it stops suddenly so the kids have to sit in the available chairs as quickly as possible. There is always one less chair than there is a child\u2026go figure. Whomever doesn\u2019t get a chair, loses. I\u2019ll bet this game in particular is difficult for autistic kids who can\u2019t catch the rhythm of social interaction and games like this one. Temple Grandin describes a scene like this when she\u2019s watching a circle of people talking. She\u2019s trying to participate but she describes it like trying to jump in on a game of Double Dutch (skipping for those who don\u2019t know it). She just can\u2019t get in. For Adam, we\u2019re still in the turn-taking and sequencing phases, and he\u2019s learning to be patient while waiting for a turn. Yet he loves to dance with people! The music plays, he probably starts to dance or follows everyone in the circle, then probably doesn\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t get a chair. I\u2019m not there, you see. But I can just imagine. Adam gets upset when they turn off the music.  I can picture him dancing and jumping with that ecstatic smile on his face. He\u2019s probably thinking \u201cWhat the ____? Put that music back on!\u201d  Some days it\u2019s hard to be an autism blogger or purporting a belief in autistic people, more than it is just to live in the moment and dance with Adam. He wants to dance with us. Please don\u2019t pull away his chair at the table. He deserves a place there. Please don\u2019t stop the music.

{"date": "2012/04/27", "body": "It\u2019s happening. Adam is growing and with it, a new attitude. Puberty is peeking through his ten-year-old countenance.  I realized this pre-pubescence more accutely yesterday when he emerged from school. Usually full of smiles at seeing me, he looked cross. \u201cDaddy\u2019s house!\u201d he exclaimed. His dad and the nanny tell me that Adam often asks for mommy when I\u2019m not around. On occasion, Adam will check to see where I am, and he seems reassured. It was new for me to hear this declaration. When he looked disappointed to see me, I felt a mix of rejection and giddiness at the same time.  After all, Adam is a boy and I hoped there would come a time when he would want to be with the boys. A boy is supposed to want to identify with the males in his life. But what of me? \u201cHi honey,\u201d I laughed, bending down to kiss his cheek. Adam\u2019s eyes were still serious and he didn\u2019t lean in to my lips as he usually does. \u201cDaddy\u2019s house!\u201d he said again.  \u201cYou don\u2019t want mommy?\u201d I asked, forcing myself to appear a confident mother. Adam was silent as the teacher and I chit-chatted as usual.  \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it today,\u201d she said, her eyes wide and proud. \u201cIt was like watching an adult Adam. He did everything that was asked of him.\u201d She put his hand on Adam\u2019s shoulder while he was listening and looking at my car. \u201cAt one point my sentences were so long, I thought he wouldn\u2019t understand me, but he could follow everything.\u201d I took in a long breath and half-smiled, grateful for her positive report and enthusiasm. I grabbed the handle of Adam\u2019s small red rollaway suitcase he takes to school and handed it to him as he began walking away. \u201cThanks so much,\u201d I said to the teacher turning and waving, and then tuned in on Adam who was walking ahead of me to the car. \u201cHey Adam, do you want to call Daddy?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he replied firmly. We got in the car and I called his dad on the Bluetooth. \u201cAdam said \u2018daddy\u2019s house\u2019 when he got out of school,\u201d I said, \u201cso we\u2019re calling you.\u201d Adam listened to his father\u2019s cheery \u2018hey buddy\u2019 voice, and Adam talked a little \u2014 phone conversations are difficult for Adam to respond to. Afterwards, he seemed content. We arrived home and Adam washed his own hands and headed for the kitchen for his snack, all without my reminding. He had a piano lesson, and Grandma and Grandpa came for a visit. Every time I went downstairs to see how he was doing, though, he pointed to the door. \u201cGo away!\u201d  \u201cOkay, okay!\u201d I said, trying to be jolly but it was a put on.  My kid doesn\u2019t want me. What an ingrate\u2026that little schnood!  (a word of affection that was developed in my family years ago). My feathers were a little ruffled and I mumbled briefly. What did I do to  him  today? Nothing out of the ordinary happened.   Is this what is to come?  My thoughts were skipping all over.   Never you mind, Adam. I\u2019ve been here for you all along and no matter what you think, I\u2019m always going to love you.  Then I started Googling in search of what age boys start really wanting their fathers.  As much as we want our kids to want us in a divorced situation, I welcome Adam\u2019s need for his dad and other members of his family. It\u2019s a new kind of separation like watching a child graduate or leave the house for the first time. While I am celebrating Adam\u2019s growing independence and associations, I feel that this breaking away is just the beginning, and I\u2019m a little sad too.  Everyone always said to me while Adam grows up, \u201cconsider yourself lucky that your kid doesn\u2019t talk back to you.\u201d That was always difficult for me to reason, as I longed to hear Adam\u2019s voice and more complex thoughts, or his yelling at me that he was going to visit his friends. Thanks to his typing and his growing verbal ability, this is slowly changing, but having him grow up is surprisingly challenging in a way I\u2019ve neither experienced nor expected. Is it perhaps more challenging when we have to let more dependent children \u201cgo?\u201d  You\u2019d think I\u2019d be jumping for joy, and while I sort of am, I missed his need of me. All sorts of \u201cseparations\u201d were running through my head \u2014 all good, natural and still, emotional. I want Adam to feel safe to feel and express whatever he needs. To help Adam, I started talking about his dad at the dinner table, and he was very attentive.\u201dDaddy is funny isn\u2019t he, Adam,\u201d I said. He looked me straight in the eye and smiled. \u201cYes both mom and dad really love you.\u201d I kept talking about love while drawing raindrops and animals with Adam at the table after dinner. At the end of the evening when everyone was gone, Adam looked in my face; his eyes regained their sparkle for me. Then, he leaned in to give me a kiss. We went through our usual wind-down routine in our quiet house \u2014 a shower, teeth-brushing, and I\u2019ve helped Adam become more independent doing these basic things. He climbed into bed merrily in his p.j\u2019s with the dogs on them, carrying a book on  How To Draw Insects .  \u201cMockingbird,\u201d he asked as he burrowed himself under the duvet. It\u2019s a song I\u2019ve been singing to him since he was a toddler. I turned off the lights, snuggled alongside him and started to sing softly. He didn\u2019t tell me to go away.

{"date": "2012/04/11", "body": "It was like yesterday. I went into labour and Adam arrived nine hours later. After he was born, he cried a lot and his eyes darted around the room.  My narrative of Adam\u2019s life in part goes like this: He was born and he was uncomfortable in this world. It was as if he already understood the painstaking road ahead.  I want to commend him and all that he has managed on his own \u2014 from the stares, to the people who have talked in front of him (all of us tend to do that until it dawns on us that we shouldn\u2019t; we can be parents of typical kids and do it too). Despite his differences and challenges \u2014 he is neurologically complex unlike some other autistic kids \u2014 Adam has made friends in his own way. He will run up to someone and want his \u201csquish\u201d or \u201cspin me higher.\u201d He has a way of charming us to provide what he wants and needs. That look crosses over his face when he meets denial; his eyes begin to smile and glimmer like Marilyn Monroe on the silver screen. We succumb and receive our thank yous in many forms. He has worked hard. He has struggled with motor planning and still finds it hard to hold a pencil, even a weighted one, among many of his challenges. For those moments he has been able to focus in the way we like to see, he has shown us what he can do \u2014 from typing, research projects, to his love of music, dance and YouTube. He is becoming a master of computer games, climbing, and of course, the trampoline. Aside from the times he needs some space from our demands, Adam has engaged us all.  I hope I can convey his beauty and loving nature on this blog. It is in honour of him as well as my message that he, as an autistic person, has been able to enamour us. It hasn\u2019t been the other way around. Sure, many of us thought we had to engage him. We\u2019ve taunted him with goodies and rewards to \u201crespond\u201d in a typical way as \u201cproof\u201d that he understands. Still, he\u2019s in control. He has been all along. He has had to manage many of us \u201cTypicals\u201d in the way we speak, treat and regard him. Most of us don\u2019t even notice how he\u2019s able to do that. As I create a plan for Adam which he will contribute to as he gets older, I think of everything Adam is, not what he should be. For ten years, I\u2019ve heard more about his deficits and inconsitencies from teachers and professionals, and I\u2019ve struggled with this like swimming against a strong tide. In all fairness to the wonderful people who have helped us on our journey, we  all  tend to focus on the gaps. Every parent wants their child to achieve. Every teacher strives to help a child become independent. It is our way of protecting and preparing them from and for a harsh world.  I always need to come back to Adam and what he can do, or else I fear what may become of us. What of his  autistic-ness  has been consistent and is  the  message of how he needs to learn and be in the world? Once I view Adam as a consistent, whole being, I can see him.  Since he was eleven months old, Adam could decode or read words. He has been in love with books. The world, to use Adam\u2019s own reference during a walk last week, may just be a series of  \u201ccatacombs\u201d that he is compelled to explore. It also causes him much anxiety. Be it his environments or knowledge itself, (see picture of Adam reading the dictionary), Adam is scaffolding and accumulating his knowledge, perhaps furiously, in neat boxes, in his very own and unique way. It may be one of his many contributions to us. There is value to how he learns, sees and thinks, and also in how he needs to navigate. I for one want to keep learning all about it. I want to keep \u201cseeing\u201d and supporting him despite all the veils that flutter in front of my eyes now and again, and that threaten to impede my view \u2014 many of my own making.

{"date": "2012/02/07", "body": "I have a favorite non-autism blog right now. It\u2019s by friend/artist Carla Lipkin called  A Water Colour A Day.  I love Carla\u2019s work (and she\u2019s a lovely person too).The blog is a work of art \u2014 you must check it out. It got me thinking of how another friend of mine, years ago when Poloroids were the rage, took pictures of herself every day the year before she turned fifty. On her fiftieth birthday, she put them all up and they made an exceptional piece. Blogging and journaling can be art too. The watercolour above is something I did a couple of months ago really quickly. I used to paint all the time while I was taking art studio and art history. Now it seems my duties as mother have taken precendence over the projects I really love doing. I have to ask myself why this has happened?  Looking at Carla\u2019s blog made me think about the importance of the everyday. For some of us, we like to document it. We really do take the small stuff for granted. Adam also has artistic ability. Wouldn\u2019t it be fun to make a little time every day to document something of our lives, no matter how seemingly trivial or small. At the end of the year these little things add up.

{"date": "2012/04/16", "body": "I\u2019m in the process of completing forms. Adam was diagnosed with autism at eighteen months of age. Now that he\u2019s ten, I\u2019ve been re-reading files and reports from clinicians and teachers over the years. We\u2019ve never had a formal IEP because he\u2019s not in public school. Instead, I\u2019m creating a comprehensive history of Adam. I\u2019m also making it current, adding samples of his work along with new reports. I\u2019m calling it  Adam\u2019s Ability Binder . It not only will list Adam\u2019s challenges, but will focus more on his abilities as a means to serving him well. Ideally, it will address his ability and disparity of skills \u2014 where he is advanced and where his disability makes life more challenging. When it is done, I\u2019m going to find a way to ask Adam what he likes the most and add that to the binder. Right now, I\u2019m combing through years of typed conversations to include and add to this list. My intention is that it becomes Adam\u2019s living document that goes with him, and to which he can contribute as he grows older. We have no system which understands autism comprehensively, let alone the nuance of every autistic individual. I am trying to create that for Adam  and  I\u2019m trying to work within the system we have. I\u2019ve been going through these \u201cAutism Rating Scales\u201d again. They took me three hours to complete. In some of the line I couldn\u2019t stop myself from writing \u201cthat is a silly question.\u201d Or \u201cthis is a biased question,\u201d when refering to whether my child does \u201cstrange things.\u201d I don\u2019t think the things Adam does are \u201cstrange.\u201d I know him to be a normal autistic person, for lack of better terminology. Here were but some of my pet peeves about the questions:  How can we tell if a child is \u201claughing inappropriately\u201d if they cannot tell us why they are laughing?  Laughing and giggling can also be a sign of stress. What if a child\u2019s autism doesn\u2019t let them respond consistently? Adam can sometimes draw with great focus and other times he can barely seem to hold a crayon. Sometimes he speaks full sentences and other times he can\u2019t utter a word. Talking about \u201cshared interests\u201d comes with great patience from a skilled communication partner, and Adam may reveal it verbally or typing, but not yet all of the time. When completing the Vineland-II, BASC-2, GARS-2, ARS, or Conners 3, it\u2019s so easy for me to notice what\u2019s missing from these \u201cscales.\u201d I sigh and mumble through them, and realize I\u2019ve got my own summaries to add.  Many of the questions are also about friends. Adam seems aware of his difference, and I\u2019ve learned this when he has typed about it. I also know Adam to avoid situations where he is aware of his difference or think he might fail. I\u2019ve seen Adam approach a group of children to join in, then stops and waits on the sidelines because he doesn\u2019t know how to \u201cget in.\u201d Recently when another child expressed pity towards him because he is autistic, Adam stopped jumping and smiling. After standing on the periphery of children, not sure of how to join them, he gives up and goes back to playing on his own. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t know the rules of the game and can\u2019t play when he  is  invited.  Is this \u201cnot interested in other children?\u201d Of course it isn\u2019t. His inability to communicate like others, however, and in keeping up with the rapid rhythm of activity and conversation makes having friends challenging. Still, Adam has made  leaps this year \u2014 wanting to join in with other children, and his increase in spoken language.  Thankfully the person evaluating Adam has recognized the limitations of these scales and the complexity of him. It is important to have your assessors understand this and urge them to observe in every setting possible. It\u2019s important to know what lens we are assessing the autistic child through. Some of them can distort the image. Now my back hurts from sitting at my desk too long. I\u2019ll be back at it tomorrow, hoping to tip the scales in a fair direction.

{"date": "2012/02/11", "body": "\u201cThis way!\u201d Adam says firmly from the backseat of our car. He points to the direction he wants me to turn as he declares it. It\u2019s not always safe for me to see where he\u2019s pointing while I\u2019m driving. I am asking him to tell me whether to go left, right or straight. He\u2019s usually directing me to the local grocery store he prefers. He likes to go almost every day after school. I\u2019ve turned my grocery shopping into a daily routine, and generally buy only what we need for dinner that evening. It is not only turning into an exercise in frugality \u2014 buying only what we need \u2014 but one where Adam now shops for himself. Adam was getting a little fixed on the one grocery store, so I mixed it up \u2014 Loblaws, Brunos, the \u201cbig store,\u201d the \u201clittle store,\u201d and the \u201cdollar store.\u201d I decided to shake it up a bit when Adam got fixed on Ginger Bread cookies at Brunos. Adam would need to buy a ginger-bread cookie, preferring to look at it rather than eat it. Once our cupboard was getting full of Gingerbread Snowmen, Christmas Trees and Stars of David, I had to ask myself what I was going to do with them all \u2014 make a house out of them or just say no. I ended up doing both. He soon tired of the cookies, thank goodness, and moved to the deli section, picking tender pieces of steak, big lean hamburgers and veal schnitzels. From there, he\u2019s moved to different stores.  We don\u2019t always need something from the grocery store, of course, so I\u2019m finding other things to do. I realize that Adam, while he seems to be a little foodie, also just likes doing something after school before he goes home. We can go out to dinner, he goes skiing once a week \u2014 he loves that. He needs the outside world. He\u2019s so anxious to take a bite, and his explorations seem to begin with a routine.   \u201cThat way,\u201d he points. He\u2019s leading me toward the little store. No matter where I am on the road, he knows the direction. Sometimes he even just wants to drive around. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel like it. \u201cWe\u2019re going home now,\u201d I say. He whines in protest. \u201cThat way!\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go home,\u201d I say with a melodic voice laced with an  I\u2019m-not-flinching  tone. I hear his red, goose-down-filled arm shuffle, pointing. He looks like the 1960\u2019s kid who can\u2019t move in the snowsuit.  \u201cThis way,\u201d he says pointing to the left. I turn my head and our eyes mirror defiance. \u201cHome time,\u201d I say, keeping it clear. I\u2019m holding my breath hoping that my simplicity will help avoid crying or whining. Sometimes Adam gets upset, although his protests are generally abating as he I notice he\u2019s beginning to learn how to negotiate with me. If I say it\u2019s dinner time, he may tell me what he wants to eat instead of being fixed on going to a store. \u201cWe\u2019re going home now.\u201d \u201cPizza!\u201d he demands. \u201cOkay, Adam, tonight you can have pizza.\u201d Well, he can if it\u2019s only once a week. He\u2019ll accept more, but I do often give Adam a lot of choice, especially if he has decided to \u201cdance\u201d with me and negotiates for what he wants (in fact, I\u2019m thrilled about it). I do want Adam to take a bite out of the world and savour it. I do want him to learn how to negotiate, and he seems to be learning it all on his own.  I suppose I don\u2019t mind having him as my bossy little back seat driver right now. In fact, I remember the days when I longed for him to boss me around \u2014 to talk to me. I\u2019m even at the stage when I\u2019m demanding a  please  and  thank-you  from him. Metaphorically he\u2019s no longer in the back seat.

As the last outlet was installed, I sighed at the continents. If I get those calendars that list the countries and their codes, I have to put a check mark where I\u2019ve been. With this new Facebook app, I was writing down all the places I\u2019ve visited and lived until I received a message. \u201cWow you travel fast,\u201d it said. \u201cAre you Santa Claus?\u201d I clicked back to my \u201cwall.\u201d I realized that the app posted every place I\u2019ve visited as someplace I was  currently  in. \u201cEstee Klar is in South Carolina.

He\u2019s at that age when he makes himself laugh endlessly just so he can keep on feeling good. I remember when I did the same thing. After the fact, I have to wonder how many times Adam gets to see his mother come undone in such a happy way.

This intimate exhibition explores paintings by Snow, a quadriplegic artist and world leader on inclusion issues for people labeled as disabled. Who\u2019s Drawing the Lines reveals how, through her unique way of creating art, Snow overcame a lifetime of perceived limitations to express \u201call that is in [her] heart\u201d. Featuring over 20 works by Snow and several by another artist in her Toronto guild, the exhibition confronts common perceptions of disability and illustrates the artist\u2019s emancipation from these stereotypes to honour her physical, intellectual and emotional diversity. Who\u2019s Drawing the Lines: The Journey of Judith Snow is on display in the Hilary and Galen Weston Wing, Level 2 until January 20, 2012. \u201cWho\u2019s Drawing the Lines is the most recent in a series of ROM displays illuminating contemporary issues that affect the community at large,\u201d said Janet Carding, ROM Director and CEO. \u201cExhibitions such as Out from Under in 2008, and last year\u2019s  House Calls with my Camera  shine a spotlight on diverse aspects of society and expand our understanding of the human condition. I know visitors will be moved by Judith Snow\u2019s personal journey and motivated to help her create a world where we all celebrate our differences instead of being defined by them.\u201d About the Exhibition: Who\u2019s Drawing the Lines , showcases 27 paintings\u201423 by Snow and four by Felicia Galati, a fellow artist in the Laser Eagles Art Guild, an initiative founded by Snow to offer individuals with limited physical mobility the opportunity for self expression through art. Many of the paintings reflect Snow\u2019s innovative approach to art-making: she has used a head-controlled laser to indicate selections, and currently works with a \u201ctracker\u201d, a person who follows her spoken or gestural directions in order to express her emotions and create these artworks. Captioned videos and photos in the exhibition also depict the various artistic techniques used by members of the Laser Eagles and contextualize Snow\u2019s personal journey to become an artist and social innovator. The ROM has created several accessibility initiatives complementing the exhibition. All label text is amplified to a larger font and is placed lower on the walls to be easily viewed by visitors using mobility aids. For visitors who are blind or who have vision loss, a tactile book accompanying the exhibition is available incorporating Braille, large print text and graphic raised-line drawings. Also available is a descriptive audio recording interpreting seven of the key art pieces presented in the exhibition, creating a visual image for those who would not otherwise be able to experience the art. An interpretive pamphlet summarizing the exhibition\u2019s themes and content is available in person and online for all visitors. For more information on accessibility at the ROM, visit www.rom.on.ca/visit/access/index.php. About the Artist: \u201cInclusion is about the willingness to take a unique difference and develop it as a gift to others. It is not about disability.\u201d ~ Judith Snow Judith A. Snow, MA (York University, Toronto, 1976) is a social inventor and a builder of inclusive communities that welcome the participation of a wide diversity of people. She is also a visual artist and the Founding Director of Laser Eagles Art Guild. Snow is known for championing inclusive education, support circles, individualized personal assistance, person-directed planning and facilitated art. Born in Oshawa, Ontario in 1949, Snow was diagnosed as being quadriplegic at seven months of age. At age 12 she made her first sketch while at a rehabilitation centre. However, her artistic talents were not nurtured until, at age 55, Judith found a way to paint. This led to the liberation of her passionate expression\u2014in art and in life. Since then she has experienced the dichotomy of being seen by many as severely disabled and by others as being a fully contributing citizen and inspiring leader.

As first couple of years separation passed, and then meeting someone very special and having lots of friends and laughter in our home, I\u2019ve been picking more colour. Every piece of new fabric is like another step towards feeling comfortable here, another step towards creating our unique family. I write a lot about home because to me it is symbolic (or I should go into interior design). When Adam and I moved here, I found three four leaf clovers on the property. While I was a little superstitious before, I now really believe in omens. Recently we\u2019ve been fixing our kitchen and doing a bit of  re-decorating, managing to fix things, making the house more ours than the previous owners. It was my decision to put our whole selves here because it\u2019s the only way to grow. I decided we can\u2019t live life half-way, waiting for it to happen to us. As I add fabric \u2014 purples, yellows, vibrant ochres and the yellows I saw in Sri Lanka, I feel more relaxed. Adam burrows himself under the lavender blanket by the window on the new couch, or sits and reads his books and he looks so, well, at home. Someone said to me that choosing colour because I\u2019m happier, and they are right. Adam, of course, picks up on this. We are growing our roots again. Two years ago, Valentines Day, Adam and I had to leave the home that sadly caught fire last year, ironically also in February. It was a home we had built ourselves. I felt awful because it was still the home Adam later visited his father after I moved out. Adam did a lot of crying and spasming when he had to make the move. In the past several months,  I drove Adam past the other house, which is still standing, and Adam wanted to go in. When I explained  that he no longer lived there any more, he didn\u2019t fuss. He knows his home is here now.  I felt, though, that I owed him some gentle explanations and drive-bys \u2014 everytime we went near after the fire, he would crank his neck out the back seat window of my car to try and see his \u201cold\u201d home across the park or down the street.  I felt awful not letting him back initally, but I had to make sure he would be able to handle it.  I think about that move and how hard it was on Adam, and on me.

{"date": "2012/02/15", "body": "This article on technology and autism appeared in The Globe and Mail today. I\u2019m worried that some people will view it as another autism miracle. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m ecstatic about the iPad and other technologies and the awareness this brings about autistic intelligence. I have cited the research about the EEG\u2019s and FMRI\u2019s in previous blog posts where it shows  the brains of non verbal individuals with various severe disabilities lighting up like typical brains. In other words, we have evidence that many non verbal individuals can understand what is said to them and have complex thoughts.  What was presumed as \u201cfunctioning at a level of an infant\u201d  can no longer be assumed. I feel compelled to remind readers and hopefuls of a couple of things. The first being that non verbal individuals with various \u201csevere\u201d disabilities (I use quotes because of the way that\u2019s been so misunderstood in terms of intelligence), have been using devices for years. Typewriters, computers, Vantage Lites, Lightwriters and more. With Adam, I chose to use the Alphasmart Neo because it was cheap and portable and I could download our conversations onto the computer. Yet all it offered was the chance to practice typing. It did not have the windows and picture symbols of other programs found in expensive devices. Now the iPad provides this.  Many of these devices are so expensive that it is not feasible for many families to obtain them, costing upwards of sixteen thousand Canadian dollars. Repairs can also cost thousands. The advent of devices like the iPad makes communication so much more accessible, although many adults and families can still not afford them. They may, however, be easier to get into their hands through schools and subsidies. My point is that we\u2019ve known for a long time that technology is important, and that autistic individuals can communicate with them.  It\u2019s not a sudden miracle or epiphany, I hope, to realize that autistic people are intelligent, and the community is as diverse as any other, meaning, that levels of ability and intelligence are variable in every group that we are trying to define. Now to my next point. We can\u2019t expect to plunk an iPad into the laps of our children and expect them to know how to communicate with it.  Just over five years ago, I began typing with Adam. I found I had to facilitate him by supporting his lower forearm. If I had not, he would have typed the letters over and over or typed a word he loved.  It continues to be a challenge to get him to focus because open-ended communication is very difficult for him. Supporting him did not mean I directed him. I learned by people at the University of Syracuse, and through my own studies, how to support him and apply, in his case, a backward resistance pressure. By actually holding his hand back from the keyboard, he had to type with more force and intention and this seemed to help him complete a sentence. I neutralized his hand in the centre of the keyboard and he went from there. I received a whole lot of criticism because of the FC controversies back then. I still did not give up. I knew, because Adam could read since eleven months of age, that he was a candidate to become an independent typist and communicator.  Fast forward five years later and we\u2019re still at it. I\u2019ve been observed by many Centres and professionals and I\u2019ve not known a lot of what Adam types in order to prove that his communication is reliable.  I do this by asking him questions or talking about things he did that I would not know. I have to keep my skills in check. Today, he types somewhat independently. He sends me a short email everyday from school, primarily because they have not been trained in supporting him. If I need to support open-ended communication, my hand is further back on his arm. He will usually say the word or letter now before he types it and he types fast that if I don\u2019t slow him down, he may lose sight of what he is trying to write. For communicating wants and needs, Adam can verbalize or type on his own. Give him YouTube, and he\u2019ll type whatever he wants \u2014 from \u201cwater slides,\u201d \u201cWalt Disney,\u201d and \u201cPsychedelic Cartoons.\u201d We recently visited an AAC expert (Augmentative Assistive Communication) and her response to my support was that my method was not very \u201cfacilitated,\u201d just some marginal support. Not only that, all the nuanced support I give him all the way down to my patience and energy is difficult to document, but so important in teaching how to use a device for \u201cfunctional\u201d or \u201csocial\u201d communication. Adam also uses picture symbols on devices. For this, he can communicate mostly on his own, unless he gets distracted or is very anxious. When an autistic person is anxious, communication tends to fall apart. Text to speech functions have enabled him to speak in full sentences. We are still learning. My point is that I am always learning to be an effective and patient communication partner. Reciprocal, social, open-ended, unpredictable communication is not so easy for him, and many other autistic people like him. While technology is a doorway, we can\u2019t just open it without excellent guides, or without the commitment to keep at it for many years, even perhaps when it seems as if we are making little progress. When someone says to me that \u201cAdam doesn\u2019t type with me,\u201d I immediately know that there is a lack of training or understanding what being a communication partner really means. It is an affirmation that the expectation and onus falls upon the autistic child \u2014 not the parent, therapist or teacher. My hope is that, in addition to providing much needed resources like communication apps and iPads, we have better understanding and training to engage with autistic people as they are. Adam mostly communicates in metaphor. His language acquisition is unique and different than that of his typical peers. He could read and count by eleven months of age, but he couldn\u2019t \u201ctalk\u201d to people. Certainly he didn\u2019t stop acquiring language or learning after that! As I\u2019ve watched him over the years, I try to see the way he scaffolds his language and knowledge. His language and way of seeing the world seems mostly associative, symbolic and visual. The iPad and other accessible technologies are encouraging in so many ways. I hope that the EEGs, FMRI\u2019s and the other \u201cproofs\u201d we seem to require from autistic people in order to validate them, also lead to an enthusiastic desire to understand autistic people \u2014 their value, humanity, and of course, how they learn.

It\u2019s as if he\u2019s saying you\u2019re my mommy,  and that is that.  \u201cYes, Adam, I\u2019m Mommy.\u201d I say. He\u2019s eyes are glued to mine until I answer him. After I do, he looks relieved and goes back to his business. The look reminds me of that  P.D. Eastman story I used to read Adam over and over again when he was a baby, \u201cAre You My Mother?\u201d I hear \u201cMommy\u201d after he\u2019s visited his dad\u2019s house. What could he be thinking, I wonder? Is he confused, as many children are, of the other women in their father\u2019s life? If Adam were a more verbal child, what would be the many questions he\u2019d have of the divorce, and his dad returning to his first ex-wife with whom Adam shares half-siblings?  I have experienced such younger \u201ctypical\u201d children with many questions. I\u2019ve often wondered if people just carry on as if it\u2019s not confusing for Adam at all because they don\u2019t believe that he understands, or at least has many questions that he can\u2019t articulate? No matter how nice people are to Adam over the years, he will always have questions, and he has the right to have them answered. It\u2019s always better to answer children with the facts rather than emotion or pretense, in ways appropriate to their age. I\u2019m taking the inquisitive \u201care you my mother?\u201d look he frequently gives me now as something much deeper. I\u2019ve read him children\u2019s books about divorce but I think Adam is beginning to have more questions. The past few days, Adam has also had the flu. It\u2019s all my fault. I caught a bad one and he got it from me. We\u2019ve been down and out for a week now.\u00a0I know Adam is really ill when he doesn\u2019t move around much and when he\u2019s not eating, of course.  Yesterday, he spent the whole day with me sitting on the couch, and today will be the second day. We watched tv, he played with his iPad and rested. He\u2019s body was close to mine \u2014 his way of comfort and reassurance. If I got up to do something, he would grab my arm to stay with him. As a single mom, I don\u2019t have anyone else to delegate all my responsibilities. Yet the feel of Adam\u2019s overly warm body needing mine for comfort and security is more important to me than any bill or piece of paper sitting on my desk. Those things will have to wait. I could complain, but then I realize that I am the most important person in the world to him right now. I have been his rock, his \u201cconstant person.\u201d That\u2019s right, Adam. I am!

{"date": "2012/02/24", "body": "This will date me. When I went to school, I used to trudge through deep snow. No, I didn\u2019t walk three miles like my grandmother did, but there was lots of snow and we weren\u2019t afraid of it. During recess, we\u2019d slide down any hill we could find and even forget our snow pants. The teachers didn\u2019t make a fuss if we came back into class soaking wet. After school, I walked back home; back through the deep snow, even blowing snow, beating like needles against my face. There were no nannies to wait for me and walk me back like there are in the city now. Parents didn\u2019t worry about us being out there in the blowing snow. In their minds, it was good for us to outside almost all day long. Adam has been home from school all week because of the flu. Finally this morning he woke up jumping. \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d he declared as I entered his room. I\u2019m so glad. One problem though: Last night, before any snow fell, I received an email from his school that it might close in case of snow. I was worried this would happen; that he\u2019d be raring to go and get back to school and his friends, and not be able to. When I was growing up, we never got notices like that. There would have to be five feet of snow outside our door and some severe wind for us to turn on the radio to try and hear if the school was closed. Like all children, I\u2019d wait in anticipation to find out, and if it was, I couldn\u2019t wait to get outside and play in it. Now we get an email suggesting the school may be closed if there is snow. The news gets more ratings with impending weather. They scare people like there\u2019s a hurricane coming and we all better prepare. \u201cSnowmageddon,\u201d it\u2019s now called \u2014 just a tad alarmist, I think, as I see a single snow flake float by my window. The street is clear and the snow looks like it is just beginning to fall fairly gently. I\u2019m emailing and calling,  trying to get in touch with anyone who might be checking at Adam\u2019s school. \u201cIs the school open today? There is no snow,\u201d I write. I know, there\u2019s more traffic. When the roads become icy, the roads aren\u2019t fun to drive on. Perhaps calling in the army nearly a decade ago in Toronto after a big snow storm made everyone a little more cautious. But still. It\u2019s just snow, and we seem afraid to let our children out in it. Children don\u2019t walk to school anymore. They are nannied, day-cared, and car-pooled to school. Let\u2019s face it, we don\u2019t let our children grow up until they\u2019re thirty-five. Granted, I know when we are talking about autistic children, we all know they require more attention for their safety. Autistic adults may also need assistants when they are older. It still doesn\u2019t mean we have to baby them, nor do they want to be babied. I think our over-protective parenting and super-cautiousness have negative effects on all of society. Now back to the snow\u2026 The school is even located near the subway, you know those things that Mayor Rob Ford wants more of. That means we can even travel  under  the snow!  So doesn\u2019t that mean that there is a way to get around after all?  They are calling for five, yes five (wow) centimeters of snow in Toronto today. That\u2019s a far cry from the five  feet  outside our doorway when I was Adam\u2019s age.  I just don\u2019t know what has happened to us. Could it be that this is the first real snow of our Toronto winter that we\u2019ve wimped out? Are we so excited that we have to declare it a city holiday? What happened to us fearless Canadians and the Canadian winter?\u00a0More importantly, what is all of this doing to our children?

Ugh. I\u2019m obsessed with clutter and yet I\u2019m a secret stasher. My house looks organized, but watch out for those closets and filing cabinets! I like to hang on to everything! As many of you understand, my life is too busy to often think about things, so they get stored.  Over the years though, the things in my life grow and gather and I find the closets too full, the toys too plentiful and I\u2019m getting too tense with it all. Even with my autistic child and all the things I have to look ahead and plan for, I want a simpler life! I look in the basement at all the toys. As is the case for many of our autistic children, baby toys are still comforting. It\u2019s especially hard to toss out the old when, in Adam\u2019s case, it becomes new again. Or for the toys that we were told to purchase when he was in early therapy, I keep thinking that someday, we\u2019ll still get to them. Someone will want to teach him how to use the board games for reciprocal play.  I met  Gretchen Rubin of The Happiness Project  at the  Blogher Conference in New York City  several years ago. Her idea of living a happy life is de-cluttering our lives. I had to say that the idea of organizing didn\u2019t make me happy, but the idea of having less to worry and think about does. Today, as I confront my office files and piles of Adam\u2019s artwork before I get to his toy area, I\u2019m so tense that I had to take a break and write this post just to avoid it!  Why is clearing the clutter so anxiety-provoking? Why am I breathing heavier? Is it the time I know I going to have to invest? Will it take days? Weeks? What of the many lists and projects might I find that I have left undone? If they are to do with Adam, I\u2019ll feel really guilty \u2014 the PECS I made, the schedules, the social stories, the other stories I write and leave in unpublished piles.

He loved when Captain Von Trapp used the whistle to call for his children and keep them \u201cin line.\u201d I enjoyed Adam\u2019s baby belly laughs every time he heard that whistle scene. For years Adam loved that movie. I think he fell in love with Maria. Most importantly, the songs and lines in that movie were some of Adam\u2019s first words. So when we spotted Mr. Plummer at the Four Seasons Cafe in Toronto when Adam was nearly three, I couldn\u2019t resist. I\u2019m not the kind of person who goes up to celebrities and asks for the autographs. I don\u2019t like to disturb private lives. As Adam and I were leaving, we walked past Mr. Plummer and his wife who were sitting near the front of the cafe. The thought of missing an opportunity to thank him (for he did not know that Adam was autistic and could not speak) prompted me to turn around with Adam, who would not have recognized the older Plummer as his dear Captain. \u201cExcuse me, Mr. Plummer?\u201d I approached timidlly with Adam by my side.\u00a0 \u201cYes!\u201d he said delightedly, his eyes darting up at me who had interrupted a quiet conversation he seemed to be having with his wife. Already I was taken.\u00a0 \u201cI just want to let you know that my son is a big fan. He watches  The Sound of Music  over and over again.\u201d Mr. Plummer\u2019s face was so gracious. At that point, I could have gone into a little diatribe of how Adam was autistic and how much that movie meant to us, but I didn\u2019t want to take up Mr. Plummer\u2019s precious time.  \u201cWell,\u201d he responded in that well-known dignified voice. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to see that my audience is growing younger and younger.\u201d We both chuckled and I said thank you and goodbye. Maybe Adam will enjoy that story one day. I sure enjoyed watching Mr. Plummer receiving his well-deserved award with the same graciousness we experienced that afternoon. \u00a0Little did Mr. Plummer know what a difference he made in Adam\u2019s young life \u2014 how the movie taught him some language, music, made him laugh and calmed him nearly every night before bed.

There was a time that we spent this period as a family. I am no longer a part of that family and I am okay with it. As the  perspective story goes , what we think of as unlucky, can end up as lucky. All we have to do is wait and see. Someone reminded me recently that I have received everything I have ever wanted: love, a family, friends and my child.  The past several years, I\u2019ve been coming down to Florida alone with Adam; my parents often accompanying me for support.  I didn\u2019t feel I needed it this year.

It\u2019s hard to replace a man in the pool, though. I threw Adam into the air, not as high. My shoulders are paying the price. We have lots of fun, but I am not a man; I am not one of his strong brothers, friends, my boyfriend, grandfathers, or father who can toss him effortlessly. I am just his mother \u2014 the one he runs to and wants to cling to, here, on vacation. He seemed to accept my shortcomings in the pool. He was laughing at me and then wanted me to teach him how to do a somersault. It is nice to have this time together.

{"date": "2011/12/07", "body": "Review:  Challenging The Myths of Autism: Unlock New Possibilities and Hope \nWritten by: Jonathan Adlerson \nHarperCollins Publishing, 2011. \n257 pages I was more than intrigued by the title of Jonathan Alderson\u2019s new book:  Challenging the Myths of Autism: Unlock New Possibilities and Hope . In the last ten years, there have been a lot of autism books and memoirs released. My favorites have been ones written by autistic people. There are other favorites, Uta Frith, for example, Darold Treffert, who talk about autistic ability and autistic individuals in history. More recently books challenging theories about autism are receiving critical acclaim. Challenging ideas about autism indicates a massive change in the way we think about mental health and neurological difference. For my autistic son, the change doesn\u2019t come fast enough, which is why we need more authors like Alderson. Theories and anecdotal stories about people with disabilities, by the people who love them, have resulted in a move towards studying the value of cognitive difference.  In the news recently, FRMI\u2019s show that some people in a \u201cvegetative state\u201d have the same brain activity as typically functioning people when asked the same questions.\u00a0  The science validates those parents who have believed for years (and criticized for those beliefs) that their children understood what was going on around them. Now fact rather than myth, the way we have treated these people has become society\u2019s ethical question. The spotlight is turning on us. By stating that there are autism myths, Alderson suggests that other facts exist \u2013 relative or absolute. There is not a lot of science in autism. Most of the science that exists is directed towards causation and treatment. New research is now pointing to autistic ability, not simply to cite the value to autistic people to our society, but also to derive a better education that is geared towards autistic intelligence, which society has a difficult time seeing beyond what appears to be severe disability and functioning. While Alderson is a clinician-first, and his observations are largely anecdotal, he cites this science and other examples. Mounting so many of these examples, which are supported by parents and autistic people, his points about autistic humanity and value become impossible to ignore. The autism myths Alderson challenges are those about affection (or the supposed lack thereof), rituals, socialization, scientific \u201cevidence,\u201d I.Q., the five-year-window, and imagination in people with autism. Parents and autistic individuals experience lack of services and quality education because of misunderstanding and a perpetuation of myths which have misguided the treatment, therapy, and education of autistic people. Most of us are much too familiar with our daily lives punctuated by therapists and teachers only citing the deficits in order to \u201cnormalize\u201d instead of teaching to autistic strengths. Autistic contributions and strengths, to date, have not been heralded enough because the disability can be very challenging. Many cannot see beyond it. Alderson completed his Masters of Education at Harvard University and originally trained with the Son Rise Program in Massachusetts, although he is not promoting the Son Rise program or any other program in this book. In fact, he points towards a more well-rounded educational plan that accommodates the autistic person.  He dedicated twenty years and practice to working with hundreds of families. \u201cThe more children I met, the more diversity I saw,\u201d he says in his book. \u201cI think we sometimes forget that we are talking about real people, a population with a very wide range of strengths and challenges and personalities. How we talk about people with autism and how we characterize them impacts how we treat them.\u201d These beliefs, he states, like the myth that autistic children can\u2019t share affection, led therapists to use holding therapies \u201cwhere children are held tightly, often against their will, for hours at a time\u2026. \u201cOr the belief that the majority of autistic children are mentally retarded led to thousands being placed in mental institutions and pushed aside in special education classrooms.\u201d The myths, he argues, \u201cinfluence research, policy, treatment and our personal relations with people with autism, and they need to be challenged.\u201d \u201cActively look for intelligence in the autistic population by removing barriers. Focus your mind and your eyes on ability,\u201d he writes.  Maybe change is hard, and the reward too small for our educators, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a point we should give up on. My son Adam was diagnosed with autism at 18 months of age. I wish that books like these could have existed ten years ago.\u00a0It would have been a much more empowering foray into the world of autism. I was one of those parents who began blogging in 2005 because from the get-go, I had difficulty related to what the \u201cexperts\u201d were telling me regarding my son\u2019s \u201clack,\u201d which Alderson addresses in his book. They did not address the joy I felt when I was with him, or the happiness and tenderness he also exuded.  Parents need to hear what their children are capable of because there is far too much time and effort being poured into being told how deficient our children are. Millions of dollars get wasted into changing our children\u2019s inherent nature instead of nurturing what is already there. All this money, and we ironically also have few places where our children can get an education. When children don\u2019t become \u201cnormal,\u201d parents can get depressed and therapists and teachers give up. Alderson quotes Carly, an autistic girl living in Toronto, who can\u2019t speak but who types independently. Carly told a television audience, \u201cNever give up on the children [you] work with.\u201d Alderson challenges the myths. Now we all need to work on redefining autism, and how an autistic person can be taught over the lifespan. I believe strongly that learning is a life-long endeavour. Our beliefs even about education ending at age eighteen or after university had more to do with getting people into the workforce in a era long past. With autistic people as well as all of society today, we are constantly learning and working at the same time. We need more talk about how to redefine the present and future for autistic people to contribute to society as they are. Also, we are just beginning to acknowledge the contributions made to society by the severely disabled, dyslexic and other disability communities. I believe the same can happen with our autistic one. This book is an empowering tool for parents, teachers and clinicians. It is readable and accessible and may open a door that educators and others may open to provide better and more opportunities for people with autism. Hopefully we will continue our quest to understand the many attributes of autism rather than making a judgment that a difference in processing is a wrong way to be human. As myths are challenged and facts are sought through science, we don\u2019t have to wait in order to treat people fairly. Challenging ideas \u2014 myths\u00a0 \u2014 is one of the most important endeavours of mankind. May we continue the dialogue for the advancement and successful living of all autistic individuals. The story of Hercules (Heracles) grappling with the giant, is a case in point. Every time Hercules hurled Antaeus to the ground, he became stronger. Clearly this is what we might politely call a tall story. But maybe there is scientific logic behind it. What if Antaeus had some sort of magnet (if you don\u2019t like the idea of a magnet, you can invent your own scenario) that made him stronger each time he hit the earth and weaker when held away from his power source? Hercules defeated another giant, Alcyoneus, only by pulling him far from his origin. The magnetic force of the earth was overcome in these examples by pulling far enough in any direction.\n  (N.S.

Adam is affable, people love him, he puts smiles on people\u2019s faces. More than this, he\u2019s systematic and likes to contribute.

I said that we as autistic families cannot ever stop going out and being part of the world. If we do, no one will understand us and there will be nothing available for autistic people. I thought this is a way for Adam to begin learning that he is valued and needed, as an autistic person.

{"date": "2011/12/23", "body": "Every year I get asked, \u201cwhat does Adam want for Christmas (or Hannukah as we celebrate both). I\u2019d like someone to come and take a look at our basement and ask that question again. I\u2019m about to divest years of collected toys and games that therpaists and teachers told us to buy; all in the hopes that it would trigger some reciprocal play or learning in Adam. The same is true for all children. Children are marketed to (and young parents) that every toy will give our children some developmental edge. While I do find many things cool and some even helpful, I believe autistic children are special targets to such marketing ploys.  This is what I bought for Adam this year: Two 2012 monkey calendars \u2014 both identical so we can write out his week and he can predict his day. So he will use one at home and one at school. One small game of  tick tack toe  because he is enjoying simple games now with others. One book. An illustrated Alice in Wonderland. No more. As I divest the things that we\u2019ve accumulated over the years to clear out our heads, I am also trying to make room for creativity. We are so eager to see a typical response in our autistic kids that we buy, buy, buy. We don\u2019t believe that boredom for the autistic child is as valuable as it is for the neurotypical one.  When I leave Adam alone, I often find him playing with a plastic monkey we bought at the jazz festival this past summer. Or he\u2019ll pull out some favorite books or another toy that he\u2019ll begin to explore. As Adam cries when he\u2019s really frustrated, and after I\u2019ve checked that he\u2019s safe, I leave him to his own devices. I am trying to help him develop his own \u201cstruggle muscle,\u201d and not rush in to save him. This helps him now to self-regulate, and it\u2019s working. It\u2019s best to leave, says Kim John Payne, M.ED and author of the book  Simplicity Parenting: Using the Extraordinary Power of Less to Raise Calmer, Happier and More Secure Kids ,  just a few toys and books on the shelf. It avoids stress and confusion. Store some away, and give away more. I know he\u2019s talking about neurotypical kids, but he does make a lot of references to ADHD and learning disabilities too. As we think of typical kids so we must of autistic ones \u2014 we must believe that as Aristotle said, every person as an essence. We are all meant to become something by our intrinsic nature. We can\u2019t develop that nature if parents constantly buy toys to entertain kids. They need to be left alone. Aristotle used the term \u201ctelos\u201d to describe it: \u201cAn acorn carries its telos within, from the beginning. Beyond our genetic gifts to them, beyond what they absorb from us and their environment, children seem to arrive with something of their very own, a telos, or intrinsic nature. The essential nature, apparent from the beginning, also points to their future, as an acorn suggests an oak. Our children come to us with a deep destiny \u2014 here again, some say spirit \u2014 that needs to be heard. It must be honored.\u201d (p.33) It all makes sense to me as Adam is an anxious child and the more visual noise or distraction, the more confusing it must be to even approach a toy and explore it. In addition to recently enjoying the monkey and books (Adam has a wide array of interests), he has taken to climbing on his bookshelf and swinging from the rope used for his OT swing \u2014 a sort of Tarzan manoever that takes me back to my own childhood. Oh how he has fun doing that! He made that game up on his own, with a high surface and a small piece of OT rope. \u201cSimplification protects the enivornment for childhood\u2019s slow, essential unfolding of the self. You needn\u2019t be a therapist to realize that most kids are quirky, aren\u2019t they? The truth is we all have our quirks, our personalities and idiosyncrasies. We tend to be more tolerant of them in adults, perhaps because we think of adults as \u2018fully formed\u2019 and children \u2018under construction\u2019 and thus more malleable. Why simplify? Over the years, I\u2019ve come to see how a child\u2019s quirks or tendencies can be exacerbated by cumulative stress.\u201d (p.26) We have guests over tonight and Adam enjoys that. I\u2019ve had a lot of people over to our home because Adam enjoys people and he\u2019s in his familiar environment where he is able to relax and particiapte more than going to someone\u2019s strange house. Tomorrow we\u2019re at his grandparents like we are every year. We have a quiet Christmas, our small family. We just want to be together and we don\u2019t need stuff to prove our love. I\u2019ve moved from being an anxious parent to one who is really beginning to see how much Adam needs and enjoys my time. No thing can replace that. No thing can also replace what he imagines for himself. Happy holidays to everyone. I hope you have a very simple and peaceful one. Adam and I will enjoy our New Year\u2026 giving our things away.

{"date": "2012/01/11", "body": "Tonight Adam asked to be carried to his bed. \u201cCarry!\u201d he implores. He has a determined look in his eye. Usually, he climbs into my lap and expects me to carry him to his bed. So I let him again, and cradled him in my arms, trying not to hit his extremities in the doorway. \u201cAdam, you are getting too big for this now,\u201d I say, my neck and back feeling strained. I carry him into his bedroom and plunk his heavy body on the soft bed. \u201cI\u2019m not a caterpillar anymore!\u201d he says melodically, and smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s right Adam!\u201dI am pleasantly surprised. It is a rare lucid statement. With all his movements and chants, for the unexperienced, it is difficult to believe Adam is understanding, or paying attention to, many things. Yet I\u2019ve always known he does, even on the days I get frustrated when he can\u2019t respond. There is a story that Adam The  Caterpillar and the Polliwog  by Jack Kent. He is using the line from that story and I know he has associated my discussions about him becoming a big boy to the story. \u201cYou are not a caterpillar anymore. You are a butterfly!\u201d Adam lifts his head from his pillow. With a big smile, he plants a kiss on my lips and lies back down, contented. I turn out the lights and say goodnight. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about Adam and his growth over the past year. Over the New Year, I\u2019ve been thinking how this will be Adam\u2019s first complete decade, and my first decade as a mom. I simply cannot believe that it\u2019s been that long as I remember our journey with autism and with each other. Adam was diagnosed with autism at 19 months of age and I began writing privately in coffee shops about our experiences when Adam spent a couple of hours in pre-school. I started The Joy of Autism blog and running the events of  The Autism Acceptance Project  when Adam was three years old. Reaction to my blog and title of the events ( The Joy of Autism: Redefining Ability of Quality of Life ) were met with both applause and contempt. Today, we read about the joy of autism and parenting an autistic child much more often. Then, parents who were struggling with challenging behaviours and expectations of a cure, challenged me.  What did I know?!  questioned many parents of slightly older autistic children who were being phased out of services.  Wait until your autistic child grows up, then you\u2019ll be in big trouble; you\u2019ll see what we are going through. He won\u2019t be cute forever!  I suppose we\u2019ve now reached that same stage. While Adam can still be cute, he is quickly becoming a pre-teen.  In the past decade, we have struggled with acceptance, understanding from others,  and in finding a great education. We deal with stigma, and having to justify why we behave as we do. As parents, we are sometimes pitied or called heroes. It\u2019s hard to be a normal parent in the \u201coutside world,\u201d even though autism is our normal. Having to justify our children, and their right, need, and desire to be included can be exhausting if not downright heart-breaking. We keep going out there every day as we brush disappointment off our weary selves. I suppose this is brave. I also realize, that as bloggers, writers, and advocates, everyone has an opinion. When there is no one cause for autism that science can find, the speculation gets polemic. The nexus of contention seems to be the nature of autistic being and intelligence; is autism a natural, \u201calternative\u201d way to be human, or is it a defect of the human condition? Of course, I believe it is what it is, although throughout the years I\u2019ve always questioned my own thinking. I still come back to the value of human diversity. Whatever the reason or the cause, I value Adam for who and what he is, how he thinks. I also recognize and try to assist his challenges. I cannot call him a defect. He is whole, loving, able, with his disability. I can\u2019t think of my life without him in it. He requires the extra effort of all to understand his differences in order to enable him. Being constantly challenged for my beliefs has been exhausting and emotional at times. The blessing of this first decade has been the deeper recognition and understanding of the values I held instinctively, and early on. In the past decade of writing and talking about Adam and autism, I\u2019ve been torn between sharing parts of our experience and our privacy. In the hopes of helping Adam\u2019s future, I\u2019ve seriously thought about whether or not to close the blog, especially since Adam\u2019s first decade also included a divorce \u2014 a challenge for any child, and an extra challenge for Adam. I decided that not only does writing about experience help me as his mother, but that sharing is a gift we both give and receive. I was helped by the writing and sharing of other autistic people and parents. I don\u2019t want to fear the sharing, although I\u2019m continually challenged by this. Of course, it is my duty to protect Adam and his privacy, so I believe that every parent must choose our stories carefully. I\u2019ve decided to continue writing. I also can\u2019t help thinking about the parents who had autistic children ten years before us. Many were the parents in Canada who argued for ABA to be covered as medically necessary treatment (the political argument still exists). Some parents found out about Dr. Lovaas in L.A. and even moved down with their children for treatment, and I may have done the same thing if Adam had been born earlier \u2014 maybe not.  Adam was born in 2002. In 1992, ABA was turned to as  the  hope for the education and life skills training for autistic children. It was believed that ABA would be the way to shape the child\u2019s behaviour and normalize them, in time for school. It seemed much more humane and reasonable than  \u201cholding therapy.\u201d The window in which to do this, they were told (and we were too) was five to six years of age. If a child could not talk or learn normally by then, the window of opportunity would close. The \u201cearly diagnosis is key,\u201d notice, is also used for cancer, and I know from personal experience that yes, better to get a cancer early (another part of our past decade). Science, parents, autistic people, however, have proven that there is no such thing as lost opportunity. Autistic people need continued life-long learning. I like to think of that all of us require continued training throughout our lives to put this in perspective. New methods and teaching approaches have been explored and integrated into many classrooms. ABA therapy has, to some extent, integrated different therapies into their own practice. By \u201coperationalizing\u201d these other methods and taking \u201cdata\u201d it seems to have been rebranded as \u201cPositive Behavioural Therapy\u201d or \u201cSupport. While there is still controversy there because the therapy still doesn\u2019t fully address the abilities and the nature of autistic perception and intelligence, one could view it as a step forward.  It is also difficult to let go of labels. Political policies are built on them. They are made for autistic people largely by non autistic people. Definitions and systems must be defined in policy, and this has been difficult for autistic people because their issues have not fully been acknowledged. So we must be cautious not to lose sight of the progress have made in the science regarding autistic ability, perception and intelligence. We must continue to work to answer the question on how we can best educate and address an autistic person\u2019s needs, and how an autistic person can participate in society as they are. The dyslexic community had to learn and now so must we. Ten years before ABA took hold in Canada, in 1982, Lorna Wing wrote her pivotal paper reviving the work of Hans Asperger and spotlighting Aspergers sydrome in her paper,  Aspergers Syndrome: A Clinical Account . It was ten years after that paper that Autism Spectrum Disorder label and definition of the \u201ctriad of impairments\u201d made it into the DSM IV. In thinking about decades, I thought back to 1972 when Ontario\u2019s last mental institution was shut down. It freaks me out to think that Adam\u2019s life could have been so very different thirty or more decades ago. He would have been even more segregated than he is today.  As I measure the decades against autism treatment, and treatment of autistic people, I see that in 2012, we\u2019re learning more every day. We do so even in a perilous time when \u201cdesigner babies\u201d arguably threaten the continued existence of people with disabilities. Many communities like ours and the Down syndrome community grieve the loss of others \u201clike\u201d them as a loss of community. We\u2019ve launched autism acceptance movement, akin to other civil rights movements, for the equal and fair regard of autistic people in our society. It is still a nascent movement of which most people are unaware. We have not accomplished full inclusion and accommodation. We still have not raised enough awareness. As I think to 2022, when Adam will be twenty years old, I hope for the ability for Adam to continue his education and the welcoming of his assistants not because he is unable, but because he can be enabled with them. I want for his participation in his own life planning, pre-college/university prep, and vocational training that will be unique to the needs of him and others like him. I think of his life, like mine, as a continual learning curve \u2014 certainly not ending at the age of twenty one. I watch and read the other parents and autistic individuals ten years ahead of us, and wish to thank them for the paths they are forging. I look ahead to the next couple of decades. There was a time I fretted about it until I realized that time is relative and all people develop as they should. I worried about Adam\u2019s future and where he would live. Yet, I intend to hang in there with him, come what may. I had some very difficult moments after my divorce and raising Adam here alone and this is when my worries were at an all-time high. On one very low day, a calm and quiet thought suddenly entered my head, and it was filled with love. While autism may have brought me some of my greatest challenges, it has also bestowed my greatest gift.  I love Adam more than words. He has always been my pride and joy. I know that it is my duty to assist him, and to find others to assist him along the way who will help him become the man he is meant to be. Maybe I just can\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to be ten years old this year. I turned on an old video when he was first diagnosed. He is twenty months and has the same smile, the same boundless energy. He is the same boy in a growing, lanky body. He is a butterfly.

{"date": "2012/01/31", "body": "I have serious jet lag. I returned on Saturday, after supper time.  It was a journey of thirty hours. The route home was Colombo-Bankok-Beijing-Toronto. On the last day, I realized I caught my first Sri Lankan cold and I suffered all the way home, making the thirty hours feel like sixty. Seriously, you can\u2019t tell the difference after the first twenty-four. I returned home to my cherub. Adam was waiting for me and the transition from his father back to my home was a happy one. I was worried the little guy would be pissed with me for being gone twelve days. The opposite was true. I tried to avoid making face-to-face contact with Adam, since I had come down with a serious sniffle, muted by a continuous in-flight feed of Contact C. He would have none of that. Adam grabbed my face, our round fleshy cheeks squished together, and he continued to kiss mine all over. Ah well. We are happily reunited and I am on the mend. I woke at midnight tonight and forced myself to say in bed until three this morning. There is a wisp of white snow on the ground and I gather today will be another gray one. I am recalling all the sights and sounds of my trip, especially the warm light and emerald colour of rice patty fields.  I will send my cherub off to school in a bit. Later, I will hopefully find some words and sentences that do justice to my first trip to Asia. In twelve whril-wind days, major flight time, and time zone changes, I still feel silenced by overwhelming differences. My experience is still blend of flickering images and sensory recollections.  As I blend back into my daily life here, I realize it will take me a few more days to articulate what I\u2019ve experienced.

Credit:  Ayslum: Inside The Closed World of State Mental Hospitals , MIT Press, 2009.) \u201cAutism is a growing burden on society in Ontario,\u201d said Steve Hudson, co-chair of the Spectrum of Hope Autism Foundation. Mr. Hudson is  promoting the Kae Martin Centre, a place that will house autism research and life-skill teaching under one roof.   I kindly ask for an apology from Mr. Hudson for his unfortunate use of language. As for the Centre, in one respect, it always sounds like it could be a relief \u2014 there are very few programs that adequately teach, or even recognize, autistic strength. On the other hand, when I read in our national newspaper,  The Globe and Mail , that autistics must have a place to be sequestered to \u201clearn how to cook,\u201d shivers run up and down my spine. My son, and many others like him, can do more than learn how to cook.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with learning to cook, or being a cook, of course. It is wonderful that there are places being created to learn the skills that autistic people need to learn. But in autism we do know that continued, or Life Long Learning is a must in the making of an autistic life and education. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, either. In my forties, I returned to university for my M.A. and I\u2019ve been taking courses, and will, all of my life. Autistic people and their families want to be a part of the community. Autistic people wish to receive accommodation and recognition as whole, valuable human beings. As soon as people present with a disability, odd behaviour, we automatically think of them as aberrant.  I can\u2019t believe sometimes that I still have to write posts like this. I keep hoping that \u201cautism advocates\u201d will actually become educated by listening to the autstic population around the world, many of whom are considered \u201cseverely autistic,\u201d but have learned to socialize and communicate by typing, for instance. I am so despondent, admittedly, when I hear that the use of terms like \u201cburden\u201d are ways to appeal for money. What about accomplishment? What about the many autistic individuals who contribute right now? Could we be achieving more for our autistic children, young and old? We are so behind other disabilities that were once viewed the same way \u2014 children were segregated, treated as dumb, assessed as unable to contribute anything to society. Later, such as in the recent HBO  Journey Into Dyslexia , these same \u201cchildren\u201d are now talking about how their disability has advanced society itself. Many of our technologies that we use and take for granted today, were invented for individuals with communication disabilities. As I read the article, the first thing that came to mind was what kind of research would be housed under one roof? Will it be to understand autistic thinking, processing and ability? How to teach the autistic person? Or are the same founders duped by the  ABA is the only scientifcally proven therapy for autism  myth? It is not scientifically proven. It simply has the most scientific research behind it. as Jonathan Adler states in his recent book,  Challenging the Myths of Autism , \u201cthe most evidence does not mean the only evidence.\u201d  I have to be honest. I have mixed feelings of putting Adam in an ABA school. Sure, everyone is nice and so far it\u2019s eclectic, so for us it\u2019s the best out there. Even writing about this, and I feel I put ourselves at risk for displacement where there is really no where else to go. Yet, I have to be honest in hopes for more services for us and every other autistic family out there. I think a civil dialogue about the issues pertaining to autism and their therapies and education is the best way to progress. I do this with Adam\u2019s current school and it\u2019s going very well. I also see that Adam is calmer and happier there. The staff is friendly and organized and have been so helpful to me. I do wonder if there is far too much time be wasted on baseline protocol \u2014 testing things Adam has known for years, and I worry about falling more behind. It\u2019s too soon to tell and I\u2019ll report back. From the other point of view, Adam has to get more \u201cfluent,\u201d and I don\u2019t disagree that practice is important for Adam. It is my opinion that Adam\u2019s disability is not fully taken into account by all schools, ABA or not \u2014 his catatonic-like movement and inconsitency. This school that I have Adam registered in, however, does teach him what I want them to, like literacy and typing, but of course everything in ABA becomes operationalized. All other methods  tend to become  ABA methods, even though they didn\u2019t start off that way.  What an autism school can do for him right now, where there is such a lack in Ontario, is provide him with better understanding and structure. They also have the ability to help us with some of the more challenging behaviour that arises from time-to-time, and seem to treat Adam with respect for his anxiety. What I am trying to say is that many methods matter and have to be included in the curriculum and in some settings I see this being incorporated more. I am always sending emails about understanding Adam\u2019s behaviour and treating him with respect. I often wonder when people will become sick of me. But I cannot stop. There is a part of me that knows that we all have to work with what\u2019s already out there. Throwing him into a school with others where there was no such understanding and for Inclusion sake, didn\u2019t work for Adam at this point in time.  His current school is willing to deal with what I want for Adam, while making other suggestions and I\u2019m willing to give it a try now that he is older and the method could be more suitable to him. Overall, though, an IEP for an autstic child must include life skills, academics, communication and social skills training, among so many other things. Adam is lucky to have all this and we are always asking questions about priorities and balance. Each autistic child\u2019s needs are very different. What I want is for Adam to be accommodated for these needs in all settings. Adam enjoys his peers, but peers are not taught to accept Adam after a certain age. Adam isn\u2019t viewed in these settings as someone who can contribute. He\u2019s viewed as someone who needs extra help. That someone who needs extra help is viewed as the burden. So I\u2019m worried just about every day. I want Adam to be safe, happy and learning. He wants to be out of the house and with others and he typed a couple of weeks ago \u201cI want friends.\u201d How do I ensure that he is being included in society, programs, and where he also wishes to be? How do I ensure he doesn\u2019t become so bored (because he has a curious mind), because he can\u2019t respond consistently? It tears me apart. So when I hear of Autism Centres, I get a mixed reactions. I want Adam out and about safely, and he comes out and about when he\u2019s with me every weekend. I get queasy that Centres, and the lack of enforcement of Inclusion Policy in Canada, will continue to force us away from our community, and we become more isolated. I spend hours trying to find activities for Adam where is is happily included with an aide, but it seems to be getting more difficult. My mind is haunted by images of insitutions, even though the last one was closed in Canada in 1972. We tend to think of mental hospitals as snake pits, hells of chaos and misery, squalor and brutality,\u201d says Oliver Sacks in his introduction to  Asylum: Inside the Closed World of State Mental Hospitals . \u201cMost of them, now, are shattered and abandoned \u2014 and we think with a shiver of the terror of those who once found themselves confined to such places.\u201d  \u201cLike so many lofty ideals, the asylums failed to live up to their expectations.\u201d Asylums were supposed to be places where disabled and mentally \u201cill\u201d individuals could learn life skills, do art, create community. We all know what happened to these facilities and the levels of abuse inside of them. I dream of autism schools somedays, ones that are as well revered as schools for gifted children (as many of our children, once they can start typing can end up there). I dream of Adam being included safely and accommodated in a public school where he is accepted and respected. I dream of people talking of autstic ability seriously as part of autism, not as an anechdote to autism, for that\u2019s just another way of writing autistic people off. On the other hand, I am worried sick about the fate of Adam and where I place him every day. Is he really learning enough, to his abilities? Or are his deficits the only thing that will ever be the target in his IEP? How much time in a day does this single mother have to defend, program and place him? I want to be happy about a new place where Adam is viewed as someone who can make it, who will contribute, who is intelligent. I have a dream. I know that typical people don\u2019t think they need to care about us or where we will end up. Yet if you really think about it, it is our greatest lesson in the study of humanity. Our growing disabled population challenge our views and the way we treat others. In the words of Michel Berube, of the popular memoir about his son with Down syndrome  Life As We Know It: A Father, A Family, An Exceptional Child,  writes in his introduction to Simi Linton\u2019s  Claiming Disability: Knowledge and Identity  about the field of Critical Disability Studies: \u201cI now believe that my resistance to disability studies is a piece with a larger and more insidious cultural form of resistance whereby nondisabled people find it difficult or undesirable to imagine that disability law is central to civil rights legistation\u2026as Simi Linton shows us [Critical Disability Studies] should be central to what we do in the humanities. And perhaps, just perhaps, if disability is understood as central to the humanities, it will evenutally be understood as central to humanity.\u201d The weight of our morals and ethics about how we treat and regard autistic people may be our real burden. So I guess I\u2019m back at the blog, here, defending our right to be smack dab in the middle of our wonderful city, hoping for Centres and schools that will celebrate the lives of autistic people, their strengths, ability and potential.  All I can ask, is to please see us as fully whole, not broken, human beings.

{"date": "2013/04/07", "body": "April 2nd makes me quiet. So many voices, so many people who need to \u201cspeak\u201d on behalf of many autistic people \u2013 I don\u2019t think that this needs another voice\u2026 well, just not on April 2nd \u201cLight it Up Blue\u201d Campaign generated by Autism Speaks. Let me begin by a poignant finding by Paula C. Durbin-Westby in her article:   Public Law 109-416 Is Not Just About Scientific Research: Speaking Truth to Power At Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee Meetings (Disability Studies Quarterly) . As she sits as one autistic person on the committee to advise the  Combating Autism Act  agenda, she highlights that, \u201cin 2008, less than 1%, about $1.6 million of the $127 million total NIMH budget was allocated for services and supports reserach. This one percent, recommended by those who are considered high-level experts on autism, was supposed to cover the following: service delivery, community inclusion issues, transition issues, education, housing, transportation, health care access, and other service related research. By contrast, in 2009, $75 million was allocated to a single cure-related research initiative. The initiative funded? [that is, service initiatives]\u2026\u201d It is more than clear, it screams, actually (not speaks) that funding priority is given to eradicated autism. Awareness campaigns are not devoted to understanding autism for the acceptance and for services that enable us to live peaceful lives within society. This is why sometimes it\u2019s just not that inspiring for me to write blog posts during the month of April. It is also concerning that we are compelled to react to the  Light It Up Blue  and other campaigns that have denigrated and devalued autistic lives. As I write \u201cautistic lives,\u201d even, I sit uncomfortably, for it is a definition that tends to essentialize and determine a set of characteristics that are supposed to belong to all autistic individuals. This is difficult for people whose lives are indeed at stake \u2013 there is a need to demonstrate that lives have value, and pride movements arise from these need. However, it is important to remember that neuroscience is not at all empirical or objective. It is rooted in philosophy ( theroy of mind theory and the like).   When I see neuroscience portending to find the eitology of autism, I imagine giving Kant an fMRI machine. I\u2019m not claiming that there is anything necessarily wrong with this curiousity, as long as we acknowledge that it is an human inclination to keep digging inside the body to find what makes us human\u2026autistic people happen to be the targets. Notice how the rates of autism diagnosis always happen to increase right before  Autism Awareness Month ? The neo-liberal machine is hard a work. The autistic body, experiences \u201cused\u201d by science and then shaped by external \u201cobeservation\u201d  \u2013 which is in and of itself shaped by a label and a framework named autism) \u2013 becomes objectified. The question about  Autism Acceptance Month , a response by people with the autism label to \u201cAutism Awareness Month,\u201d has unique opportunities to not only raise these issues, but to remain flexible. Humans are never fixed. Our knowledge and imaginings constantly transform over time and contexts. Autism is not a new invention and arguably, claimed I nge Mans, mental retardation didn\u2019t exist  in the nineteenth century \u2013 curious since this was the great age of Confinement for people labeled idiots and the \u201cfeeble-minded.\u201d (I recommend C.F. Goodey\u2019s,  The History of Intellectual Disability ).The language may change (as much as the ever-changing diagnosis\u2019 as in our upcoming DSM V), but it seems that humanity doesn\u2019t. There have always been disabled people and there always will be. The point to is to stay open to the possibilities and if we are going to promote awareness; this awareness of a history of disability, institutionalization, and abuse (of particular concern since ECT (Electric Shock Therapy) is on the rise in Canada and the U.S. for mentally \u201cill\u201d people and people with autism, notes scholar,  A.J. Withers). \n \nThere is a need for political action and reaction as well as this campaign for greater awareness and acceptance for what is happening to autistic people in society and why. The funding allocations loudly speak, or express, what Obama might call, \u201cgood folks doing not so good things.\u201d (That\u2019s not verbatim\u2026but something like that). A critical inquiry into why we do and how we do it must always be pursued \u2013 how can the  Autism Acceptance Movement  create learning opportunities for folks who do not yet understand the complexities of disability? The medical profession is crossing borders with critical disability inquiry, but we need more. It does not yet understand disability.  The charity-model, using cure campaigns and illness metaphors, misses so many points and needs of many autistic people and families to live peacefully, and equally, in society as autistic people. Many more folks require assistance, services, right to education (which is not yet a given despite legislation), and different kinds of supports \u2013  how on earth is a paltry sum going to cut it, unless we are implying that the majority of funds for cure research is intended to cut out autism from society?

{"date": "2013/04/08", "body": "To follow yesterdays post, I want to continue with some ways to incorporate \u201cautism acceptance\u201d into our communities while also resisting appropriation and totalizing effects. In other words, how do we keep the concept of acceptance open and as a human rights and substantive equality issue and to guard against the omission of others?  As humanists, how can we work to include people at the proverbial table? Who is missing from it? As Simon and Masschelein state in Shelley Tremain (2009), \u201cwhat the discourse on inclusion takes for granted \u2013 namely, that human beings become individuals by belonging to a totality \u2013 is part of a governmental history and, furthermore, exemplifies the double-bond of individualization and totalization\u201d (225). In the vein of  bell hooks  and others, \u201c\u2026disabled [people] may need some encouragement to explore the possible ways of being active subjects with options for transgression. Practices of transgression, in the context of inclusion, differ from a more antagonistic form of frontational styles of resistance; they represent a more agnostic form of struggle against those who attempt to exclude. Transgression could, on the one hand, be seen as representing a restricted level of engagement for disabled people; on the other hand, however, transgression could signal opportunities for practical involvement in battles that can be won\u2026.[this kind of exploration] may encourage disabled [people] to \u2018escape grasps of categories.\u201d (Simon & Masschelein, and Foucault in Tremain, 202). At the York University Critical Disability Studies conference last weekend, as well as in other conversations, I usually will come across conversations within and from without the autistic community on how we could possibly include \u201clower\u201d functioning and non-verbal autistic individuals. Usually the conversation peeters as people consider the systems and frameworks that are currently constructed, and how autistic people can function within them. This should illustrate the issue from the get-go \u2013 that the systems that are constructed are exclusive to many. Some of our more verbal members of the autistic community are permitted to participate because of the ability to acquire the \u201cappropriate\u201d skills, even if they are like exhausting performances for many. It could be considered as necessary to penetrate what was once even more impenetrable, but it doesn\u2019t completely resolve our problem as a community. There are also folks doing participatory research in the field, yet often time and money constraints from research funding bodies don\u2019t make space and time that is needed for the involvement of non-verbal individuals who need to take their time. These are considered, by normates in particular, as the least valuable members of our community because they are slow in a society that values speed, and this of course is conflated with efficiency.  The notion of finding ways to enable transgression is a possible way forward. In sitting on boards with \u201cbehavioural\u201d (I\u2019m using scare quotes for a reason, folks), and people who do not communicate typically, I can at least offer one observation that may contribute to this notion of acceptance \u2013 patience and consideration. For example, it is not great in a meeting if we say,  okay that person\u2019s formulating a comment or response so while we\u2019re doing that let\u2019s just move on with X.  Rather, let there be silence so that others can have their say, in whatever manner they may say it! Let there be at least the time and the respect for people who need pictorial notes, who need time to use their devices, whose bodies require more space or close proximity or to jump up and down. My friends, could we all consider enabling other transgressive acts for freedom? These are the thoughts I wake up with every day as I enjoy interacting with my son.  I\u2019d like to also add some great ideas from others for integrating acceptance into this month, and I hope every month such as this site from  Autistic Self Advocacy Network  and  The Autism Acceptance Day/Month  site and blog and  The Autism Acceptance Project.  It\u2019s great to see folks working so hard for this. I guess I just don\u2019t think \u201cawareness\u201d or acceptance should happen during solely during the month of April. To me that\u2019s like being nice to a person one day a year on their birthday. I can\u2019t even limit to a decade. The humanitarian movement should happen every day, and our need to promote acceptance speaks volumes about how people are feeling, treated and regarded in society.

If you haven\u2019t yet watched  Wretches and Jabberers,  you can access the entire movie on YouTube. Here they are at a panel at Chapman University. As for my son, he is asked to type independently by his teachers for work. At home, I support him to communicate more complicated conversation. Some days he is fully independent and other days he isn\u2019t. I believe that provided supported communication is a substantive right as it is for the Deaf community to have interpreters to interact in society. I view this only as a way to view how autistic people are not granted the right to supported communication or many forms of assistance or devices as a right because the ABA lobby in Canada takes the attention away from these rights.  (Also note: such a comparator group was not used in  Auton v. B.C.  because autism was cited only as a medical condition that should receive remediation under Medicare\u2026which is very problematic on many levels for substantive equality, and which deserves more attention than I\u2019m writing in this post. The Auton case is an example of adverse effect discrimination, that is, not recognizing the right to be different, but instead, simply put, that autistic people need to be remediated or normalized  before  having the right to be included and/or educated and/or to participate in society. The case is so problematic that I encourage people to read  Michelle Dawson\u2019s factum . I also drew attention to this in  Moore v. British Columbia, 2012  where this adverse effect was acknowledged in the factum. I have also written a series of papers on the law which may be added to this website at a later date).  My son\u2019s speech (the oh so important goal of most people for better or worse, and often to the detriment of some autistics) happens to become more fluent as he is supported. He\u2019ll begin to type a sentence, and then more able to complete what he\u2019s started by speech. This shows that it acts, for him anyway, very much as a prompt. An important one.

In it, she describes the false premise of autism \u201crecovery\u201d of ABA therapy and the masters of \u201crecovery\u201d constructions, Ivar Lovaas, and Catherine Maurice. She also addresses the neo-liberal construct of corporate \u201ccharity\u201d with careful analysis of  Autism Speaks . A quote: \u201cOne may argue that rhetoric is at its most powerful when it functions most successfully ideologically \u2013 that is, when the systems of ideas that it draws upon and represents are so naturalized and appear to be so commonsensical that one may fail to even notice what it obscures and precludes. Wilson and Lewiecki-Wilson (2001) argue that language and rhetoric play a performative function, \u2018calling this naturalized meaning of disability into circulation,\u2019 and in so doing, \u2018actually restrict[ing] thinking about disability in any other way.\u201d (2011)\n I\u2019d like to suggest a new Senate Committee Report to update the  Pay Now Pay Later: Autism Families in Crisis  which was drafted in 2007 after  Auton  to consider an additional prong, of \u201cautism service\u201d that would address the \u201ccrisis\u201d that Canadians now face. That is, I propose a report to rehabilitate all non-autistic Canadians via an urgently needed national strategy as outlined in a  Rehabilitation of Canadian Attitudes Towards Autistic Citizens  report. This strategy would aim to accept autism as part of the Canadian mosaic and to recognize the substantive equality of autistic individuals. This would include, but not be limited to, education, inclusion, all services that assist autistic Canadians, as well as access to services and entitlements that are available to all Canadian citizens. Further, this report could suggest methods for committees that have \u201cinvited\u201d autistic people to \u201cstakeholder meetings\u201d so as not to assume that all autistic people can communicate or participate on the same terms and time limits, and with complete independence (i.e.;without support staff or facilitators). This committee could recognize the value of autistic Canadian citizens in an effort to accommodate and make available the means by which verbal and non-verbal citizens can suggest,  for themselves , the types of supports they may require to participate in their communities. Also, the report\u2019s committees would consist of autistic individuals \u2013 the highly verbal to the non-verbal \u2013 and be a model for participatory methods.  The rehabilitation service component could involve 40 hours of intensive therapy per week to modify the behaviour of non-autistic Canadians currently engaged with autism charity, and the like.  These individuals are often \u201ctrapped\u201d inside the body of the  rhetoric of science  (a highly subjective field costumed as \u201cobjective\u201d by lexical construction) and could be cured. This would recover all non-autistic Canadian citizens from subjectivity and discrimination \u2013 to name the core symptoms of this disease. This should be the treatment of choice to ameliorate the prejudice towards, and the exclusion of, autistic citizens which would thereby create a more united and inclusive Canada that accepts that autistic people are both different and equal. I strongly suggest that the Canadian government provide funding for this therapy as a \u201cnon-core medical service\u201d to be funded under Medicare to help relieve the burden and costs of prejudice that eventually all Canadians will have to bear.

This year, a place where children could partake in circus arts.

The RDSP is a savings vehicle to provide future support for persons with disabilities. Parents or guardians may open an RDSP for a child. However, adults with intellectual disabilities and others whose competence may be an issue may face challenges in opening or withdrawing from an RDSP without undergoing an expensive and lengthy competency process. \u201cWe are extremely pleased to be asked by the Ontario government to undertake this project,\u201d said Professor Bruce P. Elman, Chair of the LCO Board of Governors. \u201cIt reflects recognition of the high quality of the LCO\u2019s work and its contribution to law reform in the province.\u201d The LCO will draw on work in two prior projects in which it has released final reports, its Framework for the Law as It Affects Older Adults and its Framework for the Law as It Affects Persons with Disabilities. It is currently undertaking a large project on capacity, decision-making and guardianship from which the RDSP project will benefit. The LCO will also call on the relationships with legal and academic experts and community members developed in the process of the older adults, persons with disabilities projects and capacity projects. Launched in September 2007, the LCO is funded by the Law Foundation of Ontario, the Ministry of the Attorney General, Osgoode Hall Law School and the Law Society of Upper Canada, with additional financial and in-kind support from York University and support from the Ontario law schools.

By noon, I heard the barking cough \u2013 the seal-like sound gasping for air. His face was beat red and temperature burning hot against the back of my hand. As I fumbled my with my phone by his side to reach the doctor, I tried to keep him calm. In my head,  I plotted to call emergency in the next few minutes if he didn\u2019t get better. He did. I managed to get him to the bathroom and then to the doctor\u2019s office.  \u201cSick!\u201d he said in a croaked voice struggling to speak.  \u201cI know, Adam. You\u2019re going to see the doctor and you\u2019re going to be okay. Now don\u2019t cry.\u201d I hated saying it as if I was telling him to be a brave boy, but I knew if he did, he might not be able to breathe again. His face was crying even if his voice didn\u2019t.

{"date": "2013/05/09", "body": "I\u2019m writing my thesis and am hankering to blog \u2013 so many things on my mind with the recent Ontario budget proposal, the ever-so teensy weensy allowance for an individual on ODSP to take home a couple hundred bucks a month and the way we may have to reconsider how we advocate for support as autistic families. Can I say at least it wasn\u2019t cut altogether as was the original threat? Also in the budget is a brief mention of autism services and a reduction of wait-list times for those in urgent need. I\u2019d like here to write a post for all of us to reconsider what all autistic people and families need, and how we have to lobby.  I\u2019m writing my thesis on autism advocacy, in particular, among non-verbal populations. There are wonderful contributions to this already out there to be cited. Also,  The Autism Acceptance Project (TAAP)  is in meetings, where the autistic population is setting the agenda and I am a facilitator/organizer (also we hope to announce an upcoming event soon). I\u2019ve thought long and hard about the work of autistic folks and re-evaluate my role as a partner and ally to Adam and others. The most fundamental concern I have that will effect all autistic people and their families is autistic rights \u2013 to be viewed as valuable citizens; this means that the \u201cspectrum\u201d concept of functioning does not preclude rights and that all people are equal and valuable. This is addressed in  substantive equality , where differential treatment must be sought for many to achieve equality (Rioux, 1999). In other words, many disabled people require support and accommodation to participate in their chosen ways in society. What is particularly worrisome to me as a parent of an autistic child, is the lack of access and lack of education. Yet, I also see our traditional education system crumbling, which to me, provides a new opportunity to finally give access to education for everyone. This post proposes not only services to alleviate families, but many opportunities for autistic people of all ages. Here, I see potential for those who are also ABA lobbyists (I will specifically mention this group since ABA is cited in all government literature now and as I predicted in 2005, it would be the only service available to autistics) to change their drumbeat from tragedy to substantive rights. I\u2019ve cited recently the  Jefferey Moore  case in British Columbia (2012) wherein it was stated that the notion of remediation risked  adverse effect discrimination . I would argue the same \u2013 that when we believe we have to remediate an autistic individual, or any individual with a learning disability,  before  allowing them access to school, or to an education, then this is a fundamental oppression and devaluation. ABA schools can consider integrating academics into their methods as well as any other therapies out there, thus supporting, enabling, respecting (instead of normalizing) autistic being. That Augmentative Assistive Communication (AAC) and other supported communication techniques is not considered a right to communication should be an outrage to us all. At one time, the Deaf community was not allowed to sign! Now, the same thing is happening to the non-verbal autism community. The most fundamental right is the right to access communication. Yet, teachers also have to learn how to support an autistic person to use them, while also considering the autistic learning style (there is research out there you can find easily on this). There are enough autistic independent typists as well as teaching methods available. I could go on \u2014 video monitors, white boards, computers \u2013 these are fundamental for autistic learning and we all have a wonderful opportunity to learn to support autistic individuals! My question to educators and supporters, how can we change the way we do things to support autistic rights? Back to the the right to education \u2013 music, art, math, science, geography \u2013 all of these are fundamental to an individual\u2019s quality of life. Adam is autistic and has a curious mind. When he is introduced to new topics, they may be hard at first if they are taught in traditional ways, but as he learns he becomes more interested, proud and excited; doors open and he wants to learn more! Should an autistic person in a Verbal Behaviour or ABA program be denied access to academic material when they have read the same word since they were a toddler? Or, can this new material be integrated within a program? How creative can we be?How can autistic children be allowed access to their own interests and material and how can teachers facilitate their continued learning of what interests them? These are also fundamental rights \u2013 the right to choose and to follow one\u2019s own path. While it has been cited numerous times that everyone \u2013 disabled and not \u2013 can benefit from an individualized approach to education \u2013 it as also been deemed difficult in the traditional system where teachers have been the gatekeepers of knowledge.  I was turned on recently to   Sal Kahn, who has created a series of educational videos on YouTube  which are utilized by some classrooms. Some teachers are reconsidering their role as facilitators instead of lecturers at the front of the classroom, monitoring a child\u2019s work on the computer using Kahn\u2019s lessons, and then stepping in to help when needed. Online learning can be very effective for autistic individuals and must be considered if we are to enable a future of autistic participation and contribution. This provides fantastic opportunities where video learning and technology \u2013 such as Mindcraft \u2013  are enablers \u2013 autistic people can build in this program, make art and new worlds, and this can be a monitored learning program (and many do which attests to innate autistic intelligence and ability). Online friendships and self-advocacy, as reported by many non-verbal autistic individuals, have also enabled better socialization skills in virtual and real time. How can rethink such spaces that are already at our disposal? How can we allow for autistic work to take place  also  on autistic terms? We have to reconsider these spaces from traditional ones to creative ones where all people can participate. At the moment, I can say that while I work to have Adam included, he is mostly segregated \u2013 goes to school, goes to a few programs with an aide worker which thankfully enables him to participate. Within the system at our disposal, we work with Adam\u2019s team to provide him the best we can and we are all learning. But this is what I ask of all Canadian society \u2013 at least give Adam, and others, the opportunity to participate. To-date, he is not allowed. Even trying to get Adam into certain schools is fraught with traditional testing \u2013 not allowing him frequent pre-visits or adapting work in formats that he can best respond to. All I can say is, the world is losing out too for Adam can give back so much. As I consider my daily life as Adam\u2019s mother, and how my heart wrenches for him  \u2013 I at least want him to have choices. This drives my work towards a more inclusive future (which may require specialized education in the real sense of education for his future \u2013 not sequestering, normalizing and presuming incompetence) for our children and for families to support this, this also traverses to the arena of advocacy with such questions as: What of my role as his parent and an \u201cautism rights activist?\u201d How can I, as a non-autistic person who is used to traditional hierarchical boards, committees and organization, become familiar with an alternative way of organization and allowing a new space, or room, for autistic self-advocates? How can autistic people enable us when some of us  are  listening? What about virtual spaces  and how might they be maximized? How can we allow for dissent and debate that reflects true democracy and recognize that not all autistic people feel the same way, not all people require the same supports, and not everyone will agree?  What must we recognize in ourselves as neurotypical teachers, parents, therapists, caregivers and charity organizers in stepping aside  and  lending a hand to create this space? In speaking of charity and it\u2019s historical role of \u201chanding out,\u201d how can we build communities that support self-advocate needs? In one sense, I truly understand the need for autistic people to have this space, and predominant \u201cvoices,\u201d if you will, but we also all have to recognize the important role of allies and parent supporters and educate families about the history of the autistic self-advocacy, and its fragility. We cannot afford to lose the ground gained by autistic-self advocates!  Autistic people also have to allow for us to become political facilitators alongside autistic people without us more verbally loquacious dominating the agenda or \u201cspeaking over\u201d autistics. Autistic people can teach us patience and learning to listen without speaking over. Let me ramble here by making another comment \u2013 research teams and funders have to recognize this urgent need for emancipatory research that requires much patience and time, and make allowances for it. Here, I acknowledge the  independence via interdependence  model that I write a lot about \u2013 that we tend to advocate for complete autonomy and independence that drives our therapies and expectations for autistic people before giving them full value and citizenship. Yet when we truly look at how interdependent we all are \u2013 on our families, on technology, on a service system, none of us are independent. This is the area in which we need to discuss when we talk about autism services \u2013 not a cradle to grave service where we put autistic people away,  but a collective economy of support where autistic people can also contribute and where we do not view responsibility as something tragic. I can only think that in North America this notion is strongest \u2013 when I lived in Europe, families often stayed in the same home all of their lives and supported one another. Part of me can\u2019t help but think that this notion of supporting our children into adulthood is a construction of the industrial revolution \u2013 where children were sent into factories to work. As we see those structures crumbling, I hope we can reconsider that supporting one another should be something to be grateful for, not a tragedy. Will our quality of life not improve when we know that all of us who need more support at various points in our lifetimes, will also be respected, supported and not be made to feel guilty or  less than  for it? Finally, I can think of all the \u201cjob creation,\u201d for autistic people and support workers alike when I think of Ontario\u2019s new proposed budget. Yet as long as we are wedded to this false notion of \u201cindependence,\u201d we might continue to build cities which isolate everyone. For certain, this is the ultimate paradox \u2013  I think we all feel isolated in many concrete jungles, and we need a call to building collectives and communities which utilize and respect the varying contributions of all citizens. To respect human variation and possibility for re-building, I draw on Jennifer Sarrett\u2019s  Autistic Human Rights: A Proposal : \u201c[H]uman rights are to be enjoyed based on fundamental frailty and vulnerability inherent within the state of being human. By focusing on vulnerability, a state that all people experience at various points in life, disability and difference becomes an experience that can tie all humans together.\u201d ( 2012, Disability Studies Quarterly , unpaginated)  Also, quoting Eva Kittay, Sarrett includes that while not all people are equally vulnerable, that is, some people are more vulnerable than others, it does not mean that the more vulnerable are less worthy or entitled to justice, equality and human rights: This principle, in contrast to the others, would not be based on our equal vulnerability, nor on our possession of rationality, a sense of justice, and a vision of our own good. Instead, it would be based on  our unequal vulnerability in dependency, on our moral power to respond to others in need, on on the primacy of human relations to happiness and well-being.\u201d (Kittay in Sarrett, 2012)\n Sarrett further states that, \u201chuman rights do not have to rely on a single doctrine \u2013 dependence or fragility or oppression or humanness or capability. The autism-based model described here is built on a foundation of dependence, individuality, and valuing human diversity, allowing for the inclusion of the entire sphere [note: she uses \u2018sphere\u2019 instead of \u2018spectrum\u2019 which she considers ableist] of cognitive, intellectual, physical and psychiatric traits within the human condition. Accounting for and respecting variations in the human state are central to the ongoing and dynamic process of developing human rights models most effective for any time and place. Any model of human rights should be in constant conversation with contemporary issues of diversity, medicine, law, and advocacy. Thus, all models\u2026should be subject to alterations and updates to ensure the most acute and powerful application in every community and for every person.\u201d  She notes that while some  positive rights have been granted for education and health care, that the autistic rights model, fashioned after civil rights, has difficulty with the pro motion of  negative rights  which includes the right to assemble. Sarrett says that negative rights are integral to this inclusive model of human rights, but self-representation and advocacy can be difficult for many non-verbal advocates who have assembled more easily online, and find real-time meetings and interactions very difficult. This asks us to reconsider how accessible our boards, committees and systems and how they enact as barriers to many autistic people. How might we re-organize our organizations? I, for one, believe that the Internet provides the future possibilities for the democratic process.  Reference: Sarrett, Jennifer (2012). Autistic Human Rights: A Proposal.

{"date": "2013/11/21", "body": "I learned another lesson tonight. Adam has had a few difficult days. He was complaining last week that his ear hurt, and I thought maybe he had an ear infection. I took him to the doctor who suggested it could be his 12-year-old molars coming in. I was still worried; I thought the dentist told me they had already come in. A few days passed and Adam wasn\u2019t eating that much. His body began to twitch and spasm more. Yesterday, he placed his body under the cushions of the couch, wanted to watch a  Baby Einstein  video (as opposed to Shrek or Wall-E) and I knew he needed comfort. These are the things he will do to get it. I then suggested a bath and he headed for the stairs.  Once he got to the front door, however, things were out of place. Adam spent time picking up his coat, and placing his shoes just the way he wanted them and did it again and again. He was stuck in his loop. Then all of a sudden, he layed down on the floor on his goose-down coat and began to scream, biting the fabric of the sweater that was laying beside it. The blood-curdling scream broke my heart. I sat at the top of the stair, where I was waiting for him, calm and quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Adam. I\u2019m right here.\u201d Adam let out a few more screams, but they didn\u2019t last too long. I called my father to come over as I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen next. Grandpa is one of Adam\u2019s favorite people and I thought it would help. But Before Grandpa arrived, I came down the stairs and sat at Adam\u2019s feet. \u201cI\u2019m right here. It\u2019s okay.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d he said in a distressed voice. \u201cDo you want to move to the couch?\u201d Adam seemed uncertain, needing more of my help to get him there; he got up walked half way down the hall, then back, unsure of where he needed to land.  \u201cCome to the couch,\u201d I repeated. Adam laid down and I sat at the edge of his feet with my hands on his legs. \u201cI love you Adam. Everything\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d I said in my Zen-mother voice. My entire body wanting to absorb the knotted energy around him. I smiled at him lovingly and he smiled back. \u201cHand is hurting,\u201d he said looking straight into my eyes. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry your hand is hurting!\u201d He leaned back and then sat forward again.  \u201cHand is hurting,\u201d he repeated, holding it out for me. \u201cYes your hand is hurting. Do you want me to kiss it or blow on it?\u201d At that point Grandpa arrived, also quiet and calm in Adam\u2019s presence. Adam lead him to the basement where they typically hang out together. Soon after he came back upstairs for a bath and went to sleep. This morning on the way to school, Adam sat in the back seat in the car and declared, \u201ctooth hurting,\u201d while pointing to his front tooth. When we arrived at school I checked but couldn\u2019t see anything wrong. Adam had a fine but reportedly cuddly morning with his assistant. She said he became increasingly twitchy. Adam had said \u201cyellow\u201d which is what he has learned from the  5-point scale  which symbolizes levels of distress. His assistant immediately took him to the sensory room. Adam began to tell her that his back, bottom, nose, were hurting and indeed he had a nosebleed at lunch time. When I heard he was pale and sweaty, I decided to fetch Adam early from school. Upon hearing about this, Adam assumed that he would not be able to go to circus arts where he is coached in the trampoline and began to scream. I texted (much of this conversation was happening by text) his assistant to say no, we were going no matter what because he had been asking for it all week long. Adam did well the first half of the session and then let out a yelp. His coach put him in the silk swing until he yelped again. It was time to go home. Nearly in tears for the way my own body responds to Adam\u2019s distress on the inside, Adam yelped again in my car. \n\u201cAdam, I need a word please. I don\u2019t understand screams.\u201d I was expecting protest but Adam was quiet. When we arrived home, he again had a meagre appetite, unusual after rigorous exercise. He again placed his body underneath the cushions of the couch. He then showered and then yelped in his room. I suggested we brush his teeth, and when we did I noticed that a tooth had broken through the skin. \u201cOh Adam, poor you. You are in pain!\u201d Adam smiled from ear-to-ear, probably relieved that I finally understood what he had been telling us all along. I hugged him.  \u201cTired,\u201d he declared as he climbed into bed. \u201cDaddy hurt.\u201d I figured he wanted to tell his father that he was in pain. \u201cDo you want to call daddy now?\u201d \u201cNo\u201d \u201cDo you want to see daddy tomorrow?\u201d \u201cDaddy tomorrow.\u201d That\u2019s an affirmative. So as I think this through, when Adam says he\u2019s sick and many of us just think sometimes he says things that don\u2019t mean anything, I consider how much MORE listening we all have to do. Why do we need proof? Why do we need to see a tooth is hurting to believe it? I\u2019m not suggesting that people (or I)  don\u2019t listen to Adam,but that Adam seems to need a lot more time and affirmation to feel comfortable as he passes through pain. Even for all the words Adam mustered to communicate how he felt, to get help, we didn\u2019t see it and we didn\u2019t know quite what to do for him. It\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t try to be helpful, or that we didn\u2019t go to the doctor, but we beat ourselves up about Adam and his \u201cbehaviour\u201d almost to the point of wondering if it had any function at all. Another lesson learned: We don\u2019t always need to see to believe and Adam did the job that we always tell him to do. He communicates like hell.\n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://www.esteeklar.com/2013/11/21/why-is-seeing-believing/", "title": "Why is Seeing, Believing?"},
{"date": "2013/06/03", "body": "My copy of the DSM V is here.  Ari Ne\u2019eman made this address regarding the how the DSM V may effect autism services.  I wrote this response this morning on the Facebook link: I agree with his point that suggests the hierarchy of disability and how we must work to build support and acceptance for all persons regardless of (dis) ability. Now not living in the US, and completely understanding that funding is presently coming from Medicaid, how can we call attention to inclusion issues and specifically education \u2013 that this is not a medicaid issue. Education is a right for all people. My concern here in Canada, and this was cited in  Moore Vs. British Columbia  (2012),  that the notion of remediation before the right to be mainstreamed risks adverse effect discrimination. I would be interested in discussing with you strategies that discuss this issue and how the public might only view autism as in need of services under Medicaid (which presumably means remediation before the right to be educated). Can you offer your input and can we work together? Considering the empiricist history of creating normate culture, and an education system that supports that culture, Medicaid does not is the only issue we have facing us. Services need to be multifarious to answer a variety of needs for a diverse and complex autistic population. Looking at inclusion in a variety of ways, attitudes, changing the way we do autism research, participation by autistic people who will help reduce stigma and discrimination and policy and legal levels for all autistic people, and mostly inclusion in programs, education and a deep look into the types of accommodations that autistic people need are among some of the very urgent topics that require dialogue. We need to work together to look at every aspect of the way autistic people are currently treated in society to move forward, and acknowledge that a medical approach to autism will never be panacea. While Medicaid is a system in place to help in some areas, such as habilitative services, and autistic people have the right to access these services as much as anyone else, we do have a lingering and problematic issue of medicalizing every aspect of human existence and now, framing everything under the persistent mental health (or illness) umbrella.  When does acceptance of human difference begin and when does pathologization stop? What is an illness and what is not an illness? The way we measure physical properties and the way we observe autistic people for \u201cmaladaptive behaviour\u201d are different disciplines, the latter being subjective. And so, we have ever-changing humanly-made, observed definitions of what autism is supposed to be. I have been thinking of cognitive prosthetics a lot lately and our penchant for (perfect) ability, and how utterly disabling our quest for perfection has become (think performance enhancement drugs, cosmetic surgery, technology and so forth). And now I speculate \u2013 once we all want to put a chip in our own brains because we admire autistic strengths, or to be more specific, implant ourselves to obtain these \u201cmagnified abilities,\u201d as neuroscientists sometimes call them, then what aspects of our brain today (that we consider \u201cnatural\u201d and morally  more  correct) might be disabled in order to make room for these \u201cenhanced abilities?\u201d After all, as theory presently dictates in binary terms, autistic people have strengths because of their disabilities. So, as we admire the abilities and are connected with technologies to achieve them, it\u2019s only a matter of time that other aspects of our brains will become \u201cdis\u201dfunctioned. Now let us ask again, what is a disability? Let us continue to work to include everyone and to end the exclusion of human difference.

{"date": "2013/11/08", "body": "Hmmm, let me see, where do I need to begin again? I am in the mood to just tell you where I last left this blog off, between finishing my MRP, changing Adam\u2019s school and off to the PhD races. I can already see where this will try to pull me in many directions but Adam keeps me focused. He types on his own, but he also increases his spoken words. He is not cured of autism just because he is gaining these skills. It simply represents (if I can use that word) that coming to words, no matter how many or few, is different for all of us. Progress is not linear and I\u2019m skeptical of  progress . In terms of the human body, it changes over time. That\u2019s about it.  Focusing on words, despite the fact that I write and defer to them all the time, remains tenuous \u2013 open to interpretation. Words are both important in this verbose culture, one where David Abram might say we are conditioned to speech (alas unaware of nature around us and our other senses) whereas Adam and others may be more attuned. If I say that, I am walking a tightrope \u2013 I wish to avoid  sensationalizing  \u201cautistic\u201d skill. Could it be there is a space in between words that we are ignoring more than ever before? Don\u2019t we all tend to say that we live in a world where we feel more disconnected? How ironic the term automatic/automatism/autism; I get up, get in my car behind glass and these actions are automatic and required for work. People honk horns, illustrating a passive aggressive irritation \u2013 with other human beings \u2013  that may dissolve without the glass, behind computer screens. By stating my observation, I am speaking my hope. This doesn\u2019t have to be, \u201cjust the way it is.\u201d We can rethink the way we form relationships and community. Words are what Adam learns in school, what we teach him through typing, reading. He is strongly attracted to words; he owns that  hyperLEXIC   label. We find it hard to find the right  lexicon  to describe our lives within a paradigm of normality, alas devoted to speech. We cannot see the forest for the trees; we are too busy building roads and computerized devices. We are busy proving our minds\u2026 and our reason. Still, Adam is happier. He is being educated in a \u201creal\u201d school, and that only happens with those willing to accept that he still needs a person to help him navigate spaces, other bodies\u2026a deluge of words coming at him in the forms of conversations and instructions. He is with other kids, and he gets to learn. This makes him happy. He directs when he needs to be with others and when he needs his space, and he learns to translate what he knows into the words we need for proof. And I, in a PhD program, must combine lots of words to put to this, in an attempt to move beyond them. In the meantime, I always feel full when Adam is around and there are few words between us. I seem to understand so much about his meaning, and he mine. Silence is full.

{"date": "2013/11/16", "body": "Adam types, mostly independently, and also with various modes of assistance. Of late, he has developed his grammatically perfect sentences and I have to wonder about teaching the system of language. To most, this should be a heralded moment when Adam has joined us, society, in the shared system of social reciprocity. Yet I wonder about that term reciprocity. Is it reciprocal when we are a dominant group of language users? What of Adam\u2019s own communication is considered valid?  With learning our system of signs and signifiers, he will be able to join classrooms and other groups. I wonder about the validation of his body, his movements as asserting his being in society. I wonder if he will not lose his, for lack of a better way of putting it, metaphorical ways of speaking. This to me was representative of communicating a pattern of thought, perhaps translation, and perhaps a pattern of sensory experience; meagerly conveyed through our dominant language. In order to think this through, we have to consider how we limit experience by insisting on a form of contemporary autistic \u201coralism\u201d (a term used for the Deaf/deaf, when they were force to speak instead of sign). Adam also sometimes speaks. Sometimes he finds it hard to use words and \u201cspeaks\u201d better through his body. This discontinuity, as it is often called, is referred to in the medical system as impairment or a problem. Speech in our society, we must remember, is also denotative of \u201crationality\u201d which I continue to problematize. Derrida might not consider his speech discontinuous any less than language and rationality are (Simons, 88). Derrida says that without any gap between pages and letters, there would be no language or communication. So language is in itself discontinuous. Adam\u2019s meaning must be considered similarly. Without considering his whole being in the moment I could not weave a meaning. (And it should be noted that this should not be executed by only myself. I recognize I am a dominanat language user/speaker and I have to ask for various clarifications in a translation process but also have to be patient and simply watch and listen).  Meaning is co-constructed, but the most important part of this that I want to convey is that often parents ignore this complex aspect of communication and maintain a level of expectation that no one autistic person will ever accomplish without a feeling of self-loss. Inasmuch as people should be praised for achievements, they should be praised for who they are.  I also consider how this interactive view contributes to the feelings of impairment; that is, every interaction with others, mostly those fluent in speech (and who may consider themselves superior or normal as a result of being a political majority of talkers), contribute to feelings of impairment. There are a number of issues here, too long for a mere blog post, but let me continue. If I follow Derrida\u2019s line of thinking about language, there is no easy translation. I consider Adam\u2019s typing a way of translating his thoughts into a system; I have to recognize that language limits the expanse of his thoughts, experiences and sensations.  Like science, which is a system of thought and signs, we learn to frame a \u201cproblem.\u201d  We understand science by learning its language and it is primarily an encapsulated system which speaks among itself. It is here that I will reiterate a need to move away from science as \u201ctruth\u201d as there are other valid modes of inquiry, much of which is already produced by those who are non-speaking.  I am concerned also when fellow allies and autistics revert to this form of absolutism which has only oppressed them for many years. There are ways to take back the research and inquiry and IMFAR (among other science orgs) needs to respond to them too.  I am reticent, as much as I support, a specific \u201cautistic\u201d advocacy as we know that language and labels change with time. How do autistic people keep their needed culture while at the same time co-organize across the many disabilities who share the need for respect, acceptance and inclusion (the latter word needs clarification but I will not do so here)? Many people labeled with autism prior to 1993 were placarded with dementia praecox, schizophrenia, mental retardation, to name a few. Labels are socially constructed, temporal. They are as diachronic and responsive to society as much as the rehabilitative and treatment methods seek to \u201crecover\u201d them. Yet they do share one characteristic which is political and social exclusion. Here, language as a system has played a huge role in how we regard and treat autism.  To continue with Derrida, discourse and meanings are shared and malleable (my word). Meaning is assembled across spacing/timing and interactive contexts.  A text is like a textile, \u201cproduced only in the transformation of another text\u201d (Writing and Difference, 279-80). The problem occurs in the behavioural and the sciences, Derrida would argue,  when \u201cprovisional meanings are taken for definitive ones\u201d (Simons, p. 90). Isn\u2019t this what we\u2019ve done? Isn\u2019t this the way we continue to respond to organizations like Autism Speaks? In a Sausserean sense, we react to the constructed meaning, signifier of autism and we continue to validate it. In other words, by reacting, we also support the dominant system. In a political sense, I think this is important to remember when we respond. It\u2019s not that we should not do so, but we must also think of ways of moving beyond this discourse as I fear we may only be continuing to support the current infrastructure that oppresses many people who do not fit the normal paradigm.

{"date": "2013/11/22", "body": "The CBC news story on an autistic child being sent regularly to an isolation in a B.C. school was aired this morning.  The student, who is \u201cmildly autistic\u201d (she can speak), is sent regularly to a windowless room. In polling the other young students if she should go, they responded with a resounding yes. So what\u2019s going on in Canada? Recently, the institutional \u201cresidents\u201d of  Huronia  were awarded for their incarceration and imposed sterilization in Canada. Schools regularly remove students from classrooms. Despite the loss of the Auton case, ABA is the only \u201ctherapy\u201d in Canada that attempts to normalize the autistic child. Negative reinforcement is still used in some of our government-funded autism centres. So while Auton didn\u2019t win, the ABA movement has. There is no choice for autistic children in Canada. The Harper government has an agenda of ridding autism from our country. Money is spent from our \u201ctop\u201d charity Autism Speaks to cure autism and when those same ABA schools and communities apply for funding for a $5,000 whiteboard, those grants are denied. As Ari Ne\u2019eman writes in  Loud Hands Speaking , the charity  Autism Speaks  does nothing to support autistic people and the communities that support them. Those same walks in our communities, with the parents who give thousands of dollars to it,  get nothing from that charity in the way of supporting autistic well-being, lives and options.  Despite deinstitutionalization, the rehab and medial model is supported to keep incarcerating people with disabilities. There is a human rights model, and those in the rehab and educational industries would be wise to start reading.  In the meantime, the B.C. school board seems defensive about its position. Policy-makers are deferring and the autistic girl is left in limbo and to the devices of a system that remains intolerant of her inclusion. There is an air of defense in this position. This, let us be reminded, however, that this is an infringement of the  Canadian Charter of Rights  and Freedoms and the  UN Enable on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.   It is against the law as more cases set the precedents (it is still an hermeneutical exercise it seems, but the principles apply); we have to keep working. The school system, which only cares about those who conform the best and get through the fastest (it\u2019s a business model of course that doesn\u2019t care about those who require support \u2013 it uses the cost-benefit/burden models), supports this marginalization. Most disturbing is the trend of adults who poll young children, or indeed condone this isolation of their autistic peers. These adults need to be questioned, their attitudes need to be changed, and in most cases, the only way to implement change is to bring this to the courts. And where will our Autism charities be in incidents like in B.C.? Those who continue to support the amelioration of autistic people in the guise of acceptance and help? There is a predominant medical and libertarian model that we urgently need to discuss. It makes sense when government money supports economic solutions, that is, proposals to make children normal contributors to the market economy. Of course, these are just proposals. Work projects will only work when autistic people are respected, their rights upheld and dignity in place. As in other countries, all people (especially considering our economic privilege in this country) should receive a baseline of support in order to live good lives (but I\u2019ll leave that discussion for another post). These are modeled in other countries but we don\u2019t pay attention. There are too many people living in poverty and many other people are making lots of money in the false-marketing of cure and recovery, not assistance, support, rights, social supports, attitudes, and yes, employment \u2013 the latter which more often than not is also a means of emotional and social support. Such exclusion in policy and law speaks volumes.  Autism Speak\u2019s  leader in Toronto states that she \u201chates autism but not her child.\u201d What message does that send to a public still in need of education about disability, it\u2019s history and human rights? How does that attitude improve the lives and acceptance of her child, and other people who will always be autistic? These are the challenges that are most difficult to face and that ask many families with any child who is different to lock up their doors and stay off the playground. If we don\u2019t talk now, we are risking a horrible reversion to institutionalization. Instead, let us think about how we can work together to recognize that our country is sick,  not autistic children and adults. We some of that change such as the recent settlement of former inmates of Huronia. We need to work with our communities to identify the attitudes and policies that lock us out and keep us in isolation.

While technology is said to open up avenues for communication, we do not heed the critical theorists warnings of Adorno and others \u2013 that there can be \u201cno true life possible in a false world.\u201d The question is, how do virtual realities and mass culture, mechaniziation and so forth limit the acceptance of autistic bodies among us? It seems that work to befit the body, not the body to work. This is also a feudal notion invoked by the company  Specialisterne  which is a software development company providing work opportunities for autistic people. My job is to critique these structures and life is my lab. I am a mother to an autistic son as well as a single mother and I engage (and explore) in atypical forms knowledge production with my son \u2013 I attempt to resist the standard ways of producing knowledge that in fact are, to Adorno\u2019s critique (my interpretation), relativist \u2013 that speaks only unto itself within a frame. That is, science speaks to science and we\u2019ve adopted its rhetoric. As such, it may shape the way we think about our lives by this framework. We cannot examine a system if we don\u2019t try to work from without. So, when I go online to look at the company  Specialisterne , which provides work opportunities for autistic bodies, it is imperative that we question how bodies may be vulnerable to exploitation in totalizaing \u201cautistic charactersitics\u201d as: \u201cable to focus for long periods of time; superior ability to recognize patterns; superior visual perceptual ability\u201d and so forth. While autistic people need to eat, and work provides important human connection (see \u201cemotional labour\u201d), we have to be cognizant that we are working within a system that reduces support, devalues disabled bodies and in fact, requires all of us to work longer and harder \u2013 in fact, like machines\u2026automated\u2026autistic. While these characteristics that may be present for some individuals, we have to be aware of how generalities about autistic characteristics may serve to oppress people.  That said, as I do my research, I was tuned in on the marketing of  Specialisterne  to ask if an autistic person is a \u201cweed or herb?\u201d (see  Specialisterne\u2019s  banner above). If we are to speak, to anchor ourselves in frames of reference for how we have come to be where we are and to think about autism, we are obliged to point out that the term came from a eugenics book   Weeds in the Garden of Marriage  (1931) by George Henry Lane Fox Pitt Rivers.  Using this object metaphor is also explored i n this paper by Gerald O\u2019Brien in  Disability Studies Quarterly . It might be helpful for self-advocacy organizations to engage in media and marketing monitoring to ensure that dignity, respect and the history of oppression is recognized, so that we may never again re-invoke the rhetoric which belonged to the eugenics movement which rendered the segregation and sterilization of disabled people mandatory. It is curious that marketing firms would not research this thoroughly.

{"date": "2013/06/12", "body": "Adam has progressively better days since the basement flood and croup. When he seems anxious or derailed by life events I quickly engage everyone on Adam\u2019s team \u2013 what has worked well for him is more predictability, gentle voices, activity including sports and sensory support that befits him. All I have to do is write things down and Adam reads lists and stories for me. Countdowns work, clocks and the like. It\u2019s important to set the time aside and concentrate on him until he feels better (and this makes me obviously feel better too). And while I\u2019ve been bemoaning the loss of his cherub cheeks for quite some time now, puberty has officially begun. I can see it emerging as cherub cheeks turn in to pimply ones. It just really hit me this evening how much he suddenly changed. It seems as if the last two weeks have presented us with a lot and although I knew this day would come, I\u2019m feeling a little strange about it, like, poof\u2026the childhood is now officially gone. Of course, the transition is longer, but sometimes the way we view things seems so hyper-real. I\u2019ve heard that boys stay close to their mothers, and while I\u2019m really cognizant of him needing to spread his wings and be a boy, a teenager, a man, I still hope he will indulge my affections. I picked a book up about boy\u2019s development the other day. I scoured a few to read what boys his age go through. Of course, these are supposed to be boys with typical skills, but I still found it so relevant in terms of body development and feelings. I want to support Adam into his teenage will (and whatever else comes with it). When I looked for \u201cautism\u201d in the index, I was surprised, actually, to see a reference. I flipped to the page, situated in the first third of the book, and read the \u201cwarning;\u201d that is, the \u201cnegative\u201d things that a boy may  not  develop which might indicate autism. I was disappointed if not bored (while I considered new parents paralyzed with fear). I mean, when will autism be included in the long life development model that I  need  to read, and not as a blurb or a warning in a paragraph?  Adam\u2019s life is not a paragraph. It doesn\u2019t necessarily belong to the \u201cspecial\u201d boys category of books, either.  It is a long, developmental line (and hopefully life) and he feels and just like other boys feel, and sure, then some. It would be great to acknowledge all boys, not matter what their label, integrated within the context of a full and whole boyhood \u2013 to include the ways that all kinds of boys may experience their bodies and feelings. Yet, autistic boys get books on different shelves (if we get any at all outside of  Jessica Kingsley ). Maybe we should simply ask that our boys getting written in.

{"date": "2013/06/10", "body": "So I\u2019ve just put Adam to bed. We\u2019ve had another challenging month \u2013 a major basement flood ruined his space where he jumps on a trampoline and has his OT equipment. It\u2019s his space where he is king. It\u2019s our second flood, but this one was much worse\u2026expensive damage and more importantly, it had to be totally ripped apart. The same week, Adam suffered the viral croup that\u2019s been going around up here. Unable to move for a week, he hardly ate and broke out into frequent sweats. Unable to explain the way he feels in detail, or to have the energy to \u201ctype it out\u201d as I say, I panicked and took him to the doctor three times to make sure he was going to be okay. In the middle of it all, my walls were being ripped out and fans and humidifiers hummed so loudly that it was difficult to feel at home let alone relax.  Then, Adam returned to school on Monday and started biting his wrists and arms. It hasn\u2019t abated yet \u2013 he\u2019s frustrated when his preferred activities are ending, he\u2019s starting puberty and my great little guy is on the anxious side to begin with. He has all the difficulties with transition and arousal as expressed by other autistic adults.  It\u2019s very difficult to write about Adam in this way, but these challenges are inevitable in life. My mother confided in me that she used to bite her friends (she won\u2019t mind me writing about it now) because she was frustrated and angry. I expect Adam is a bit frustrated and angry too \u2013 his ripped up space, his sickness that has kept him immobile and now having to return to demands not to mention the need to express the free will of becoming an older boy. The way I deal (despite my own stress) is to bring back routine, use visual supports, gestures, counting, less words, gentle affect. In the midst of chaos, this is one thing I know to do. I also have a routine, it seems, when I\u2019m overloaded. I get stressed out and then realize its time to shut everything down, off and focus on calm and Adam. Then, as I do, continue to support Adam\u2019s development and learning to cope with new experiences and on patience with the things that don\u2019t work out as planned. I had two other thoughts this evening when I considered writing about challenges, which I am wary of doing for all the twists and turns I see stories take for some people\u2019s own self-interest. First, I recommend everyone to read Val William\u2019s book,  Disability and Discourse: Analysing Inclusive Conversation with People with Intellectual Disabilities . Using a conversational analysis between disabled and non-disabled support workers, she analyses the subtleties of our conversations, intonations and expectations against our desire to support autonomy and how we may in fact silence and disable it, as well as examples of how it can be enabled in people with severe communication disabilities, which is my area of special interest. I was considering how I might disempower Adam\u2019s free will and autonomy by analysing my own behaviour as his parent in how I talk to him, what my expectations are, how I may garner an answer from him. I asked myself if I praise him because he has answered in a way I expected, or made a choice I preferred. Then I asked myself (and am more aware of this now he is entering puberty) how often do I praise the choices he makes that I might dislike or are inconvenient for me? How can I encourage and support his autonomy if I only praise what I think is acceptable? These are the reflexive questions and sometimes, fine lines. Then, I came across two recent books that mention my name and work. The first is by Michael Prince and Bruce Doern,  Three Bio Realms: Biotechnology and the Governance of Food, Health and Life in Canada . I have quoted Prince especially from his book  Absent Citizens: Disability Politics and Policy in Canada . In  Three Bio Realms  he states: \u201cBio-life technologies are especially susceptible to both the \u2018wow\u2019 and the \u2018woah\u2019 reactions and instincts. In this case, the \u2018wow\u2019 factor came in the announcement itself and press coverage of it. An immediate letter to the editor of The Globe and Mail newspaper expressed the \u2018woah\u2019 reaction in intensely human ways. The letter came from Estee Klar, who signed her letter as the founder of the Autism Acceptance Project (Klar, 2010). Her letter expressed the views of the mother of an autistic child reacting to the announcement about genetics and autism. She wrote \u2018the lack of public awareness about autistic pride and the many autistic adults who have helped our understanding of what it means to be \u2018different.\u2019 She expressed deep concern about language that might cast persons with autism as having fouled-up genes. Klar concluded by stating that autistic people \u2018are more than their genes\u2019 and that like non-autistic people, are shaped by [their] environment, supportive families, good education and so forth. (Klar, 2010 in Doern and Prince, 2013, 198).\u201d I was surprised to see this disability scholar refer to autism as a \u201cdisease\u201d because the reality is, there is no known etiology of autism. While there are other issues that confront many different individuals with the label, the term itself is too broad and deterministic regarding autistic being and identity. I also think it prudent to cite the  woah  factor in a society that searches for a panacea \u2013 from pills to technology to gene-causation \u2013  in the pursuit of a (perfect) ability that I think will still experience or may create new disabilities. The way we parse humans as (dis)abled repeats self-evident ableism. And then I came across this book  Bad Animals  by Joel Yanofsky who says, \u201cI\u2019m recounting the highlights of a telelphone interview I just had with Estee Klar. She\u2019s a Toronto writer and curator I learned about when I read her heartfelt essay \u2018The Perfect Child.\u2019 It\u2019s about her son Adam whose on the spectrum. Not long after Adam was diagnosed, she started TAAP or The Autism Acceptance Project. TAAP\u2019s mission is \u2018to bring about a different and positive view about autism to the public in order to raise tolerance and acceptance in the community.\u2019 She also started blogging about her life and about autism, which she says on her website, is not about illness but a way of being. Even so, Klar is hardly starry-eyed. She knows first hand how tough dealing with autism is. She also knows that if she were to accept all the doom and gloom heaped on her over the years she\u2019d be incapable of doing anything, including what she believes is best for her son. Currently, Klar\u2019s blog reaches some two hundred and fifty thousand readers.\u201d I do think that many of us need to write-it-out, visit meet-up groups, talk it out, type-it-out despite some days I think I should just delete everything and walk away. For myself, I\u2019m not a great writer but I just keep doing it. I have a compulsion and I guess it is a way I can deal, and if it helps you too to read it, then I\u2019m glad for that. I am grateful that Yanofsky in that at least he highlighted that I am hardly \u201cstarry-eyed.\u201d I guess despite the fact I can get very down just like anyone else, I am also determined to see that sun rise and know there are always many delightful days, and I don\u2019t believe in simple answers and a final cure. I don\u2019t believe in easy paths and the \u201cpursuit of happiness\u201d  \u2013  when we think it is something to obtain and possess, it simply makes us more miserable. It\u2019s like expectation \u2013 when we hold on to it, we will be disappointed. We can\u2019t hang on to anything (obviously not a soothing statement for people who need regularity and routine). So why am I thinking about these two quotes about the way I think about autism and my life tonight? Well, if anything is final, my concern is the finality of the existence of people  we deem not worthy to live because they do not fit an economic paradigm and who are considered burdens on society. The thrust of my work today deals with this and how we can support autistic people, and  to reconsider how we view autonomy and independence as yet another path to normality (and oppression). Normal doesn\u2019t exist and it never will for many of us, and for most, it is a mere delusion. Hmmm\u2026delusion. A way to survive the ultimate reality? Think about it.

{"date": "2013/06/17", "body": "Part of writing a blog and writing at all is the responsibility I tend to feel for supporting myself and others. Yet I have to tell you, since Adam was diagnosed with this ambiguous \u201cautism\u201d nearly 11 years ago now, anger and frustration and my love for him fuels writing and work \u2013  as it does for so many. Let me start here: we have a deeply engrained prejudice towards non-verbal people in our society, and towards those whose bodies don\u2019t conform. The reality is, this is not a black and white issue so if one says one thing, it gets reified (e.g. autism is x or he does this  because  of autism). The complexity of human BEING is ignored, especially for autistic people. As I watch Adam\u2019s body tense and react to even the slightest pain (yesterday he hurt himself in a rose bush), these days with a bite, I am caught between feeling grateful for support but also upset that I have to be careful in how I question this support (for fear of losing it entirely\u2026 a crappy position many of us are forced into). Alas, we  have  to question it and everything that happens in an autistic person\u2019s life to fill out the picture and to support and autistic person well. We need to do this all together \u2013 to look at the whole person and not the label and not all behaviours as the result of autism or as, well, just a behaviour. Adam\u2019s body is intensely aroused and as this is happening at the beginning of puberty, I\u2019m very worried about how long kids are asked to sit and comply. We must reconsider physical and behavioural compliance in the name of boys needing to be boys. This is recently  called the \u201cfeminization of boys\u201d  and although gender-blame is problematic, it does point to an issue in how we approach education overall. Autistic boys should be considered in this respect as well. You can\u2019t remediate before you respect. You\u2019ve got to respect and include autistic kids from the beginning. Differential treatment also can lead to equality and respect. Differential treatment need not be remediation; it is the form of accommodation, acceptance and respecting sensory and other differences and needs. This leads to another concern I have \u2013 so-called \u201cautism campuses\u201d being created.  How does that serve the rights of autistic people to be included in society?  Back in the day, an asylum was considered a wonderful refuge where disabled people could learn life skills, do work in \u201csheltered workshops,\u201d be \u201ceducated\u201d to their potential. It was a hopeful place where people would be treated \u201cwith respect.\u201d Does this sound familiar? I don\u2019t know about how you feel about it, but it reminds me of just how close we are again to re-institutionalization and the issue we have with notions of \u201cpotential\u201d and \u201cremediation.\u201d There comes a point when educating to potential can turn into another form of ableism because it asks that a person become a normate. Potential doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201cas close to normalcy as possible.\u201d  Now that Adam is experiencing this intense arousal (and he has been already redirecting himself to an object to bite, without my telling him to do it), how will \u201cthe system\u201d view him as a (non) person? Will our only choice be an autism campus? A thorny issue.

{"date": "2013/06/19", "body": " Image by:  Stephen Wiltshire. I must admit time heals anxiety. After the darkness comes the light, or is it the other way around? Well, the globe rotates. As Adam seeks knowledge by going through doors, I have always needed to calm my own anxiety through books. As I think more again about Adam\u2019s need for doors, his curiosity for bushes, dark places, paths, and in particular, the doors within buildings, I\u2019ve been thinking about maps and a book I bought for this purpose in considering Adam\u2019s interests \u2013 Denis Wood\u2019s,  The Power of Maps.  As many autistic individuals proclaim a need to map, to visualize, and with an exceptional ability at visual memory (routes, maps), I feel that this is the next frontier for us: to learn how to make maps of our environments, to build a 3-D version of our house, and go from there. \u201cWe are always mapping the invisible or the unattainable or the erasable, the future or the past, the whatever-is-not-here-present-to-our-senses-now and, though the gift that the map gives us, transmuting it into everything it is not,  into the real . This month\u2019s  Life  leaps at me from the checkout counter: \u2018Behold the Earth,\u2019 it says. \u2018Startling new pictures show our planet as we\u2019ve never seen it before.\u2019 Inside, below the heading \u2018This Precious Planet,\u2019 the copy promises \u2018Striking new views from near space show us more than we could have guessed about our fragile home\u2026I am overwhelmed by the solidity and apparent indestructibility of everything I see around me. Only the pictures \u2013 let us think about them as maps for the moment \u2013 convince me of the reality the captions evoke\u2026\u2019New picture'; \u2018never seen it before'; \u2018new views'; \u2018show us more'; each phrase insists on the fact that indeed I  never have seen  the planet in quite this way\u201d (p. 5). It reminds me of Dawn Prince when she wrote in  Songs of a Gorilla Nation  of how she ran to greet every room of the house over and over again. Many other autistic people have superb visual memory (Stephen Wiltshire, Temple Grandin\u2026). Adam once drew pictures that were so \u201ccorrect\u201d in their perspective despite the fact that he otherwise has weak motor control. This leads to the conditions in which a person with various sensory disabilities can and cannot perform the same task or function. Soma Mukhopadhyay speaks of this in her books on  Rapid Method Prompting  and I find them true to Adam \u2013 the way a keyboard is positioned, his orientation, the differences he experiences with his vision other body movements.Things have to be set up the right way for him, and I need to always pay greater attention because it is easy to fall back on my laurels and adopt my  take-it-for-granted  view of the world. Sometimes it seems that I\u2019ve always known that mapping could be Adam\u2019s hobby which might lead to map-making or building. He needs to know what\u2019s behind everything for what we call \u201cobsession\u201d or \u201cstuckness,\u201d automatisms and the like.  Lennard Davis discusses how we come to value obsessions, particularly the actions of artists as \u201cobsessive acts ,\u201d like Vincent Van Gogh. Instead of invoking a moral value (a trait or characteristic as inherently good or bad, positive or negative), we can come to accept these proclivities as inherent (even if it scared the living day lights out of me). Adam needs to explore and to know as I do by finding information in books. How might I make this something that works for Adam? This is my next frontier.  \u201cThe sphericity of the globe is not something that comes to us as seeing-hearing-sniffing-tasting-feeling animals, is not something that comes to us\u2026  naturally.   It is a residue of cultural activities, of watching ships come to us up out of the sea  for eons , of thinking about what that might mean, of observing shadows at different locations, of sailing great distances, of contemplating all this and more at one time. It is hard won knowledge. It is map knowledge. As such it is something that little kids have to learn, not something they can figure out for themselves. \u2018Educators are living in a dream world if they assume young children understand that the earth is round'\u201d (p.6). So why do we prohibit Adam from being free to explore, to know what and how he needs to know? How can we keep him safe while doing so? How can we fuel his interests in ways that are productive for him, and perhaps for many others?

{"date": "2013/06/18", "body": "Two years ago today, to the day, Adam bolted. He has lots of need to run through doors, especially at my parent\u2019s condo. I remember it well\u2026 my dad coming back from an enjoyable walk, his hand sweaty then off Adam went;  so fast  my dad said. When Adam saw the concierge he was familiar with when he got lost nearby their condo, he ran into his arms. My mom called me \u2026I was not far by this time after I jumped into a cab. By the time I was five minutes away she announced that Adam was found. Adam saw the police and seemed timid in their mighty kevlar presence. Then, strategies in place, Adam felt better. I called it \u201coperation calm down.\u201d Today\u2026I got a call from Adam\u2019s dad that Adam had bolted in his condo. Police were called. I jumped in my car and started to fly down to them. I received another call. Adam was found in the stairwell. He was okay. I stopped the car. What are the similarities between then and now, I asked myself?  I\u2019ve been trying to keep Adam calm, successfully doing so with his team this time, his school \u2013  using weighted knapsacks, keeping his hands busy, and a multitude of other little things that I know work for Adam because I am so close to him; to write them all down would constitute an Adam how-to manual (I think I\u2019ve written it in emails to his school, his dad, and everyone in his life, actually). Well, two and a bit years ago, the house his dad and I shared, and the one Adam stayed in after I moved out, suffered a serious fire. Adam never went back\u2026so he was suddenly extracted from his home. His dad moved in with his parents for a while where Adam became familiar. Then, his dad moved into a condo. This was all happening around the same time his aide worker of seven years moved on, and his school announced they were closing down his class. Ah, the merry month of June. Two years forward: Adam suffered a very bad viral croup and was in bed for one solid week. Before that Adam suffered bad hay fever with nose bleeds\u2026 an all-in-all crappy month-and-a-half. That same week of the croup, his beloved basement flooded from a bad rain storm we had here in Toronto. It\u2019s the room where he is KING \u2013 he controls his own videos (he likes the old VHS ones and I save the TV that can play them), his OT swing, toys, mini trampoline. He is a free spirit down there. After his week of sickness and flood repair (we\u2019re still repairing after thousands of dollars worth of serious damage) he went back to school and was having a hard time adjusting. He clenched his body and started biting. This has now abated and he cleverly taught himself to bite into a chewy toy\u2026good on him (it\u2019s better than people or himself). \u201cOperation calm down\u201d requires lots of pressure, a weighted knapsack on outings, structure, visual lists, emotional support, and more effort, planning and attention than is typically required\u2026well I\u2019ve said it above. I\u2019ve learned that there are just some things that Adam needs and some things he just cannot do when certain things are happening in his life, and he communicates this loud and clear. I guess I can\u2019t understand why others don\u2019t understand that some people can\u2019t do everything that expected of them. I\u2019ve been tuned into Adam\u2019s anxiety from the wee hours of the morning when he was born \u2013 no exaggeration. Seriously\u2026way to sensitive myself here. So as I\u2019ve finished my self-help post, my hands have stopped shaking. He is safe. I\u2019ve talked to his dad again and asked if he (dad) is okay\u2026it\u2019s certainly a scary moment. Maybe I\u2019ll remember to take a deep breath after nearly a month now of holding it in. Tomorrow, back to teaching Adam. Back to strategic operations.

{"date": "2013/09/03", "body": "It was back-to-school day. Adam started his new inclusive school today. It was not unfamiliar; he had been there two years ago.  He had a great day and was typing very well. Adam was happy when I picked him up and was apparently glad to be back with the big kids at lunch and recess. In the meantime, I\u2019m up to planning the rest of his programs, and my own. I am due to defend my thesis this Thursday and if all goes well, will start my doctorate and teaching assignment next week.  As I opened Adam\u2019s bag this evening I got a new kind of homework that I was most delighted to find \u2013 I was asked to tell the teacher  about  Adam. I was asked to write in a circle about what Adam likes to do as well as answer questions such as:  Who is he? What does he mean to you? What are the things about him that I should know?   I was just thinking again the other day how, just because are kids have this label we name autism, that our children inherit an identity that does not belong to them. I mean, how often are we asked to talk about our children in positive ways (for lack of a better word)? Aren\u2019t we typically asked by therapists what our kids like for the sake of using them as reinforcement as opposed to knowing  who  our children  are ? And what about knowing our children as people first? In thinking about the year ahead, I\u2019ve spent much time over the summer pondering all the things that Adam  is , what he loves, what he is good at, and what he brings to his family and to the world. Then  surprise ! I got this \u201chomework\u201d in his backpack today. Needless to say, all that thinking about what Adam is, as opposed to what he isn\u2019t, helped me to fill the circle quickly.

He seems to be happier and I am working on keeping him calm \u2013 and there\u2019s people who also help me to do that. I think I\u2019m doing the best I can as a single parent and how it forces me to never give up, call out for support, and stay persistent in asking for help because I realize not everyone knows what kinds of help we all need, or even how to help. I know this is not exclusive to women or single mothers, but to single fathers and married couples too. Yet I speak from where I stand today. I never realized the extent to which this would be a challenge, not Adam per se, but being a mother alone in the middle of the night without anyone to talk to takes a toll on me; having to ask for help, or the right questions, in so many different ways. You have to stop caring what people think of you and go on for the sake of your child because we need as much information as possible. This takes a lot of time. As I care for Adam, it is often difficult to remember to take care of myself. I am thankful for my parents who help both Adam\u2019s father and I out; they are exceptional grandparents and I can\u2019t emphasize enough how important grandparents are! Adam\u2019s extended family is helpful too and although it is hard to let my child go, I know that people\u2019s intentions are for him and to support him, and I\u2019m thankful for everyone involved. I am so tired today but I don\u2019t want to forget to thank people who extend themselves to support us. Adam\u2019s basement is being repaired \u2013 a major renovation. On top of everything I live with a reno which takes its own toll of drilling while I\u2019m trying to get things done\u2026I also have a sensitive sensory system where noise is concerned\u2026so it feels like a dentist drill to me. Yet I am also grateful for it getting done so quickly. Everyone is concerned for Adam to get everything back in place as quickly as possible.  Being on our own \u2013 no matter who we are \u2013 makes the generosity of others so apparent. My mother sent over a thermos of special tea just for me. That seemed to me like such a loving gesture that I almost cried. It\u2019s exactly what I needed \u2013 a mother needing some mothering. I drink now to get my strength back, to give back to Adam the mother he needs. Speaking of which\u2026Adam will soon today be Uncle Adam. His half-sister will also soon be a mother, perhaps a sleepless one for a while. Mazel tov, dear mothers (and fathers and grandparents too)!

{"date": "2013/06/26", "body": "I\u2019ve been thinking and planning with Adam\u2019s team the next stages of his learning and doing our map project. Every once in a while, I got down the dark whole of blog comments and blogs that consistently regard autism, even its many complications and struggles, as inherently \u201cbad.\u201d The issue we have with thinking in these terms, although safety is an ongoing concern for many parents including myself, is that we think we can shape behaviour without truly understanding it, and that what we are talking about is bad behaviour. Behaviour is something that we can control, impulse and many disabilities are not constituted by the will of a person. So when we talk about shaping behaviour and \u201cpositive\u201d behavioural support, we always have to question our subjectivity and how we\u2019ve come to make sense of autism. Given many of our children are not provided access to alternative communication support, and cannot tell us otherwise, and that it takes time and care for many autistic people to learn how to communicate (if they can), the Antecedent, Behaviour, Consequence (ABC) mode of tracking behaviour will remain problematic, and the very recognition of that can be helpful. There are often too many conflating factors that precede a behaviour so, while we do our best to interpret it, it is always difficult to claim one cause. Here I find that I\u2019m needing to ask many different players in Adam\u2019s life for information so that I can cobble together the best interpretation I can, bearing in mind that this is merely an interpretation. So with recent events and noticing Adam\u2019s propensity for visual memory, needing to know his environments, I continue to study maps and autistic art and will experiment how this might be useful for Adam. This is another example of the visual map I found by an autistic artist found at  Drawing Autism: 50 WAtts.  It\u2019s part of my interest in helping Adam draw his own maps as a way of understanding his own environment. This means, I have to be careful how I enable and support him, and be in a continuous reflexive state of mind in terms of enabling versus prompting him which would therefore NOT be his own communication.  Felix: Imaginary City Map, Age 11 Here\u2019s how the artist responded about the work: \n What was the inspiration for this piece? \n     Generally I start drawing one street on different spots on the edge of my paper. I make the streets grow toward one another.  \n Who are some artists that you like? \n     None. I study road maps and atlases in detail and generally I scroll the full track of our trips on Google Earth. I turn now to education in hopes to keep honing in and improving it when I think of Adam\u2019s needs. Under the rubric of the Medicaid system in the US \u2013 a system that is already in existence \u2013 advocates seek more, or varied, habilitative services for autistic individuals. This is an important beginning within an existing system and we have to keep discussing the medical model and its effects on the way autistics are included and regarded as full citizens, or not, in society.  In Canada, we also require more choices that fit with parental values and wishes for their autistic children, and this was addressed by Doug Reynolds in his paper for A utism Ontario:  Looking Forward: Has Intensive Early Intervention Hijacked the ASD Agenda?   The work of autistic people in this is valuable in how I think about Adam and his education and the extra supports and help he needs. Bear in mind, I write here a blog post, not an essay. Here are some of the ideas that I think about that I have not yet formatted into a paper.  To go on, if a parent wants an education for their autistic child, they should be able to work with a school to attain it using some key principles: 1) Respect for autistic identity and personhood; \n2) Understanding  learning at one\u2019s own pace  and an acceptance of it (as opposed to a linear model for learning and development); \n3) Understanding and completion of complicated sensory profiles and the time it takes for accommodations to be put in place and, \n4) recognition that accommodations frequently change and must remain flexible; \n5) Recognition and acceptance of family-hired (which could fall under a direct-funding model from government support) support workers as reasonable accommodation in classroom \u2013 for transitions, programs, to help with accommodations and if needed, supported communication and whatever accommodation an individual and family might need to enable success; \n6) Transparency by schools \u2013 to allow parents in for observation, to review class binders, etc. Considering many of our children are non-verbal, it would be good to not only  communicate in binders, but to allow drop-in visits (even if a bit of arrangement is needed to respect others). This enables open-hearted communication and better accommodations. \n7) Communication aides and technology and access to supported communication and devices as legal right to communicate as autistic people. As an example, an ABA therapist will often say \u201cuse your words,\u201d thereby implying that an autistic child is stubbornly with-holding them. Considering the levels of frustration an autistic person has when they cannot communicate, do we not think they would  use their words  if they could?); \n8) Recognition that most autistic people we name as \u201cinconsistent\u201d and \u201cdiscontinuous\u201d or \u201chaving regressed\u201d is often a result of sensory issues and transitions, and that learning happens at unexpected rates. Sometimes, the teaching agenda must be put aside when an autistic person may seem \u201cdisregulated\u201d and build back tolerance. An autistic person can often jump several grade levels in reading, for instance, and then appear to have regressed. This is not necessarily indicative of a regression so much as a need for a body to regroup. Therefore, \n9) testing autistic people academically so they can advance grades must happen with re-presented formats, over many sessions, and then, the  best result  should be taken as an achievement of grade or pass so that the autistic person is not held back until they \u201crecover\u201d from autism to normalcy and thus never allowed to advance, or potentially restrict their pace and ability. To understand the seriousness of withholding education as a right, see  Moore vs. British Columbia  and the note that remediation may result in adverse effect discrimination because it assumes a person has to reach a certain level of normal performance before granted the right to be educated. Of course we want children to generalize skills and be as independent as possible or to achieve an 80% mastery, but often this concept of discontinuity is missed or misunderstood and education is held-back. These have been my considerations of late and, and I support a variety of methods that befit a child and the combination of many may suit for different people and different situations, so long as they do not harm or torture an autistic person.   ABA is pretty much the only method which is used in Canada to remediate autistic people before granted access to education (particularly people labeled with Low Functioning Autism, who are non-verbal, or who have complex sensory systems). It can be a useful strategy also within a curriculum but it needs to keep examining itself from within and by studying autistic autobiography and potential effects of behaviourism on self-identity.  I am suggesting that autism  schools also need trained teachers in regular and special education and need to: 1) Be inspected by the  Ministry of Education for meeting curriculum requirements (the adapatation and accommodation piece is an extended discussion); \n2) Adopt other methods that we know help an autistic person learn through re-presentation of materials  (see Judy Endow); \n3) Be reflexive about the psychological effects of shaping behaviour and compliance may have on autistic individuals self-esteem and identity; \n4) Learn creative methods and enable an autistic person to go on outings to educate not only life-skills, but other interests by using other methods and creative strategies. I remember one professor of an autistic child stating that when her son was interested (or people tend to label \u201cobsessed\u201d with asphalt), she took him to an asphalt factory. Do schools undergo this kind of creative exercise for autistic children who, for instance, may bolt and may be so enamoured with routes and maps so as to learn something as opposed to controlling behaviour? Sure, we have to attend to immediate safety concerns, sensory regulation and building tolerance \u2013 these are important steps to an autistic person\u2019s success. Yet my question persists \u2013 what can we do that teaches an autistic child to creatively channel their passions and proclivities? What are we telling an autistic child day-in and day-out about them when we ask them to \u201ccomply\u201d  to our agenda without enabling some of theirs? What is freedom if not mobility? Is an autistic person a slave to the performance of normalcy if they are not allowed to freely move their bodies in order to feel safe and secure? (See Judy Endow and  Tito Mukhopadyhay ). For instance, there is so much autistic autobiography about how autistic people need to protect themselves from over-stimulation \u2013 reverting to their iPad in order to be part of a group, squinting their eyes, or if they do not feel their bodies, they feel frightened and must flap their hands or lie on the ground in order to feel safe! If we are talking about \u201csafety\u201d how are we helping? To what extent to researchers and teachers use and take autistic autobiography seriously?  The other issue I need to bring up today is one of freedom of choice. What I find concerning about models of teaching for autistic people specifically is the judgement of some parents against other parents for choosing what they feel is right for their families and their children. It is not right to state that an autistic person has to undergo a certain drug or therapy or blame a parent or an autistic person. The freedom of families as well as autistic people is at stake, and while I wish to trouble this, I realize this has many angles and complexities within such a discussion. Some autistic people feel a parent agenda, if it is one of just becoming normal without critical regard, can result in problems when autism is seen as a disease that requires potentially harmful remedies. So by no means is this discussion an easy one, but there is no freedom if Canada only presents and makes available one kind of service. In short, Canada, with an autism agenda led mostly by parents, needs to consider what it\u2019s building and its long-term effects. There needs to be choice for families, a respect for values and an invocation of substantive equality in our systems. Here I wish to close with an opening \u2013  with the words of Melanie Yergeau, autistic, from her essay,  Socializing Through Silence: \u201cMy silence is in fact a compliment. It means that I am being my natural self. It means that I am comfortable around you, that I trust you enough to engage  my  way of knowing,  my  way of speaking and interacting.  \n When I dilute my silences with words \u2013 your words, the out-of-the-mouth and off-the-cuff kind \u2013 I often do so out of fear. Fear that my rhetorical commonplaces \u2013 the commonplaces that lie on my hands, sprint in my eyes, or sit nestled in empty sounds \u2013 will bring you shame. Fear that my ways of communicating will be branded as pathology, as aberrant, as not being communication at all\u2026This isn\u2019t to say that my use of your language is always a product of fear. There are times when I genuinely want to use it, understand it, and learn about and from it. I understand that speaking is how you prefer communication. I understand that speaking is how you best learn and interact\u2026 \n But the burden can\u2019t always rest on me. I have a language too, one that I take joy in, one that I want to share. And when you deny me that \u2013 when you identify my silence as a personality flaw, a detriment, a symptom, a form of selfishness, a matter in need of behavioral therapy or \u2018scripting\u2019 lessons \u2013 when you do these things, you hurt me. You hurt me deeply. You deny me that which I need in order to find my way through this confusing, oppressive, neurotypical world.\u201d   \u2014 From:  Loud Hands: autistic people speaking , pp. 303-4, The Autistic Press.

My own anxiety feels seismic, and I wonder when all of this can explode, get worse, or if all my calming strategies for Adam are working. I\u2019ve spoken with his doctor almost every-day this week, his school, his OT  \u2013 doing what I feel I must to get all the information. It may be information I\u2019ve learned along the way, sometimes we see things differently or new things at different points in our lives. We\u2019ve generally avoided many medications but over time, things can change. Although we will visit the neurologist, it\u2019s not time to act yet\u2026 I hope that camp again abates Adam\u2019s jerking and the stress he must feel he\u2019s under. His basement flood, the end of school, a new baby on his dad\u2019s side of the family. Sometimes I think that Adam is the strongest, most \u201ccontrolled\u201d person I know!  When I think of his body and how hard he works to get through his day, I just can\u2019t believe his strength! Every day I ask Adam how he\u2019s feeling. He usually says \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d with the same tone. Sometimes I get a \u201cgood.\u201d Since his allergies, turned viral croup turned jerking and biting (conflated with the other changes in his life) this has changed \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m feeling sick,\u201d he says. At least he\u2019s loving his chewy tubes! He knows I love him too\u2026that\u2019s a good place to start. I know he needs my counts to five, my voice to help him move more days than others. A weighted vest seems to help and holding things in his hands. And although everyone is working as fast as they can for him, his space in our basement is not yet complete. It\u2019s the space where he can engage in a lot of sensory activity. I\u2019m feeling sick  \u2013  I don\u2019t take Adam\u2019s words as gibberish. His words may be few, but they are powerful to me. So I am trying to help him knowing the labyrinth we must travel through yet again, knowing that for every medication that is recommended, we would be treating a symptom, and where my real anxiety begins. It is here where the term autism, and perhaps its reified status, falls short in helping medical conditions for autistic people. I guess I don\u2019t believe in rushing in. There\u2019s just too much complexity about Adam and how he feels about things that this needs lots of time. Autism is too broad a term and Adam can appear as if he has Tourettes or seizures or movement disturbance like Parkinsons or at times, catatonia\u2026 Gah! He would fit just about every profile, my little guy.  Anxiety and heightened arousal (either positive or negative) may trigger Adam\u2019s twitching or biting. Some days, just working on calming and ordering his body is work enough for him.  As I try to help Adam, and want to abate his pain as opposed to sedating my worry, I also try to finish a major research paper and am thinking of Larry\u2019s quote from  Wretches and Jabberers : \u201cautism is not abnormality of brain but abnormality of experience.\u201d Here, I question autism as a co-production of that experience, the way must describe it with language that is always half-formed, where normative views and experience may alter Larry\u2019s meaning in the way we perceive it, and where real pain of such a different experience may be missed or ignored because of the label, and perhaps where Adam may not feel supported, accommodated or maybe, even respected. All of these things I have to write down and run through my head over and over again; and this needs good communication from everyone involved. In any event, it can feel like an isolating experience because I must deal with all of this mostly on my own \u2013 I take the responsibility and the worry on, perhaps as the stereotype goes, like mother\u2019s do.  But I realize that I have the the loving support of my parents and my partner, Adam\u2019s aide worker,  and the other team members in our lives that he really needs in order to live a good life. Parents and autistic people require lots of love, support, inclusion. This includes general acceptance of the way things are, as well as acceptance that some people, like my son,sometimes cannot participate in normate ways. Instead, he can always participate given our patience, accommodation, consideration and respect. As I think about how I felt about rabbit-holes today \u2013 of medicines and men, and to use Adam\u2019s word, \u201ccatacombs\u201d of our journey \u2013  I have talked myself out of feeling anxious and will continue plot along\u2026 just like Alice.

{"date": "2013/08/05", "body": "This is Adam\u2019s best friend. Aside from going back to camp this summer, which he is able to do with an assistant, this is the friend who Adam spends time with. We recognized it was a real, unscripted friendship when the two of them preferred to play without words, to roll around on the floor, or when Adam would lead his friend around the house to show him things. His friend is verbal and not autistic and seems to understand and have compassion for Adam, and I believe the feeling is mutual for Adam towards his friend. There have been lots of events this past week, most importantly the decision to send him back to the school he attended two years ago, which is not an autism school, but a school for all kinds of wonderful kids. Adam had good friendships there; we could make adaptations in the way work was presented; he could show off his skills and he especially enjoyed the mentoring program when the older kids would teach him. There, he made lasting friendships that have stood the test of time \u2013 the same friends attend his camp, and they enjoy each other\u2019s company. His typing stories is getting stronger this summer with our daily practice, and helping Adam with schedules and learning to be patient with me (I\u2019m a single mom\u2026 I need his patience) is another important lesson he\u2019s learning with success. Let\u2019s just say, I\u2019ve made these things my mission and I find when I attend to them carefully, we generally do well. Here\u2019s an example: Every weekend, he wants so badly to go to his grandparent\u2019s house. There, he is soothed and served by my mother. My father gives him strong hugs and takes him on his long walks and subway rides. How could he not love the attention and understanding he receives there? (In fact, he loves them so much, I\u2019m going to ask the TTC if they will take us on a special learning tour). If I don\u2019t take him and I don\u2019t have a plan, he had been getting quite distraught with me. I decided to let it be. I broke part of my foot on Friday and couldn\u2019t do everything he asked. This prompted a teaching moment. \u201cGrandma\u2019s house,\u201d he demanded on Saturday, looking at me with determination in his eyes. I was a bit nervous he would bite his wrist if he got angry with me; he wears a chewy tube or heart around his neck so if he\u2019s inclined to do so, he will choose that now instead. \u201cWe can\u2019t go today. We\u2019ll go tomorrow,\u201d I said, thinking  whoops  \u2013 that\u2019s an abstract concept and I\u2019m not sure if tomorrow could wait. What is tomorrow when we want it now?  I tried making a calendar, and since he can read \u2013 I simply wrote in the plan for the days. We went through Saturday, then Sunday\u2026 \u201cGrandma\u2019s house,\u201d he said again emphatically. \u201cNot today. First we will eat lunch, then we will go for a drive,\u201d I declared, thinking of my foot. Adam got out of the chair, he was sitting in, and I wondered what he was going to do next. Then, he walked towards the rotary phone I bought \u2013 to gain his interest in making telephone calls, since he seemed averse to talking on the phone.  He picked up the receiver and began dialing. I quickly held up grandma and grandpa\u2019s phone-number, just to make sure we weren\u2019t calling Australia. He put his finger in each hole and dialed each number carefully. He began speaking into the phone, without my assistance. \u201cHi,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAdam, may I listen?\u201d I asked, knowing that my folks weren\u2019t likely to be home. Sure enough it was the answering machine. \u201cOkay, they\u2019re not home,\u201d I said to Adam. \u201cLet\u2019s call grandpa\u2019s cell phone.\u201d I held up the number for him to follow again and dial. \u201cHello\u201d he said into the receiver. Again, I did not know what was being said to Adam, or if anyone was even there. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said again. \u201cI love you\u2026.can\u2026 I\u2026 go\u2026to\u2026your\u2026house?\u201d he asked softly, speaking each word deliberately. \u201cAdam,\u201d I interjected. \u201cMay I please speak to grandpa?\u201d I took the phone from Adam to ask my parents where they were and indeed, they were not going to be home. I asked if they would please tell Adam themselves (they were in the car on speaker phone). \u201cTomorrow\u201d I heard Adam say softly and he began to whine. \u201cBye.\u201d I was elated that Adam made his first phone call by himself. After that, we were able to follow through with the day without a hitch. I asked him if he wanted to go for ice cream, it went so well. \u201cWhat flavour do you want\u2026raspberry?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cLemon?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHow about chocolate?\u201d  \u201cNo.\u201d In fact, if you\u2019ve  ever watched Gumby,you might recall Mr.Nopey,  from which Adam has earned one of his many nicknames; you\u2019ll just about get the right intonation and speed of Adam\u2019s replies. I waited for a bit. Then Adam declared\u2026\u201dWhite!\u201d I realized that someone told me he had tried lemon once and really liked it. \u201cI think white is lemon, Adam,\u201d I said. We drove to the frozen yoghurt shop and indeed, he loved lemon. So today, with my broken foot, I sent Adam along with his friend to  Canada\u2019s Wonderland  where they shared rides and won a couple of prizes. I\u2019ve been thinking of the typing, the relationship we share when we do it together, preparing Adam the way he needs to be prepared, and Adam\u2019s strong desire to connect. I think when I spend more time with Adam typing and sharing, and when he can spend more time in sincere relationships that aren\u2019t always highly verbal and difficult for him, he is a happier kid. Then, as I finished my Master\u2019s Research Paper (more or less) today, I was thinking of Larry\u2019s line in the movie  Wretches and Jabberer\u2019s  when he speaks to Tracy about their trip to Japan and Sri Lanka, and they\u2019re in dialogue about how nice it was that they traveled together: \u201cLarry loops twice on that loving fellowship feeling.\u201d Indeed, there is something about the summer that triggers these feelings -perhaps it\u2019s simply more time \u2013  and I\u2019ve learned how important these feelings are\u2026all year long.

Mark answered many questions after the filming of this, and Adam listened. Thank you everyone for your hard work. I believe we are getting to know how difficult it can be to learn how to type, to translate an experience into a language. Thanks to many autistic typists, so many kids are accessing AAC or learning how to type, and support workers are learning what  support  means in terms of autonomy. Thanks to typing, Adam is becoming a two-handed typist on some days. Some people will become fully independent and others will always need some form of support, and I certainly hope with a greater understanding of interdependent relationships, that support becomes better understood and accepted. I suppose the main message I would have for people would be: do we support people and enable autistic people by mitigating our proclivity to normalize (and over-value independence)? I think many of our practices are the  taken-for-granted   normate methods and attitudes that erase many autistic contributions. Are we supporting autistic people in order not to be frustrated, to self-advocate? I won\u2019t go into the \u201csystem\u201d which lays out how we value people and for what (such as productivity, independence) \u2013 in fact, I think these mechanisms are universal, except they are more difficult standards for disabled people to achieve, especially when they are not accommodated. I suppose any method could be used for normalization, and this is what we always have to be troubling; by thinking about autistic self-advocacy and autobiography as valid and primary information about autistic experience, and thinking of how our treatments, attitudes and supports can even affect these experiences. By thinking and talking about such topics, perhaps we can better support the community instead of rushing in to say how autistic people ought to be in society.

{"date": "2013/08/21", "body": "I returned home from Germany to find this story (the letter above) in my email box. How ironic. I had lived in Germany 26 years ago for school, and spent much of this trip marveling at the new Jewish museums, memorials and many new races living in Germany that did not do so to this extent when I lived there. Still, I didn\u2019t get the sense that in cities such as Berlin, for instance, that these museums of  hopefully-never-forgetting  insures the security and citizenship rights for Jewish citizens or citizens of other races or disabilities. Work goes into protecting rights; they are not, sadly, given, and often impermanent. Therefore, there is work to be done. During my trip,  I brought my portable Hanna Arendt.  I am thinking specifically of her essay,  The Perplexities on the Rights of Man  where she discusses inalienable rights and The Rights of Man which proved to be unenforcable:  \u201cThe calamity of the rightless is not that the are deprived of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, or of equality before the law, but that no law exists for them\u2026\u201d  She goes on to say how having a country was important for the Jewish people because without one, they were not considered people at all. Of course, we can\u2019t produce a country for disabled people in order to obtain citizenship \u2013 it\u2019s a silly thought if not a dangerous one;  Arendt protests the classless citizen \u2013 one without rights \u2013 by arguing that the prisoner, at least, has a citizenship status; the Jews on the other hand, much like disabled people, have been targets for complete erasure from society. Similarly today, my concern is that autistic people continue to be status-less.  \u201cThe fundamental deprivation of human rights is manifested first and above all in the deprivation of a place in the world which makes opinions significant and actions effective. Something much more fundamental than freedom and justice, which are rights of citizens, is at stake when belonging to the community into which one is born is no longer a matter of course and not belonging no longer matter of choice, or when one is place in a situation where, unless he commits a crime, his treatment by others does not depend on what he does or does not do. This extremity, and nothing else, is the situation of people deprived of human rights\u201d (Arendt, 2000, 37). I conflate these situations \u2013 the disabled and citizenship status \u2013  with the recent story of this  hate letter sent to the Begley family  regarding their son Max playing in their yard. Waking at 4 a.m. this morning from Europe, I turned on CBC news to hear that this letter is not considered a hate crime (the other report suggests it is still under investigation at the time of this writing), and I thought that we must, as a community, ask just when, then, does a hate crime occur? Does it take more than one letter? Hundreds? Physical violence? Institutionalization? Calls for euthanization? Would this be in question if this letter was written about other \u201cacceptable\u201d diversities such as race, gender or sexuality?  Why might we even have to accept this letter, regarding an autistic child, as escaping the category of  harmful crime  when it threatens, if not illustrates, many ignorances about autism? Why must we live \u2013 as autistic people and the families who love them \u2013 as second class citizens, or, as Arendt would probably argue, non-citizens? Are we not allowed, as this letter suggests, to go out and play, go shopping, be with others? In Ontario, the disabled have the mechanisms under  The Ontario Human Rights Commission  and the  Canadian Charter\u2019s Section 15   for the rights of people with disabilities (although another discussion, I posit these Canadian instruments for reference purposes, not for the issues inherent in enforcing these codes or issues I have with the OHRC process). In 1976, the  Union of Physically Impaired Against Segregation  released the landmark statement that provided the beginnings of the social model of disability; \u201cdisability is a situation caused by social conditions\u2026[d]isability is something imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society (UPIAS, 14). While we have these new mechanisms that can be enforced, we know that until autism is understood in social terms, as a human rights issue, and not only governed by etiological interests that often occlude autistic personhood, enforcing autistic rights and cultivating understanding will encounter further discussions of citizenship, that merge with notions of capacity, various models of disability, and more.  For the purposes of this post, it is important, I think, to stick with a fundamental concern I have which is the right for autistic people and their families to live and thrive in their communities, to go to school, to have support, and be accepted as they are and to live a life without arbitrary labeling, diagnosis, testing buttressed by ignorance and the ignoring of a person\u2019s right to live in society  with  their disability \u2013   to live free from harmful words and threat.  As for the Begley\u2019s and our families, we must not cave in to the violent words produced by their neighbour, but to protest against them in order that we too may partake in the fruits of life, to contribute to them, to be allowed to roam free with our whoops and flaps and delight in the lives of our children, and them in ours. For when these fundamental human necessities for life and well-being are threatened, particularly considering the tenuous status of the autistic human subject, we might consider this letter in and of itself the words of a hate crime \u2013  for words are the foundations upon which further human atrocities are built. To add, CBC also posted an essay,  What is a Hate Crime?  which highlights section 319 of the Criminal Code: \u201cThe Criminal Code of Canada says a hate crime is committed to intimidate, harm or terrify not only a person, but an entire group of people to which the victim belongs. The victims are targeted for who they are, not because of anything they have done\u2026It is illegal to communicate hatred in a public place by telephone, broadcast or through other audio or visual means. The same section protects people from being charged with a hate crime if their statements are truthful or the expression of a religious opinion.\u201d I would think that we should all take up this as a threat to the entire autism community. So let\u2019s ask the key question again and I challenge our autism societies to take this up \u2013 when does a letter  become  a hate crime? Or, why is considered  not  to be a hate crime \u2013 perhaps this question is more revealing in how we regard autism and autistic people, and that society-at-large considers autistics, non-persons. Therefore, how can we protect the future of our children and autistic adults living in society? As for me, I write this open letter/post in support of any legal action they pursue against the author of this letter. Reference: Arendt, Hanna. (2000). T he Portable Hanna Arend t. Peter Baehr (Ed.)

And accommodation isn\u2019t difficult \u2013 while designing spaces is an inclusive and creative necessity, as I mentioned, permission to allow people to use their bodies the way they need to use them, enables participation.

{"date": "2013/07/20", "body": "Yep, yep\u2026that\u2019s how I felt reading a review of Scott Barry Kaufman\u2019s book  Ungifted: Intelligence Redefined.  Dr. Kaufman, a cognitive psychologist from New York University claims that he was dismayed by IQism: \u201cI would look into textbooks and look at these charts that said if your IQ was this score or your IQ was that score, these were your chances of obtaining various things in life. I just didn\u2019t accept it.\u201d (Globe & Mail, Focus Section, p. F3, July 20, 2013). He cites our definition of intelligence conflating with speed and efficiency. Yet, a question I always ask myself in reading such books is if it is achieving recognition and transformation in the way we provide opportunity for all people.  Certainly when I was growing up, IQism was hammered into us \u2013 our fates seemed sealed by childhood \u2013 supposedly. Poor at the time in math (primarily because of the way it was taught \u2013 I graduated an Ontario Scholar from high school after finding the right tutor in math), I remember my grade four teacher announcing to the class that I was a failure. I\u2019d like to tell her now that I\u2019m a doctoral student, and how long it took me to get here, and how devastating her words were for me that I remembered and had to fight against for the rest of my life. Subsequently, of course, I had other teachers who felt I should be a writer, or an artist \u2013 thankfully. The question I have now is how these transformations can take place for people with the autism label in recognition of disability and various intelligences. Again, what kinds of support must we all provide to enable autistic rights and well-being? When I say rights, I believe education is but one of them. While we all work having to prove ourselves throughout our lives, I believe it is more exhausting when a severely disabled, particularly a person with a communication impairment and movement/sensory differences, is confronted with daily prejudice about their intelligence. When it takes a long time to get out a few words by typing or speech, you are more discriminated against. Stephen Hawking can only type about twenty words per minute and we speakers utter about 157 words per minute. In other words, there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into having to communicate for many people, and by the time people finish a basic greeting (unless it is preprogrammed into a device) most people will have walked away. I\u2019d highly recommend that if people are interested in the history of this prejudice, and how we\u2019ve come to view intelligence in terms of speed, to read C.F. Goodey\u2019s,  The History of Intellectual Disability.  It seems to have informed Dr. Kaufman\u2019s work, and this is a promising step in shifting the manner in which we support people\u2019s potential throughout their lives, for as Kaufman writes, \u201cPotential isn\u2019t something that\u2019s fixed at birth. Potential is a moving target.\u201d While I\u2019m not sure about his concept on ability grouping \u2013 I\u2019m always wary of the power imbalances at work in our society and how we favour some abilities over others \u2013 I do support the idea that people have many different types of potentials and types of contributions throughout the life-span. In summary, this kind of popular book may create more dialogue about how we are coming to understand intelligence, but our challenge is to transform the way we accommodate it.

{"date": "2013/07/09", "body": "In 2007, I went to Edmonton to speak at  Autcom . I happen to be presenting again at Autcom in Colorado this year about  how to support autistic rights  as parents, teachers, therapists and caregivers. At that conference, I was interviewed for the movie  Loving Lamposts (2008)  which I saw briefly when it was released in 2011. I\u2019ve spent much of the day today re-watching it as I write my thesis. I recommend you watch it for Roy Richard Grinker, Ralph James Savarese, D.J. and Emily, Kristina Chew, Charlie and James Fisher, Dora Raymaker, Sharisa Joy Kochmeister and her father Jay, Stephen Shore, Simon Baron Cohen, Paul Collins, Christina Nicholaidis, Kassiane Sibley,  Nadine Antonelli, Lila and Lyndon Howard (boy you touched my heart), and more\u2026 and of course the maker of the film, Todd Drezner, his wife and the person  they  think about all the time, Sam. It is an important movie for parents (and educators and doctors and\u2026) of autistic children to watch. I don\u2019t think there is any parent, no matter how accepting of our children, who don\u2019t struggle with the temptation to succumb to the prevalent notion that we should be doing more therapy, advocacy, volunteer work and the like. The temptation to believe something is wrong when your child is the minority remains strong, and I remind myself how equally strong parents have to resist this negative vortex that takes away valuable relationship time. And, as stated in the movie, much of my thesis also has to do with how negative views, notions of abnormality and the language we use to describe autism can be assimilated by autistic people as part of their identity. This is really important to me as Adam\u2019s mother. He is now half-way through the age of eleven, and after a really tough couple of months this year, as Adam was communicating something important to me, I consider that pondering my role, my beliefs, how I interact with Adam is, for me, a daily activity. In other words, the work I have to do as his parent on myself is not yet complete; what he wants for his own life and what he can and cannot do just is and I have to help him with that. In this, accepting autism is the hardest work I\u2019ve ever done, and more often than not, the most gratifying.  So, I just want to say thanks again for  Loving Lamposts  to remind me of this, for I believe we could all use reminding.  Along with  Wretches & Jabberers , it\u2019s one of my favorite autism flicks.  It\u2019s time to think about screenings and have more serious discussions here in Canada regarding how we support and regard autistic people. I sometimes get despondent when I see that ABA is the only option for our autistic children, and how that movement has gained such a hold in the field. It is of utmost importance that we discuss various habilitative services, the right to choice, the right to communication and devices and workers to support communication, to be autistic, the right to be accepted, to love, to be educated, to be supported in life and in finding purpose. My job as Adam\u2019s mother is to make sure he has everything he needs to be an autistic person and everything he needs to fulfill what he wants to do in his life. And what I want for both of us is to enjoy our time together. It\u2019s really important not to forget that.

{"date": "2013/07/11", "body": "Adam and I sat on the stoop as usual this morning for his bus to camp. Yesterday, Adam was content and happy and then his assistants reported another sudden biting incident, to which Adam didn\u2019t seem to remember. It lasted but a few moments, then he happily moved along. Of course,  I\u2019m in a newer territory now with his, new concerns and am back to re-reading.   When I asked Adam about remembering it, he said \u201cno\u201d in several formats, including pointing to his chart, typing it out, and also saying it (which came first). He was happy and contented last night, jumping on his mini trampoline in the basement, which is now partially repaired after the flood. After I gave him his ten minute warning that it was nearing time for bed, Adam came upstairs.  This morning, though, my heart broke a bit, but I am also determined to do my best that Adam has a positive self-esteem. Let me preface this by stating that when a person like my son doesn\u2019t speak very much, people don\u2019t tend to listen as they refer to speech as \u201cpsychotic\u201d and nonsensical. I never take Adam\u2019s words as such. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cYou know lots of things and you will learn lots of things. You are really smart,\u201d I replied. \u201cTeeeea-cher,\u201d he sang melodically. Then again, \u201cTeacher, teacher.\u201d He climbed into my lap to be cradled. I\u2019ve asked his ABA school of late to teach him to his age-level and invoke the Ontario Curriculum, to which Adam is entitled, and they have agreed. I am devoted to making sure that education is Adam\u2019s right. I am working this out with Adam\u2019s team which may include part integration, part home-school, getting out more into the art gallery, the museum (he enjoys such places) and the programs he has loved so much and integrating this into his own writing. In Canada, there\u2019s little option but to make our own path at the moment, and families have a right to choose what suits their children best.  In Adam\u2019s case, he requires support, and this is also his right in order to participate in his community in the manner that he wants, needs and is able.  It is great when teachers understand these complexities, and I encourage everyone to continue to learn outside of the behaviour paradigm, and to listen to autistic people. (I think you can sense how concerned I am about what is reflected back at Adam in terms of his person-hood and self-esteem as an autistic person \u2013 a complete and whole person). \n \nPost-Blog Comment: \nThanks to an email that pointed out something important to me which I must write here \u2013 in it, the person mentioned that the Ontario Curriculum is \u201cuseless.\u201d I want to extend how I appreciated the comment as important and hope more comments will come. My comment to extend on that one would be that I feel that education is a right, but the manner in which that education is delivered to Adam must be customized. He still has a right to it, and the reality is that\u2019s what he needs to fulfill to move on to higher ed if he desires it. There are many tensions at play here \u2013 my own personal experiences as a normate which must always be questioned; the changing needs and nature of education overall; the normative linear developmental model that represents the mutually supportive notions of social and neo-liberalism; and this quest for a specifically autistic education that fits Adam\u2019s learning style and abilities while also providing him with opportunities to contribute to society as an autistic person \u2013 and this is the ultimate challenge when society doesn\u2019t value people with severe disabilities.

{"date": "2013/07/16", "body": "I am blissfully tired after our second day at the Communication Institute in Syracuse. This is Adam\u2019s first autism conference and all that stuff that was happening beforehand has abated. He is happy here and spending time in a workshop in the mornings learning more skills, and sitting in talks for the rest of the day, and taking small excursions for his breaks. He has watched other typists here intensively and this always inspires him to do it. I\u2019ve learned that he needs less support than I had been giving him, given the right tools, keyguards, anti-glare screens\u2026 I\u2019m learning about iPad apps that will change his life and change the way we \u201cdo\u201d school\u2026not that most schools (most using ABA/IBI for autistic kids) in Canada  understand or provide as of yet. Adam can\u2019t be normalized but he is a very bright, very autistic, very wonderful and intelligent person.  One thing that really gets my goat, however, is the notion that there is no real purpose in teaching autistic people how to type, use AAC, or engage in an academic curriculum. It blows my mind that these things are under threat for autistic people \u2013 that communication tools risk being taken away in favor of verbal behavior, which, of course, harkens back to Oralism \u2013 when the deaf culture were denied sign language and were forced to speak and act in normative ways. We can look at Victor of Aveyron (1788-1828) for this under the tutelage of early behaviorist Dr. Itard who later abandoned Victor (although Victor could read and use text). Alexander Graham Bell also favored Oralism and it existed well into the 20th century. Today autistics face a kind-of Oralism in Verbal Behavior programs. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want our kids to speak if they can, but most autistic folks can\u2019t speak for a full day or not at all and need other reliable sources of communication. These tools for autistic people are a right as sign language is for the deaf, and considering we are asking autistic people to communicate normatively, and autistic people say that they need this means to articulate their thoughts, it\u2019s a complete mistake to even think of taking this away from people. Society, in the general sense,  doesn\u2019t find that many autistic folks are economically productive enough to invest in them, so instead they are called the  burdens on society . I\u2019d like to invert that notion of what a burden it is for all of us to be underestimated and only be taught for the purposes of being the cog in a corporate wheel. May I suggest that we all be creative in thinking about the various kinds of purpose and contribution that humans can make, and rethink \u201cproductivity.\u201d Then, I\u2019d like to suggest that parents of autistic children who want their children to be accommodated, educated and literate as autistic people to adopt the mantra of those who doubt our children, \u201cso what?\u201d In other words, I think we need to develop a sense of entitlement when it comes to supporting autistic rights to communication tools, access and accommodations. We have to say \u201cso what?\u201d to being autistic, or our children being autistic. It\u2019s a material reality that normative culture is a majority culture to which autistic people work so hard to adapt, and I think of the terrible injustice it is that autistic people have to prove their value and competence every single day of their lives (and often get held back because of it). I think the mantra \u201cSo what?\u201d helps me to keep going against ignorance when people ask me why bother educating Adam as opposed to remediating him (before the right to participate or inclusion)  or just teaching him functional skills. We are here, literally, among the \u201cwretches,\u201d and there are quite a few here, folks. The critical mass is growing and we ain\u2019t no epidemic. I don\u2019t care what you think of Adam and his going to school or later, university. Just don\u2019t take away his right to it. As for the wretches, they are doing a magnificent job in advocating for this right, and we have an obligation to support them. Now I will turn my post back to Adam. He was proud of this little story he wrote today which was read aloud to the class \u2013 I can\u2019t remember when a teacher presented Adam\u2019s work to the class for such a long time now: \u201cOne day two leaves fell early in the morning. They weren\u2019t happy because they wanted to stay up on the beautiful branch. A nice boy called Adam found them and stuck them up for the rest of the day.\u201d A few minutes later he typed to me: \u201cReal useful ideas.\u201d Then, \u201cThe joy love you mom.\u201d Thank you my little one.

The first was the purported rarity in which people experience synesthesia. I was wondering if the researchers paid any attention to autistic individuals who experience it (and report about it) fairly often \u2013 Tito Mukhopadyhay, Amanda Baggs\u2026there are many more; the second point deals with the ways in which this report discussed synesthesia on the radio using the dominant discourse of medical pathologization \u2013 as something to recover from and a \u201ccross wiring\u201d in the brain. This is of course a metaphor to discuss something that falls outside of the normative margin \u2013 it\u2019s not literally a \u201ccross wiring\u201d or a mistake or an aberration. As a critical disability scholar, I like to call attention to how we conceptualize the brain and how we persist \u2013 even post-Susan Sontag and Thomas Szasz \u2013 to use metaphors of illness and aberration. This shrinks the space we need to accept all different kinds of brains and bodies that exist in which we refer to as neurodiversity.

{"date": "2013/05/16", "body": "  This photo is of Adam with his Grandma. I know I don\u2019t write about Adam that much these days. I\u2019m always caught in ethical considerations about his right to privacy and protection versus the benefits of sharing stories. I work a lot with autistic adults theses days as well (am always grateful to have them in our lives and realize how sharing of information and differences of viewpoints benefit us all), and I also work and play every day with Adam. I juggle between my studies, re-growing work with TAAP and as his mom \u2013 teaching him after school when I can. Single motherhood brings it\u2019s own worries \u2013  am I giving him enough? What would happen if I get ill? , among many questions. I do the best I can and I have to accept my situation. As usual, I digress\u2026 Adam is typing on his own now, is becoming a trampoline champion with an excellent coach, and has a friend. The challenge and sorrow, when I feel any, is the isolation by comparison to other children, or quite frankly, the concern I feel when people ask me questions that are proliferated by the media about how \u201cfunctioning\u201d Adam is. When people ask me about Adam\u2019s functioning level, I get to ask in return why that matters to them \u2013 I think it\u2019s important to ask others in order for them to think about it deeply. I then usually respond that I love Adam as he is, and go on about what great person he is. Functioning levels are arbitrary assessments made by subjective observation \u2013 by an individual who thinks they know something about autism, but in fact, just follow a set list of criteria that continues to change.  Frankly, the most valued professional advice I would receive is the answer \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and someone who considers Adam\u2019s unique needs and strengths. Also, permit me to meander, it should never be an assumption that autistic people prefer to be alone. This is not fair \u2013 all autistic people are different and most express a profound loneliness. As for  spectrums  and  functioning levels,  this discursive dialogue must end if we truly value all autistic people.  In other words, there are no prognostications that are accurate. Ask any autistic adult and read through their psychometric assessments and old IEP\u2019s and they\u2019ll have plenty of comments \u2013 none of them positive. In fact, I am very concerned about the material reality these stacks of binders (recording bowel movements and the like) get absorbed by an autistic child regarding their identity and later, their self-narrative. I often think of taking all the binders I\u2019ve kept over the years, papers, assessments and do something with them \u2013 no not burn them \u2013 but make an installation regarding this question:   Shouldn\u2019t we as parents be concerned about a forthcoming identity crisis as our children are told what they are by a mere label that describes virtually nothing about person-hood and individuality? If I could turn the clock back eleven years, what would I change?  I support Adam\u2019s development and person-hood  \u2013 his right to access and individuality. Further, and I have to keep saying this, it disappoints me when autistic children are not allowed to go to various programs with an aide worker. An aide worker enables many to contribute, work, participate, and feel a more a part of our community. While I cannot predict what level of assistance Adam might need when he gets older, for instance, this is besides the point  \u2013  the issue is the right to access. Our autism committees and charities and governments must start considering these rights as opposed to simply believing that autism can be cured and kids can become normal with enough therapy. Instead, when we consider the value of people, we have more chances of seeking education after the age of 21, opportunities for vocational training, college, and university. More creative strategies for living situations can be considered such as co-living, assisted independent living (therefore interdependent living), micro-boards and aide workers and educators can also be treated with more respect as valuable assistants to autistic individuality and right to choose. Strategies for the latter entail visual supports, AAC, extended time, patience, teamwork. Back to Adam\u2026he is partially verbal and this is growing every day now as I watch him also grow taller. He is enabled more as he types a first word which seems to prompt the rest of his sentence. Some days he\u2019s more chatty than others, which seems to be common for many partially verbal autistics. Through patience and repetition, Adam has begun to take care of himself. Adam can talk on the phone a little longer, dial his grandparents, get dressed, brush his teeth, and ask me  where  and  what  questions verbally, that is, on the more verbose days. I guess I\u2019m saying this for all the years of misunderstandings by parents that autism acceptance means just letting a child sit around all day and do nothing. This to me is also an ableist concept which presumes that autistic people can\u2019t do anything at all when the truth of the matter is that everyone has a different situation and we address each child uniquely and with respect. I think many teachers and coaches have enjoyed their  own  teaching successes with him. I also think parents must work harder to readjust their expectations to support education and inclusion. Teachers cannot succeed if we have unreasonable expectations of normalcy and, as parents, we should be startled at this word as it discriminates our families. As we accept this we should also not accept the unfair exclusion and segregation of autistic children and the lack or regard for their education!  In this, education will also have to adjust and I expect it will as computerized learning is becoming more popular \u2013 where children can be taught online and monitored and facilitated when needed. The potentials of the Internet and computers have not yet been fully tapped and could change the face of individualized education as well as citizenship. As commerce takes place online, we are also looking to the Internet for online voting \u2013 the last bastion, arguably, of citizenship.  It was Singer (1999) who said \u201c[t]he impact of the Internet on autistics may one day be compared to the spread of sign language among the deaf (1999:67). Alas, however, let\u2019s not segregate autistic children into a room full of computers. We all need human interaction. Also we need to consider this by Alison Sheldon (2004): \u201cThere is a small but growing body of work within disability studies that emphasizes technology\u2019s \u2018double-edged nature\u2019 (Oliver, 1990) and stresses that it can be \u2018both oppressive and emancipatory, depending on the social uses to which it is put\u2019 (Gleeson, 1999:104).\u201d  (Sheldon, 2004: 157).\n Sheldon suggests that some of the barriers to access include its cost. \u201cWe must not be distracted\u2026into denying the socio-structural origins of the problem. Access to technology is not simply a technical issue with technical solutions. The inaccessibility of technology is just one more symptom of disabled people\u2019s continuing oppression.\u201d (157).  Also, to balance this drive towards access to technology, Sheldon states: \u201c\u2026in the current political climate, the increased use of Internet technology as a means of disseminating information may have adverse effect on other means of information provision. The unconnected majority of disabled people may find that accessing information (and indeed other consumer goods) in traditional ways becomes even more problematic as these facilities become available online. Thus, the Internet is not a panacea that many suggest. There is still a need for appropriate and accessible information to be disseminated to disabled people in other ways, or the disabled community may simply become yet more polarized.\u201d ( 157).\n As I suggested when the iPad became popular for autistic children in schools, we cannot expect it to replace teachers, parents, the knowledge to teach autistic people how to communicate by AAC and/or supported typing. Technology should not become another means to segregate. Finally, to end today\u2019s ramble, it\u2019s time for us to reconsider the spectrum concept. It\u2019s based on a hierarchical system of who is better functioning which is discriminatory in so far as it implies whose life may be more valuable than others. It effects the way we educate, include or exclude, and keeps autistic people from obtaining fair treatment and equality of well-being. And, after all, none of us can predict the future and autistic people do not \u201cfit\u201d neatly into the high and low functioning paradigms. References: Sheldon, Alison.(2004).

{"date": "2013/05/14", "body": "The Autism Acceptance Project (TAAP)  will post a new announcement on its website about its forthcoming work and formation of a new board of directors. TAAP is an organization that is directed by autistic people, and facilitated by non-autistic supporters in order to reflect the concept of inclusion. As a mother to a child who has communication challenges, I am personally invested in autistic rights for the non-verbal populations. TAAP will encourage research and activities to enable the question of  who is missing  from autistic organizations and how might we reconsider the manner in which we organize in order to equalize power imbalances. For the aphasic community for instance, this is addressed. Yet the manner in which we have constructed (and essentialized)  autistic  identity remains problematic if we do not consider the broad scope of individual experience. For example, while some people (autistic or not) prefer to be on their own, other people do not wish to be. In autism, we tend to apply broad strokes to describe how an autistic person lives and thinks through labels. There are dangers in suggesting that all autistic people \u201cprefer to be alone\u201d as much as we assume  autistic children need to be yanked into a neurotypical social world in order to be valued and included in society. The truth is in there somewhere, but usually between the two extremes. The point is, not every person is the same and we need to account for this in autism as we would for any person.  As part of my doctoral research, which will begin this fall, I will be studying emancipatory research and social organization for our community. With autistic folks, we hope to assist clinicians, therapists, educators, parents, caregivers to support autistic rights as one of our projects. Allow me to share some extensive quotes from Carole Pound and Alan Hewitt\u2019s  Communication Barriers: Building Access and Identity  for your consideration. I do hope that many others will engage and invest in research for our non-verbal/ communication-challenged populations: \u201c\u2026an interesting additional challenge is that if language is the core of what makes us human, and the primary means of exploring new narratives of illness and disability, how do individuals negotiate personhood or the development of changed identities following sudden loss of speech, understanding, reading and writing?  How does your own and others\u2019 difficulty with understanding and using words impact on your ability to talk about and question fragile new forming identities with others who are also grappling with a concept at the edge of words? Given these difficulties, how much greater is the risk, as a language-impaired person, that your personal disability narrative will be hijacked by outsider stories constructed by families, professionals, researchers and the media?\u201d p. 165\n \u201cMany people explore concepts of disability and identity by being exposed to and engaging with discussion of alternative representations of disability. New stories of disability can challenge internalised stereotypes offering a precious escape route away from the set of \u2018tragic stroke victim\u2019 or \u2018courageous little fighter\u2019 paths purveyed by mainstream media and disability charities. The means of accessing new narratives is not obvious when academic texts, articles, and website stories are hidden behind a veil of language.\u201d p. 165. \u201cMeeting, supporting and just \u2018being\u2019 together are powerful experiences which, in many respects, transcend words. Meetings between people who share a common communication disability, but who each individually require different levels and types of communication support, are not without challenge. Negotiating communication support from non-language-impaired people, such as relatives, volunteers or health professionals, is an option but one which runs the risk of meetings being dominated and controlled by those who can speak and write. Notwithstanding these challenges, self-help groups remain a rare bastion of power and identity for many people with aphasia.\u201d p. 165.\n \u201cAccess to a sense of personal and social confidence, to a more certain identity, is for many people a pre-requisite to asserting one\u2019s voice, to feeling you have a possibility and a starting point to interact with power. So language, identity and power become crucially interwoven. Without language, it is very hard to grasp the core of identity, and without language and identity it is virtually impossible to hold and interact with power. How, then, can those who possess intact language and power develop skills, environments and structural supports which acknowledge this imbalance and model more equal power relations?\u201d p. 165 \u201cThose charged with implementing communication access need to think creatively about ways of engaging people, processes, environments and infrastructuers with new communication practices, practices that attend, non-tokenistically, to the diversity of communication.\u201d p. 166.  Some of the ways the authors suggest for assisting and organizing for those with communication disabilities are: -training for those without communication disability; \n\u2013 including \u2018interpreting\u2019 skills enabling non-communication disabled people to adapt their spoken and written language to make it accessible, and training in monitoring language for clarity and flexibility; \n-supporters who offer one-to-one interface between people with and without language impairment. (p.166) \u201cAt Connect, for example, trained communication supporters facilitate inclusion in meetings by going through papers at pre-meetings, supporting the person with aphasia to follow conversational exchange and ask questions, by taking notes on line and by spending time after the meeting to review ideas, concepts and decisions. Communication access training focusing on written documents is a further aspect of developing communication skills, supporting everyone in an organization to reword complex, abstract documents and information into clear and concrete language. Training also supports people to consider format, layout and use of pictures that most readily support communication access. The situation where everyone in the organization, from therapist to receptionist to researchers to finance director, takes responsibility for monitoring and changing their use and presentation of language is a healthy first step towards inclusive communication.\u201d p. 166. In the autism community, it\u2019s just as important to look to other community\u2019s that share similar challenges, and to read what they have to say. Often in our community, we tend to get locked into autism labels which confine us to consider that autistic people, with \u201cdifferent\u201d behaviour, cannot be capable of understanding language, although we have enough research and personal accounts to seriously challenge that assumption. As researchers engage in ways to \u201cenable\u201d autistic people to communicate, which is important, we also have to consider the ableist dimensions of technology and language training. We have to consider that power comes from those who can communicate, and to rethink our organizations and the way we do and do not provide access. As suggested, communication seems to assure identity and power.  In its absence, does it mean that an communication-impaired person is not a person? How accessible is current technology to autistic people? What are the barriers to access which include financial issues, attituidinal issues in AAC provision? What about the way we enable or disable a different way \u2013 perhaps we can coin it an autistic way \u2013 of information gathering and language construction (or any other kind of construction such as art, the way information is gathered, learned and expressed)? We tend to assume so much about how people  should  be and it may behoove us to think that neuro-normative ways could very well have its own limitations. Perhaps its time to cross borders.

{"date": "2013/07/24", "body": "Every morning since returning from  The Communication Institute  in Syracuse, Adam has been typing. I\u2019ve realized that he actually doesn\u2019t need the levels of support that I thought he did, when given the right equipment at the right angles, and when I present opportunities for communication that are for now, more constructed. I don\u2019t tell Adam what to write, I\u2019ll suggest it. I\u2019ll begin by asking him to get a book we can read or talk about together or he\u2019ll get a toy on his own. We\u2019ll start to write a story \u2013 this morning we wrote one about a green dragon. When he seems stuck, I\u2019ll say we\u2019ll write the story together and I\u2019ll write a line. We\u2019ll read it together, then he\u2019ll write the next line. When he types for things he wants, he is a two-handed typist now, and reading his own sentences assists with his verbal speech. For someone as literate as Adam, as are many non-verbal autistic children, often labeled with hyperlexia when they were very young, with-holding communication technologies with the proper teaching and support people who are trained becomes a discussion about human and legal rights. I dread thinking of all the days many autistics are taught to label and verbally \u201cmand\u201d without access to other supports. People, we\u2019ve got to change the way we rethink literacy and autism, AAC and supported typing!  In the meantime, I\u2019m writing a paper on this dealing with the discursive tendencies to think of communication as normative, and typical language is, but also how autistic individuals have a right to this access to level the playing field.  \u201cIs it normal to use only spoken language as the accepted currency for exchange of interests? It is certainly usual or normal for talkers to talk, but if you are not a \u2018talker\u2019 you might use other methods to converse.\u201d (Lawson, 2008).  I\u2019m certainly aware of the work it takes for Adam to  translate  his experience, if you will. I\u2019m in no way undermining it by suggesting that to write and type is the only way to be a person. He is already a whole person. He just lives as a minority in a majority world of talkers and he has a right to communicate in his own language as much as is his right to be able to have access to translation and interpretation. When I think of support workers for communication, I think to my lectures, where a deaf individual is supported with two translators who must translate normative speech to deaf sign and vice versa. It takes two sign language interpreters to support this person in a three-hour class. Why should the standard be any lower for the non-verbal autistic person in terms of support?

{"date": "2013/05/28", "body": "The end of the day of Adam healing from the croup and us both watching repeats of  Wretches & Jabberers  for my thesis. Adam can\u2019t help laughing at the scenes of Naoki jumping up and down to Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s  Flight of the Bumblebee  \u2013 flapping his hands, moving the window blind from side-to-side, opening and closing doors, and running up and down the stairs to then, finally settling at his computer utterly focused and well, communicative. I can tell Adam\u2019s feeling better as he giggles and then afterwards decided to do some puckered-lip kissing practice on my cheek. Watching these clips from YouTube are also very important for anyone wanting to discuss it. I would imagine we\u2019re all concerned about Tracy\u2019s living situation and want that to change. As I write an academic paper about a subject that I am personally invested in, I also feel a responsibility to my son\u2019s community. I am also selfish and grateful at the same time \u2013 selfish in not wanting Adam or anyone like him to have to be in Tracy\u2019s position as well as inordinately grateful to both Tracy and Larry and their supporters for going out into the world to do this work. We are all motivated by personal circumstances which enables our emapthy. I am hoping to articulate my personal interests and vulnerabilities in my own academic writing, where one is otherwise  supposed  to be, in a traditional empiricist sense, emotionally removed and (supposedly) objective. Others have discussed this as  well \u2013 Behar in  The Vulnerable Observer , and Douglas Biklen in  Autism and the Myth of the Person Alone  and recently this new paper by Andrew Bennet in t his issue of Disability Studies Quarterly  discusses the possibilities of our mutual vulnerabilities \u2013 as researcher and research participants.  I really appreciate this clip that comes in addition to the film, as I wanted to know more about Mr. Thresher\u2019s situation. I don\u2019t live in Vermont, but I do think that the issue should be a politically active one here in Ontario as our autism societies take up adult autism issues. How can we enable autistic people to advocate on their own behalf for their own needs? How can we support them? This film should be shown at every chance in discussing positive living situations outside of institutions and segregated shelters. I also work hard to get Adam to type and use AAC and seek people to support Adam. It is frighteningly slow for people to believe that Adam can understand, read, and have the ability to type and both of us need more support that is difficult to find here in Ontario. I\u2019ve been writing this blog since 2005 and been telling people he could read words, numbers and book spines since he was 11 months old. I find it really frustrating if some verbal behaviourists teach him the word \u201ccat\u201d over and over again so he can  say  it correctly when he\u2019s been reading it since before he could walk. The autism curriculum must change to include education and academics in its programs to be truly supportive of the autistic person\u2019s right to education.  In terms of typing, his school will support him visually, and I think because of the time I\u2019ve spent typing with Adam with support, that he is able to type to some extent at school without it. Yet I think with better support he could do better there and I\u2019m trying to teach people myself. If you are a parent, you know this is a labour. However, I can\u2019t understand any longer, as Adam and I have also been informally tested (yes, that\u2019s the doubt people have about autistic people) that Adam\u2019s communication is his own, and that with the right kinds of supports and teaching, he could communicate better by typing. This is seen in the same way deaf sign language was once denied to deaf people in favour of lip reading and speaking. Yet, communication is also a right. To deny a person with a communication disability such support and access will become an issue for law and policy, but our important work for now as activists and educators is to keep showing the work of autistic self-advocates, such as Larry and Tracy, as well as autistic people who are prolific bloggers and writers, and to keep breaking down barriers within our own homes, communities and schools, one person at a time. My last thoughts for the evening: Isn\u2019t it better to support an autistic person in their autonomy rather than to fret about what level of dependence they are going to have on their families or in group homes? In other words, isn\u2019t the support of autonomy and our mutual interdependence a much more empowering prospect for us all? (I have to add, I am not intentionally favouring those who are able or have the desire to type or use AAC. There are those who are not able to use it and we have to consider the people missing from this dialogue). Part of my work wonders why such doubt exists regarding Adam and why we\u2019ve had to struggle with so much resistance with educators and clinicians. I do think that Adam, like other autistic people, will dispel the doubts. But I also wonder if we have to ask ourselves what or why we doubt, exactly? What do we fear if people with communication disabilities can communicate via other means? Is this the right question?
