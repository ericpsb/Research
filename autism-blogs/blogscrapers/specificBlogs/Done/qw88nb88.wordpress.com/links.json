Woke up this morning with what feels like one of those \u201cnot-deadly-just-entrenched-for-two-or-three-days\u201d migraines coming on.  Will see if the meds help, soon as I feel like keeping something down so I can take the meds to make the migraine go away, so I don\u2019t feel so nauseous and unsteady and unable to access so many of the \u201chigher cognitive skills\u201d widgets in my brain. Yeh, viscious circle, is it not?First line of attack on the migraine is drinking some strong coffee (yay caffeine), and putting on my iTunes to drown out the louder-than-usual tinnitus that tops hearing aid feedback for dB and Hz obnoxiousness. (Okay okay, for you audiophiles I\u2019m listening to \u201cThe tortoise and the hare\u201d from Flook\u2019s album Haven; it\u2019s Celtic music.  Now anyway), and began catching up on two days\u2019 worth of blog reading.At Planet of the Blind, Connie had posted a blog rating, which I find to be one of those humorous little asides.  So I went and had mine done up:(Image description:  a grey rectangular movie rating icon with the inscription,\u201cTHIS BLOG IS RATED NC-17; No one 17 and under admitted\u201d)The blog rating site goes on to explain, \u201cThis rating was determined based on the presence of the following words:pain (9x); dangerous (8x);  hell (4x); bastards (3x); death; (2x) dyke (1x)\u201dMy response to this rating, in absolutely deadpan voice:  Eek. Words.  Oh, eek.They didn\u2019t even catch the insect fornication going on in this page. Hah!(I should note that it only took me SIX tries to remember how to put an image coding onto my blogpost, after an equal number of tries I still had not figured out how to remove weird paragraph spacings.  It also took me FIVE rounds of proofreading to bludgeon this post into something approaching grammatical orthographitude.  Or whatever it\u2019s called \u2014 I am having trouble retrieving words this morning.   I think I\u2019d better go forage some food before I try to do anything else.)\u00a0", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.planet-of-the-blind.com/", "http://mingle2.com/blog-rating"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/01/quelle-horreur/", "title": "Quelle horreur!"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 April 2007", "body": "Yesterday I went to the grocery store.I wandered up and down the aisles, repeating a few aisles in my (typically ADHD-forgetful) journey to fetch the items on my list (and I still forgot a couple of items, despite using a list).  I selected various pieces of produce and only had one head of cabbage leap from its cruciferous ziggurat to hurl itself at my feet.  (I was examining a pineapple at the time \u2013 what is it with kamikaze produce?)  I paid for my groceries, uneasily navigating volleys of largely meaningless chit-chat from an exuberantly loquacious checker.  I loaded the bags of groceries into my vehicle, and drove home.  Aren\u2019t you thrilled.Doing all that was possible because I am privileged to do so.Privilege means it\u2019s easy for you to get the things you want and need, without a lot of excessive hurdles in life. Privilege means not having to worry about what others think about you.Privilege means that who and \u201cwhat\u201d you are makes your life easier, not more difficult.  You can connect with people and meet them and work with them and enjoy life with them because those connections are facilitated, rather than impeded, just because of who and \u201cwhat\u201d you are.One of the problems with privilege is that when you can make connections easily and get the things you need and want, it\u2019s much easier to fall into a Primary Attribution Error.  This means you believe that you succeed because of your talents and abilities, and that problems you encounter are merely environmental, but that others don\u2019t succeed because they don\u2019t try hard enough or they don\u2019t deserve to, and that their successes are merely happenstance.  Your privilege colors your perceptions because you are not aware of how your privilege affects your life.You don\u2019t have to be Pharaoh to have privilege.  The last time you bought something, were you able to get to the shop because your transportation is reliably functional, or is there for you in a sensible time frame?  (If you take public transit, it\u2019s understood that there will be some constraints to operating hours, but you should not have a problem getting a vehicle because of who you are, nor should you have to wait hours or days or random never-ness for a requested special transport.)Were you able to go through the door of the shop?  Was there parking for you, and was the door accessible? Were you able to go into the shop without being harassed by idiots for who you are, or for what you were buying?Were you able to find the merchandise you wanted without being harassed, ignored, misdirected, or pressured to buy something more or something else?  Were you able to shop without being seriously disturbed by overly-loud background music or merchandise noises, competing perfumes, flickering or flashing lights, or merchandise layout that was a confusing jumble with adverts on the floors-shelves-ceilings-doors-walls-bins-baskets and other surfaces?  Was there enough free space on the floor to man\u0153uver around the merchandise easily?  Could you reach the merchandise you needed, and choose a particular piece?Were you able to purchase the merchandise without being ignored for a long period, or waiting longer than necessary from being deferred service in favour of others?  Were you able to purchase your merchandise without being treated like a child, sexually harassed, mistreated because of your race or religion, or without being mischarged, or your payment method overly scrutinised,  or having your merchandise treated carelessly?If you have been able to do these things, then you are (or have been) a person with privilege.The funny thing is, being privileged is not a bad thing, and you are not a horrible person for having such.  It\u2019s absurd to say that a child of an affluent family is bad because they get several birthday presents, or that someone is bad because they have clean water from a pipe in their home instead of having to draw it from a well or a dirty stream.  Much of privilege derives from the beneficial cooperative action of millions of people creating a world full of vehicles and streets and store buildings full of merchandise and monetary systems and everything that supports those, just so we can get the objects and services we want and need.But privilege becomes a problem when we make bad assumptions.  We assume that we \u201cought to\u201d be able to do something or have something simply because of who we are.  We assume that because we \u201ccan\u2019t help\u201d but be part of some privileged segment of a culture, that we are also excused from our misbehaviour towards those who aren\u2019t.  And worse, we assume that we aren\u2019t privileged,  because we are not able to see how we are, and how others are not.The conscious snubs and hostilities and neglects of open racism or ableism are much easier to point out and fight against.The most difficult work in any kind of advocacy and social change is that when we have to identify the injustice that is culturally invisible \u2013 people don\u2019t even recognise it.  We have to be able to describe what it is, and how it works, and why it is there, and to convince people that not only is it there, but that it is wrong and needs to be changed and that we all have to be part of that change.We all have to be part of that change, even the people who feel they are not affected by the problem.That\u2019s the bad part of privilege \u2013 not being able to see that you are privileged, and others aren\u2019t, and that because privilege is a social phenomenon, we all own responsibility for it.We don\u2019t want to get rid of privilege; that\u2019s impossible.  Rather, we want to be sure that privilege turns into something greater, meaning both larger and better.  We want privilege to become acceptance and accessibility.Because buying a few bags of groceries should be a simple, everyday activity for everyone.(Even the part about gravity-stricken fruit and veg, for we should all have such simple things to complain about with our pals.)", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/04/10/the-privilege-of-being-clouted-by-cabbage/", "title": "The Privilege of Being Clouted By\u00a0Cabbage"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t28 April 2007 ", "body": "It\u2019s a strange hollow, invisible kind of feeling.  As though I could fade away just sitting there, because my own personal reality has so little bearing on what happens.There it is again in the after-school period. The hallways have just quit echoing with the tintinnabulation of the class bell, the clanging of slammed lockers, and agitated hollering of teenagers exploding from scholastic confinement.  A few minutes after the last student has been scooted off to their busses and the staff members have checked to make sure that \u201cno student is left behind\u201d (in the literal sense), we gather in the hallway to update each other with the necessary news bulletins / gossip about who-did-what.   It takes several minutes for the staff to successfully transition from one period to the next, as we work through our concerns about the fallout from the day\u2019s emotional and behavioural problems exhibited by our students.Once that\u2019s sorted, there\u2019s a lovely 45-minute lull for drinking hot drinks while they are still hot (or cold drinks while they are still cold), and (because we have students in six secondary grades and even more levels of math textbooks) strategizing about who is working with whom on the next day\u2019s assignments.  The teacher prepares the assignment pages, and the other paraprofessional and I catch up on the grading.In the first minutes of quiet, I find to my brief annoyance that some of the noise ringing in my ears is nothing more than my tinnitus, which had been masked by the day-long stream-of-consciousness babbling of ADHD students, the monologuing of Asperger\u2019s students, and the repeated exclamations of the student with Tourette\u2019s.  Then there were the other kinds of verbiage, the obnoxious sort, like the cussing and arguing of students just-plain acting out, the ranting of ODD students, and the babbling-followed-by-the-ranting of bipolar students.  (Really, I wouldn\u2019t know how to deal with a classroom of twenty quiet kids.  Fortunately I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have that problem.)I sip my mug of hot Earl Grey, take a deep \u201ccleansing breath\u201d to regain my focus, and pull out my grading pen, the appropriate Teacher\u2019s Edition textbook from the stack, and my pale green sheet of paper that I use to mask off part of the page to more easily read the equation answers.Then the dialog begins.  The other two staff members casually pick back up the conversation they have been engaged in off-and-on since before classes began.  It\u2019s not a particular topic, just chit-chat between two co-workers that usually has nothing to do with work.  Hours earlier I had volunteered a couple of supportive comments during conversational lulls, but neither of them had been picked up.  Were my offerings actual captions, the words would have been still laying lost and unwanted on the floor, crumpled and torn by muddy shoe prints, and partially kicked underneath desks.After recognising that this is more casual conversation that is not related to work and doesn\u2019t include me, I return to the grading.I don\u2019t consider my jobs to be my major source of social life.  Nor do I expect to have a high level of personal connectivity with all the other staff members. Not every conversation needs to include me.And yet \u2026 hours go by with this dialog operating like a tennis match.  Somehow it\u2019s a two-player game, but no one is interested in mixing up players.  I\u2019ve been there outside the court, fingers curled around the chain-link fencing, staring in.  I\u2019ve made overtures to join in \u2013 after all, I brought my racket and a can of tennis balls \u2013 but they\u2019ve not been accepted.It\u2019s not a big deal, except that it\u2019s hour after hour, day after day.  It\u2019s not that my overtures have been actively refused, or identified as stupid or rude.  I\u2019m simply being ignored.  Yesterday one person moved from the desk at the corner of the room to a seat between me and the third staff person, and turned away from me to chat.Perhaps I make much ado about nothing. Not every conversation needs to include me.  I can accept that.  I neither need nor want to be in every conversation.Then one day I arrive at the room where the staff members take lunch, and began unpacking my lunchbag.  One of those staff members pops into the room, looks around, makes eye contact with me, and announces, \u201cNobody\u2019s here,\u201d and then leaves. I don\u2019t expect to have a high level of personal connectivity with all the other staff members.But neither do I expect to be invisible, to be dismissed as a Nobody.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s malicious; neither of these two people exhibits malicious qualities in their other behaviours.  I don\u2019t even know that it\u2019s intentional, that they are both consciously and consistently trying to \u201cextinguish\u201d conversational overtures from me by not reinforcing them with responses.  Granted, my conversational style is sometimes idiosyncratic; because of my Auditory Processing Disorder and/or ADHD, at times I have trouble perceiving when someone\u2019s pausing versus when someone\u2019s done talking.  Then again, I observe other people running over each other\u2019s words on a daily basis, but they continue to chat with each other.Other staff members chat with me about things.  We ask each other questions, and offer ideas and positive feedback.  We talk about school-related issues, and events in our personal lives.  I do have conversational skills, and I do have rapport with most of my co-workers.But I have over the past month become much more wary and reticent.  I strain to observe others\u2019 conversational volleys, to identify how they are giving verbal and nonverbal signals to each other, and what those may mean.  Doing so requires a lot of active mental effort, especially when there are background conversations going on, as it is difficult for me to sort out and follow and understand the words of just one person\u2019s voice among many.  (This is the disabling part of my APD \u2013 multiple conversations are like a blender that chops up sentences and mixes them together into an unreconstructable confetti.  Background noise means my comprehension is reduced to half of what I hear, leaving me to puzzle out what someone may have said by context.)I don\u2019t consider my jobs to be my major source of social life.  Not being included in the daily chit-chat between two people is hardly a crushing blow to my world. But neither do I expect to be invisible, to be dismissed as a Nobody.  It shouldn\u2019t be an issue.But it is.  I am with these two people most of my work day.  I\u2019m not in an office \u201ccube farm\u201d where I have loads of paper or computer work to focus on.  Instead, I am spending hours in a classroom with two other people, who only speak to me to give directions about the students.  The students are there to interact with, but they are not my peers, and my attention with them is directed toward instruction and helping them manage their behaviour.If they were merely absorbed in discussion for a day or two it wouldn\u2019t be an issue.  But I am being ignored, snubbed, for days and weeks on end.  Yet how can I complain about people not doing anything to me?  My social life is certainly not under our supervisor\u2019s purview.It\u2019s a strange hollow, invisible kind of feeling.  It\u2019s much worse this time for having happened many times before.  This time I\u2019m not a \u201cweird\u201d little school girl being snubbed by other school children.  I\u2019m an adult who is finally aware of why I have some difficulties.  I\u2019m not an incompetant loser who can\u2019t hack the job \u2013 I\u2019m a necessary and valuable employee who received top marks in all categories of my last evaluation.  I go out of my way to think of extra things I can do for the students, and bring home-made treats to staff meetings.But there I am sitting there, silently minding my own business.  I reply when either person tells me something, and several times a day I provide information they need to know, or enquire if I can be helpful doing this or that.  And the conversation goes on, and I am become invisible and inaudible.  I feel as though I could fade away just sitting there, because my own personal reality has so little bearing on what happens.I can\u2019t bear to stay trapped in this invisible box of silence, like an involuntary mime.  I must advocate for myself against this snubbing, however volitional or unconscious it may be.  Yet how can I complain about people not doing anything to me?In sociology, an outcast is someone who is stigmatized because they have committed some transgression, or are behaving outside the social norms.  The group collectively shuns the outcast with the goal of correcting their behaviour or to remove them entirely (to protect the collective identity of the in-group).  Being ignored by two people from a group isn\u2019t shunning \u2013 it\u2019s just snubbing.  I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m being so assiduously ignored.  It\u2019s not so much a lack of rapport; there are other staff members with whom I don\u2019t chat much, but they don\u2019t give me keep me at arm\u2019s length and give me the cold shoulder when we\u2019re in the same room.Combatting such lack of action is like fighting fog.  There\u2019s nothing good to be gained by negative actions on my part, neither confronting the people nor complaining to others.  After much consideration I\u2019ve decided to address the issue by trying to improve my relationship with each individual, by providing more friendly, supportive conversation and actions when it\u2019s just the two of us, or when we are in larger groups.  I\u2019m hoping to change the dynamics on a one-to-one basis.So far my efforts have been rebuffed, and I continue to be ignored. I can\u2019t bear to stay trapped in this invisible box of silence, like an involuntary mime.  I must advocate for myself against this snubbing, however volitional or unconscious it may be.  Yet how can I complain about people not doing anything to me?", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/04/28/the-glass-box/", "title": "The Glass Box"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 October 2007", "body": "In one of my jobs, I\u2019m a paraprofessional in a high school science classroom. Last week in Biology we were in the unit on carbohydrates, lipids and proteins as polymers. Of course, the students have been struggling because we\u2019re touching on biochemistry concepts, and they\u2019ve not had chemistry.So I asked the teacher, \u201cIf biology depends upon chemistry, and chemistry depends upon physics, then WHY don\u2019t we start with physics, and then go to chemistry and then biology?\u201d(I mean like, duh!)And he replied, \u201cBecause most of these students don\u2019t have the math background for physics; they\u2019re only in geometry.\u201dThat\u2019s Geometry as the class that for some reason is inserted between Algebra 1 and Algebra 2, before they get to Trigonometry. Actually, a person can get through basic physics without using calculus.  But you do need algebra.  And you especially need to be willing and able to tackle \u201cstory problems\u201d.I think this whole issue with \u201cstory problems\u201d illustrates a very basic problem in a great deal of American maths instruction.  Mention \u201cstory problems\u201d and the students groan and whine, if not almost break out in a rash because \u201cthey\u2019re confusing and hard and [we] don\u2019t understand them\u201d.   Unfortunately, a lot of textbooks (and educators) focus too much on rote drills using the  particular method for that lesson, for example, \u201chow to use distribution\u201d by multiplying 5(3x-2).  The problem with such approaches is that it focuses the students upon recognising a particular \u201ckind\u201d of problem, and then using whatever method  was taught with those kinds of problems in that section.  The students often lose out on when to use particular methods, and why.(The most daring and illuminating thing a mathematics teacher ever told me was in my college algebra class, when she said to us, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, then change it!\u201d  Meaning, if the way the problem is set up is difficult to do, then you can manipulate it into an easier form.  Naturally, that\u2019s what a lot of algebra is really about \u2014 juggling the knowns to figure out the unknown \u2014 but it had never been explained as something where each of us were allowed to change things around to what we needed, rather than trying to guess what some anonymous person thought should be done to the problem.)Another thing that students often miss when learning too much rote mathematics is determining how to identify and then create their own equations (& inequalities).  You know, the \u201cWhen am I ever gonna do THIS in real life!\u201d whine.  Well, that is to some degree a valid complaint; everyone wants to learn things that have some use in their own lives.But in real life,  no one is ever handed a textbook of problems to solve, much less one with the answers to the odd-numbered problems in the back of the book.  This is my answer to those who complain (about any subject), \u201cI don\u2019t care how it\u2019s done, just tell me the right answer.\u201d Because the really important part of the instruction is not the answer, but knowing how to get the answer!  (The teacher doesn\u2019t really need dozens of students to tell them the answer; the teacher could calculate the answer, or look it up in the teacher\u2019s textbook, assuming there\u2019s not a typo.  I\u2019m always amazed at how many typos were in the answer keys!)In real life, we don\u2019t have ready-made equations, aside from various bookkeeping functions.  Rather, we have an assortment of situations where we need to figure something out, usually as a part of a much larger project we\u2019re working on.  For example, this weekend I will have to calculate area of a yard, then do a concentration conversion, then calculate the amount of material to spread on my lawn.  Of course, in real life I can\u2019t go down to the hardware store with a number like \u201c3.6666667.\u201d   In real life, I would end up buying a 5-pound or 2-kilogram bag of whatever.That\u2019s a story problem; I have to identify which variables I need, and which formulae to use, select conversion factors (if needed), and then create my own equations using whatever quantities I know, to figure out which quantities I will need.Regardless of whether or not we use calculators, we still have to know how to set up the problems, and how to solve them.  Calculators enable us to do the drudge-work more easily and quickly, so we don\u2019t lose sight of what step we\u2019re on, or what we\u2019re trying to solve for.  I have no quibble with using calculators for most kinds of mathematics or science instruction.  Regardless of what kinds of tools you use, you still have to know when and how to use them.  No matter what some students think, the calculator doesn\u2019t tell you the answer to the problem; it only displays the result of what you punched into it.*   GIGO, Caveat emptor, et cetera.Back to teaching science. So in this simplistic sense, we can\u2019t teach our science in a sensible physics-chemistry-biology order because our students can\u2019t do the maths. At our local schools, the state has decided to start doing science assessments, which if I understand correctly, will have one particular grade getting a physical sciences assessment, and another grade getting a biological sciences assessment, but because the current biology students didn\u2019t do the physical sciences assessment last year, they have to do it and the biological sciences assessment this year.  (I don\u2019t understand the rationale for that, either.)  Which of course means that the science teachers are taking time from teaching the curriculum for doing assessment preparation.As the saying goes, \u201cNo one ever grew by being measured.\u201d  Although I think most everyone agrees that we need good teachers, and that we need to hold schools accountable for providing the educations that our students need, I don\u2019t think that the constant focus upon assessment tests is the way to achieve that.  We end up placing too much focus on test-preparation instead of teaching, and reciting or identifying the \u201cright answer\u201d instead of knowing how or why it\u2019s the right answer.Bug Girl has a nice little piece, \u201cWe\u2019re taking our math and going home in a huff\u201d about the Bush administration not wanting to participate in the next global test of advanced math and science, quite possibly because US students don\u2019t compare well to their peers in many other countries, and the results wouldn\u2019t reflect well upon the 2002 No Child Left Behind Act.When all is said and done, we still end up placing too much focus on getting the \u201cright answer\u201d on the NCLB stats, instead of knowing how or why it\u2019s the right answer, or more importantly, if it answers the questions we\u2019re asking, or if we\u2019re even asking the right questions.Such as the important question about the most sensible order to present different science subjects.* No matter what some students think, the calculator doesn\u2019t tell you the answer to the problem; it only displays the result of what you punched into it.\n\u201cSeven!\u201d  he crows, shoving the calculator in my face.\n\u201cAnd what does \u2018seven\u2019 mean?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the answer \u2014 seven.\u201d\n\u201cNo, seven-what?  What do you have seven of?\u201d\nCross retort: \u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s the problem asking?\u201d\nStudent recites, \u201cHow many [blah-blah-blah]\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOkay, so what do you have seven of?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d\nI wait a moment, letting the mental cogs catch up.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he realises, \u201cSeven pizzas.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d  I then model translating the numeric result into a verbal answer,  \u201cTo feed everyone at the party you would need seven pizzas.  This is what you use math for.\u201d\n\u201cHah!  I would just buy a bunch of pizzas and eat them ALL MYSELF!\u201d comes his grandiose reply, accompanied by exuberant arm-waving and squirming at the desk.\nI sigh at this last response; this is a program for students with emotional and behavioural issues, after all\u2026(See my additional comment below.)", "outgoing_links": ["http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/09/27/were-taking-our-math-and-going-home-in-a-huff/"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/math-and-science-bass-ackwards/", "title": "Math and Science,\u00a0Bass-Ackwards"},

But I\u2019m sure you get the idea.  (The behavior specialist was naturally horrified that a teacher would want to trigger a melt-down in a student.  That kind of \u201cproof\u201d was certainly not necessary.  Interventions were needed all around, especially in the staff\u2019s classroom management methods, with regards to helping the students rather than \u201ccontrolling\u201d them.)There are a variety of phrases that drive me abso-bloomin-lutely NUTZ, and \u201cfor no reason\u201d is one of them.  No one ever does something for no reason.Often someone is not consciously aware of why they\u2019re doing something. We frequently do something for a number of reasons, to get things we need, and to avoid things that stress us.   Sometimes the way we react or deal with events makes things worse for ourselves and others. The whole reason the field of counselling exists is because many people \u2014 regardless of diagnosis, disability, or lack thereof \u2014 need to untangle how things have gone badly in the past, and learn better ways of dealing with issues and stresses in their lives.When someone describes another person as doing something \u201cfor no reason,\u201d what they are really saying are:\u201cI don\u2019t know why he did that.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice the warning signs she was giving off that would have indicated she was getting really wound up.\u201d\n\u201cChildren-with-autism or That Kind do strange things that normal people never do, just because they\u2019re not like real people, so there\u2019s no point in trying to understand them.\u201dEach one of these translations illustrates a different layer of misunderstanding that can add to the misimpression that someone has a melt-down or a blow-up \u201cfor no reason\u201d.  I call these Incomprehension, Unawareness, and Cluelessness, respectively.  They\u2019re all forms of ignorance, but they usually stem from unexamined foolishness, rather than outright stupidity or cruelty.  (Most of the time; sadly there are exceptions. Somehow in these cases the cause of problems is never \u201cstaff making bad choices\u201d or \u201cstaff not following IEP or BIP\u201d. Too often the problem is \u201cbad reaction to initial reaction\u201d rather than something related to identifying and solving actual cause of problem. But it\u2019s much easier to react to the reaction than to identify the situations and triggers. Funny how in these bad situations the successes are owned by teachers and the failures are owned by students \u2026 )It sometimes takes a trained behavioral observer, working with the team of people who are around the child/student (the teachers, aides and paras, parents and other caregivers, doctors and therapists) to observe, discuss, and come up with testable ideas for why the problem is happening, and different ways that it can be handled and prevented.  People need to work together to help the child/student learn how to identify problem situations, and better ways of dealing with whatever is stressing them.Most of all, it takes communication, awareness, and compassion.  We have to not only figure out what\u2019s going on, but also learn to identify the signs or non-verbal signals that stressed people give, so we can interrupt the developing storm, rather than just reacting after the melt-down, or worse, aggravating the situation.Most importantly, we have to realise that we\u2019re all people.  Although we each have different tolerances and different reactions to situations,  once we understand each other better, the problems and the reactions are much easier to understand and relate to. Under different circumstances, any of us could have reacted in much the same way.  Some of us even remember having literally \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d.  Such memories don\u2019t let us condone the blow-ups or melt-downs, but neither do they let us condone the ignorant statements that others make.  Their incomprehension, unawareness, and cluelessness requires being addressed by education.After all, That Kind of person doesn\u2019t just go saying ignorant things like that for no reason.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/05/for-no-reason/", "title": "\u201cFor no reason\u201d"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t9 October 2007", "body": "Well, this is a terribly second-hand review.  Which really wouldn\u2019t be fair, so I won\u2019t even try to review the play, because I\u2019m not going to be in town to see it.  Instead, I\u2019m reviewing the reviewer, or at least remarking upon the reviewer.Nonetheless, I was skimming through newspaper headlines this morning, and the New York Times had a review of the play, \u201cThe Children of Vonderly\u201d.  A few lines by the reviewer, Neil Genzlinger, made me come up short.  The review title is, \u201cAll families different?  Not this different.\u201dAnd a paragraph later, the reviewer notes:The Vonderly family of Indianapolis is aggressively atypical.Okay, this mythical family is more diverse than many, but really, one of five Americans has a disability, and disabilities are not rationed \u2014 it\u2019s not only possible but not uncommon for families to two two or more people with disabilities, even completely unrelated disabilities. Mr. Suh\u2019s boldest stroke, though, is not putting so many disabled characters into a single play; it\u2019s building in an intrafamily romantic triangle as well. Yes, a romantic triangle.Am I misreading something, or is the reviewer flabbergasted at the idea of a play with \u201cso many disabled characters\u201d and \u201ca romantic triangle\u201d?  Disabled people get themselves into romantic triangles, too, along with unrequited love stories, and mushy soap-opera level romances (gay, straight, bi) as well.The reviewer did catch one peculiarity:It would have been doubly interesting to see the play performed by disabled actors, but under Ralph B. Pe\u00f1a\u2019s direction the cast here is never less than credible.What, the casting director couldn\u2019t find actual disabled actors?  Granted, putting an able-bodied person in a wheelchair isn\u2019t quite as bad as putting them in blackface, but you\u2019d think they\u2019d be able to find disabled actors in freaking New York City, of all places.  I mean, the town is downright riddled with actors.\nNaturally, I have no idea how much the section editor hack-and-slashed the reviewer\u2019s copy to squunch it down to whatever space requirements were dictated by the ad sales on that page (and that, O Best Beloved, is sadly how a lot of those editorial decisions get made).  But it\u2019s still notable that half of the article seems to be wrapped up in revelling about the fact that this play\u2019s about disabled people! Well yeah, duh, you might reply back to me, so of course the reviewer\u2019s going to focus upon that.But it\u2019s how that focus was er, played out, that I\u2019m focused upon.  Ordinary play reviews focus upon things like the scriptwriting, and how well the actors could fulfill or overcome the script, how well the actors worked off each other, how they interacted with the audience, the limitations of live theatre, the sets and costuming, and music if there was any, and the social relevance of the plot, and all those other details.  In other words, the review is about the play, as a piece of live theatre.  When someone puts on Fiddler on the Roof, the reviewers don\u2019t spend half the review caught up in Oh-my-gosh, this play\u2019s about Jews!  With yes, a romantic triangle!Isn\u2019t it about time we got past the point where disabled people are such a bloody novelty?

I didn\u2019t know anyone else understood what it was like to be this sort of person \u2013 to have this kind of mind \u2013 much less that anyone out there valued it.Miscellaneous Vacancies\nAre you:\n\u2022    A creative, articulate scientist with research experience in biological, medical, chemical, electrical, mechanical or materials engineering disciplines?\n\u2022    A lateral thinker, passionate about science and your own discipline, yet able to think outside of the box and make connections to other fields?\n\u2022    A great listener with highly developed interpersonal skills, with career goals in commercialisation, technology transfer or business development and able to manage relationships with clients in a highly fluid environment, respect confidentiality and work with people across all levels of an organisation?\nDo you:\n\u2022    Thrive on change and derive great pleasure from making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas?\n\u2022    Get a buzz from finding new routes that others have not trodden before and yet would be comfortable with working collaboratively to develop your ideas and those of others without expectation of extra personal or monetary recognition?Sadly, the closing date for the position had long since passed by the time I read it.  But like so many dangerous ideas, knowing that such a thing even existed reverberated up and down my mental timelines.In graduate school, the entomology professors didn\u2019t understand how or why I kept making connections between ecology and learning disabilities.  Such details were certainly not necessary to researching insect behaviour, no matter how much they might apply to some of the students in the department.In a recent New York Times article, \u201cInnovative Minds Don\u2019t Think Alike\u201d, Janet Rae-Dupree describes the \u201cso-called curse of knowledge\u201d where experts are so familiar with traditional means of getting things done that their expertise gets in the way of innovation.  The article also describes how bringing in people who have other fields of knowledge, but who are not bogged down by the specialist jargon that reinforces and limits the current understanding, can free up boxed-in thinking and create new ideas.It\u2019s a conundrum how organisations (academic or otherwise) claim to want innovation, but are resistant to novel suggestions that often go against what everyone knows will work.  But as the saying goes, \u201cIf you always do what you\u2019ve always done, you\u2019ll always get what you always got.\u201dMore recently, an education professor was not only unfazed by my entomological background, but thought it \u201cwonderful\u201d and mentioned that Jean Piaget had worked on snail behaviour before working with children.

Trying to convince others that they can benefit from such seems almost beyond my abilities, as  I\u2019m not a natural salesperson who can schmooze and easily persuade others.Meanwhile, I\u2019m still buzzing about, looking for a good niche.

The \u201cword verification\u201d programs (such as CAPTCHA) are used to verify that a real human is using the site, instead of a spambot or whatever.  Anyone with vision problems, dyslexia or other related issues hates them.  One alternative is to have an accessibility option (sometimes denoted with the blue wheelchair symbol) that will provide audio of the word /letters that the user needs to type in. Obviously, this doesn\u2019t help customers who cannot hear well.  I\u2019m not sure if screen-reading programs for the blind can read them properly, either.You can find  the current Web Content Accessibility Guidelines from the World Wide Web Consortium here; there\u2019s a new version currently in the works. This page has W3C\u2019s comments about CAPTCHA inaccessibility.Personally, I hate the damn word verification things; mine seem to have too many wobbly  i j b d p q  letters in them, and unlike real words with familiar orthography (where I can rely on kinesthetic memory for my fingers to \u201cautofill\u201d), they are hard for me to read and type in correctly. \u201dThen a couple days ago he sends me a link for this tee shirt from Crush3r.com:(Description:  a tee shirt design with a black background around a white text box.

Fun with silly tee shirts aside, I still really, really dislike having to deal with CAPTCHA programs when posting comments on people\u2019s blogs or on commercial Web sites.  I quite understand the reasons why people use them, but  continue to hope that someone out there will come up with a better Turing Test that doesn\u2019t present so many dang accessibility issues!In a related issue:  CAPTCHA is a rather clever acronym for Completely Automated Turing Test To Tell Computers and Humans Apart. A Turing Test refers to Dr Alan Turing\u2019s idea that a computer\u2019s intelligence could be tested by having it chat via some sort of text device with unknowing humans; if the person cannot tell that they are texting with an artificial intelligence, then the computer or robot passes the test.  Naturally, a number of objections and replies came out of Turing\u2019s original 1950 paper.  This is one from the Wikipedia article linked above:\nMechanical Objections: A sufficiently fast machine with sufficiently large memory could be programmed with a large enough number of human questions and human responses to deliver a human answer to almost every question, and a vague random answer to the few questions not in its memory. This would simulate human response in a purely mechanical way. Psychologists have observed that most humans have a limited number of verbal responses.\nI find this particular objection to the validity of the Turing Test to be rather interesting.  \u201cPsychologists have observed that most humans have a limited number of verbal responses.\u201d  Some of us have a more limited number of verbal responses than others! When I am stuck trying to make chit-chat with strangers in social events (such as holiday parties for hubby\u2019s employer), I\u2019m frequently afflicted with the terrible issue of having every line of acceptable verbal fluff evaporate from my memory.  Over the years I have collected these trite phrases of polite interest that are supposed to facilitate conversation between strangers, but no matter how much I practice them, they fall out of my dialog buffer when I need them the most.So while I\u2019m standing there trying to follow someone\u2019s prattle amongst the blended babble of party-goers and background music (that whole Auditory Processing Disorder bit), and desperately trying to recall and retain a relevant script before it slithers away again,  I\u2019m also losing my ability to look appropriately animated and present the correct gestures and verbal inflections. I\u2019m prone to defaulting to taking things too literally, and resorting to factual analysis rather than the spoken equivalent of ape-grooming that is so much of the function of chit-chat.The cocktail party as Turing Test \u2014 maybe that\u2019s where someone came up for the idea for the Star Trek character, Spock \u2026", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.captcha.net/", "http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/", "http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Test"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/06/prove-youre-not-a-robot/", "title": "Prove You\u2019re Not A\u00a0Robot"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 October 2007", "body": "Wow.  Here I was ready to comment on one piece of news, when several more caught my attention.  They all revolve around social ideas of gender r\u00f4les, and marginalised or disabled people.This first one struck close to home:  Khadijah Farmer was kicked out of women\u2019s toilet of a Manhattan, NY, restaurant because the bouncer thought she looked too masculine.\u201cI said, \u2018I am a woman and I am where I am supposed to be,'\u201d said Farmer, speaking at a a news conference. \u201cI offered to show him some identification. I was told that\u2019s neither here nor there.\u201dSome people might say that happened \u201cjust because\u201d she\u2019s a lesbian (like that\u2019s a valid reason), but I can vouch for the same thing happening to me as well. On the occasion that I wear a skirt or dress, I look \u201cappropriately\u201d female.  But since I have a really short hair style, and often wear men\u2019s shoes (because I have wide feet) and men\u2019s shirts (because I have broad shoulders and long arms) and am disinclined toward wearing make-up, I have been frequently mistaken for a guy.Even my name doesn\u2019t seem to help; just last week someone assumed that \u201cAndrea\u201d is a man, because although it\u2019s the female form of \u201cAndrew\u201d in English-speaking countries, it\u2019s a masculine name in Italy and other countries.  So my persona gets transgendered to \u201cMister Andrea [surname]\u201d or \u201cMister Andr\u00e9 [surname] or Mister Andreas [surname].  Or when I am giving my name over the telephone to someone (who is probably working in a call center somewhere in South Asia), I end up both transgendered and ethnically transformed to \u201cMister Chandra\u201d or other variations.  This is mildly amusing until I am standing jetlagged at a hotel reception desk or a passenger ticket counter, blearily trying to guess what new mangled version of my name my reservation is filed under, while the receptionist in turn is trying to make sure that I\u2019m not trying to pull some convoluted scam by presenting them with a valid reservation number but photo identification that doesn\u2019t match the name or sex they expect.(I will confess that sometimes it helps to travel under the aegis an affable white male who can \u201cpresent\u201d himself as a harmless business traveller \u2014 this is of course assuming that my hard-of-hearing hubby is not also exhausted, and trying to bluff his way through a conversation but failing miserably.    We make pretty good travel partners so long as we each retain enough patience with the other.)I\u2019ve yet to be kicked out of a restaurant or a bathroom due to discrimination by gender (mis)perception, but I have received a wide range of suspicious looks or \u201chelpful\u201d directions toward the door of the men\u2019s toilet.   This whole business about bathrooms is really ridiculous.  Let\u2019s face it:  we all use the bathroom for the same reasons. Of course, women also use the stalls to attend to menstrual hygiene.  And guess what \u2014 both men and women use restrooms (the loo) to change diapers (nappies) on babies, children, or even themselves or other adults.In a more reasonable world, we wouldn\u2019t have a Men\u2019s Toilet and a Women\u2019s Toilet.  We would simply have Toilets (unisex or all-gender).  Just imagine how much easier it will be for daddies to take their girls in, and mommies to take their boys in, when the tykes needed to go potty.  No more worrying about translating cutesy signs in restaurants, \u201d \u2018Heifers\u2019 is the Little Girl\u2019s Room,\u201d drawls the waitress helpfully, leaving me wanting to ask where the Big Women\u2019s Room is.  (Note to intersteller aliens: a toilet door icon for \u201chuman wearing slacks\u201d doesn\u2019t mean I should use that room when I\u2019m wearing slacks, nor does the toilet door icon for \u201chuman wearing skirt\u201d mean that a man wearing a kilt should use the other room.  Nor does the sign on the shop door, \u201cNo shirt, no shoes, no service\u201d mean that you can patronise that business bare-ass nekkid.)   Unisex toilets would also mean no more panic over which room your transgendered students should use: \u2026 if Luke entered a women\u2019s bathroom on campus, \u201dsomeone might yell, \u2018Oh my God, there\u2019s a man here\u2019 and call security,\u201d he said. \u201dIn men\u2019s bathrooms I\u2019d have to fold my arms over my chest and hope that no one would notice.\u201d Now he and several other Brown students are pressing the university to create more single-stall bathrooms, so students who don\u2019t look clearly male or female can avoid harassment.The next story involves the reinstatement of a South Korean helicopter pilot, Colonel Pi Woo-jin, who was discharged from service following her mastectomy \u201cbecause army regulations require soldiers who are missing body parts to be discharged.\u201d I was going to make some snarky remark, but just found myself sputtering, as this whole situation is just too stupid beyond words. I hope Colonel Pi gets her full reinstatement and isn\u2019t cheated out of her future retirement benefits, or subjected to additional harassment on her job. (I\u2019m not optimistic about the latter.)Lastly, there\u2019s the whole dreadful d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of the Ashley X story revisited with the Katie Thorpe news.  The parents of the 15-year old English girl with cerebral palsy feel that their daughter\u2019s life is already too \u201cundignified\u201d because she needs personal care, and that she might have painful menstrual periods or would be frightened or confused by her \u201cinconvenient\u201d monthly menses.  They also fear that she would be more vulnerable to sexual molestation if she is fertile.Um, isn\u2019t major surgery fraught with its own complications?  Trust me, I understand how painful such \u201cfemale problems\u201d can be \u2014 I took the surgical route to resolve issues related to cysts and endometriosis.  I also know that recovering from such an operation is both long and painful in its own right.  And while removing ovaries and uterus is one way of preventing some potential medical problems, doing so at the age of 15 introduces others, such as osteoporosis.  Likewise, as I pointed out before in my post on Ashley, making a disabled girl sterile doesn\u2019t prevent sexual abuse, but would simply make it easier to hide such, because she wouldn\u2019t unexpectedly miss a menstrual period, nor would she receive regular gynecological checkups.If they\u2019re worried about  her being frightened or confused about her menses, then she simply needs to be educated about them.  The article mentions that she loves to ride horses, and that her family knows that she enjoys doing that.  Obviously there is some level of communication going on between Katie and her family; if she can communicate joy, surely she can communicate pain?  One thing the article doesn\u2019t mention is whether or not Katie has alternative communication means available to her.  As the saying goes, Not being able to speak doesn\u2019t mean not having anything to say.  It\u2019s not that the parents\u2019 concerns are not valid, or that they don\u2019t need supports in her care, it\u2019s that the solutions they are seeking are not the best ones, and that they also set terrible precedents for worse \u201csolutions\u201d regarding disabled people. Penny Richards has been collecting bloggers\u2019 reactions to this news story in her post, \u201cWe do know better\u201d.So trying to sort out all this news and nonsense, it becomes apparent that a lot of discrimination happens when people are uncomfortable or scared of someone who is pushing the boundaries of gender identity or gender r\u00f4les.  People are uncomfortable with the fact that disabled children can grow up to be disabled, sexual adults.  And what happens?  People are \u201cpunished\u201d for stepping outside of narrow definitions of social r\u00f4les.  People seek drastic steps to relieve their own discomfort and fears of human sexuality by literally trying to cut them out of the bodies of young girls.Talk about undignified.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/02/america/NA-GEN-US-Gay-Customer-Complaint.php", "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403EFD8113FF934A35750C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all", "http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=3694339", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article2604771.ece", "http://disstud.blogspot.com/2007/10/we-do-know-better.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/10/m-f-na/", "title": "M, F, N/A"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t18 June 2006 ", "body": "The unfolding layers of cruel imprisonment and torture of students with mental/emotional problems and learning or developmental disabilities at the Judge Rotenberg Center as described in this report have created ongoing responses by horrified and angry posts by parents, professionals, and survivors of similar places (e.g. Kevin Leitch\u2019s Autism Blog Web Design Blog, Mike Stanton\u2019s blog Action for Autism, or Amanda\u2019s blog Ballastexistenz).I won\u2019t list the litany of carefully crafted, systematic and officially sanctioned malfeasance described in the Report, which span a range of criminal, irrational, abusive, and generally mindf**king evils that are only more shocking for the fact that so many people seek to defend them as being sensible and necessary. You really need to read the report to understand that the anger generated by the JRC & its head Matthew Israel are far from over-reactions.What I do want to bring up are my thoughts on the whole underlying paradigm of punishment that such institutions, and indeed much of society, are operating on. It\u2019s not enough to shut down one place (and given the current political climate, that will be far more difficult than should be compared to other bureaucratic efforts). We have to understand how such things come about, and continue to pop up. Otherwise we\u2019re just picking off mushrooms and not addressing the fact that the entire structure is rotting and permeated with fungal myc\u00e6lium.Once upon a time, long time ago, when people had problems in life (being sick or poor for example), these were seen as due to divine punishment for being sinful. Centuries later in more enlightened times, problems were seen as being due to the natural consequences of being sinful (a Renaissance, humanistic perspective). More modernly, problems were seen as resulting from people choosing to be sinful, so they therefore deserve punishment from other people or from God. (I\u2019m speaking generally here, so history majors will have to keep their corrective twitches to themselves.)All of these revolve around the idea that humans are inherently sinful \u2013 and if people have problems, it\u2019s their fault.   Because it\u2019s their fault, they should have to deal with the consequences.That sounds reasonable on the surface, but what it really means is that people are often being punished for having problems. E.g., if you\u2019re poor, it\u2019s because you\u2019re lazy and sinful and deserve to be poor.Furthermore, the \u201chelp\u201d given to people often seeks to perpetuate the status quo \u2013 the person who is being the helper gets cosmic brownie points. Such \u201chelp\u201d is about doing things to people rather than doing things with them; it reinforces power inequalities and objectifies people. It\u2019s about maintaining these paradigms rather than empowering people.In classroom situations, this kind of helping or behaviour \u201cmanagement\u201d just creates tasks defined by what the giver (teacher, administrator, special education therapist) wants done, rather than by what the receiver actually needs, or is able more better suited to do. (If that doesn\u2019t seem true, ask yourself if you ever had teachers who gave out pages of \u201cbusy work\u201d that were neither useful nor needed, just to keep the students busy and quiet for the teacher\u2019s benefit. Or, did you ever have to practice \u201cskills\u201d over and over even though you were never able to improve significantly, just because you \u201cneeded to\u201d be able to do neat penmanship or work without an assistive device, nevermind that in the real world you would later rationally drop those tasks in favour of methods that were more functional.) Commands like, \u201cYou need to do thus-and-such,\u201d are flags that should make us examine the situation more closely.When the students fail to comply, the resulting punishment often teaches quite different lessons, not those about how to better manage one\u2019s papers or how to mediate playground arguments, but rather lessons about power. \u201cI\u2019m bigger/ older/ in charge, so I can make you do what I want,\u201d is the message actually learned.A big problem is that the whole system seems sensible because it\u2019s so entrenched, and because it\u2019s easier to temporarily suppress certain behaviours by punishments (or coercing people with shiny rewards), than it is to identify and resolve the underlying problems that are causing the distress in the first place.Sometimes that distress is the student\u2019s feelings of powerlessness and helplessness. But when students act up from feeling powerless, what do the authorities then do? Clamp down even harder, create more restrictions, and more punishments. This is hardly a solution, and very much a self-perpetuating feedback loop that increases distress for everyone involved.The worst kind of pedagogical punishment is making someone do a task that is otherwise supposed to benefit them. That is, if a student acts up by being oppositional or disruptive or fails to do the assignment because there is something they cannot do cognitively or physically, then the student is \u201ctaught a lesson\u201d and punished by giving them more of the same kind of assignment. Learning should never be used in an aversive manner; the student then gets even more upset and frustrated and acts out and then becomes a \u201cproblem student\u201d. The student is then being punished for having problems.Aversives in the form or corporal punishment (such as the electroshock apparatus used at JRC) teach both the giver and the recipient that aggression and inflicting pain are acceptable and appropriate ways of responding to people when they don\u2019t do what someone else wants them to do. Unfortunately, lots of people have learned this \u201clesson\u201d all too well \u2026Not only does punishment as behaviour modification set up and maintain coercive power systems, but it also distances teachers and others from their students, and puts them into antagonistic roles, rather than as partners in education (contrary to what many school districts\u2019 mission statements assert).Punishment can not only ruin learning, but also takes moral development from an inner-directed process and changes it to a situation of \u201cdon\u2019t let me catch you doing that again\u201d where the message isn\u2019t avoiding the behaviour and doing something positive, but rather of not getting caught. The focus is on consequences instead of creating interpersonal and social benefits.Instead of morality being inner-directed (under a person\u2019s self-control and self-initiation) it becomes personally directed \u2013 how to get what one wants for themselves \u2013 not how to work with and help others.One of the biggest challenges we face is not just shutting down localized hotspots of cruelty and injustice, but also of providing viable alternatives to replace the vacuum left behind. Otherwise we\u2019re just plugging dikes with our thumbs.andrea", "outgoing_links": ["http://boston.com/news/daily/15/school_report.pdf", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=374", "http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2006/06/15/judge-rotenberg-center-a-marker/#comments", "http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?cat=189"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/06/18/the-crime-of-punishment/", "title": "The Crime of\u00a0Punishment"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t2 April 2008", "body": "There are a lot of difficult things with getting used to a condition that causes regular pain or chronic fatigue. Part of it is just getting used to the idea that there is no quick fix, that this is the New Normal in our lives.Part of it is realising that medication and treatments will alleviate some of the pain, but that they don\u2019t always eliminate it.  Even if we\u2019re not feeling horribly crappy, that doesn\u2019t mean we can just blaze through the day like we used to.  The reductions in overall capacity from tiring and/or painful conditions create additional problems that are not always easy to anticipate.There are the social issues, of not wanting to sound whiney, but also of needing to advocate for ourselves, and either forgo doing some things or request accommodations for others. Meanwhile, everyone else is still working on the idea that relieving pain means making-it-go-away, and that \u201cif you\u2019re not in pain, then you can do everything just like normal\u201d.There are weighing issues of prioritising things. When we don\u2019t fully adjust to this new normal, it can be partly denial, and partly not realising just how much the condition permeates things in life.  It\u2019s one thing to say, \u201cI\u2019m hurting, I\u2019m not going to do this right now,\u201d or \u201cDoing that causes me too much wear and tear so I\u2019m going to do this instead.\u201dBut it\u2019s quite another to realise that we can\u2019t keep putting things off until \u201cI have more energy\u201d or \u201cI have more time\u201d or \u201cWhen I\u2019m feeling better in the afternoon\u201d.  In reality even though there are better times of day or just better days, and even though we find alternative means, what we find is that we still can\u2019t do all those things.We can do them, but we can only do some of them.  When we\u2019re having a good afternoon or a better day, we then find that we have a backlog of Things To Do. In truth, there was no way we could really could do all of them previously in our lives, which is why everyone has those long To do Lists in the first place!There are budgeting issues of allotting energy.  In the new normal, we not only can do less because we have fewer good time periods, but also because we have to pace ourselves.  If we push ourselves too hard, then we crash and feel worse than we would have otherwise, and will just get even behinder.  (And both the crashing and the getting behinder result in being grumpier, making us and everyone around us miserable.)What makes pain such a bastard is not just the direct issue of hurting \u2014 a lot and frequently, or variably and all the time \u2014 but also the secondary issues of pain causes stress and stress aggravates pain and the dreadful feedback loops.Chronic stress-pain loops can result in not having much appetite (so not eating regularly or nutritious foods), being more sensitive to the ordinary incidental pains in life as well as the chronic issues, getting more easily stuck in anxious, obsessive or depressive states, having depressed immune responses, and of course, it can create the whole horrible pain-bad sleep feedback loop.  There\u2019s nothing like chronic pain to make one realise just how inter-related psyche and soma really are.Chronic issues mean not having much in the way of energy reserves.  It can be really easy to fall into a bad habit of \u201ccheating\u201d the budgeting or pacing by relying upon crisis energy.  Lots of people (especially those with AD/HD) rely upon the \u201csalvation by deadline\u201d to get them energised to do or complete a task.  But this kind of crisis energy is really hard on the body because it relies upon the adrenaline from the sense of crisis.  Once that adrenaline rush is past, we crash.  It\u2019s a way of pushing ourselves that is counter-productive in the long run.People who are able to integrate the new normal successfully throughout their lives are those who do best with chronic issues.  The novelty fades and the issue is simply another part of their life. Acceptance is not the same thing as giving up. We can accept that we have problems without abandoning efforts to find new ways of improving things.Prioritising and budgeting energy are important components of the adjustment, just are various therapeutic approaches and regular stress management. Energy prioritising and budgeting are especially important because they are less about what we cannot do, and are more about enabling ourselves to do things that are important.Whatever \u201cimportant\u201d gets re-defined as.\u201cBut pain\u2026 seems to me an insufficient reason not to embrace life. Being dead is quite painless. Pain, like time, is going to come on regardless.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t6 April 2008 ", "body": "(\u201cThrown a curve\u201d is a phrase from baseball, meaning when someone throws you a curve ball that is difficult to hit; it can also mean running into something unexpected.)Halfway through the semester of Gen Chem I, we had just gotten another exam back, and things were grim.  On the first day of class, the prof had told us that, \u201cHalf of you are going to drop out or flunk,\u201d and he  hadn\u2019t been kidding; as we neared the last day to Withdraw from class, the students were dropping like flies.  Those of us still remaining were struggling mightily. The students were bitching about the teacher, and in turn the teacher was complaining about \u201cthe kind of students nowadays\u201d (and this was back in the early 1980\u2019s).Of the several dozen who hadn\u2019t given up and were slumped through the lecture hall staring at their exams dripping with red ink, only two had done well, meaning had correctly answered at least 70% of the questions.  (Hallway discussions after lecture would yield the fact that both of them had taken chemistry in high school, so this wasn\u2019t their first experience with the concepts.)  As the instructor skimmed through and told us the correct answers to the test, the grousing turned to arguing, and then to deal-making.\u201cDo you grade on the curve?\u201d pleaded one student.  Everyone turned expectantly towards the prof, who as usual, looked annoyed and cross.  His utter fatigue with teaching had been apparent from the first week, and had disimproved steadily with the succeeding weeks. His answer, like all other quantitative answers, began with a sigh audible all the way to the back of the lecture hall, and then he rambled on in a rush of words as to how such a calculation would work, and then why it wouldn\u2019t change anything on today\u2019s exam because of the two students\u2019 A and B grades in the 90+ and 80+ percentiles.  After giving them an earful of arithmetic, the energy of the protesters was worn down, and he returned to reciting the answers we should have gotten.  Why we had not gotten them was not an issue he discussed.Later on that day I was more puzzled by grading curves than by acid-base reactions.  (The conceptual part of chemistry  was fine, I had simply gotten tangled up in the calculations.  Again.)  Not yet having the awesomeness of the World Wide Web for looking things up, I flipped through some maths books at the library until I found mention of the Normal Distribution Curve in a statistics book.I understood grading by percentile; a score greater than or equal to 90% was an A, 80% was a B, and so on.  And I understood how the normal distribution curve worked as far as describing how most of the members in a set were in the middle range, and successively fewer were at the lower and higher ranges.  But trying to apply that normal curve (a mound that looked like a sand dune, or slice of bologna after my dad had cooked it in the pan) to distribution of grades left my brain itchy.Everyone knew that a C grade was \u201caverage\u201d, and that C\u2019s were common, and A\u2019s and F\u2019s were rare. That should then mean that the Normal Distribution Curve was being supported as a pedagogical concept. But something didn\u2019t seem right.  I figured that \u201cmental itch\u201d feeling meant there was something wrong with my understanding; after all, it was obvious that I had major problems with calculations.In later years I studied statistics, and learned that not every data set would follow a normal distribution curve.  Some of them followed asymmetric curves with their central tendencies over to one side or the other, some of them were two-humped (the Bactrian camels of statistics), and some data sets didn\u2019t make any particular sort of curve at all.  I also learned about statistical circular arguments, whereby creating a measurement algorithm that would result in survey scores with a normal distribution curve did not prove that a population set naturally fell into such a curve \u2014 the curve was simply an artifice of the algorithm.I have since learned that the \u201cmental itch\u201d feeling does not necessarily mean I am being stupid; more often it means that something else is Not Right.Weird things happen when people try to force students\u2019 grade into the curve.  It\u2019s not that the scores cannot fall into a curve.  Rather, it\u2019s that people try to use curves when they shouldn\u2019t.With the standard grading scheme, a student has to achieve a certain percentage to be considered as having mastered whatever was being assessed.  (Whether or not that assessment accurately reflects the learning objectives is a whole \u2018nother story.)  But if we instead impose the normal distribution curve to sort out the A, B, C, D and F grades, we then say that the top grades are A\u2019s, the bottom grades are F\u2019s, and the median (and frequently mode) grades are C\u2019s.  There are a couple of problem with this.  Firstly, it requires that some students get bad grades.  Secondly, the distribution of letter grades from the curve does not guarantee that the students are succeeding in meeting the required competencies.In addition to the problems that can be created by imposing curves, we have an essential problem in assuming that grades should even result in a normal distribution curve.  There\u2019s that algorithmic artifice issue, where exams can be created that will (when given to a large number of students) result in a grade distribution that creates a normal curve.  This is the rationale for the argument for using grade curves.  But it\u2019s a circular argument, because not all assessment methods will yield such score scatters, and they should not have the normal distribution curve imposed upon them.Furthermore, we have to ask ourselves if demanding a normal distribution curve really reflects our educational goals.  Do we really want to have certain percentages of students getting bad or mediocre grades?  When we ask individual teachers what they want for their students, none of them say that they want lots of average students, a few really good ones, and a few really poor ones.  When we read the mission statements for school districts, we find that every district has Lake Wobegon dreams, where they want all their students to be \u201cabove average\u201d.Another concern people have is with \u201cgrade inflation\u201d.  Because of the pedagogical bias or expectation that grades \u201cshould\u201d fall into that fabulous normal distribution curve, when we get lots of students getting B\u2019s and A\u2019s (and hardly, if any, getting D\u2019s and F\u2019s), then people start fretting that something is terribly wrong.  Why, there must be grade inflation going on.  Obviously, if so many students are getting good grades, then that must mean that the work is too easy!On the other hand, if most of our students are not only passing tests and courses, but are even doing very well, maybe that just means that the teachers and students are both succeeding in their educational goals. Don\u2019t we want all of our students to pass subjects and succeed?  Education is not a zero-sum game, where every winner must be accompanied by a loser.  Likewise, if most of the students are doing very poorly, it does not necessarily mean the students are just lazy or stupid.", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Wobegon_effect"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/thrown-a-curve/", "title": "Thrown a curve"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t5 April 2008", "body": "No, \u201cbuzz off\u201d does not mean that I am being grumpy and telling everyone to Go Away. There are apparently a lot of other people out there who are grumpy about Mosquitos, but not the insect kind.  The story (like most) gets complex very fast.So. There are some young people who hang out in front of shops or public areas and are annoying, even to the point of committing misdemeanors.  This is hardly a new problem of urban settings; doubtless ancient Greek and Roman shopkeepers complained about much the same thing.  In addition to the primary problems of what the yobbos / chavs / hooligans (pick your fave term) may engage in, there\u2019s the secondary problem of their presence intimidating customers and driving away trade.Of course, not all young people act like this.  In fact, very, very few do.  And young people, like people of other age groups, like to get together with their pals and socialise.  Of course, when you\u2019re young you don\u2019t have your own place, and not everyone wants to hang around the living room where dad\u2019s watching Top Gear or yet another history programme about some war or another.  So kids hang around in parks, on sidewalks, in malls, and other public areas.  And then people complain because shockingly, there are kids hanging around. Well, duh; few can afford to spend lots of cash at movie theatres or pool halls or video game parlors, and if you\u2019re not spending, they don\u2019t want you there.Back in 2005, Howard Stapleton realised that he could use teens\u2019 better hearing against them.  In theory, young people can hear up to 20 kHz (20,000 Hertz), but as people age they lose this ability due to presbycusis.  Although most older adults can pass a basic hearing exam with flying colors, such exams only test up to 8,000 Hz, because audiologists are concerned with how well people perceive common speech and environmental sounds. (This concept also assumes that those targeted have not had any hearing loss due to listening to loud music in vehicles, headphones, and / or concerts.)  Thus, the Mosquito device was born.According to a distributor\u2019s description, these speakers broadcast a 17.5-18.5 kHz tone at 75 decibels. Although not damaging, the whine becomes very annoying after a couple of minutes, and those who can hear it usually leave after a few minutes, although the unit runs for 20 minutes before shutting off.  It can be heard 15 meters / 50 feet away, with stronger models audible as far as 90 meters / 300 feet away.The Mosquito device proved popular with a number of shopkeepers and other business owners; some 3500 units have been installed around the UK, to prevent young people from congregating outside of stores, rail stations, car parks, industrial areas, city parks, and even school grounds (used after hours).  Now it\u2019s being sold in the U.S. and Canada as well.Naturally, there were protests about the use of the devices.  The prototype was banned in its place of inception, Newport, South Wales.  Although legal elsewhere, other groups have taken up complaint, and not just young people:Scotland\u2019s Commissioner for Children and Young People, Children in Scotland, and the Scottish Youth Parliament fully support the campaign launched today in England against the use of the Mosquito device.So too is Liberty, the National Youth Agency, the Children\u2019s Commissioner for England, which is spearheading the Buzz Off campaign.Frankly, I find the whole idea of using sonic deterrents as weapons (attack devices) against young people to be abhorrent.  These things target and punish all young people present for the actions of a few.  You get what you give, so how is being deliberately obnoxious supposed to encourage better social behavior in others?  We don\u2019t like it when people go around playing their music too loud, so why is it okay to broadcast high-pitched whines that are meant to get on people\u2019s nerves?Furthermore, the manufacturers and users assume that only young people can hear these sounds, and that simply isn\u2019t true.  I\u2019m 47 and I can hear such frequencies (despite the tinnitus), and a 75 kHz noise is also pretty damn loud, even if it\u2019s not technically at the damaging threshold.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t9 April 2008", "body": "Look at all those honeybees, buzzing around the hive!  One of them is named Kathleen. (Can you tell them apart?  I sure can\u2019t \u2014 they\u2019re all sisters.) So where\u2019s Kathleen? \u201cYoo-hoo!  Which one of you is Kathleen?\u201d\u201cI am Kathleen!\u201d\u201cI am Kathleen!\u201d\u201cI am Kathleen!\u201d\u201cI am Kathleen!\u201dExpect to see a lot of blogging bees styling themselves as Kathleen, a la \u201cI am Spartacus.\u201d (Or check out the LOLcat by DKMNOW.)Due to scholastic issues, I am late making this post.  If you\u2019ve not already heard, a blogger, Kathleen Seidel of the Neurodiversity.com weblog, was recently served with a subpoena by a lawyer in a current case.  Kathleen has long blogged about the lack of scientific credibility of the vaccines-cause-autism idea, and the court case deals with such. As a citizen-journalist, Kathleen has commented upon this case and others like it, and her posts are copiously annotated with the supporting references from public domain documents. Other bloggers with legal backgrounds have commented that this kind of legal action seems to fall into the category of a \u201cSLAPP\u201d, Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation:This form of litigation is frequently filed by organizations or individuals to intimidate and silence critics or opponents by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense so that they abandon their criticism or opposition.Walter Olson of the Overlawyered blog calls the subpoena a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d.  Not only are the demands in the document incredibly broad and laboriously demanding, they are simply irrelevant to the case.  Kathleen asserts that she is not involved in the case, and she does not have any special information relevant to the case.As she stated in her reply (a \u201cmotion to quash\u201d),9. The subpoena commands production of \u201call documents pertaining to the setup, financing, running, research, maintaining the website http://www.neurodiversity.com&#8221; \u2013 including but not limited to material mentioning the plaintiffs \u2013 and the names of all persons \u201chelping, paying or facilitating in any fashion\u201d my endeavors. The subpoena demands bank statements, cancelled checks, donation records, tax returns, Freedom of Information Act requests, LexisNexis\u00ae and PACER usage records. The subpoena demands copies of all of my communications concerning any issue which is included on my website, including communications with representatives of the federal government, the pharmaceutical industry, advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations, political action groups, profit or non-profit entities, journals, editorial boards, scientific boards, academic boards, medical licensing boards, any \u201creligious groups (Muslim or otherwise), or individuals with religious affiliations,\u201d and any other \u201cconcerned individuals.\u201d\u202615 \u2026  Plaintiffs and their counsel seek not only to rummage through records that they suspect pertain to themselves, but also through my family\u2019s bank records, tax returns, autism-related medical and educational records, and every communication concerning all of the issues to which I have devoted my attention and energy in recent years.This is an incredible amount of documentation.  Who would even keep all of these kinds of records?   Many sorts of library searches do not give you \u201creceipts\u201d. And, as originally cited in the subpoena, what sort of search engine is \u201cLexus Nexus\u201d, an automotive dealership? They probably mean LexisNexis(R), as Kathleen properly refers to it. (Spelling error or Freudian Slip?)  And what\u2019s with the \u201creligious groups (Muslim or otherwise)\u201d?  Her religious affiliations (or lack thereof) have no bearing on the lawsuit.The subpoena itself lists in those requested documents, \u201cwritten or verbal communications\u201d between her and a very, very long list of people or groups, which reading through is quite quickly apparent simply her blogroll, meaning all the 100+ blogs that she has links to on her sidebar.  Mine is one of that large number, probably because my blog is listed in the Autism Hub feed.  Mind you, I have never even mentioned anything about this particular court case on my blog.So, disclosures:   I have no special information about this court case, and I don\u2019t even know any of the people involved.  I don\u2019t even know Kathleen personally, and have never met her. I do not work for her or for Neurodiversity.com, and have never even been to New Hampshire. I\u2019ve probably made a few comments on her blog, as I\u2019ve made comments on all sorts of blogs across the World Wide Web, but her blog is not listed on my blogroll.  I do have a family member diagnosed with an ASD.  I work in school settings with students who have various educational needs, including ASDs. I do not work for a law company, for a pharmaceutical company, or for a medical company.Asking Kathleen for the least crumb of communication between herself and the numbers of people mentioned simply because they are on her blogroll is absolutly nutz.  Can you imagine how many endless pages of paper all those requested documents would be?  (What if you printed out every e-mail you had ever sent or received?  Do you keep every e-mail you have ever sent or received?  Neither do I.)The responses to this action in the blogosphere have been incredible; big names like Pharyngula, Orac, and Steven Novella have taken time to comment upon action. Liz from I Speak of Dreams is keeping a running list.  I too think the legal action is absurd.One bee from the hive stops to turn over.  Instead of being able to look at the viewer, she is displaying her underside, and we have a great shot of a bee\u2019s ventral abdomen, essentially her rear end.

Being able to generalise concepts across different circumstances is sometimes challenging for our autistic/Asperger\u2019s children, and one can\u2019t develop that if they are always being told what to do.If parents and teachers are finding that their children and students are being \u201clittle lawyers\u201d, then they should seek to find what in the system is making everyone so anxious that every decision needs questioning.\u00a0 Because in truth, it is the system that is being questioned, more so than the authority!\u00a0 Re-asserting one\u2019s authority doesn\u2019t resolve that, it just adds more friction.We want a system that enables us to create plans for co\u00f6perating with and helping others, rather than focusing on punishments and rewards.\u00a0 The problem with relying upon punishments and rewards is that they don\u2019t help create the respect, responsibility and relationships for creating community that are our ultimate goals.People who are heavily invested in punishment and reward systems, invested ego-wise, security-wise, and/or financially-wise (such as the JRC), will try to assert that not using the punishment and rewards to control behaviour will result in gross misbehaviour and chaos.\u00a0 This is a false dilemma; there are other ways of teaching our children.When you\u2019re hostile and suspicious, everything looks like dissent, everything looks like challenge, and everything looks like rebellion.Even saying, \u201cHello\u201d.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=374"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/07/01/being-unruly/", "title": "Being Unruly"},

I\u2019m smart, you\u2019re dumb.  I\u2019m big, you\u2019re little.  And there\u2019s nothing you can do about it!\u201d\nTo make sense of something, to understand how it works, what is significant about it in your own experience, in short, to create a meaningful gestalt, requires that one be able to manipulate it physically, to stretch it, pull it, push it, turn it upside-down, use it in different ways and then compare and contrast the results.  This is the active process of learning.Making sense of the social world and its often unstated rules requires that one be able to do original research in the nature of it, just as one does with the physics of the universe.  The problem however, especially for our autistic/Asperger\u2019s students, is that the social world is not nearly so consistent as is the physical world or the digital world.  You mess around with mechanical objects or video games, and the responses will consistently fall within the same parameters.  Likewise, the ecology of the biological world is more complex, but still rather straightforward.However, human social systems are rife with \u201cfuzzy logic\u201d.  The social sciences are seen as comparatively \u201csoft\u201d sciences because sorting out the variables and interpreting the results is so damn tricky.  Given such complexity and unpredictability, it\u2019s no wonder that autistics, whose social radar is less acute, often prefer to stick with the natural sciences, or view themselves as researchers of human beings.People not only need worlds that they can make sense of; they also need worlds that meet their needs.  The needs of children and students are somewhat different than those of adults.  They are still very much in the process of building understandings of the social world and of their places in them.  They need to be able to create systems that are functional and adaptable, and they need to find a place in society that allows them to continue to grow as individuals, that draws upon their personal strengths and works with their individual weaknesses, and that respects the parts they will have to play throughout their lives.Rigid, unyielding rules systems built upon the premise that the child or student is a bad person, who needs to be controlled, and always told what to do, cannot effectively provide that.There\u2019s a kind of physics in social relationships:  push on someone, and they will push back with that familiar \u201cequal and opposite reaction\u201d.  No one likes feeling controlled, like a helpless pawn in some chess game.  Everyone wants to feel that they have some measure of say and control in how they get their needs met \u2013 this is what empowerment and respect is about.Empowering others is scary for some people because it requires relinquishing some of their control.  Or rather, empowering others is about giving them opportunity, the right tools, and letting them have responsibility. The whole crazy part about the current scenario at the JRC is the people in control complain that they \u201chave\u201d to use force (pain and other punishments and rewards) because the students would otherwise be irresponsible.This isn\u2019t about a child \u201ctesting authority\u201d as feared by disciplinarians; it\u2019s about the student being able to try things out, practice, reflect, discuss, acquire new skills, and practice some more.  Being given absolute rules circumvents the learning process, and later when they need to adapt to novel situations, leaves the learner in the lurch, stranded without the knowledge of how to devise new strategies.  They only have a limited number of tools in their social toolbox, and little knowledge of how to build new kinds of tools.  If we go telling children what to do for their entire lives, then we shouldn\u2019t wonder that they become young adults without the ability to think for themselves and to be responsible without someone monitoring their actions.How do children learn to be responsible?  It takes practice.  If you want people to know how to be inner-directed, moral, responsible people, then they need the opportunities to learn how, and they need adults to share their wisdom and their power and to help them along the way.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/07/02/making-sense-of-rules/", "title": "Making Sense of\u00a0Rules"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t4 July 2006 ", "body": "This seems like an especially apropos subject to blog about; I am after all, a horticulturalist and also work with children who have developmental disabilities, some of whom are autistic/Asperger\u2019s. As a freelance writer with degrees in science, my goal is to provide useful information to the public that is unbiased, based on good research science, and is not created to promote commercial products. In the classes I teach, the articles I write and the conversations I have with others in my community, I am constantly working to correct the misinformation given by the likes of J. Baker, who flog books full of quackery, self-promotional videos and broadcast programming, and present pseudoscience as special, secret knowledge that only they have access to because the \u201cexperts\u201d don\u2019t want the public to know. More details deconstructing this kind of bunk are on this page.I really, really don\u2019t like inauthentic stuff. I like fields with real grass, and floors with real carpeting. Astroturf and indoor-outdoor carpeting rub me the wrong way, even when I have my shoes on. More inauthenticity includes advertising, propaganda and campaigning presented as vox populi.  (Sorry, I guess the word \u201cpropaganda\u201d in that list is a redundancy.)  \u201cAdvertorials\u201d and \u201castroturf\u201d efforts exasperate me.When used outside of sports arenas, the term \u201castroturf\u201d refers to faux grass-roots efforts. These activities are meant to seem like they come from the general populace, when in fact they are really self-promotional campaigns sponsored and instigated by businesses. The purpose of astroturfing is to spread a commercial meme, sliding it under people\u2019s advertising radar by presenting it as originating from other ordinary people, rather than from its true source.Real grass-roots efforts (as organizers everywhere will attest) are nearly always blessed with thin wallets but loads of volunteers. In contrast, astroturf efforts frequently have plenty of funding to support a small but carefully-led group of workers. The whole \u201cautism is vaccine induced / mercury poisoning and we need to cure our stricken children with X, Y and / or Z treatment\u201d crowd is a prime example of small-time astroturfing by the various quacks who are selling purported \u201ccures\u201d. Some of the workers in this whole fiasco are journalists / media people and medical personnel, who end up adding their skills and patina of respectability.In an effort to \u201cget the word out\u201d, the workers are advised how to get the attention of unwitting television reporters to and create the angst-ridden, \u201csmall person vs big bad government / organization\u201d newsbites that will sell airtime for broadcasting companies; are given sample letters to send to the local newspaper editors; and are provided with Web boards that purport to be helpful consumer sites and support groups for concerned families sharing information, but are also fronts for promoting commercial enterprises, e.g. quack \u201ccures\u201d and dubious treatments.The insidious problem with stealth astroturf is that the people involved don\u2019t realize they\u2019re being duped. Full of earnest, well-intended zeal for spreading the gospel, these followers are very convincing and energetic, in ways that ordinary paid employees wouldn\u2019t be.Now, those Web sites can contain a lot of useful advice and emotional support between ordinary people posting there. But some of those members will find the boards are also bastions of groupthink, enforced by a booster club of the vociferous few who create an atmosphere that is hostile to disagreement. The zealous may also go beyond the bounds of their own personal expertise and become self-appointment experts simply by dint of experience rather than by professional expertise.It gets worse. Beyond promoting commercial products and services, astroturfing seeks to champion not just the social but also the legal necessity. This requires selling the whole system of ideas to the mass-market culture as the beneficial and inevitable solution to what is actually an artificial need for a non-solution to a nonexistent problem. Therefore we have \u201cautism epidemics\u201d resulting from \u201cpoisoned\u201d children, or those who assert that ABA is a \u201cmedically necessary\u201d treatment for \u201cafflicted\u201d children.The ordinary citizen or government official doesn\u2019t understand the scientific or educational issues, and doesn\u2019t have the time to educate themselves to a level necessary to be able to critically analyse the claims. When faced with the inevitable scientific debunking of either the problem or the solutions being sold to address them, these quacks find that they must fend off potential legal actions by expanding into pre-emptive   damage-control: (emphasis mine)As WKA Communications stated in a brochure distributed at Key West, \u201cWe\u2019d Rather Guard the Border Than Fight the War.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t keep an ear to the ground, or ignore what you hear, the results aren\u2019t pretty,\u201d the brochure states. \u201cIn terms of time, energy and cost, the difference between early-stage issues management and late-stage crisis management is the difference between guarding a border and fighting a war. It\u2019s easier and less expensive to influence an outcome before the government has written the law or regulation.\u201cIn these cases, the question parents, educators, therapists and government officials must ask themselves is, \u201cWhat is being sold here, and who ultimately benefits?\u201d", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Astroturf", "http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/antivaccination_warriors_vs_re.php", "http://www.sentex.net/~nexus23/naa_aba.html", "http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Grassroots_PR_Activists_Swap_War_Stories"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/07/04/weeding-out-the-astroturf/", "title": "Weeding Out The\u00a0Astroturf"},

Those odd people don\u2019t fit the neat cogs of traditional social machinery, and society has had to invent new mechanisms to \u201cdeal with\u201d the misfits and to isolate them from the social workings.Thus for example, we get \u201cspecial education\u201d programs to make up for the fact that the current educational system doesn\u2019t work all that well.

This happens indirectly by illustrating how the social machinery is lacking. Furthermore, the social machinery is often lacking for a lot of people, not just those for whom it\u2019s such a poor fit as to be outright unusable.This informing also happens directly by the communications we get from all the misfits.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 July 2006 ", "body": "The favor of your reply is requested.The other year when I was giving the annual Inservice training to the other university tutors, I asked them how many had flunked a test or a class. Only one person of the dozen-plus raised his hand, and he too had some kind of learning disability/difference. I was amazed, and thought to myself, Is life really this smooth for everyone else?All the other tutors were there as tutors because they really knew their stuff, they were good at it, and it was easy for them. None of the others knew the panic of not being able to do something today that they were able to do a few days ago, or not being able to retrieve knowledge they knew, or not understanding test questions correctly (and thus providing the wrong sorts of answers). Hardly anyone knew what it felt like to fail, and how crushing it was to work very hard, yet still not achieve.I also had a classmate in a College Teaching course who worked as a Teaching Assistant, and who confessed that she got really impatient and annoyed with students who had trouble in the subject; it was easy for her, and she couldn\u2019t understand how it wouldn\u2019t be for anyone else! Oy.Of course, for tutors they want people who have a good command of the concepts and details of a subject, and who can communicate those well. But they also need people who are able to be flexible in how they explain things, and who are empathetic with their tutees.Sometimes the tutees seem unprepared. But we have to assume the tutee wants to improve; why else would either person be there? Asking the tutee, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you prepared? Don\u2019t you want to get better at this?\u201d is patronizing. It\u2019s easy to mis-attribute the lack of progress to laziness or similar moral failing.Tutees may be \u201cunprepared\u201d because they have gotten \u201cstuck\u201d at some fundamental level. For instance, they may have not completed the assigned reading because they are not understanding terms, or there are different definitions of familiar words that are specific to the particular discipline, so the text makes no sense even thought they \u201cknow\u201d the terms in some other context.Oft times our students cannot pinpoint just where in the process they are having problems. These are the students who will swear up and down that they are doing everything the right way, but aren\u2019t getting the results that are supposed to happen. Insisting that the student merely needs to \u201ctry harder\u201d is profoundly unhelpful. It\u2019s not a question of how hard one is working, but rather how one is working.Some of those students are the ones who are really smart and have mostly skated through primary and secondary school on sheer intelligence, and who have not developed many study skills. Or, they may be trying to use the wrong study methods because they\u2019ve been told that they are \u201csupposed to\u201d study with flashcards, even though they don\u2019t really learn well with that method. Many students need help developing new organizational or planning approaches to handle the greater or more complex work loads.They may also have processing difficulties that are not readily apparent. For example, a student may spend so much of their cognitive energies listening to a lecture, remaining focused despite distractions, understanding the auditory input, and/or making sense of the concepts as they are presented, that they are unable to retain the information in their long-term memory, or to be able to simultaneously take effective notes. Despite having attended very carefully, later on they will not be able to explain what the lecture was about, or have useful notes to refer to. But this lack of \u201cresults\u201d isn\u2019t from a lack of effort; indeed, that student may be working twice as hard as their peers.This is profoundly frustrating, and at this point the students either turn the frustration inwards and consider themselves failures because they are stupid at a subject, or else turn it outwards and insist the teachers are making things impossible just to flunk some of the students, or that the subject itself is useless. In cases like these, the student needs help figuring out how they learn best, and how they can advocate for themselves to have access to the material in a way that works best with their individual learning style, and thus be able to work with their strengths.Differences in learning styles is hardly a novel concept, yet there are instructors, those professors, graduate teaching assistants and tutors, for whom this idea is mostly theoretical. The professor who is an auditory, sequential learner and who did well during their own school days when taught by the lecture method, will likely just lecture to their own classes. To them it\u2019s a \u201cnatural\u201d way of teaching and learning. Obviously there are students who are \u201csmart\u201d enough to \u201cget\u201d the content this way. It\u2019s \u201cproven\u201d because it\u2019s traditional. Writing a few key terms on the board and projecting an illustration or two in an hour\u2019s monologue seems like sufficient effort for visual learners. Once again, the instructors are so personally successful that they can\u2019t truly understand why others aren\u2019t.Students get tutoring because they are unable to learn subjects the way the subjects are taught, or because they have great difficulty doing so. They seek out tutors because they want to do better, not because they are lazy. Each of us has different tasks that find easy or difficult, and it behooves us to remember that these are different for each person.At this point, I\u2019d like to be able to explore this dilemma with other members of the blogosphere, so we can all improve our understanding. My question to you is:What sorts of teaching and learning methods work best for you, and what kinds of situations have you found that particularly hindered your ability to learn?

Integrative Diagnostics focuses on listening to that information.

Integrative Manual Therapy practitioners utilize advanced yet gentle palpation techniques to \u201clisten\u201d with their hands to all of these rhythms.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t8 July 2006", "body": "Are there really more males than females with autism/Asperger\u2019s and AD/HD?Reading the diagnostic literature, one finds references to the \u201cfact\u201d that there are more autistic boys than girls. There certainly seem to be more hyperactive, inattentive boys diagnosed (and consequently treated with medication) than there are girls.Curiously, when one reads through bulletin board sites for autistics/Asperger\u2019s, there seems to be a pretty evenly balanced gender ratio (as far as one can discern from screen names or profiles). Looking at the \u201cautiebiographies\u201d available, the male to female author ratio is fairly even. However, such reviews are not necessarily going to be a representative sampling of a population. Publishing houses require authors to be able to present novel perspectives (pardon the pun), to have good written verbal skills, and may try to present a balance of authors. A bulletin board is naturally self-selecting for individuals who have computer access, a comfortable grasp on the language used, a willingness to identify one\u2019s self as belonging there, plus just as importantly, an interest in socializing through Web media. The first two factors are universal requirements for access, but the last one is distinctive for a different reason.Females are generally perceived by society as being more socially -oriented than are males, or more interested in people than in things, hence the \u201cMen are from Mars, Women are from Venus\u201d analogy or Dr. Simon Baron-Cohen\u2019s recent writings on male/female differences. They are also perceived as having higher verbal skills than do males, or at least girls develop higher levels of verbal skills at younger ages than do boys. There is the possibility that even if women are outnumbered in these populations, they are more likely to crave socialization and be more adept at, or feel more comfortable with, socializing through the written medium of a Web board. But does the sex ratio evinced reflect this self-selection, or is it a good sampling and therefore indicative of the overall population?Currently more males than females are diagnosed with autism and AD/HD, at a general rate of around 4:1. The causes of autism are proving to be complex; autism is not a single, simple thing, but varies in collative properties by individual. Thus far it is indicated to be polygenic and also affected by factors in embryonic development as well, as twins do not even develop similarly. It would not surprise anyone to find that males are more likely to be autistic; the susceptibility derived from only having one X chromosome is seen in a variety of genetic factors.These off-repeated ratios are likely not true prevalence rates, but rather reflects diagnostic rates. Both autism and AD/HD are diagnosed by sets of behaviours that differ from the norm, and thus attract attention of those people who would make initial remarks (parents, teachers) leading to those individuals being brought to the attention of those who would make final assessments (p\u00e6diatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists).Females often do not \u201cpresent\u201d in the same manner that males do. This is rather a reflection of the fact that the diagnostic criteria were based more upon behaviour of males from the sample populations than upon a gender-balanced population samples. Currently the psych field is abuzz with discussion that girls are being missed for ADD diagnoses because they present more in the Inattentive qualities. The quiet, daydreaming girl staring out the window is not a problem for her school teacher, so there is less concern about her erratic scholastic achievements. (After all, maybe it\u2019s just a \u201cblonde thing\u201d /sarcasm.)Part of autism is inherent in the \u201cwiring\u201d of the human brain, and part of autism is a social construct. That Kanner and Asperger both met with unusual children who gave them the impetus to dually conceive of the concept of autism at the same time in history, may have more to do with the fact that a public awareness of psychology, the development of social and scholastic statistical norms that created specific definition of abnormal, plus the evolving field of child psychology, more than any sudden incidence of autistics.Likewise the concept of \u201cminimal brain dysfunction\u201d that has evolved to its current status of AD/HD reflects changing understanding, including distinctions between hyperactive, inattentive and combined forms. As mentioned, a hyperactive boy is simply more noticeable in a classroom setting than is a daydreaming girl, although they may have very similar difficulties with their school work, personal and social lives, and ultimately their adult worlds of work.Amazingly, kids with AD/HD grow up to be adults with AD/HD, although the problems of the adult can be less \u201cnoticeable\u201d because adults can develop coping mechanisms (including the acquisition of helpful spouses who eventually become very frustrated if no one realises what\u2019s really going on). Likewise, the addition of Asperger\u2019s to the DSM and ICD criteria reflects a greater understanding of the breadth of autistic expression, and the number of adults that would now qualify for an AS diagnosis is far greater than those who actually have such a diagnosis, simply because it was not available as a diagnosis during the school years when such things are often diagnosed. The lack of available diagnoses is not the same thing as the lack of diagnosable individuals existing.Just as autistics sometimes face the gross error of being misdiagnosed with schizophrenia, mental retardation or other disorders, females face the similar problem of being misdiagnosed with personality disorders. The complementary dilemma to Misdiagnoses are the Missed Diagnoses, those girls and women who continue to struggle through life never understanding why they feel so different and why they find many things difficult. For these people the secondary problems with relationships, schooling and work result in lifelong stress and all too frequently in depression.To better understand how autism or AD/HD affects the abilities of females, we need to better understand how to recognize them and to be able to see those cues when they are expressed in girls and women.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/07/08/where-are-all-of-us/", "title": "Where Are All of\u00a0Us?"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t14 July 2006 ", "body": "People whine about how hard it is to have an autistic child, or any kind of exceptional child. All too often there are terrible news reports about parents who have killed their handicapped or autistic children because they were such a horrid burden. Even more horrifying is when the press perspective or quotes are full of sympathy for the murderer because killing your own child is \u201cunderstandable\u201d because a person can\u2019t help but be insanely stressed from dealing with the child\u2019s abnormality. Excuse me; that should be the alleged murderers; trials haven\u2019t happened yet for several of these cases.Holy shit! Parenting is hard. Period. Yeah, there are bad days. Some days you feel like you\u2019ll never get to eat your food at the proper temperature, or go potty or take a shower uninterrupted, or sleep through the night. Some days you feel like you\u2019ll never finish the endless assessments, or learning more about the alphabet soup of ADHD, APD, ASD, TS, DSM, IEP, or attending special school meetings. Some days you feel like you\u2019ll never get through the little chats with the police officer on your doorstep, or the hormonal teenager angst, or the getting homework done and turned in so the grades reflect a little of the smarts behind the scholastic ennui.Amazingly, this is true regardless of what sorts of kids you end up with.It\u2019s true that there are some problems with autistic children that one doesn\u2019t have as often with neurotypical children. There are also problems with NT children that one doesn\u2019t often have with ASD children (when was the last time you read a blog by a parent sighing over how their autistic kid wanted to invite two dozen kids for a birthday party at Chuckie Cheez followed by a sleepover?) Different is not worse.Aspie kid was a \u201crunner\u201d as a toddler. With my faceblindness I have great difficulty finding people in crowds; tracking down a small child that has bolted into the mobs of people at a mall would have been dangerously slow. Thankfully my other kid was four years older and could help me. I ended up having the tot in one of those child-harness & leash setups when we went shopping. People would give me dirty looks because I was a \u201chorrid mommy who put their kid on a leash\u201d. Frankly, I was a concerned mommy who wanted to keep her kid safe, because this child was fast, strong and inclined to dash off when intrigued by something.There were also meltdowns, which being unaware of autism at the time, were to me simply \u201cbeing too tired\u201d and/or \u201chaving a tantrum\u201d. So I ended up figuring out what the triggers usually were, and finding ways of circumventing those. We also learned how to calm down, and how to recognise when things were starting to get to be Too Much. I also learned the fine art of calmly saying, \u201cHaving a temper tantrum is not going to make me change my mind. When you calm down, then we will shop some more.\u201d (I used a lot of If-Then and When-Then constructs when dealing with my toddlers; they could understand the binary constructs, and it helped them make sense of cause and effect.) Of course, passers-by would want to intervene and try to comfort/appease the child or chastise me for having a crying, floor-kicking kid on the grocery aisle floor. I also acquired the other fine art of smiling, nodding, and reassuring them, \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay in a minute or two.\u201dThis child also had/has distinct clothing and food preferences. Some relatives called this \u201cpicky\u201d. I thought of it as merely having \u2026 preferences. I like my clothes or my food a certain way; why wouldn\u2019t anyone else?Sure everything was all about orcas when younger. Sure made gift-giving easy. Now it\u2019s videogames (shocking, I know). Sure makes gift-giving easy. (Unlike dad, who has neither perseverations nor any particular hobbies; is that just so weird, or what?!)Different is not worse. It\u2019s just different. Rearing children is going to do major things to your daily life structure, your bank account, your living room furniture, your social life, and so on. That\u2019s real life. Whining because your life isn\u2019t going the way you thought it was going to, or like some kind of posed ideal family scenario from a greeting card, is simply whining.Meanwhile, learn how to have fun with your children. Figure out how they learn, as unique individuals. Experience how they share their thoughts and feelings, as unique individuals. Take photographs, collect stories about funny family moments, and build up that group identity of \u201cthis is the sort of stuff that makes our family because we\u2019re all part of it\u201d.DON\u2019T EVER wait until \u201cthings get back to normal\u201d or \u201cwhen this is all over\u201d to do anything. There is no \u201cnormal\u201d. This is it. This is life. Fun is something you make, not something that happens to you. Families is who you are, not something you wish would be.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 July 2006 ", "body": "(It\u2019s been a long, long day.  So here\u2019s an only-slightly-used, gently-recycled essay, but with an Brand New! hyperlink for your enjoyment.  Bon app\u00e9tit!)\u201cIt has been said that man is a rational animal. All my life I have been searching for evidence which could support this.\u201d\n~ Bertrand RussellHere\u2019s our new word for the day: pareidolia. It comes from the Greek, para = almost and eidos = form. The word itself originates in psychology, and refers to that cognitive process that results in people seeing images (often faces) that aren\u2019t really there: the man or rabbit in the moon, canals or face on Mars, faces of holy people in tortillas or stains in plaster \u2026 It also sometimes refers to hearing things that aren\u2019t really there in random background noise (Electronic Voice Phenomena: EVP). Pareidolia is what makes Rorschach inkblot tests possible (attribution errors are what make Rorschach tests fairly unreliable).The human brain is \u201cwired\u201d to see patterns, especially those of faces. Creating and perceiving patterns is what allows all animals to operate more efficiently in their environments. You need to be able to quickly find your food sources, your mates, your offspring, and the predators in the busy matrices of sensory inputs. Camouflage relies upon being able to become part of a pattern, and therefore less recognizable. Aposematic warning coloration, such as black and yellow wasps, does the reverse, by creating a specific kind of pattern that stands out.Sometimes people subconsciously assign patterns and meanings to things, even though they don\u2019t intend to do so. This is why we have double-blind studies, so the people who are collecting the data don\u2019t unconsciously assign results to the treatment replications by increasing or suppressing or noticing effects in some trial subjects. Prometheus has a lovely blogpost about this: The Seven Most Common Thinking Errors of Highly Amusing Quacks and Pseudoscientists (Part 3).  (This series of his just gets better and better!)Seeing patterns can lead to weird cognitive biases and fallacies, like the clustering illusion, where meanings are falsely assigned to chunks of information. The fact is that clusters or strings or short repeats of things will naturally happen in random spatial or temporal collections of objects or events. A lot of people think that \u201crandom\u201d means these won\u2019t happen (which makes assigning correct answers for multiple choice tests an interesting process; students get suspicious if they notice too much of a pattern and then start out-guessing their correct answers to either fit or break the perceived pattern).Sometimes the reverse can happen, where instead of seeing patterns in data, people put some of the data into patterns. This is known as the Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy: a cowboy randomly riddles the side of a barn with bullets, and then draws a target where there is a cluster of bullet holes. People will perceive a pattern of events, and then assume that there is a common causal factor to those, because of the perceived pattern. This is why statistics was invented \u2013 to suss out if there is a pattern, and how likely it is. Mathematics takes the cognitive kinks out of the data so the analysis is objective, rather than subjective.Statistics also gives research rules about how best to proceed in experiments, to avoid various errors. One of those is deciding what kinds of analyses will be used for the type of data set that is produced by the experimental design. Note that this is decided beforehand! The reason for that is because people want to see patterns, and (even unconsciously) researchers want to see results. The purpose of testing for a null hypothesis is to try to disprove the given hypothesis, to avoid these kinds of issues.It doesn\u2019t matter how noble your intentions are \u2013 wrong results are still wrong results, no matter how they are achieved, or to what purpose.To look at the data and then start picking through it for patterns, (\u201cmassaging the data\u201d or \u201cdatamining\u201d) is inappropriate for these very reasons. The greatest problem with doing analyses retroactively is that one can end up fitting the data to their pet theory, rather than testing the theory with the data. Mark Chu-Carroll\u2019s post on the Geiers\u2019 crappy and self-serving data \u201canalysis\u201d is an elegant dissection of how this kind of gross error is done.  (Note that is MCC\u2019s old blog address; his current blog is here at ScienceBlogs.)Doing this intentionally is not only bad statistics, it\u2019s bad science as well. The results come from anecdotes or data sets that are incomplete or obtained inaccurately. Correlations that may or may not exist are seen as having a common causality that also may or may not exist. It\u2019s pick-and-choose and drawing erroneous, unsupported conclusions. People want to see patterns, and do. Even worse, they create patterns and results.The seriously bad thing is that con artists and purveyors of various kinds of pseudoscience do this a lot. The intent is to deceive or mislead in order to sell something (ideas or objects or methods).The people who then buy into these things then think they are seeing treatment results because they want to see them. Take this secret herbal cold medication, and your cold will be cured in just seven days! (Amazingly, one will get over a cold in a week anyway.) Give your child this treatment and they will be able to learn and develop normally! (Amazingly, children will learn and develop as they get older, for all not everyone follows the same timelines \u2013 developmental charts are population averages.)Meanwhile, the well-intended but scientifically ignorant people who buy into these things are being duped by charlatans, sometimes with loss of life as well as with great monetary expense.Economists will tell you that the cost of something is also what you did/could not buy, and when time and money is spent on false promises, it deprives everyone involved of the opportunity to pursue truly beneficial treatments.Then the problem is propagated because those well-intended but scientifically ignorant people become meme agents, earnestly spreading the false gospel \u2026", "outgoing_links": ["http://photoninthedarkness.blogspot.com/2006/07/seven-most-common-thinking-errors-of_10.html", "http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/index.html#index", "http://goodmath.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-slop-autism-and-mercury.html", "http://www.scienceblogs.com/goodmath/", "http://www.quackwatch.org/index.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/07/10/cognitive-bias-patterns-pseudoscience/", "title": "Cognitive Bias, Patterns &\u00a0Pseudoscience"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 July 2006 ", "body": "Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I\u2019ve not really lost my entire thumb to accident. I merely knicked a bit off the tip with a kitchen knife. But unlike a mere cut where the skin just has to close back together, this is a small concavity that takes a bit longer to fill in. Because it\u2019s on the tip of my thumb, it\u2019s prone to all sorts of ongoing abuse that would prolong the healing process. So, I have one of those plastic caps taped to my thumb to protect it. And of course I can\u2019t really use my thumb for much bandaged like this.So like many other things in my own life I had to develop coping strategies to accommodate this temporary disability. I use my index and middle fingers in a pincer grip for holding small things (hooray for doublejointedness). Shoelaces are really tricky this way, but I\u2019ve always asserted that shoelaces are the work of the devil (I was in 3rd grade before I finally mastered them), so I stick to loafers and sandals whenever possible.Last night I remarked to hubby that my entire life is composed of coping strategies.I have coping strategies to deal with the ADHD forgetfulness, distractedness, and hyperactivity. We have a baker\u2019s rack near the front door for backpacks and shoes. My necessary pocket stuff is emptied onto a special dish at bedtime, and reloaded the next morning when dressing. I set my medicine bottle on my computer keyboard. I write notes to myself (and others) using a dry-erase marker on the bathroom mirror, as one ends up in the bathroom on a regular basis, it doesn\u2019t get lost like scraps of paper, and I can be sure of seeing them when getting up the next morning. I turn off the oven before removing the food. I have an index card in my shirt pocket where I keep my To Do list and ideas to pursue. I set my car keys atop whatever object I need to take with me.I have coping strategies to deal with the Auditory Processing Disorder blips where I can\u2019t understand what someone has said to me, and the resultant overtaxing of my short-term memory that makes recalling verbal instructions and lectures so damn difficult. I watch television with the closed captions (subtitles in English) turned on. I take extensive notes when given verbal instructions. I request emails instead of phone calls, printed meeting agendas, and transcripts.I always have earplugs on hand to turn down the volume a bit in noisy places because of my hyperacussis, and frequently listen to background music to drown out my tinnitus.I have coping strategies to deal with my faceblindness. Like other prosopagnosics, I rely on accessory features of posture, gait, mannerisms, voice, hairstyle and location to identify people. I also rely upon name tags and prompts by family members and others. When we\u2019re in crowds, I instruct people to wave at me so I can find them again.I have coping strategies to deal with my clumsiness (although given the continuous succession of bruises and the number of scars I have, apparently insufficiently adequate ones). For years we did not have a coffee table because I crash into furniture too often. I transfer raw eggs with my hand palm-up to let gravity work for me. I pour liquids with the containers over the sink to make spillage cleanup easier. I keep burn ointment on top of the refrigerator instead of in the bathroom medicine chest because I get burned in the kitchen, not the bathroom. I skid the sole of my foot across the top edge of a staircase to find the first step. I do complex hand-and-foot actions sequentially instead of simultaneously. I wear glasses with metal rather than plastic frames, as they bend instead of break. I wear snug clothing to improve my proprioception so I don\u2019t run into furniture as often.I have coping strategies to deal with my intermittent reading & writing transpositions. Everything has to be proofread. I block off extraneous numeric data with a piece of blank paper so I don\u2019t pick up the wrong number. If I have to write out calculations for students, I ask them to watch me really closely and let me know if I transpose something. (This makes me more human to them, and also makes them watch me like a hawk, thus paying more attention to the lesson!)All these coping strategies mean that on good days I may even be over-compensating for some things. Overcompensation is something I sometimes do well. Spelling was one of my worst subjects; as an adult I became a newspaper proofreader. I had a speech impediment and occasional stuttering that required speech therapy; I\u2019ve recorded books on tape and now I do a lot of public speaking and get return invitations. (I also get queries about my \u201caccent\u201d because when I\u2019m tired I tend to over-enunciate, producing a sort of Received Pronunciation effect.) I have ADHD but for several years of college I lived in two cities and did four jobs while taking classes. I have APD but have been a note-taker for other students, albeit in classes where I already knew most of the material. Adler would be proud.There is however an inherent drawback at being so good at developing coping strategies: because I can more-or-less get by most of the time, people can\u2019t tell that I\u2019m having to work twice as hard to do what I do. So when I\u2019m tired and/or sick or otherwise stressed, I don\u2019t do things as well. To be frank, I do poorly. A lot of my coping abilities lie in the fact that I\u2019ve worked to create enabling environments for myself. Take me out of those (for examples, when on trips, or when starting new jobs), and a lot of my strategies fall apart.Because these are invisible difficulties and disabilities, people don\u2019t understand why I intermittently fail or falter. They can\u2019t understand why an otherwise apparently smart person suddenly does and says apparently stupid things. This means that sometimes people will decide I\u2019m being lazy or rude, or if they don\u2019t know me they will decide that I\u2019m stupid.In the long run, the attribution errors can be the most disabling thing of all.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/07/20/i-miss-my-opposable-thumb/", "title": "I Miss My Opposable\u00a0Thumb"},

Good helping is about making the counselor \u201cunemployed\u201d as it were, of being a temporary resource to the client, rather than a permanent fixture that is necessary to keep a \u201cbroken\u201d person working.Good counseling (Gc) helps the client to determine problems they are facing, and what they need to solve them, and how they can acquire the tools needed to do so.\u00a0 The counselor works with a person, not for them or to them.\u00a0 It\u2019s about respecting the client, and presuming competency on the client\u2019s part, including the client as the local expert on their self.In other words, Gc is empowering. The client needs to have their own power to make decisions.\u00a0 They need to have resources and information made available to them so they can make their own choices.\u00a0 Those choices need to be real choices, not dilemmas sold as choices. People need to feel like they are masters of their own fate, and also be able to understand the boundaries of what things they can change.Clients also need to learn how to be able to reframe how they understand things in a more constructive manner, so they can take the things learned and be able to continue to help themselves later on.\u00a0 A child\u2019s job is to play, learn and grow, and so is an adult\u2019s.\u00a0 We all need to continue to learn new skills and approaches throughout our lives as our situations change, and as our abilities to do things also change.\u00a0 There is no one place in life where one is done learning; it\u2019s an ongoing, lifelong process.\u00a0 To be able to do this the client needs education, not just in the form of information, but also in the process of making thoughtful decisions with this kind of information.But to do all that the counselor has to be able to figure out \u2013 with the client \u2013 not just what the problems are, but also what the client thinks is important:\u00a0 the things they need to solve, or skills they need to acquire. If something is important to the client, then it\u2019s important!\u00a0 The counselor should address the subject with them.\u00a0 People need to be able to make decisions about things that are important to them in their lives.\u00a0 That\u2019s the inherent difference between Bc and Gc: telling people versus asking them.\u00a0 A lot of what people need is attentive listening and being taken seriously (for a change).To be hopeful for a positive outcome, a person needs to feel that they can make a change in their lives, and do so from their own power. The client should then be able to take that sense of power that is created from beneficial change, and be able to share it with others in their communities \u2013 the personal empowerment becomes social.\u00a0 Part of that social empowerment comes from the client being able to earn the respect of others and to be seen as a competent person, rather than as someone stigmatized for being \u201cdamaged\u201d.To do these things, the counselor should be a tool for the client.And boy is that a change in the power paradigm!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/07/23/good-counseling-bad-counseling/", "title": "Good Counseling, Bad\u00a0Counseling"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t19 July 2006 ", "body": "Today was a long, exhausting day working at summer camp.  It was, as some people are wont to say, \u201ca stimmy day\u201d.  So that\u2019s the topic of today\u2019s blogging.One of the complaints I read about on some parenting boards is \u201cthe stimming problem\u201d, when a child engages in self-stimulatory behaviours.   (No, I don\u2019t mean masturbating, although that could be a stim; we\u2019re referring to finger-fiddly activities, whole body activities like jumping, rocking, spinning, and so on.)Many people act as though autism is cause of stimming.  This isn\u2019t quite true; stereotypical stimming behaviours are associated with autism.  Rather, stress is the main cause.  Stimming is nothing more than a more focused version of someone else\u2019s \u201cnervous habit\u201d. Various stimming behaviors can be beneficial stress-coping mechanisms, assuming they\u2019re not self-injurious.We should note that stimming activities are things that EVERYONE does. People smoke, or fiddle with their hair, or stroke mustaches and beards, or spin wedding bands around their fingers, or chew gum, or bite pencils, or repeatedly click ballpoint pens, or fiddle with pocket change, or mangle paperclips, or count rosary beads, or slide necklaces, or play with earrings, or crack knuckles, or doodle on page margins, or stare out the window, or pace, or endlessly swizzle mixed drinks with decorative stirrers \u2026 you know, all those stereotypies that neurotypical people engage in.The only difference is the type of activity.  Those previous things are \u201cnormal\u201d whereas autistic stimming things are \u201cnot-normal\u201d.  But how can something be \u201cabnormal\u201d when millions of autistic people do it? Then again, I bet a lot of those so-called \u201cnormal\u201d behaviours are done by ADHD people leaking hyperactivity around the edges in a socially-acceptable manner.I\u2019m prone to \u201cswaying\u201d or rocking from side to side. I\u2019ve been doing it for over forty years.  My husband has finally resigned himself to the fact that if I stand and talk for more than a few minutes, I\u2019m likely to start up.  (It was camouflaged when I had tots in my arms, but now they\u2019re in high school and college.)  I even rock some while teaching and doing presentations (gasp!) and the world hasn\u2019t come to a screeching halt yet.  Fifteen-plus years of this and they still send me contracts and invitations. It\u2019s not an issue of \u201cshe rocks but she\u2019s a really good speaker\u201d but rather that \u201cshe\u2019s a really good speaker and sometimes she rocks\u201d.  Come to think of it, not even that.  No one has ever mentioned it to me.  Maybe no one notices.  Or maybe no one cares.My office chair is a rocking chair. Rocking chairs exist because people like to rock. Even the better sorts of conference room chairs rock.  Rocking is soothing.  Rock on!Listening to the same music track repeatedly is a great stim.  For the highly distractible ADHD brain, it nicely spackles in some of the attentional inputs, and helps drown out some of the random auditory background, thus enabling better concentration.  There must be LOTS of people who like to do this, as many music players have a Repeat function so you can listen to the same track over and over and over and \u2026Some people try to reduce their child\u2019s stimming through behavioral modification.  Unfortunately, this often prevents the person from using their stress-coping mechanism, and thereby increases the sum stress load, which is unhealthy. Likewise suppressing behaviors such as stimming is not going remove the ultimate causality \u2013 masking the outward behavioral appearance does not change internal processing.  Verily, it can create more difficulties for person by short-circuiting natural learning & stress-management techniques, thus reducing ability to successfully interact with world and others in it.(And we all know that suppressing the stimming behaviours is not going to eliminate the autism, no matter how \u201cnormal\u201d the person acts on the outside.  Duh.)Of course behavioral modification can be used to change problem behaviors; it is something that good parents and teachers do all the time. But smart parents and teachers know that the best way to prevent problem behavior in the long run is to address the cause of the problem.  Wise and caring parents and teachers do not blame the child for having problems and stimming, but help the child learn ways of dealing with the daily stresses, and if really necessary, find ways of stimming that are more socially acceptable.Because you know that stimmy autistic children grow up to be \u2013 stimmy autistic adults.  And fidgety ADHD children grow up to be fidgety ADHD adults.  Next time you\u2019re in a meeting, quietly scatter a bunch of paper clips on the table and watch what everyone does with them!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/07/19/stimulating-topics-of-conversation/", "title": "Stimulating Topics of\u00a0Conversation"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t27 July 2006 ", "body": "\u201cI, myself, was always recognized . . . as the \u201cslow one\u201d in the family. It was quite true, and I knew it and accepted it. Writing and spelling were always terribly difficult for me. My letters were without originality. I was . . . an extraordinarily bad speller and have remained so until this day.\u201d\n~Agatha Christie\n\u201cI was, on the whole, considerably discouraged by my school days. It was not pleasant to feel oneself so completely outclassed and left behind at the beginning of the race.\u201d\n~Sir Winston ChurchillHow bad does it have to get?At what point does a student\u2019s difficulties with schoolwork demonstrate that they are having significant problems, and therefore need help?Should a student have to fail classes before someone realizes or decides that there is a problem?Why do we rely on failing \u2013 or near-failing \u2013 to signal academic difficulties?  By the time a student has slid that perilously low in achievement, they have been struggling for a long while, and are getting further and further behind, thus making it even more difficult to catch up and succeed.Furthermore, all that time spent struggling and generally not understanding why they are having problems, only creates even greater frustration.  Stress doesn\u2019t always push students to rally and succeed \u2013 too much stress rather, just serves to flatten their spirits.Being told (directly or indirectly by all sorts of adults and peers) that they are simply \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cnot trying hard enough\u201d or \u201cstupid\u201d or whatever, only serves to further mangle the esteem and create greater frustration.  It\u2019s a recipe for depression, for withdrawal, and/or for acting out.Bright students apply their natural intelligence and create coping strategies around their various difficulties.  Oft times this is an unconscious process; it\u2019s sheer adaptation to the world because they are expected to be able to do what everyone else does, and because in many ways, they have to approach tasks differently.But coping strategies can only compensate so far.  When the student is tired, or is sick, or is overwhelmed by other events in life, or is having to spread not enough compensation over too much difficulty, it breaks down.  And then the student \u201csuddenly\u201d can\u2019t do what they\u2019ve always been able to do.  Teachers, parents and others can\u2019t understand why the student isn\u2019t performing well.  It\u2019s easy to make those dread attribution errors: \u201cYou just need to focus.  You just need to try harder.  You just need to pay attention.\u201dFor the student, sometimes they can\u2019t even understand how or why it is that they can do things some days, but not others.  Or why they can only sometimes do things well.  It seems irrational.  It\u2019s easy for the frustrated student to make attribution errors of their own: \u201cThe teacher hates me.  The work is too hard.  The subject is just stupid.\u201dStudents who are both very bright and have learning disabilities or learning difficulties or even marked learning style differences, face a terrible Catch-22.  For years they will get by on sheer brains, compensating for their problems in ingenious ways.  But eventually the complexity of the subject materials, the increasingly higher taxonomic levels of assessment, and the increasing study load all combine to bog down the effort.  (The distractions of adolescence certainly don\u2019t help, either!)These \u201ctwice-exceptional\u201d students may do well, but struggle to achieve what they could do.  The learning problems, which affect both the acquisition and demonstration of knowledge, can cancel out the exceptional qualities.  What everyone sees, instead of a bright student with learning problems, is just an ordinary student with erratic and scattered abilities.Once someone finally cues into the fact that there is a problem, it\u2019s the disparity between ability and achievement in test results where the learning problems are diagnosed.  But even before that, it\u2019s the erratic results in the grades (even in the same subject!) and the uneven scatter of abilities that should send up flags.It\u2019s not uncommon for students with learning disabilities to be uneven \u2014 the \u201ceasy\u201d things may be difficult (such as taking 4+ years to learn multiplication tables) and the more advanced stuff may be easy (e.g. physics or calculus concepts). If people insist that the student \u201cmaster\u201d the preliminary steps before they can move on, the student will be bored and not reach their academic potential. Bored students can act up, either withdrawing, being class clown to get attention, or getting frustrated and angry.Even after testing, there can be confusion all around.  None of the test results may show a severe problem of any one kind.  But we have to remember that problems are cumulative.  On good days, various problems may merely be additive; on bad days they can be multiplicative.  So a student with some ADHD organizational problems and some Auditory Processing Disorder problems and some Asperger\u2019s socialization problems and some difficulties in reading and some periodic tics and some depression and occasional migraines \u2026 doesn\u2019t have any \u201cmajor\u201d problems.  But what that student does have is a major conglomeration of interacting problems.  It\u2019s no one thing \u2013 it\u2019s everything!One school person said this student didn\u2019t need an IEP because they were \u201ccoping so well\u201d.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t29 July 2006 ", "body": "Traditional ways of understanding processesOften science has taken the approach of understanding how things work by examining situations in which things don\u2019t work, or in which they work differently, e.g. mutations in Drosophila flies or Arabidopsis plants, or disease processes. On one hand, these situations help reveal the mechanisms / processes by showing us where to look, and by giving us a comparison for what does or does not happen.For example, when we have plants infested with insects, sometimes we see the insects (often we don\u2019t see them because they hide on the undersides of the leaves; insects are not intelligent, but they aren\u2019t stupid either), sometimes we see signs of the insects themselves (such as frass, a technical word for insect poop), and sometimes we observe or measure the  symptoms caused by the insects\u2019 feeding (such as red discoloration on sorghum from greenbug aphids).When we have people infected with diseases, we can also see the outward signs or the symptoms reported by the patient, but we cannot see the disease itself. If the disease is caused by an organism, such as a bacterium, fungus, or virus, we can see the agent, but that is not the disease. The disease rather is the mal effect upon proper functioning caused by one organism upon another*. Diseases can also be autonomic, caused by something from within the organism itself; diseases in this sense are processes gone wrong.Technically, something is a disease if it has a predictable set of symptoms, with some sense of the cause of those symptoms, and the physiology of how they are expressed. If the cause or the physiological dysfunction is unknown, it is not a disease, but a disorder. When repeated sets of symptoms are observed, they are referred to as a disorder. Although some disorders may be treated pharmaceutically, they are not diseases.We cannot see the disease itself, rather, the disease is something inferred by the observations and dialogue between the people with and people without the disease. In contrast, a disorder is often only discerned by the people without such, because it is defined by comparison; order is defined by like, and disorder is defined by not-like. Diagnoses are defined by relationships and perception as much as, or even more so, the physical states.\n\nLimitations of inferenceWhen we have people who are autistic (et cetera), we diagnose it likewise by the \u201csigns and symptoms\u201d or the observable data of the behaviors. What we cannot necessarily determine are the causes of those behaviors. It is an accepted fact in some disciplines of science (such as ecology) that the specific process cannot necessarily be determined by the end results! We can hypothesize several likely causes, or series of causes that would produce the current situation, and we can do experiments to test if we get similar results, but those experiments do not guarantee that the specific causes and processes are what caused the current situation.Quite frankly, our ability to understand what is going on is limited by both our ways of thinking, and by our abilities of perceiving the world. Ethologists who study animals are more often aware of their inabilities to share the same perceptions as their subjects than are behaviorists, because it is more obvious that the Umwelt (perceptual world) of a honeybee is different than that of a human being.What we can discover is determined by how we approach the problem conceptually as much as by the methods we use, or by the data we gather (i.e., \u201cIf the only tool you have is a hammer, all of your problems look like nails.\u201d)A person who assumes that the behavior exhibited by another person results from a particular set of sensory inputs and mental processing, is therefore going to be limited in, and also sometimes erroneous in their understanding of that behavior. Five different people can do the same thing for five entirely different reasons. For one of them to assume that the others do the same thing for the same reason they do is a kind of egocentrism. In this way, the much-vaunted neurotypical \u201ctheory of mind\u201d that allows people to guess others\u2019 motivations by implicit information can actually lead them astray, because they assume that others do things for the same reasons they do.Conversely, when people do not see the expected behavioral results from certain circumstances, they can sometimes misunderstand what is going on and why. If several people laugh at a television show and I do not, they may assume that I do not have a sense of humor. In truth, I have a well-developed sense of humor, and will spontaneously giggle at things I remember, or jokes I remember and re-tell to myself, or laugh from other television shows, but I do not always find the same things funny that others do. In this case, their conceptual limitations prevent them from understanding alternative causes.Even if all the information is present to be observed, and even gets recorded through some miraculous accident of experimental design, the underlying causes and effects may still be hidden because the observer has neither the intent nor the capacity to notice and understand it. We can only answer the questions we ask, even if additional answers are there in front of us. Likewise, if we ask questions the wrong way, we will not be able to learn the right kind of information.The current mode of research has derived from the pathology model, where we try to figure out what goes wrong. This is not bad. This is a necessary approach, in many ways. But it should not be the only approach. One of the best ways to figure out what we should do, and what does work, is to examine the successes!Problem 1: warped perspectiveIt is because of the historical origin of psychology, (it stems from studies of mental problems) that the dominant paradigm is \u201caverage = normal\u201d. Much of the diagnostic phrasing is focused on disorders, and it tends to pathologize what is different from the norm. If you don\u2019t fit within the boundaries, then something is wrong with you, not that the situation doesn\u2019t fit you.On the other hand, these situations also tend to give us a warped perspective. The warping stems from the fact that identifying processes by \u201cbroken-ness\u201d gives one a \u201cDysfunction\u201d \u2013 and dysfunctional \u2013 view of the universe. Things working = function = normal. Things working otherwise = not working = dysfunctional = abnormal.To follow the disease model is not correct because average is presumed to be equivalent to normal. Actually, \u201cnormal\u201d is a value-laden word, because \u201cnormal\u201d means both \u201caverage\u201d and it means \u201cokay\u201d. Abnormal means not-average and not-okay. It is a false dichotomy to assume that not-average means abnormal!There are those who deny the appropriateness of difference; one must do their best to fit it and not be different to be okay and accepted. I am different in many ways, many not visible. One difference is visible: I have fair skin and rather than tanning, will freckle and easily sunburn. This is genetic. Because of this genetic difference, I exhibit different behaviors than do most of my peers. For example, I do not use tanning beds or lay out on beach towels to sunbathe, and will do my field work clad in a brimmed hat, sunglasses, bandanna, long-sleeve shirt, cotton gloves with the fingertips trimmed off, long pants, and socks. The average person does not wear this much clothing when outdoors on a 104\u00b0 F/40\u00b0C day; however, no one would say that I am \u201cabnormal\u201d for exhibiting these behaviors. These behaviors are appropriate and healthy for someone of my genetic makeup; they prevent me from stressing and harming myself. These behaviors do not create problems for others, and only create social disturbance because they are uncommon in some social realms. There are no, nor should there be, any negative value judgments attached to behaving differently than my peers because of this genetic difference.I am also sensitive to noise, especially chaotic or high-frequency noises, and will in some situations wear ear-plugs, withdraw to a corner, or limit the frequency or duration of my visits to certain places. These behaviors are appropriate and healthy for me; they prevent me from stressing and getting severe headaches. In contrast, these behaviors are considered odd or unacceptable, but without them I can end up twitching, grimacing or swaying from the noise stress, and these reactions are considered even more unacceptable!Then there are those who deny differences exist as real differences, and that if one cannot achieve things in the same way or at the same rate as \u201ceveryone else\u201d, then they just are not trying hard enough or are stupid. People with AD/HD (et cetera) are simply \u201cmaking excuses\u201d.\u201cEveryone else\u201d is an interesting myth of self-contradiction; it assumes that everyone is the same, while at the same time acknowledges the fact that one is not the same. The myth of \u201ceveryone else\u201d makes the different person responsible for the having and resolving the problem that others create. The meta-issue here is that the person\u2019s difference is not the problem \u2013 the others\u2019 lack of acceptance is the problem! I do not \u201csuffer\u201d from any number of differences I have, I suffer from the lack of acceptance and understanding of those differences and how I can best function.The unsavory alternative to people rejecting differences can be their amazement that people can accomplish things \u201cdespite\u201d disabilities. Imagine during World War II, when in the US women went to work in factories. That women had competently done hard manual labor in factories in previous decades was often forgotten (the working poor or various ethnic groups didn\u2019t count of course); instead there was amazement and collective self-applause because my goodness, women not only wanted to do factory work (how noble! how patriotic!), but could even do the factory work and do it well (how extraordinary). Those women workers who could perform well were an inspiration, they could overcome their lack of mechanical expertise, or inherent female weakness or even the fact that they suffered from monthly hysteria. Of course, after the war was over, the women were to cheerfully return to their kitchens and let men do the \u201creal\u201d work; factories wanted their normal, able workers. Of course, such attitudes seem dated and silly now; there is nothing amazing about women working, just people with \u201cdisabilities\u201d getting college degrees or married or having families or working or \u2026Problem 2: assigned motivationsAnother problem with the current model is that it tends to assign motivations that do not necessarily exist. For example, someone offers to share with me a slice of his or her home-baked, fragrant, pecan pie. If I smell the pie and love to eat pecan pie, I should [want to] eat the pie, shouldn\u2019t I? But behavior is not merely stimulus-response; there is also the previous history of the organism, the perceptual realm, the mental processing, and the current state of the organism. For example, previous experience may lead me to drool when I smell pecan pie, but if I am not hungry then I will not have this reaction. If my nose is stuffy from a head cold and I can neither smell nor taste much, then I won\u2019t have this reaction. If the offer of pecan pie comes with the additional requirement of staying and eating it at an intolerably noisy-busy lunchroom then I may also decline to choose to eat the pie. The person offering the pie may imagine a whole variety of motivations for my refusal of the pie, including suppositions about my judgment of their ability to cook good pies, or my desire to socialize with them. These motivations are imagined, and do not necessarily exist!Problem 3: disemphasisAlthough my differences affect what I do and how I do things, they do not exist separately from me, nor they responsible things, e.g., my ADHD is not \u201cbeing bad today\u201d. I may be judged \u201cunsocial\u201d when rather I am adverse to be in crowded, noisy places. This actually transfers my real or perceived motivations from my thoughts and my actions, and assigns them to the \u201cunsocial dysfunction\u201d.The problem with this is that it changes the emphasis of thought from who I am and what I need to \u201cwhat my problem is\u201d and \u201cwhat treatment my disorder requires\u201d. Just as hospital patients run the risk of not only acquiring not only nosocomial infections, they also run the risk of being identified by or replaced by and treated as their maladies, e.g. \u201cthe COPD in room 243\u201d.Lacking diagnoses (and attendant \u201ctreatments\u201d) for many years, I cannot say what my life would have been like had I been considered to be a child student with disabilities. I can say that missed diagnoses are just as bad as mis-diagnoses. I can also say that as an adult, the time I must spend getting diagnoses done, paperwork filed to \u201cprove\u201d such (it\u2019s not real unless someone else says so on paper), making arrangements for \u201caccommodations\u201d (one must be very \u201cspecial\u201d to have enough time to finish a test, and to take it without a lot of distractions), having to go through the schedule re-arrangements required for such, and all the other stuff rather detracts from other things I could be doing, like studying or lab work. This really improves my ability to be a good student, right?* If disease rather is the mal effect upon proper functioning caused by one organism upon another, could we then assert that some teachers/ clinicians/ social workers cause disease in autistics by interfering with their normal functioning?", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/07/29/on-behavioural-observations-and-assumptions/", "title": "On Behavioural Observations and\u00a0Assumptions"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t11 April 2008", "body": "Whenever I read statistics about the \u201cincreasing rates of autism\u201d, I heave a big sigh. Those statements invariable contain a whole number of assumptions, many of them flat-out wrong, or at least unexamined. In the epidemiological data, there are diagnostic issues and census issues and statistical issues and of course, the inevitable agenda issues in the reportage of the census results and analyses. I\u2019ve previously discussed a number of these problems, including incidence versus prevalence, and correlation versus causality in the post, \u201cEpidemics of Bad Science vs Epidemics and Bad Science\u201dWhat I would like to address today is a related issue with diagnostics and perceived prevalence, meaning, \u201cHow do we know who has autism or AD/HD or a learning disability, and how many such people are out there?\u201dIn entomology (and in other zoological branches) we have a concept known as \u201ctrap bias\u201d. There are a number of ways of taking a census of an animal population, including using traps. A \u201ctrap bias\u201d means that the kind of trap you use to census a population will limit the responders to your census, and thus create unintended biases in the results.Now, if a few synapses in your brain just fizzled from that wordy definition, let\u2019s try a simple example. Sometimes fishing nets are used to describe trap bias, where a net with large openings will only catch large fish, leading people to think there are no smaller fishes.But trap bias goes way beyond that. So instead, let\u2019s say I want to find out what kinds of insects are out there, and a rough idea of how many of them there are. If I put a malaise trap out in a field then I will get a broad range of critters. There will be bunches of individuals of some species, and only a few of others.A little thinking about this way of census-taking will quickly lead one to realise that an aerial trap is not going to catch aquatic or terrestrial insects. It only catches flying insects. We will also get different compositions between one weekly census and another, especially as the seasons go by, because some insects will mature into flying adults later on in the year, and because some insects migrate. So, you can either decide that you\u2019re just going to measure the populations of flying insects, or you use other kinds of traps as well. After all, it\u2019s up to you to decide what the parameters of your census will include.But there are other, less-readily discernible biases that creep into such a method. For example, if you get a lot of male butterflies of a particular species in your trap (compared to females of the same species), does this mean that there are really more males than females? Does it mean that there are more males in this particular area than females? Does it mean that there are more males during this particular time period? (In some species, the males die after mating season.)Or, does it have nothing to do with the actual sex ratio, and everything to do with the kind of trap? Some males are more vagile (move about the landscape) than are females. The girls just get to sit and wait for the guys to find them, casually sipping nectar. If they are a species that mates only once, the mated females may also hide out a bit so the males aren\u2019t constantly harassing them. You will get more males in your trap simply because the guys are out bebopping around more than the gals.When it comes to making diagnoses and determining the prevalence rates of various issues, we also run into trap biases. For example, one runs into a 4:1 male:female ratio mentioned for both autism and AD/HD. Nowadays it is becoming much more recognised that girls will more often have the inattentive than the hyperactive form of AD/HD. Hyperactive boys are a helluva lot easier to spot than girls who are staring out the window and daydreaming. This higher visability makes it more likely that they would be referred for assessment, even if both are having similar academic problems.But there are other forms of trap bias that can creep into identification issues.One is diagnostic parameters. There can be subtle differences in how the same syndrome can present between males and females. Girls with Asperger\u2019s are frequently more socially-oriented and verbal than are boys (they don\u2019t always have more social success as they get older, but the dynamics are different between groups of girls and groups of boys). The girls trend towards\u00a0different interests than the boys, such as fewer train enthusiasts and more Harry Potter enthusiasts. If you think it\u2019s difficult finding someone who\u2019s sufficiently familiar with all the different ways that Asperger\u2019s presents in boys, it\u2019s even more difficult to find someone who\u2019s familiar with girls.Likewise, diagnosticians who usually see children will also be less familiar with how adults present, because\u00a0adults have usually figured out a variety of coping mechanisms \u2014 which is not to say that adults\u00a0are not struggling and failing to achieve things, either!Another issue arises from\u00a0social expectations about gender and learning. It\u2019s too easy to dismiss a girl having more difficulty in mathematics because she\u2019s \u201cjust a girl\u201d, or say that well, boys just lag behind girls in reading and writing skills, and \u201che\u2019ll catch up in a few years\u201d. Such problems are too easily written off as non-problems, or else unalterable simply because they are related to gender or maturity. Being dismissive is multiply\u00a0damning: appropriate responses or necessary interventions are withheld, the psychosocial needs of these struggling students are ignored, and all the while,\u00a0they are repeatedly admonished\u00a0that neither they nor their academic problems are worthy of attention.Yet another problem comes from not diagnostics, but treatment preferences. A curious\u00a0thing happened over the years.Back in the 1980s, masses of\u00a0public attention were focused on\u00a0the \u201csudden\u201d rash of numbers\u00a0of kids being diagnosed with ADD or ADHD. People blamed all sorts of things as the\u00a0cause, including sugar, food coloring, bad parenting, even the latest new toy, \u00a0video games . Over time the ruckus settled down, and the crackpot theories faded away (although the food additive one somehow lingers on, like a\u00a0grape-flavored stain in the rug). We know that ADHD is not caused by bad parenting or video games, and we also know that it\u2019s not just an issue in childhood. No one is even surprised to realise that like other traits, it can run in families. Of course\u00a0no one in previous generations had been diagnosed with such, because the same diagnostic label\u00a0had not been used (\u201cminimal brain damage\u201d anyone?). But the thousands of people diagnosed as adults can certainly point to the piles of documented evidence for the difficulties they had as children, and continue to have.Nowadays the uproar about \u201csudden\u201d numbers or \u201cepidemics\u201d of autism are the current crisis, and people blame all sorts of things for causing it (the list is not terribly different) as well as come up with all sorts of bogus treatments and cures.But because of all of these causation myths and the subsequent treatment / cure myths, it\u2019s also easy for struggling people to not get appropriate diagnoses and subsequent treatment or accommodations. After all, all you need to do is just pay attention, try harder, get a good paddling, quit eating anything with artificial food coloring or wheat or dairy or high-fructose corn syrup or monosodium glutamate or artificial sweetener or trans-fats, quit using mobile phones, move away from power lines, quit playing video games, get detoxified, take more vitamins, or whatever else the cure\u00a0du jour requires. All these things create an imaginary goal of\u201dbecoming normal again\u201d, simply by correcting some deficiency in how one chooses to live their life, and then magically everything will be fine. Just like other dismissive attitudes, the reality of the problem invalidated.But you don\u2019t have to take my word that there are plenty of people out there with undiagnosed issues, girls as well as boys, adults as well as children. Just listen to them.But before you can listen to them, you will have to quit standing there counting what flies into your trap. Not everyone who needs to be counted comes to your door.", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise_trap"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/04/11/more-trap-bias/", "title": "More \u201cTrap Bias\u201d"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t14 April 2008", "body": "Of all the people in the world, my eldest would be the least likely to be dismayed by becoming a \u201cwheelie\u201d.  Every time we visited the science museum in Denver, dad and I could always count on at least a solid hour of book-reading time as the kids played with the wheelchairs in the Discovery Zone.When a staph infection on one knee got especially nasty (round, red and swollen, requiring repeated expulsion of alarming amounts of pus), we scheduled a visit to the doctor.  In addition to getting antibiotics and analgesic, there was a good-natured enquiry by the patient if this might not earn the doc\u2019s permit for a wheelchair?  After all, mobility was definitely impaired \u2014 hobbling between bedroom and bathroom was difficult \u2014 and definitely meant unable to hike around the hilly campus.  Well, replied the doc, were it both knees he would.Shucks!So, time to take the semi-disabled student back to college. I packed up the \u201cBug of Holding\u201d with the overnight luggage, and we went back to the campus.  The swelling made it difficult to bend the knee as well as to put weight on it, which meant that any footwear with laces, zippers or heels was extremely difficult to put on or use.  Well, that was essentially all the footwear currently owned, so we stopped by a Target store to get some sandals. Hobbling inside, we espied three wheelchairs lined up near the shopping carts (buggies, trolleys), one of which was motorized.I was surprised to hear some initial concern about whether the store would allow someone who wasn\u2019t Officially Disabled use one.  We were just borrowing one of the regular chairs, not the motorized one, of course they would, I answered.  Besides, if anyone gave us grief, they could always be shown the big nasty, which by this point was doing a rather disturbing impression of a mammary gland, \u201cnipple\u201d and all.So we went down the shoe aisles, and I noted with relief that the aisles were not only wide enough for the chair to get around easily (including U-turns), but also that the store did not have the sort of display clutter at the end-aisles or within the aisles that some stores feel compelled to put everywhere.  This is one of the reasons why I prefer shopping at Target (compared to K Mart, or the big-bad-bully of retail, Wal-Mart); the stores are relatively free of excessive visual complexity or navigational hazards.My eldest quickly realised that some half-gloves would be really helpful if there was going to be much wheelchair usage.  That wasn\u2019t the only accessory that would have been required, either.Of course, there was the reaching issue.  I was there to hand things down as we shopped for shoes, and then for some groceries that could be kept in the dorm room, as the dining hall was a hilly block away.  I realised ruefully that I should have brought the reaching tool from home; it had been my mother\u2019s, and all I used it for was fetching socks that fell behind the washing machine.  Had I not been there, the options would have been trying to use that lightweight reaching tool (likely as not reaching up to tip a can off the shelf and then catching it), or trying to stand and sit back down repeatedly (ow!), or relying upon the convenience of other shoppers or a store clerk to hand things down.There was also the basket issue \u2014 one simply could not carry all the necessary shopping items on the lap or tucked between thigh and seat edge.  I suppose a person could grab one of the hand baskets, assuming that they had enough lap space when seated.  I\u2019ve also seen people pushing carts while seated in a wheelchair, which given the handlebar height and the basket depth of American carts, makes both maneuvering and unloading difficult.Given that we were using the wheelchair because someone had less mobility and was less able to get out and around, I realised with some horror that a shopper would perforce end up being able to fetch fewer items in a shopping trip, and would thus require more difficult trips to the store.  And of course, then one would have to get the stuff back to a vehicle or to a public transit connection (assuming that there were any in the city, and that they went to the places where one needed to go).  Some of the less-implicit secondary difficulties of disability were becoming apparent to me.Not wanting to leave the wheelchair outdoors in the cart corral (trolley bay) where it would be at the mercy of the spring weather, I carried the bags out and then pulled my car up to the exit doors to fetch my limping passenger.  I reflected that shopping had just become a very complicated endeavour. We were however, very thankful that the store had free wheelchairs for patrons to use, and that the one we grabbed was in good working order, and that the aisles were easily transversed. These things are not difficult to provide, but of course that doesn\u2019t mean they are found nearly as often as they should be.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dmns.org/main/en/General/Exhibitions/CurrentExhibitions/discoveryZone.htm", "http://ftwleather.com/library/GFHALF_400px_72dpi1.jpg", "http://img.alibaba.com/photo/50952220/Pick_Up_and_Reaching_Tool.jpg"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/shucks-not-disabled/", "title": "Shucks, not Disabled"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t16 April 2008", "body": "I am fetching one of my teaching props, or retreating to the whiteboard to make a quick diagram \u2026 just doing something besides speaking at the moment, when one of my students accidentally knocks over her soda can.\u201cSorry!  Just a retarded moment there,\u201d she apologises into the sudden quiet, snatching the can upright and then grabbing some tissues from her purse to blot up the dribbles.I freeze.  Suddenly at a loss for words.  Not for a lack of things wanting to say, but for having too many things to say, and everything getting into a verbal logjam.RETARDEDAll the momentum of being in my teaching-presenting groove evaporates.  It literally evaporates, leaving my skin all clammy, and a chill jolts up from my tailbone, snapping my head and shoulder back in one big tic.  My hasty breakfast curdles in my gut as I have visceral flashbacks of childhood abuse.The R-word.Omigawd I hate the R-word.  I hate being called a Re-tard.To retard means to hinder or delay. Various of my scholastic and social achievements have been delayed, but that never made the word appropriate.  In the vernacular it\u2019s meant as a slur, an insult, an assertion that someone is of subnormal intelligence.  It\u2019s the N-word of special education.  Once-upon-a-time the word acquired a specific diagnostic meaning; someone who was \u201cmentally retarded\u201d had an IQ of less than 70. But whether or not the term is, or was, applicable to me or anyone else present is not the issue. Not even, and especially not, people with cognitive impairments or learning disabilities want to be called Retards.She had not called me retarded.  She hadn\u2019t even directed the comment at anyone else.  I would be extremely upset if she had.But all of my responses are clogged up together in my verbal output buffer:Don\u2019t say THAT WORD.I hate that word.She wasn\u2019t meaning to be rude; it was simply meant to describe a clumsy moment.I should speak up and tell her not to use that word; it\u2019s rude and disrespectful.She\u2019s already embarrassed; that would just compound it if I corrected her in front of everyone.Jeez I farging hate that word.I should speak up\u2013\u201cWe all have moments like this,\u201d I start to say, referring to the accidental spillage.  And then my brain\u2019s all a-whirl with considerations about social responsibility, and advocacy, and the roles of instructor and student, and the vagaries of linguistics, and how to phrase things declaratively but without being hostile, and \u2026I couldn\u2019t get any more words out on the subject.  That happens sometimes.  I don\u2019t like it.  I feel \u2026 stupid.Meanwhile, the students have shifted their attention from this brief distraction that, in reality, only lasted 15 or 20 seconds, back to the ongoing program.  I\u2019m mentally groping for What should I do next? and need to not get irrevocably Stuck in the moment, socially frozen there, non-speaking and rocking where I stand. I hit the right-arrow key to advance to the next PowerPoint slide.  Technology as crutch.  I stare at the computer screen, forcibly dragging my attention back on track \u2014 what\u2019s next in the spiel?~//~After class I am sorting out the paperwork and packing back up my Big Bag O\u2019 Props. I am chewing over the lost opportunity.  I should have said more.  I wanted to say more.  But unlike the presentations that I have done dozens of times over, even when I was ill and running on that glazed-over forcefully-cheerful autopilot mode that all stage veterans know, for this moment I had no scripts.Scripts.  I rely upon scripted conversation more than I like to acknowledge that I do.  \u201cSmall talk\u201d is awkwardly scripted, and those scripts have an alarming tendency to do a 404 Error from my mental RAM.  Presentations are largely scripted, though not to the point of being unable to include asides to questions, or to reference previous remarks by students to help them connect concepts.  Everyday home chatter is fairly impromptu, but we all know that parents in general also have a stock of some 50 sayings that they use over and over.I drop off the required paperwork, and schlep my gear out to the car, replaying the scene in my mind.  Once I\u2019m in the safe, semi-private zone of my automobile, I start practicing new scripts.\u201cPlease \u2014 don\u2019t say that word.  It\u2019s rude and disrespectful.  Even if you didn\u2019t mean to be rude, it still hurts.\u201dYou can hear the protests already.  People always make the same stupid protests, Oh, I didn\u2019t really mean it.  It\u2019s not like that.  It\u2019s just a saying.  I was just joking \u2014 can\u2019t you take a joke?  You don\u2019t have to take it personally. See \u2014 no one cares.You cannot deny it.You cannot dismiss it.You cannot diminish it.No, it\u2019s NOT \u201cjust a saying\u201d. It\u2019s an insult stemming from prejudice.  Using that word in such a way continues that prejudice.No, it\u2019s NOT \u201cjust a joke\u201d. Using it continues the abuse of disabled people by ridiculing and Othering them.No, people DO care \u2014 I\u2019m a person, and I care.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t21 April 2008", "body": "Well, it\u2019s spring for sure because the frogs and toads have been singing, the daffodils and dandelions and forsythia are blooming, and it\u2019s impossible to keep my nails clean. Earlier today I was able to get this shot of the chief noisemaker from the backyard pondette; it\u2019s the American Toad (cleverly named Bufo americanus, which means American Toad).Seeing him trilling reminded me of an incident just a few years ago when I was at a gardening function.  A group of us were touring some gardens, one of which had a little pond.  All of a sudden, one of the Teetery Old Garden Club Ladies* let out an agitated squeal and began dithering around in circles, begging others for assistance.She was pointing to a couple pairs of toads that were nested amongst the blades of water iris, terribly concerned about someone (else) needing to \u201crescue the poor froggies\u201d because they were obviously trapped and one of them was \u201cgoing to drown the other one\u201d as it tried to climb out.  (Apparently she hadn\u2019t seen the second pair.)  Someone let out a helpful suggestion that maybe the gardener had a net.  There was a brief debate about whether or not one could really get warts from touching them. Yet another person said maybe they could put a spare rock in, for the froggies to climb out. This was the scene:Of course, in reality the toads were engaged in amplexus, releasing eggs and sperm into the water. I came over and looked over someone\u2019s shoulder.\u201cThey\u2019re REPRODUCING,\u201d I asserted, \u201cno one\u2019s drowning, and he\u2019s not hurting her.  And I\u2019m pretty sure those are toads, too,\u201d I added, remembering some random factoid about toads being \u201cwarty\u201d and frogs being smooth.Well, once she realised that she had made a scene over nothing, she minced off to go powder her nose or something.  Once the crowd of gawpers parted, I took some photographs (mentally cursing at my camera, which was old and on its last gears).I was surprised by the fact that she and several other people had not realised what was really going on.  Doesn\u2019t most everyone know that frogs and toads start off as aquatic eggs, then turn into tadpoles, then grow legs and lose tails, and later on mature into adults? I then remembered that many people of her generation did not have the opportunity to finish secondary education, and that the limited amount of science education would have not included much (if any) detail on animal reproduction.But even so, that would have been decades ago. Any children\u2019s book or television show on natural history has this information.  Surely anyone with an interest in gardening would have picked up more knowledge of basic biology over the years?Or maybe it was an unconscious bias against anything related to S-E-X.  People frequently hear want they want to hear, and see what they expect to see.  A lot of these Teetery Old Garden Club Ladies were also in the habit of referring to \u201cboy\u201d and \u201cgirl\u201d birds, mentally veering around the fact that sexually dimorphic birds were distinguishable because the adult males were especially showy to better attract the adult females for mating.  (They were in fact, not little boy and girl birdies.)  Even when I tried to describe why \u201cpollen-free\u201d flowers would not produce seeds for them to save and re-plant the next year, the sexual details had sometimes resulted in nervous asides enquiring about refreshing others\u2019 teacups.Sometimes I ran into presentation difficulties because the Teetery Old Garden Club Ladies just wanted information about what to do, and were not interested in why we used certain techniques.  In contrast, my approach to public education has always been about explaining the processes, and the subsequent rationales for using various horticultural methods.  My reasoning is that if people understand what\u2019s going on, then they can use that information to know what to do in new circumstances.  You don\u2019t have to memorise a whole series of arcane \u201crules\u201d about what to do for every kind of flower you grow if you simply understand the basics of their life cycles and how a few basic methods affect those.  (I confess, sometimes I do end up sharing Too Many Details, delivering what what the kid calls a \u201cthree terrabyte RAR-bomb\u201d.)But some people either don\u2019t understand science, or they feel intimidated by science because they think they are not smart enough to understand it.  Worse, some people avoid science because it interferes with their pretty little mythologies about birdies and froggies and posies.  Cartoonist Gary Larson wrote a deliciously satirical story about the dangers of ignorant romanticism about the natural world in his picture book, There\u2019s a Hair in My Dirt!  A Worm\u2019s Story.The good news is that nowadays I do my presentations/teaching through a college, so the sort of people who attend are not put off by being exposed to scientific explanations.  Indeed, they are usually pleasantly surprised by the fact that the \u201cboring science stuff\u201d has direct applications to ordinary dirt-gardening.For example, I use both the scientific and common names for plants.  I don\u2019t do this to impress or intimidate people.  Most people are familiar with, and prefer to use just the common names.  But as I point out, the same common name can be used for a number of different (and sometimes even unrelated) species of flowers, and also the same flower can have a number of different common names.  If someone asks me about \u201cblue bells\u201d we will have to do a little discussing to figure out whether they\u2019re talking about a perennial, biennial, annual, or bulb-type plant.  We use the scientific names to prevent confusion, not to be snobbish.Near the beginning of class, I will ask the attendees for a show of hands when asking them, \u201cOkay, now how many of you know what a Tyrannasaurus rex is?\u201d  Of course, everyone raises their hand, or at least grins.  \u201cSure, everyone knows what a T. rex is. You learned that name when you were a little kid \u2014 it was a BIG, SCARY ANIMAL with a BIG, COMPLEX NAME, and you were proud to know it!  Don\u2019t let the scientific names of flowers intimidate you.  You don\u2019t have to use them all the time, but do get to know them \u2014 there\u2019s nothing worse than buying a dozen Brown-Eyed Susans, and then next year discovering that they\u2019re not coming back because you bought the biennial sort, Rudbeckia hirta, instead of the perennial sort, Rudbeckia fulgida.\u201dTo be honest, not all of those Teetery Old Garden Club Ladies were biased against understanding science. In fact, some of them were well-educated, crack horticulturalists who knew what was meant by phrases like \u201ctetraploid lily\u201d. And certainly one doesn\u2019t have to been either female or elderly to be scientifically illiterate or science-phobic. But it\u2019s a simple fact of life that if you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, then you are much more likely to create mis-interpretations of the world around you, or get suckered into believing things that just aren\u2019t so.And I think that\u2019s a shame.* With my prosopagnosia, I tend to classify \u201ctypes\u201d of humans, as I have great difficulty distinguishing between individuals whom I do not know well. Teetery Old Garden Club Ladies are remarkably homogeneous, with white hair, glasses, pastel pant-suits or floral dresses, have high-pitched voices, and in semi-formal situations (even in the 21st century) refer to each other as Mrs. Husband\u2019s Name.  Having done presentations at a number of garden club meetings in people\u2019s homes, I also found that they frequently have environmental preferences for matched engravings of peonies, lamps with plastic dust-covers on the shades, and large quantities of china, including hand-painted plates hung upon the wall.  Because I\u2019m clumsy, all that expensive brick-a-brack made me nervous, and I was prone to rooting self-defensively in a hard-backed chair. Fortunately, as the guest speaker, I was often accosted with horticultural questions, which I found much easier to deal with than trying to engage in chit-chat.", "outgoing_links": ["https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/toads.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/imgp2957.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/toads1.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR_(file_format)", "http://www.amazon.com/Theres-Hair-Dirt-Worms-Story/dp/0060932740/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1208738195&sr=8-3"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/04/21/new-season-eternal-science-illiteracy/", "title": "New season, eternal science\u00a0illiteracy"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 April 2008 ", "body": "It is morning after some afternoon yard work (a couple hours spent lopping back a shrub by 2/3, and then cutting down those branches for pickup), and I am waiting for arthritis medicine to kick in.Then I realise that it has. Enough time has passed, and this is \u201cbetter\u201d (at least for the medicinally-mediated improvement).   Which-all leaves me wincing, and wiping wet corners of my eyes on my shoulders. I am tearing up less from pain than frustration-with-pain.  When I see my rheumatologist in a few weeks, I will have to explain that pain meds are not working so well, as even post-medicated I am in pain much of the time.  I cope with it and \u201ckeep on truckin\u2019 \u201c, which is not to say that it doesn\u2019t affect me.  (I haven\u2019t even been tracking my blood pressure, which I should be doing now that we actually have a mini-clinic on campus.)Today I am not just creaky and feeling nauseous before breakfast and after breakfast + meds, but I am also stiff.  It shows in the halting progress of my first foray down the stairs and the bumbling around the kitchen.  (Thank you, hubby, for making the coffee!  Again.)  I fumble, and more than once drop things, and then in Slow Motion must bend over to retrieve them from the floor.  Knees locked, legs straight, I reach down with my fingertips straining to touch the floor and pick up my sock.Now, you would think that if I can reach the floor like that, then I am doing pretty well.  There are arthritic people who have difficulty reaching past their knees. But all things being relative, I am indeed stiff.  This is because I am normally hypermobile.  On normal days (now Good Days), I can bend over, knees locked and legs straight, and put my palms flat on the floor.  Oh yes, even when wearing 2-inch (5-centimeter) heels. I am really bendy, and had I been co\u00f6rdinated, would have made a good gymnast or dancer.\nLater on in afternoon when I had loosened back up (still achey, just less stiff), I did a test to see what the morning stiffness means in terms of loss of mobility.  Per this book on Musculoskeletal Assessment, \u201cA tape measure is used to measure the distance between the tip of the great toe and the most distal point reached by both hands. Normal ROM is present if the patient can touch the toes. In the event the patient is able to reach beyond floor level, the test can be carried out with the patient standing on a step or platform to measure reach distance beyond the supporting surface.\u201d  So I grabbed a ruler and tried a step on some stairs, found it to have too little rise, and then went over to a small stage and did the procedure (barefoot), measuring just how far beyond the undersides of my big toes the ends of my middle fingers reached.That was a change of 20.3 centimeter (8 inches).When I bend over to pick something up, that involves hamstrings, hips, curve of spine, and shoulders.  Flexibility is spread out over a series of joints, and loss of flexibility is thus cumulative, depending upon how all those joints are interacting. But even so, end result is still that 20.3 cm (8 in.) loss of what for me is normal range of motion (ROM).Anyone who from one day to the next loses 20.3 cm (8 in.) of reach is losing a considerable amount of flexibility.  It\u2019s when we try to compare my personal (reduced) ROM to \u201cnormal\u201d ROM that we run into a false comparison.  \u201cNormal ROM\u201d dictates being able to touch one\u2019s toes with fingertips.  I have gone from my hypermobile reach to normal reach. If doctors or PTs only look at how I compare to the norming model, then they would consider that I am fine.But I\u2019m not fine \u2014 I\u2019ve lost normal mobility.  I cannot do what I normally do, how I normally do it, and furthermore, doing what I can involves pain.  I don\u2019t know if a PT would consider this amount of ROM loss to be \u201cclinically significant\u201d, and fact that I do regain my normal ROM over relatively short periods of time (within day or two), would likely remove the stiffness out of realm of rehabilitative significance (for PT).You might simply wonder why I\u2019m concerned with being able to pick stuff up from the floor with my knees locked; why not simply bend my knees?  Well, I can, and I do sometimes.  Doing so may not only result in some impressive cracking noises (no worries; it\u2019s only air bubbles in joints), and even uses the large, strong leg muscles, but also requires me to use slightly different means to keep myself balanced, and involves different stresses on knees.Truth be told, in such situations I find that squatting to reach the floor hurts more, and is harder to maintain my balance than simply bending over.  I like to avoid situations that can result in falling, as I get enough bruises just from ordinary navigation.In the end, I have to wonder if comparisons to normalcy need always be to standard-normal, as personal-normal may sometimes be better baseline for comparison.  I am not living in standard-normal body, but my own. I am needing to do things that are significant for my life, howsoever that may be dissimilar to someone\u2019s ideal of standard-normal life.", "outgoing_links": ["http://books.google.com/books?id=mrDPB1hEca0C&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=normal+ROM+%2B+toe+touching&source=web&ots=MEhknR3sFB&sig=VWvhEGKAfbCQz7s2JG41DgDs2uM&hl=en#PPA77,M1"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/04/22/in-which-i-am-stiff/", "title": "In which I am\u00a0Stiff"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t4 March 2008", "body": "\u201cWow, you take more pills than me,\u201d hubby remarked as I filled up my daily pill-minder for the next week.I paused for  a couple seconds and then answered, \u201cThat\u2019s a bit misleading \u2014 you take more inhalers.\u201d  A bit later, I added, \u201cBesides, a couple of those pills are just calcium supplements, and there\u2019s one prescription I take twice a day.\u201d  With the HRT patch, that\u2019s just four daily prescriptions.    Going by numbers of pills swallowed isn\u2019t a very good comparison of the numbers of medications we each take; it\u2019s probably close to an equal number, just different kinds of meds and different kinds of delivery systems.Maybe I was being a trifle pedantic.  Then again, the phrasing of the comment made it sound a bit like I was popping a lot of drugs. I don\u2019t think that my hubby meant the remark in a negative way; it was just an off-hand remark meant to fill conversational space while I was puttering around getting ready for bed.I might not have even noticed \u2014 or responded \u2014 had I not run into similar comments over the years, comments that were meant to make negative implications. These kinds of statements really bother me, especially because they are a misuse of otherwise good forms of factual communication. There\u2019s an old joke:When the cabbie got his fare but no tip, he responded, \u201cWell, it\u2019s right \u2014 but it ain\u2019t correct.\u201dThese things are not lying outright in the sense of speaking falsehoods, but are deliberately misleading by presenting true statements that lack the necessary context, or that are phrased in such a way as to lead the listener (or reader) to make connections that don\u2019t really exist.A similar situation was in a staff meeting some years ago.  This boss was no longer my primary supervisor, but since I still worked for him a few hours a week, I still conscientiously attended staff meetings when time allowed.  He paused to look down at his agenda, and then announced to the group, \u201cAndrea, you made 90% of the photocopies last month.\u201d  (This was significant because the copies were paid for from his budget.)I blinked a few times, surprised at this remark.  Well yes, I had made a several dozen photocopies, but \u2026  gee, I had made 90% of them?  Was I being extravagent?  I thought to myself, But photocopies are only a few cents apiece \u2026 \u201cWas it very much money?\u201d I asked, concerned, \u201cDo you need me to refund you for them?\u201d\u201cNo, no,\u201d he deferred.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a lot of money.\u201d  But the social damage had been done \u2014 I looked like an absolute spendthrift, just from the misleading way it had been phrased by my former boss.  Bringing it up in a meeting simply made the issue bigger and more public than was necessary. Well, it\u2019s right \u2014 but it ain\u2019t correct.Such misleading assertions can be difficult to rebut when you\u2019re in the middle of conversation. The other person\u2019s comments are factual, but are also misleading because of the phrasing, what details are presented, and what details are omitted. It\u2019s hard to rebut such statements because you have to stop and think about what particular facts aren\u2019t being mentioned, and then describe why the statement is misleading and what else people should know.Of course, when the other person who is making such comments on purpose (for devious intent, unlike hubby), they do not want to be corrected and lose face. Their whole point is to set up situations that make other people and their ideas look inadequate, wrong, foolish, or dangerous. This isn\u2019t a reasonable discussion where everyone gets to present their information in an equal manner and be politely listened to. They are quite likely to interrupt you and dismiss your corrections with ad hominem attacks, saying that you are just \u201csplitting hairs\u201d or \u201cexplaining things that everyone already knows\u201d or will imply that you are \u201cjust confused and don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d.Of course, such situations are worse when the antagonist is in a position of authority over you. You can end up going around trying to explain what\u2019s really going on to people, and even become hyper-vigilant about catching and correcting mis-impressions. If you\u2019re already on edge due to other stressful issues, it magnifies the stress. If your reputation is already at stake, your nervousness, hypervigilance and willingness to contradict people can then be remarked upon and twisted around as indications for further reasons for your supposed lack of competency. When people make these misleading comments on purpose and as part of an overall trend to discredit and harass someone, it is a particularly insidious type of bullying.One has to enlist other people who are also \u201cin the know\u201d about what is really going on, and have them speak up when they see such slurs being made, so the bully cannot assert that it\u2019s \u201cjust you\u201d.Such deceiving omissions don\u2019t happen only in work and school. Sometimes they are found in the press as part of sloppy editing or biased reporting.  At worst it falls into the realm of \u201cyellow journalism,\u201d reportage that sensationalistic and just this side of libelous. (After all, they are printing \u201cthe facts\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s just that how things are said, and what is left unsaid will mislead the readership.)There are an alarming number of events of sloppy writing in the news, such as a recent article in the San Francisco Chronicle, \u201cCDC panel recommends flu shots for kids\u201d The decision was criticized, however, by parents who believe that a mercury preservative, found in adult flu shots and once common in childhood vaccines, is responsible for rising rates of autism in the country.\n\u201cThe CDC continues to minimize the dangers of injecting mercury and aluminum into our kids,\u201d said Rita Shreffler, executive director of the National Autism Association. \u201cI\u2019m living with the results as so many other parents are, and it\u2019s just horrific.\u201d Shreffler is the mother of two children, 14 and 15, who developed autism at the age of 18 months after routine vaccinations.\nFlu shot supporters said multiple studies have failed to find any link between autism and the preservative, thimerosal. However, the CDC ordered it removed from required childhood vaccines eight years ago, and California law bans it from flu vaccine given to pregnant women or children under 3.Despite the weak disclaimer attributed to \u201cflu shot supporters\u201d (instead of  an overwhelming majority of the doctors and health agencies in numbers of countries around the world), the newspaper continues to advocate  the highly-discredited idea that \u201cvaccines cause autism\u201d. Mentioning that the childhood vaccines and flu vaccines for pregnant women and children under three don\u2019t even contain thimerosal does nothing to reduce the emotional impact of the hyperbole in the last quote. They not only sought out comments that will keep the nonsense current in the public mind, but also included the tired post-hoc fallacy that the two children \u201cdeveloped\u201d autism after their vaccinations. Such tales are biased by failing to mention genetic causes of developmental disorders.  But mostly the autism-scare story is irrelevant to flu shots.(Please don\u2019t bother flogging the tired old canard about presenting \u201cboth sides of the controversy\u201d. Next time there\u2019s an earthquake, will the newspaper feel obliged to give equal time to \u201cboth sides\u201d by interviewing both a seismologist and someone who claims the earthquake was due to the movement by the giant animal that holds up the world?) Well, it\u2019s right \u2014 but it ain\u2019t correct.When we read or hear news, we need to beware of statements that use not only facts, but also statistics without the necessary context (e.g. that \u201c90%\u201d).  Not only are people impressed with numbers in general and view any statement with numbers included as \u201cmore scientific or factual\u201d, but a lot of people are not well-versed in understanding how to interpret statistics or any kind of numbers.  Even something as simple as a mean average can be misleading \u2014 another joke goes:Bill Gates walked into the homeless shelter, and suddenly the average income of everyone in the room was in the millions.Numbers are really just more words; there\u2019s nothing magical about them.  But with statistics (like so many things) context is very important.Research studies are also frequently twisted around.  Very few people will bother to read the actual study, partly because most people can\u2019t even access the journals they are printed in.  Most science research is also so highly technical that it\u2019s difficult for anyone outside the field to be able to properly judge the merits of the testing method, the quality of the data, or the appropriateness of the results interpretations.A research study will get printed in a journal, get summarised and interpreted for the more-literate public in a press release, then get re-interpreted and very abbreviated by news aggregators, and then local news \u201cpersonalities\u201d will even further summarise and often tie their own interpretation of the study results to local events or people that may or may not have anything to do with the actual significance of the study.  It\u2019s like a giant [parlor] game of \u201ctelephone\u201d or \u201cwhispers\u201d being played by news-reporters, where every time the message is whispered from one person in the circle to the next, it gets changed just a little bit, so the person receiving the end message gets something rather different than the initial intent.Whatever the source, these tactics work by suppressed evidence, which allows people to easily develop hasty conclusions.  It\u2019s not enough to merely print random facts and to quote people.  Knowing what to include, what not to include, and understanding the context is important.", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism", "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/28/MN8RV9QB8.DTL&type=health"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/facts-arent-enough/", "title": "Facts aren\u2019t enough"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t5 March 2008", "body": "Damn anthocyanins!See what a college education does for you?  It allows you to cuss using polysyllabic words.This morning I awoke with an \u201cicepick headache\u201d type migraine as well as stiff arthritic joints.  Then as I was pulling my large, soupy bowl of near-boiling oatmeal-with-blueberries from the microwave, I spilt it all over my hand and wrist, the shelf, and of course, the cream-colored carpeting.  After running cold water on my hand for a couple minutes (it\u2019s fine, if tender \u2014 I\u2019m not wearing my watch for a couple of days), I had to go back and swab up the spill.  The purple anthocyanin stains from the dried-then-rehydrated blueberries will be quite the test of my carpet-cleaning spray.Meanwhile, the physical pain of ice-pick migraine has bugged me off and on all morning.  The good news is that although it\u2019s horrible and intense, it lasts no more than a minute.  The bad news is that it tends to repeat periodically through the day.  Made a point to take some more medication before my exam tonight.~//~Glancing through newsbits was less entertaining \u2014 there\u2019s a reason why I usually read blogs in the morning and news in the evening.  (I do glance over the headlines in the morning, just in case western California decides to crumble into the Pacific or something.)Oh the conceptual pain \u2026 it\u2019s sort of thing that Stephen Kuusisto calls, \u201cthe neurological equivalent of a foot cramp\u201d.  This is from Time magazine, \u201cHuckabee\u2019s Texas Evolution\u201d (hyperlink is to single-page, text-only version), which describes US Republican presidential candidate Huckabee and his support for intelligent design, and the upcoming  Texas State Board of Ed elections (emphasis mine):Republican Barney Maddox, a urologist and ardent supporter of creationism. \u2026 Maddox, who declines media interview requests, has posted his writings on the web at sites like the Institute for Creation Research and has called Charles Darwin\u2019s work \u201cpre-Civil War fairy tales.\u201dNow there\u2019s some irony as heavy as a falling Acme anvil.  Sorry \u2014 I didn\u2019t realise the clipping was an animation \u2014 hit your ESCAPE key to freeze the action. (Picture description:  this is a pop culture reference to Roadrunner cartoons. Wile E. Coyote was always trying to do in the Roadrunner, including dropping an Acme brand anvil on him.  In this cartoon clipping, there\u2019s a pile of birdseed in the middle of a road, with a sign stuck into it saying \u201cFree\u201d.  The road runs underneath a natural stone arch somewhere in the US desert Southwest, and hanging below the apex of the arch is a heavy iron anvil.  Presumably the unseen Coyote has a hold of the rope tied to the anvil, and is waiting for the likewise unseen Roadrunner to come running by.  Of course, Coyote never succeeds, as Roadrunner is way to smart for him. Beep-beep! )~//~Just to complete this triad of pains for the day, I realised that I was wearing a new turtleneck for the first time.  Normally when I get new clothing I remove the sewn-in brand name, size and laundering tags.  Clothes-tag irritation is not as much a strict dermal irritation (there\u2019s no rash), but rather is a constant hypersensitivity, a small but chronic sensory pain.So before I washed this turtleneck I used my seam-ripper to carefully pick out the threads holding the labels at the collar seam.  But by this mid-morning I realised that I had missed a tag, a big long one with laundry instructions that was unexpectedly sewn to the seam just below my ribs.  Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have the spare time to sit around partially-disrobed in a toilet stall and employ my Swiss Army Knife scissors to the task of snipping a line of tiny stitches.You would think that after a little while my brain would habituate to the sensory input and I would forget all about the silly tag.  Well, it does, for a few minutes.  But then I twist to do something, and I notice the annoyance all over again.  Repeatedly, all day long.  ARRGH!~//~Well, it\u2019s time for me to wrap up my day soon.  The icepick headache hasn\u2019t shown up for a while.  My wrist is less tender.  It was wonderful to yank off the turtleneck and put on my soft, old honeybee pyjamas.I aced my test this evening.  And the last fix-it job I did on the dishwasher seems to have worked \u2014 we have machine-cleaned dishes, and I didn\u2019t have to pay someone to come out and fix it, nor \u201chold vigil\u201d for a repair person who would supposedly arrive \u201cbetween the hours of eight and four\u201d.Oh joy, there\u2019s the tinnitus popped back on again.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 March 2008", "body": "My first job was scooping ice cream.  Normally someone would come up to the counter, tell me what they\u2019d want, and then would stay there until we traded money for cone.  The system worked fine most of the time.  I could keep track of my customers fairly easily because the shop did not have high volumes of traffic, and the narrow store-front meant both limited seating for customers (most of whom promptly left) and that the servers stayed behind the counter.At the time, I had no idea how much difficulty I really had recognising people.  It had never occurred to me that there was a reason why I hardly knew anyone at school besides a few teachers.  Because I didn\u2019t really go anywhere around town, I had not really encountered the issues of not recognising familiar people outside of their familiar contexts.  The narrowly-defined social worlds of my life was an effect of the faceblindness, and perpetuated my continued unawareness.  I\u2019d had inklings on previous occasions when I could not find or identify people, but lacking any way of comparing my inability to others\u2019 abilities, my faux pas were considered to be rudeness or stupidity on my part, rather than an organic problem.There behind the ice cream counter, I unwittingly kept track of my customers by their position at the counter, and by their shirts or hair style \u2026 which if the shop was not crowded, worked pretty well.  There would be the tall guy with the crew-cut in a white cowboy shirt, the skinny girl with the afro in a glittery tank top, the big mom in a pink muu-muu with two little kids in tow, and so on.  Of course I knew who got which kind of ice cream, no problem.And then one day a softball team came in, some dozen white girls, all wearing the same jersey, and they all seemed to have their blond hair up in pony-tails.  It was the most queasily-disorienting sensation, as though the same person had been multiplied (\u201ccloned\u201d was not yet in the public vernacular).  Of course, all the girls were bouncing around changing positions to see the different flavors of ice creams, and going back and forth chattering with each other.  They wouldn\u2019t even stay put in the queue for me to keep track of them!By the third serving, I had absolutely NO idea for whom I had just scooped, and just stood there with the cone held up in my trembling hand, \u201cWho wanted the praline on a sugar-cone?\u201d  They all look at me with disdain, and the gal flounced up and grabbed it, and re-joined her giggling mates.Mortified, I stared down at the lines of ice cream tubs, trying to remember the next flavor and focusing on scooping it out into a perfect ball.I couldn\u2019t put my finger on why, but I knew that I was uncomfortable with trying to keep track of which customers had which orders.  Worse, I couldn\u2019t figure out how everyone else knew the \u201cregulars\u201d, those customers that came by frequently and always got the same thing.  I just figured that somehow the other ice cream shop employees knew those people from other parts of their life \u2014 that they knew them in other capacities than simply as frequent patrons whom they recognised.It never occurred to me that it was odd that I never noticed anyone I knew when I was out shopping or running errands.  When I couldn\u2019t recognise the neighbors my mom chatted with in local shops or restaurants, I just assumed they were part of the vast horde of adults that my parents knew but I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t realise that they were people whom I should have known.  I never \u201cran into\u201d anyone when I was out, partly because I knew so very few people, and partly because I could not recognise them if they were \u201cout of place\u201d from where I was used to seeing them.It was only a summer job and I didn\u2019t get into social trouble very often by just keeping track of people by their shirts and haircuts.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t16 March 2008", "body": "After you\u2019ve become familiar with a variety of stupid political arguments or with spotting pseudo-science, you find yourself making a mental game of it:  Name That Fallacy.  It\u2019s gratifying to know that there are terms for the sorts of things that used to \u201cmake your brain all hurty\u201d because you knew they were wrong.  Such terms are a great time-saver in discussions: being able to assign those names means that others know what you\u2019re talking about, and that you don\u2019t have to explain why the fallacious thinking is not correct.But every now and then I run into something that cannot be easily defined by a term.  Such things may be multifactorial in the numbers of cognitive biases and argumentative fallacies; there\u2019s no one reason why the reasoning is bad.  But boy, are they off the mark!Right now, I have two fallacies I would like to discuss.  (Maybe there are names for these that I\u2019ve not yet run into \u2014 let me know; they could be from fields that I\u2019m not well-versed in.)~ I ~I call this first sort of \u00fcber-fallacy-bias the Prohibition Fallacy.  I know that it\u2019s not merely an isolated situational bit of nonsense because we have all seen it numbers of times in history. When people make arguments for laws, rules and other arrangements to ban something, they often use theProhibition Fallacy:  trying to prevent abuse of something by eliminating the thing or the circumstances where it could occur.The Prohibition Fallacy has been obviously seen in the domestic laws or religious strictures that led to prohibition of alcohol (in multiple times and places throughout history) simply because some people are alcoholic. Of course, the circumstances resulting in such decrees are really false dilemmas; the solution to the problem is neither wholly allowing nor prohibiting alcohol.  Most of us realise that there need to be some limitations on what is considered acceptable usage, and we have repeatedly found that merely prohibiting alcohol does not lead to elimination of issues, but merely drives some of them \u201cunderground\u201d where they are less easily addressed.A Prohibition Fallace is more than just a fallacy of objection, where the presence of opposing arguments is taken to be cause enough to deny something.  It also demonstrates a cognitive bias known as the neglect of probability where someone fails to take into account the likelihood of something happening. It is also a hasty generalisation where someone leaps to a conclusion based upon too little evidence, and uses a biased sample that assumes because a few do something, all the others will also do that same thing. This scenario partly stems from an availability heuristic that lends the perception for something to be likely to happen, simply because of the ease at which such a potential problem can be imagined (or recalled from actual events), and because the emotional impact of that bad event lends further weight to the perceived probability. Such claims are also an appeal to fear (as distinguished from avoiding something for rational or prudent reasons), and can involve the slippery slope where a series of worsening situations are assumed to be inevitable, without regard to the likelihood of those really happening.But unlike its namesake example, the Prohibition Fallacy is not limited to alcohol.  The fallacious thinking that \u201cthe way to solve or prevent problems is by prohibiting things\u201d is found in a variety of arguments.I noticed the Prohibition Fallacy again when I read a recent post at Midlife and Treachery that discussed a particular editorial with regards to the (U.S.) ADA Restoration Act.  The editorial began with some mention of the Catch-22 issue in the current ADA (which I\u2019ve also blogged about), that you can be simultaneously denied a job or promotion for being \u201ctoo disabled\u201d to do the job, but you are also not protected against that discrimination because of being \u201cnot disabled enough\u201d if you have some means of mitigating the factors that disable you.  As pointed out in the M&T blog, that part of the argument from the editorial is fine.But then the editorial writer does something nonsensical:  their first reasonable point is then ignored as they veer off into a protracted bit of nonsense about why the ADA Restoration Act is actually a bad idea. The Prohibition Fallacy is  then used, asserting that one must protect against the possibility of employers being falsely taken advantage of by a few unscrupulous individuals claiming discrimination, by completely eliminating the thing that they would abuse (i.e. the amendments to the ADA).  This argument ignores the fact that most of the people who would be needing and using these expanded legal protections would be doing so for totally appropriate reasons!As another example, we see this same kind of fallacy in schools, where rules are sometimes instituted to prevent irresponsibility by a few students.  One such rule is disallowing students from leaving the school campus during lunch time.  The rationale states that if they go out for fast food they might get back to class late, or that rushing out to get lunch and return in time might seriously increase the potential for dangerous driving, or that they might use the lunch period to sneak off somewhere and have sex, or smoke, or do drugs, or any number of activities.  (Conveniently forgotten is that some years back when there were more stay-at-home moms, many students used to leave campus and go home for lunch.)   The main selling point is the fear that secondary students will naturally engage in risky behavior, and that we must legislate ways of restricting their activity in order to control them and thus enforce \u201csocial standards\u201d (meaning, someone\u2019s narrowly-defined moral framework, as opposed to existing laws).We all know that in real life, some adults use their work lunch periods to do any of those things (legal or otherwise), but their employers don\u2019t try to keep them in the office.  Schools are concerned about the students\u2019 actions because the district is responsible for their students\u2019 safety on campus (or at off-campus school functions) simply because the students are legal minors.  But schools are not responsible for what the students do off-campus in non-school functions.  The real issue is not that most students don\u2019t actually believe in or follow moral and legal guidelines. The real issue is the Prohibition Fallacy that results in all of the students are being restricted because of the fear that a few of them will do irresponsible, dangerous, or illegal things while they slip outside of the realm of the school\u2019s responsibility.Naturally, most high school students find such a rule to be, \u201clike, totally stupid\u201d and \u201ca real farce\u201d \u2014 they can see through the fallacious thinking.  But being young and under-developed in critical thinking skills, most of them aren\u2019t articulate enough to pick it apart, beyond arguing against the likelihood of specific examples of misbehavior provided in the rationales.  But they know what\u2019s going on and why, and being teenagers, resist being \u201cmanaged\u201d in such a way.  The fact that they resist such management does not make them \u201cbad kids\u201d or \u201cprove\u201d the necessity for such a rule. It simply shows that like anyone else, teens and young adults do not like being subjected to unnecessary restrictions based upon absurd conclusions and fallacious thinking.~ II ~The second sort of fallacy is a little more complex to explain.  I\u2019m not going to provide a lot of examples, but you can feel free to cite some of your own in the comments discussion.  I\u2019m calling it the Opinionation Fallacy:  when someone tries to dismiss corrections to their erroneous \u201cfacts\u201d by claiming that their assertions are Opinions, and \u201ceveryone\u2019s entitled to their own opinion\u201d.Well. You cannot claim special exemptions for untrue statements just by calling them \u201copinions\u201d.Let\u2019s get this straight: opinions are about subjective things, those that are perceived or phenomenal, such as how we feel about something (that\u2019s \u201cfeel\u201d as in emotions, not \u201cfeel\u201d as in \u201cwould like to believe to be true\u201d), including our particular tastes and preferences, or that are our individual perceptions of sensory information.  Subjective things are not very arguable; you cannot, for example, call a syn\u00e6sthete wrong for the way they perceive things.In contrast, facts are about objective things that are outside of perception or cognition, those events and objects that are measurable, that can be experienced in common, and that exist independent of our experiences of them.  Objective things are arguable; although the accuracy of some facts may be up to debate, there is still some way of verifying if a thing is true or not.The Opinionation Fallacy is a form of subjective validation, where someone perceives things as being true (real, factual, correct) if it\u2019s personally true or supports their own belief systems.  Interpretations for the significance of events are to a degree subjective, and may have some level of debate. But the details of events are objective; either the evidence is there to support the existence of things, or there isn\u2019t.What a person \u201cbelieves\u201d to be true does not affect whether or not their statements are correct or false.  Merely believing in something does not make it real. When we have knowledge of something that is not first-hand experience (which is most everything we\u2019ve learned in school or through information media), we don\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d [most of] the information to be true, we trust the information to be true.Because most of us have large bodies of knowledge that we trust to be true, we realise that sometimes what is known about a thing can change over time.  More facts are found, which do not make the old facts false if they were truly facts.  What can change are the understandings of things, because the new information allows us to re-examine the significance of what we know.Sometimes the Opinionation Fallacy also involves a bit of the relativist fallacy, where \u201cwhat\u2019s true for others isn\u2019t true for me\u201d.  A person claims that their pet ideas or beliefs should have special exemption from the requirements of proof, just because of who they are, or because of some status they feel they have.Sorry, it doesn\u2019t work that way.   You can\u2019t change false statements into true ones merely by cloaking them under the \u00e6gis of \u201cOpinion\u201d.  Nor can you turn subjective beliefs into facts merely by wanting them to be true.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t16 March 2008 ", "body": "Read up on descriptions of students with autism, Asperger\u2019s, or Non-Verbal Learning Disorder, and you find the familiar piece about how such people \u201chave rigid routines\u201d or \u201ccannot deal with changes in routine\u201d.  Some of those descriptions are um, much more rigidly defined than others.  I have real problems with descriptions that use a lot of always or never, as real humans just aren\u2019t that binary.  In such cases, the author is being more literal-minded than the group they are describing!In contrast, statements worded as, \u201cDislikes changes in routine\u201d or \u201cHas difficulty with unexpected changes in routine\u201d would be much more accurate, especially with regards to the unexpected changes \u2014 you can brace for, and plan ahead for expected changes in routines.Therefore, consistency in routine is suggested as a good instructional, parenting, and employment tool.  It\u2019s also recommended for students with AD/HD as a support measure.But you know what?  Everyone is attached to their routines.  We like to get through our morning preparation without a lot of glitches. \u201cOMG, we\u2019re out of coffee!\u201d We expect holiday celebrations to go a certain way, and when two people become a couple they find out how many rituals were specific to their own families of origin, and then the couple has to decide how they are going to select and combine both of their rituals.People in general don\u2019t like having to adjust their day around massive changes in their schedule, and are more than a little vexed at unexpected and unavoidable challenges thrown in.  Airline travel went from something exciting to a dreaded ordeal as airport security became tighter and tighter, and the airlines restricted what kinds of and how many comfort objects people could bring with them on the plane. No, \u201ccomfort objects\u201d aren\u2019t just teddy bears or worry-beads; a wide variety of mundane objects like your favorite bed pillow, brand of soda and portable music player are also comfort objects.So why are some people so much more attached to their routines, and then undone when faced with changes?There are a several reasons, related to situational decoding, compensating, and attention-switching. Decoding problems are  the difficulties faced in understanding what is going on in new situations, and then deciphering what those events signify.  Compensating is about building up methods for dealing with the various demands required, as well as coping strategies to compensate for assorted difficulties.  Attention switching problems result because some things place heavier processing demands on the brain, and because of a strong need for a sense of closure.Situational decoding is a complex process.  If you have ever travelled abroad and then dragged through a market while still jetlagged, you have an exquisite idea of just how difficult even the simplest things are to deal with. You\u2019re exhausted from the jetlag or prolonged transit.  The store isn\u2019t your familiar chain, so you have no idea where they stock certain items.  All of the labels and container shapes are different, so you can\u2019t just run on \u201cautopilot\u201d and look for a familiar logo on a can.  Even the signs are confusing where some of the words are replaced by others that may or may not mean what you guess they might mean.  Once you have finally found more-or-less what you were looking for, \u201cParacetamol = Acetominophen, right?\u201d paying for the purchase is yet another hurdle while you sort out unfamiliar bills and coins.  Oh, help! \u201cI can\u2019t brain today; I have the dumb.\u201dYou expect to run into such difficulties when travelling; lots of people get disoriented with jetlag and being in a strange place. But it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d for someone to experience the same kind of disorientation under \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances, or to continue having bouts of disorientation after the first day.  And yet, some people do.  When someone gets too overwhelmed by all the sensory input or cognitive demands, the stress may cause them to have a melt-down (tantrum or anger explosion), a shut-down (withdrawal), or resort to some kind of stimming activity to sooth themselves and reduce the number of things being focused upon.  It takes time and practice to learn how to monitor yourself to notice when things are getting too overwhelming and that you need to take a break, before things get so overwhelming that the stress-response is mostly uncontrollable.The first two weeks on a new job, I spend the entire time in this brain-wringing kind of jetlaggy disorientation.  (Adding in the whole faceblind-related issues of sorting out different people and finally assigning names to those individual gestalts is yet another heavy load of cognitive demand.)  Unfortunately, once you have been on a new job, or in a new school for a few days, everyone assumes that you should have finished adjusting.  They know all about how things run, and where things are, and how to do things. But meanwhile, I am still dizzy from the novelty, and all the new people, and having to work harder to understand what people are saying because of auditory processing difficulties, and on top of all that, I am also trying to learn how to do a new job. Consciously or not, everyone else is evaluating the newbie, and judging how intelligent or useful or friendly they think the person is.How quickly a person sorts out a new environment depends upon a variety of factors, including the level of novelty (new towns, unfamiliar buildings, different equipment, packaging, signage, social rituals), the level of fatigue, the number of differences, or even the person\u2019s previous familiarity with decoding variations. Sorting all the sensory stimuli, deciphering it, \u201cpatterning\u201d it, and then creating sensible meaning to the patterns can take a while.This is especially true for the whole patterning part, because you have to perceive which elements are significant, determine if they belong together in the same pattern, and then figure out what the pattern is related to or what it means. Then we have to be able to identify when something is different or additional to the pattern, and the resulting significance to that.Physical environments have their own levels of significance.  Travelling to an entirely new ecotone can be confusing, not so much from the massive differences in plant life or terrain, but also because you do not yet know which kinds of plants, animals, geologic structures, sounds, smells, or weather changes are important to be aware of as meaning something dangerous or something interesting or even something tasty.Human environments carry their own different signifiers, and it takes a while to learn to figure out which items cluttering up the scenery are important and which aren\u2019t.  It can take even longer to figure out what things are not visible in the scenery but that you will need, and where you can find them and how you can get them.  Ever try to figure out the plumbing in another country?  Where\u2019s the toilet flush mechanism?  How do you turn on the shower? \u201cI need to perform basic hygiene; I don\u2019t want some bizarre plumber\u2019s aptitude test!\u201d Another part of human environments are the humans themselves.  People engage in a wide variety of interpersonal, social, and institutional rituals.  The rituals are there to enforce norms, to exchange meanings (as signifiers), and to provide acceptable and routine ways of getting things done.  Some rituals are general to the society at large, some are specific to the particular discipline, some are specific to the particular business\u2019 culture, and some are specific to individuals.(Sometimes the rituals are pathological, where the overt and covert signifieds are nowhere near close and may be antonyms.  Such rituals are there to perpetuate dysfunctional needs of some individuals or even the organisation itself.  People who have difficulty in discerning the meanings of non-literal communication, or who assume that others will engage in rational behaviour, are going to find especial difficulty working within and around these circumstances, and will quickly be the new targets and scapegoats.)If you are already familiar with many of these rituals, then they are easier to spot again and to understand. Or if you are familiar with rituals from psychological, sociological, anthropological, pedagogical or business theory, then identifying and deciphering the meanings of them will be easier because of that framework for identifying patterns.  Otherwise, you are in the thick of things, already with cognitive functions overtaxed, and trying to identify and decode numbers of different patterns and discern what is being signified, and what the appropriate responses are supposed to be.  It\u2019s very fatiguing, on a number of levels.If you have gone through several similar changes before, then you have built up something of a meta-analysis for figuring out how to pattern and decode new situations.  But even with having that meta-analysis, there is still the daily requirement to be able to identify and collect the data and analyse it.  Hour after hour, day after day.  Oh, and look perky and be friendly and master the new job routine and demonstrate that Yes, you are indeed a person who will be able to do the job well. If only you could have next month\u2019s level of competency today!Compensating I\u2019ve blogged about having to compensate for various problems. We all compensate for things, because nobody can do everything. The weird thing is that society does not deem such inabilities as problems, and does not even view the alternatives as being compensating strategies. For example, I get the maintenance and repairs on my car done at a service station, but that\u2019s considered \u201cnormal\u201d.  Having problems understanding voice-mail and asking for everything sent by post used to be considered somewhat abnormal, but nowadays cultural norms have changed and asking for text-messaging or e-mail instead is considered to be normal.But not everyone has to compensate for the same things, and frequently the things being compensated for  are not apparent. But if you are good at compensating, most people don\u2019t realise that  you are working much harder to achieve nearly as well.  If you \u201cpass for normal\u201d most days, people can\u2019t understand why you \u201csuddenly\u201d having problems when ill or stressed, or are simply trying to compensate for too many things simultaneously.The problem with compensating is that we rely on the structure of our environments and our habits to help remind us to do things and to provide the supportive framework that reduces stress and allows us to achieve things in different ways.  When our schedules are abruptly or unexpectedly changed, this causes stress not only because we are concerned because we don\u2019t know what new things will have to be dealt with, and because we are losing our system of supports.Attention SwitchingAttention switching problems result because there are more activities that require conscious, cognitive processing instead of easier associative processing.  A person can only use cognitive processing for one thing at a time, which results in highly focused, \u201cmonotropic\u201d  thinking.  There\u2019s simply not enough mental \u201cRAM\u201d to do high-level multiprocessing from a number of sensory channels, so some kinds of input are perforce less attended to.Attention-switching can also be difficult because of a strong need for a sense of closure. Even people with AD/HD experience this when they are highly focused on something of interest, especially when previous experience has proven that distractions will result in the idea of the moment simply \u2026 evaporating.  It\u2019s not that a preoccupied child cannot physically hear a parent call them away from the Legos to come eat dinner (which is sensory processing), but that decoding the meaning of the words gets stuck somewhere in the active memory buffer, and doesn\u2019t always get attention switched to it.  Or, the attention-switching has a lag time while the current thought is being completed.Oh jeez, it\u2019s time for me to leave and meet people at a restaurant for dinner!", "outgoing_links": ["http://a0.vox.com/6a00c2251d84868fdb00d41432e8206a47-pi", "http://www.bullyoffline.org/workbully/bully.htm#Why"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/03/16/transitions-ack/", "title": "Transitions, ACK!"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t19 March 2008", "body": "Last night I was digging through a giant box full of 35mm transparencies (slides) looking for specific pictures for a new class I\u2019m teaching in a couple of weeks. Naturally, the effort took far longer than I anticipated, partly because I kept finding other interesting pictures, such as vacation photos.  I finally did find what I was looking for, but once again, it was after midnight before I got to sleep.One picture was of me back in 2000 when I was building our backyard pond.  Kitted out in a tank top, a pair of knee-length boy\u2019s cargo shorts, a pair of leather gloves and my hiking boots, I was hardly a fashion plate.  But boy was I buff. I had muscles, and it showed because I was holding a very large chunk of limestone up above waist level. The long rock was about six inches / fifteen centimeters thick and wide, and stood on end it would have reached my hip bone.  The piece weighed about 90 pounds / 41 kilos, which is less than I\u2019ve ever weighed as an adult, so hardly something braggable in the world of bench-pressing barbells, but it was still a respectable lunk of solid rock to be schlepping about.Nowadays the arthritis slows down the yard work considerably.  I can\u2019t work as long, and it takes me longer to get going in the morning because I have to eat before taking my meds.  Continuing to do some form of weight-bearing exercise is important to avoid the osteoporosis that runs through my maternal line.  But I also have to take care to protect my joints against non-Tennis-playing Elbow and the stupid shoulder subluxation.I have to force myself to work out at home or the gym during the winter.  Frankly, this winter I\u2019ve been especially lax in doing so, partly because by the time I get off work I\u2019m so tired and achey I can\u2019t bear to go to the gym.It\u2019s funny though, how if you have a physical impairment, what would ordinarily be getting exercise somehow gets turned into Receiving Therapy after its trip through the \u201cdisability grinder\u201d.The last time I visited the \u201cPhysical Terrorist\u201d was a few years ago when I went to the university clinic for something-or-another.  I left with some over-photocopied handouts describing exercises, and a prize (better than any shiny piece of costume jewelry from the dentist\u2019s \u201ctreasure chest\u201d), my beloved rice sock for re-heating and draping across sore places.The PT encouraged me to come back for more therapy, but I found the exercises to be sufficiently effective on my own. I\u2019m not keen on people manipulating my body.  Other people think that if my joints can move within the normal range of motion, that I must be okay.  But in truth it means that I\u2019m actually injured and stiff because they are reduced in range of motion from my usual hypermobile state.  It\u2019s also hard to convince them that I normally have oddly-placed or large bruises about my body, and that I really can\u2019t remember getting them, and that \u201cNo, nobody is abusing me, thanks for asking.\u201dAny kind of therapeutic exercise is more fun, easier to do, more beneficial, and more likely to be engaged in and maintained if it is combined with one\u2019s daily activities, rather than done strictly as PT or gym exercises.  I continue to schlep my briefcase or luggage-size tote with my teaching references around campus (frequently switching which side I\u2019m carrying it on), and try to get in as many staircases as the routes require during the day.The turnabout is that even dull exercises can be more inspired or inspiring if I think of them as antecedants for doing the fun stuff.  I need to start stretching out and doing dumbbell reps again, because spring lurks around the corner.The daffodils are poking up through the mud and leaf litter, reminding me that I need to rake.   And once gardening season starts, I can get in lots of stretching, range of motion exercise, weight-lifting, deep knee bends et cetera, just from fun things like turning over and hauling compost, digging, planting, weeding, deadheading and all those other fun \u201cchores\u201d.I\u2019ll just be doing them for an hour at a time now, instead of eight hours solid.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t15 March 2008", "body": "I\u2019m going to tell you a story.It\u2019s about a recent presentation I gave on Auditory Processing Disorder.Afterwards one of the attendees had some specific questions,and I had some ideas to offer.  Here\u2019s how it goes:One of the things that I had mentioned that APD wasn\u2019t really \u201ccurable\u201d, but that one could improve some skills to cope with it.  She was concerned because the school had released her son from therapy some years ago, and yet her son was demonstrating obvious difficulties again \u2026 she was concerned and puzzled.As I\u2019ve mentioned before, a person can \u201close their label\u201d by having achieved the proscribed psycho-educational goals.  This means that the particular skills have been met so that the problem is no longer severe enough to warrant the diagnostic label.  The therapists, the school district that may have employed them, the family, and the child have all succeeded in the neatly-documented IEP goals. Whoopee!But in cases like this, although the child\u2019s enunciation may be much improved, and his phonemic awareness sharpened (meaning he is better at discriminating between different spoken sounds), that does not mean the APD has necessarily gone away.So why was the boy having so many of the familiar, discouraging, \u201cHuh?\u201d moments again?Well, I asked, how old is the boy now? Thirteen, she explained. Ah, yes \u2026 well, things have changed in the school environment.  Think about it: he was doing well in grade school, where one has relatively small classes with the same teacher all day long.  It\u2019s easier to know what\u2019s going on because there is a lot of consistency.But when you get to junior high / middle school, suddenly there are class changes all the time, with different teachers who have different speaking and teaching styles.  There\u2019s also a lot heavier cognitive demand going on academically as well, as the material is more abstract and is being assessed at higher taxonomic levels.  Students have to start taking more notes as part of their instruction and learning processes.  Things are much more complex and demanding now. Plus, the social world in junior high is a really rough place, which adds to the stresses.   There are a lot of changes to get used to and learn to deal with.She went on to explain that before the APD diagnosis, they were concerned because the boy was speech-delayed, and not very social; he just \u201csat in the corner and played with his Legos\u201d.  They\u2019d even wondered if he was autistic or something.I was nodding energetically again at this familiar tale (as are, I\u2019m sure, a lot of you readers).  It\u2019s quite possible that the boy could have something else in addition to the APD, as a lot of these things are co-occurring (\u201ccomorbid\u201d).  A lot of the symptoms tend to overlap, especially with AD/HD, Asperger\u2019s, or Non-Verbal Learning Disorder.There seems to be this phenomenon of what I call \u201cdiagnostic stoppage\u201d where if a person gets one diagnosis, it is usually deemed sufficient to describe most all issues they are having.  It\u2019s as though a person is only \u201callowed\u201d one disability, possibly because that\u2019s more one-dimensional and therefore much easier to deal with.As tutors, such problems with our own children are particularly frustrating for both of us, because one of the problems is that no matter how much either of us knows about teaching or tutoring, our offspring are quick to tune out any advice or suggestions we may have, because at home, we\u2019re just Mom (or Dad, as the case may be for some of the other tutors).On the more immediate end of things, she asked, what about all those \u201cHuh?\u201d moments?  Of course, the kid never seems to misunderstand when asked, \u201cDo you want to get a new video game?\u201d  But if you ask, \u201cDid you remember your materials to study for the history test?\u201d then there\u2019s that \u201cHuh?\u201d response again.  She explained that years ago the therapist said he had a \u201c15-second delay\u201d in processing.  Fifteen seconds is a l-o-n-g time.  (Seriously, watch fifteen seconds on your clock.)  What was going on, and what could be done?  Did it really take him 15 seconds to process the test-studying question but not the game-purchasing question? Parental skepticism and frustration and confusion and obvious love for her child oozed from her questions.Well \u2026 probably not, I suggested.  Of course, I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s brain, but I could describe the sort of thing that might be going on.Being asked if you want to get a new game is easy \u2014 you already know what new games you want.But being asked about the test studying is more likely about all the accessory answer-processing, than it is about  decoding of the sounds into words and the words into a meaningful sentence.  Think about it \u2014 you\u2019re a teenage kid, and you come home from school.  Your mind is already miles away from scholastic subjects, thinking about snackage and relaxing from the work day, when suddenly your mom asks you, \u201cDid you remember your materials to study for the history test?\u201dSo when he says, \u201cHuh?\u201d it\u2019s not so much about not understanding what was being said, as it\u2019s really more of a conversational habit and a place-holder, while he\u2019s thinking.   Meanwhile, his mind is churning with thoughts about Test? What materials was I s\u2019posed to bring home? History? What do I need for studying?  Did I bring it home?  How grumpy is Mom? Do I have to do this right now? Am I in trouble?\nWell, that made more sense as a possibility.  But how could it be handled?Well, at our home I\u2019ve a kid of my own with APD, and a hubby who\u2019s hard of hearing.  I have APD too, so you can imagine the potential for conversational confusion at times.  When I\u2019m being sufficiently self-aware I try to \u201cheadline\u201d queries. (Parents aren\u2019t perfect, especially those who are tired and/or pre-occupied, which is oh \u2026 99.9% of us.)You know how someone at work will stop you in the hallway and ask you a question, and it takes you a few seconds to figure out what they\u2019re talking about?  That\u2019s the kind of thing that can be going on.  Headlining is about alerting someone to the subject you\u2019re introducing, and giving them time to pull up the necessary information.   It could go something like this:\u201cSay, in your history class,\u201d(pause a couple seconds for auditory processing and recollection about history class)\u201c\u2026 you have a test coming up \u2026\u201d(ditto)\u201c\u2026 did you bring home the stuff you need for studying?\u201dWhat this does is to not only alert the person to the upcoming subject of query and slows down the rate, but it also does something else that\u2019s important.  The normal question (in English) would actually have those three parts in reverse order: \u201cDid you bring home the stuff you need for study for the test in history class?\u201dSo someone with APD is not only decoding a long sentence, but also trying to put the parts into order (sequencing is a common issue in APD), and also trying to figure out what they need to know to answer the question plus recalling the necessary information.The headlining puts things into the right processing order, and gives enough time to retrieve the necessary bits of information, review them, and assemble an answer.Additionally, it might be time for someone (else) to review her son\u2019s situation.  New demands upon his abilities can mean new difficulties.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/03/15/headlining/", "title": "Headlining"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 March 2008 ", "body": "There\u2019s something about the intersection of the loss of a child and thoughtlessness that produces a dreadful lot of dreadful platitudes. But your child doesn\u2019t even have to die \u2014 finding out that your child has an incurable disease or disabling condition can result in more horrible platitudes.Some people will protest that, \u201cWell, they mean well, so it\u2019s really okay.\u201d No. When someone says something cruel, or does something rude to another person, their \u201cgood intentions\u201d don\u2019t really amount to a hill of beans. Even using treacly god-talk doesn\u2019t sugar-coat the insensitive words enough to make them palatable.Finding out that you will have to learn how to do many things differently due to chronic illness or major disability involves some initial sense of loss for expectations of how life would be. But the situation is not analogous to having a child die. The parents have not \u201clost a normal child\u201d. The child is not dead, but very much alive, and still loved. Furthermore, the child would not be \u201cbetter off dead\u201d.Sometimes people pull out the platitudes because they want to \u201cmake things better\u201d. But a few saccharine words is not going to help. The death of a child cannot be healed by the verbal equivalent of a bandage on a cut finger. When at a loss for words at the magnitude of someone\u2019s grief, it\u2019s okay to be honest and share that, \u201cOh, I\u2019m SO sorry. I hardly know what to say.\u201d And if you can\u2019t think of anything further, then share a hug if these are hugging people.After the initial shock, share memories of the child with the grieving parents, rather than trying to make the social \u201cproblem\u201d go away by ignoring it. Don\u2019t suddenly drop the parents of disabled children from social groups, as though the family has contracted something horribly contagious.But please, don\u2019t pull out the insensitive platitudes:Don\u2019t be so selfish; you still have your other child.\nYou can always have another one.Children are not interchangeable, replaceable units, like dolls.Having another child won\u2019t somehow magically make a family \u201ccomplete\u201d \u2014 the family isn\u2019t defined by the number of members, but by who they are. There will always be a sense of loss for the missing person.God wanted the child with him.What kind of deity is so selfish as to deprive parents of their child? What, God couldn\u2019t have enjoyed the child\u2019s presence more by watching it grow up with its family?God\u2019s punishing you for putting your desire to have children ahead of Him.Make that selfish and vengeful. Where\u2019s the \u201cloving deity\u201d?It was God\u2019s Will.And you know this because \u2026 how?\nYour child\u2019s in a better place.How is an early death better than a full life?God never gives people more than they can handle.Nonsense; there are plenty of people who have cracked under the strain of grief, falling to depression or sometimes even violence.Everything happens for a reason.True, there are causes for everything. True, people can create extra purpose in their lives in reaction to events that happen to them. But I cannot accept that a deity required a child had to die for its parents\u2019 moral improvement.Think of the money you\u2019ll save; having one kid is cheaper than twins.Oh for ~~ one doesn\u2019t have children for budgetary reasons!Guess what \u2014 I\u2019m pregnant! It\u2019s like God\u2019s making up for the baby you lost.Let\u2019s blame the maternity hormones for that incredibly tactless, thoughtless remark, and hope that she has a full recovery.Haven\u2019t you gotten over that yet? You just need to pray more / work harder / think about others.Grieving for the death of a baby or child is not something over and done in a few days. Really, one grieves for the loss of a loved one the rest of their life \u2014 it\u2019s just that the grief becomes tolerable, and the memories more wistful than painful.You\u2019re lucky the baby died early \u2014 it could have been handicapped.Being disabled is not worse than death.It\u2019s for the best \u2014 she / he would have suffered from being, \u2018you-know\u2019 \u2026 Retarded. Crippled. Deaf. Blind. Palsied. (et cetera)Being disabled is not a life sentence of suffering.Well at least you have your other, healthy child(ren). You could even try again.If I have a disabled child, I am not about to discard them, nor decide that I have not succeeded in getting the \u201cperfect\u201d child that I deserve.God gave you a special child to teach you something.We all learn things from our children, and many parents find they learn unexpected things from children who have different needs. But such a platitude smacks of begin given a special-needs child as a prescription or punishment for a moral failing.It\u2019s just as well; so many sick preemies survive nowadays, and there\u2019s too many special-needs kids being a burden on society.The social burden is not special-needs kids.The social burden is people who feel they have some special hotline to heaven. The social burden is people who think that death and disability are divine punishment for sins. The social burden is people who can only see the disabled as those who are a useless waste of public resources. The social burden is people who imagine that a disabled person cannot have a happy, loving, productive or even [otherwise] healthy life.", "outgoing_links": ["http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2008/03/touch.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/piss-poor-platitudes/", "title": "Piss-poor platitudes"},

I blame the lack of caffeine; that\u2019s my story, and I\u2019m sticking to it.)Spring has sprung, at least in my part of the northern hemisphere. To celebrate the vernal equinox yesterday, I was out in the garden.  I\u2019ve been doing bits of garden cleanup on days when there have not been showers.  Or hasn\u2019t been snowing.  Or drizzling.  Or sleeting.  Or sprinkling.  Or frozen solid.  Or pouring rain.  Or thundersnowing \u2026No arthropods found yet, aside from some pillbugs, also called sowbugs, woodlice, roly-polys or ballbugs. People call them pillbugs because when bothered, they roll up into little pill-size balls.  But they aren\u2019t really bugs, nor even insects.  Insects have 3 pairs of legs, and these have 7;  with this many legs and flattened dorsal-ventrally (back to front) they are Isopods, a few of which are terrestrial crustaceans.  (I think these are probably Cylisticus convexus.)These weren\u2019t even out and about; I uncovered them when I slipped and skidded on a rock that rolled over in the heavily-saturated ground. As crustaceans go, they are small; the largest is about 1 centimeter long.  They look a bit like beans in plate armor, and are generally detritivores or eat the fungi that grow on wood.  Once in a while they can get out of hand and bother garden plants. Lots of school children (myself included) make temporary pets of them because they\u2019re fairly hardy critters.  You can hide a few in your pocket during recess, and then play with them at your desk instead of doing boring worksheets. And did I mention it\u2019s been raining?  I did find another Minuscule vid I hadn\u2019t seen before, with our hapless friend the little fuzzy black spider.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 March 2008", "body": "\u201cLuck is like having a rice dumpling fly into your mouth.\u201d\n~ Japanese proverbSo.  The eldest is in town for spring break and loves any sort of dumpling, so tonight I made cheese pierogi.  This requires making the noodle dough, which after resting gets a few pressings through successively thinner bands in the pasta roller (the hand-cranked machine is not necessary, but it does make the job a little quicker).  Of course, once an eighth of dough has been  properly flattened, it has to go someplace safe and the countertop is full of  other stuff, so  I hang the two-foot long sheets over the backs of the dining chairs.The sheets of pasta are then cut into circles (my official dough cutter is an old tin can with both ends cut off), filled with a bit of cheese mixture, folded and sealed shut, and then boiled for a few minutes before being served all slippery in butter.  Somehow there are never any the next evening for dinner, because a pier\u00f3g (or two) sounds like the perfect midnight snack. Or breakfast.  Or second breakfastes.  Or brunch. Or lunch. Or a tea-time nosh.After we stuffed ourselves with pierogi, to the point that we know to quit because our tummies are saying, \u201cEnough already!\u201d, contented sighing ensued, and after a while I got up to put away the leftovers.And then I discovered a forgotten sheet of pasta draped over the back of my chair.  Having leaned back against my chair, the dough was now stuck to the slats.  \u201cWhy didn\u2019t someone tell me there was still noodle on the chair?!\u201d I asked incredulously.  (What a waste of perfectly lovely noodles.)Hubby indicated that he\u2019d seen the dough there, but didn\u2019t think I would actually sit on it.  As if!\u201cThere\u2019s some stuck to your jeans, too \u2026\u201d added the eldest. I twisted around to look at my tuchis, and peeled more pasta off the waistband.  ::sigh::   If you\u2019re one of those people who has trouble with figures of speech, I will explain that is not really what they mean by food that \u201cgoes straight to your hips\u201d.  Cheese pierogi are fattening, but they are also dense, so there\u2019s a limit to how many you can eat in a sitting.Make these for your family.  Heck, share the fun and make these with your family by having them help roll out and fill the dough circles \u2014 just keep an eye out for stray dough pieces.  Like so many things, they take longer to make than to eat, but they\u2019re not really very difficult.  The sour cream dough is not only delicious, it\u2019s also more tender than traditional egg noodles.   Pierogi are Polish dumplings; I\u2019m not Polish, but like our eldest, I never met a dumpling I didn\u2019t like.PIEROGI WITH CHEESE FILLING(\u201cPierogi\u201d is plural; one dumpling is a Pier\u00f3g)DOUGH\n5 cups flour\n4 eggs, slightly beaten\n2 cups sour cream\n1 teaspoon saltFILLING\n1 pound Farmer\u2019s cheese, grated\n1 egg\n2 tablespoons minced parsley (optional)\nblack pepper, to taste\nmelted butterMix together the flour, eggs, sour cream and salt to make a dough.  Remove to a well-floured board and knead until the dough is smooth.  Cover and let rest in the fridge for half an hour until rolling out.Tumble together the cheese and other ingredients.  Cut dough into eighths for more workable quantities.  Roll out an eighth as thin as possible, cut out a circle, put 1-2 tablespoons of cheese filling to the side of the center, fold over and crimp shut.Cut any leftover bits of dough into long noodles and add them into the pot to cook. Gently drop pierogi into a large pot of boiling water, and let cook until they have been floating at the surface for a couple minutes.   Remove with a slotted spoon and lay in a heated platter, drizzling with melted butter; you can garnish with some more fresh parsley.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/andrea-knows-noodles/", "title": "Andrea Knows Noodles"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 March 2008 ", "body": "What do you do when you are trying to get a technical project started, or get feedback on it partway through, or even get it finished, and some of the people with whom you work have this strange inability to just reply to an e-mail or memo ?  You need information \u2014 simple data, and maybe a higher-up\u2019s preferences \u2014 so you can perform the tasks for which you were hired.  That\u2019s what you are there for.   Why is it so hard to get simple answers?  (One feels like Johnny-Five from the movie Short Circuit, \u201cMore input!\u201d)Asperger\u2019s / autistic employees everywhere express this same complaint.  Just give me the information so I can do my job.  But what if you also have Auditory Processing Disorder as well?  The Unruly Asides blogger ran into this recently, where she describes in a recent post how all she needs is some responses from a board member to produce a video.  But the other person won\u2019t simply reply with the required information in an e-mail.  They want to chat.  On the phone, because they don\u2019t even work in the office. Oy!If you also have APD, you need information given in a manner that doesn\u2019t work against you and make things more difficult.  You don\u2019t want to appear foolish, forgetful, rude, or uncaring because you are having problems simultaneously understanding what is being said in words, and how it\u2019s being said in tone, and why it\u2019s being said in interpersonal meanings, as well as being able to remember all those details later on.  The problem with auditory processing is not about hearing, but about understanding the conversation in all those other ways.Because listening to someone over the phone (or even in person) becomes a highly cognitive task to just decode the meaning words, one has much less ability to process all those other parts, the tone and interpersonal pragmatics, as well as the ability to keep the entire conversation in working memory (much less tack it up in short-term memory).  All this stuff going on makes it additionally difficult to reflect upon what the other person wants and needs (factually, personally-emotionally, and socially within the business heirarchy), plus being able to recall all the relevant information, and then present it as your part of the conversation.\u201cNormal\u201d people do all those things unconsciously.  They don\u2019t understand the problems created by those multiple levels of cognitive demand, or why someone would have problems talking on the phone if they don\u2019t have a hearing problem.  (Then again, \u201cnormal\u201d people simply think that hard-of-hearing people should simply be able to understand them if they yell \u2014 they don\u2019t realise that clarity is as important as volume.)I also have APD.  And I have also run into this before, especially with co-workers who are \u201cchatty\u201d and \u201cjust like to talk things out\u201d.  What I finally realised (in my 40\u2019s) is that not everyone else is so object- or objective-oriented.  These folks are not like Unruly Asides, myself and others, who view the flow of information or project development from systems-analysis perspectives.  These other folks are people-oriented.  Neither approach is wrong, but the contrasts in needs and approaches can make for some frustrating interactions.Here we are, focused on achieving the technical details.  These are mostly objective things, aside from some that are mixture of subjective and objective, such as \u201cI think this script font is prettier\u201d versus \u201cSans-serif bold fonts are easier to read when projected, especially on cluttered backgrounds.\u201d  For us, the communication is about getting the Official Permission, the feedback, and the data for a Go-Ahead on the project.In contrast, people-oriented folks are less concerned about the minute technical details of how the job will be done, than they are about the personal details about how the employee interact swith others, and how the job will affect others.  That sounds like a contrast between engineering and social sciences, but it isn\u2019t even that objective; people-oriented folks approach things affectively.  They usually need to feel comfortable with an idea before they can assess it in other ways.  (In contrast, object-oriented people usually need to understand things before they can feel comfortable with them.)By \u201cpersonal details\u201d I don\u2019t mean whether or not you are technically competent, but rather that the other person likes the voice-communication for the warm-fuzzy personal contact, and for the friendly reassurance that their end of the conversation is being \u201cheard\u201d.  For them, \u201cheard\u201d is less about auditory input than it is about the interpersonal aspects, that you acknowledge you are listening to them, that you respect them as a person and the official role they fill. They want to \u201cget to know\u201d the person who is doing the work, not in the \u201clet\u2019s review your resume\u201d sense, but in the \u201coh there\u2019s the nice lady who says hello and compliments my garden every time she walks by\u201d sense.They want to feel that you have taken  their feedback into positive consideration.  You don\u2019t have to agree with all of it, or use all of it, just be upbeat and enthused that they are suggesting stuff.  Instead of outright explaining why their suggestion won\u2019t work, (which would be taken personally, rather than technically), ask what it is about that suggestion that they like.For example, someone wants to use an antique Edwardian Script font.  Not because they think it\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d than the sans-serif Arial bold you had selected, but because they think it looks \u201cclassy, elegant, well-bred, and will appeal to the older clients\u201d.  (They may not even be able to express Why they like something, but you can offer different positive adjectives and then let them pick, as a way of sussing out their rationale.)  So, your reply would be something along the lines of, \u201cOkay, we need a font that has those important classic, cultured lines, and will also work on the background.  Let\u2019s try Lucida Calligraphy because it has those same qualities, and will be easy to read.\u201dIt\u2019s partly a matter of \u201cface time\u201d and networking. Despite what some people spend their hours doing, face time and networking need not be filled with social fluff \u2014 it simply has to be friendly, enthused (not gushing), relaxed (not overly nervous), and establish some bonds on the personal level through shared interests or experiences outside of work, \u201cOh, you have a Westie!\u201d (terrier).  This makes little bits of historical connection between people.  It\u2019s about creating comfort and familiarity between individuals.You could suggest meeting in person to get their valued responses on the project.  (If neither of you has an office there, then reserve the nice meeting room, such as where the Board meets; this will be quieter, and put the other person on familiar turf.)  Then look at the list of data you need, and come up with two or three examples of each alternative.  Instead of describing why some things won\u2019t work, present the ones that will, and give just a few good reasons why each one would be user-friendly (ease of use), help the client (personal benefit), and improve the company\u2019s social relevance (I hate to use the word \u201cimage\u201d because it has so many negative marketing connotations).This kind of approach circumvents a lot of the heavy-duty cognitive work by having examples prepared ahead of time.  Limiting the choices keeps the discussion focused on what information you need, and what will actually work.  Meeting in person, asking their opinion,  framing the questions and descriptions in positive terms, and also framing the questions and descriptions in a people-oriented manner will work with the other person\u2019s needs.That may sound laborious, but it\u2019s not just about getting the information for this one piece of work.  Having established that positive social bond will make future work easier, and a lot of people-oriented folks will be more inclined to just answer your questions in the future.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/amazon", "http://unrulyasides.wordpress.com/2008/03/21/need-to-talk-to-a-board-member-for-something-work-related-i-find-i-cant/"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/03/22/more-cross-cultural-communiques/", "title": "More Cross-Cultural Communiqu\u00e9s"},

Ettina is back, breaking out of rules that were not good for her, and finding unconventional ways of dealing with feelings.   Cherylberyl is taking advantage of a Independent Study period to also break out of some bad habits and create mature strengths; it\u2019s a very insightful post.  I\u2019m trying to deal with some feelings of my own on how to break out of obnoxious social situations of being given Piss-poor platitudes when faced with the pain of grieving (or, not grieving).  On the other hand, Amanda is trying to find a way to break out of the monotony of having her thought processes repeatedly blocked by a different sort of pain \u2014 there was a thought in there about the weird fairy-tale versions of disability that others have, but then \u2026Speaking of fairy tales, Simi Linton at Disability Culture Watch discusses how advertisers are trying to break out of stereotypes by featuring disabled people, but in fact are perpetuating some misconceptions (the term \u201csupercrip\u201d comes to my mind). For something really different, Sweet Perdition describes how an old horror movie, \u201cSpider Baby\u201d, manages to break out of the usual nonsense to explore some concepts (but not enough!) around the social ideas of disability.More social ideas about disability are being discussed at the Discovering Deaf Worlds blog, Dave Justice & Christy Smith report that in China, Yang Cui is breaking out of the four (and only four) traditional careers allowed for Deaf college students.  The dynamic duo also describe a visit to the Deaf community in Wuhan.  Fookem and Bug did not break their bottle, as they bring out an example of really old-fashioned woo with Dr Cooper\u2019s  Ethereal Oil for Deafness.  The Future Doc Wilson relates the tale of how parents are trying to break INTO the board meetings at St Mary\u2019s School for the Deaf because they are currently not allowed in, and there is plenty of contention \u2014 and secrecy \u2014 about a number of the board\u2019s decisions.On the other hand, did you know that the Illinois General Assembly may break out of the usual curriculum to add disability awareness teaching in public schools? Katie at Urbanagora has a whole list of things we never learned in school.  (Think we can get something more than a token nod to Helen Keller, with the lousy blindfolded disability simulation?)Omigosh, give the women wheels and they get all uppity-like!  And more power to them, I say. Emma the Wheelchair Princess just had to break out of her Good Little Patient role by remarking to other volunteers that doctors don\u2019t always know everything, especially about incurable conditions like CP.  Naturally, we are shocked. /sarcasm.   Frida writes up a bitching good list of 9 things, \u201cBeep Beep Beep This Important Message for the Abled Community  Beep Beep Beep.\u201d   Fruitfemme breaks out of society\u2019s limitations by Choosing my body, pithily noting that \u201cBodies on the margins have always had to fight for integrity.\u201dSarahspy breaks out from her usual \u201cpop culture nonsense\u201d to do an MS Walk.   Funky Mango breaks out the crystal to celebrate the 3rd anniversary of a chronic diagnosis \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing.  Bint Alshamsa writes from My Private Casbah, where she is breaking out from the usual oncological dichotomy: the news of being in an unexpected sort of limbo from being On the Frontier of a New Kind of Cancer Survivorship.Just when I wasn\u2019t sure just how to wrap up such a diverse assemblage of posts (and disability is nothing if not full of diversity), the fabulous Fledchen managed to come up with no less than seven aspects of what \u201cbreaking out\u201d means.

It\u2019s hard navigating unfamiliar streets and trying to read the signs and watch for passengers and watch for traffic and figure out how to get somewhere despite the one-way streets and angled streets and dead-end streets that confound my passage. I was stymied by streets that were closed for construction, and I found no less than four of them in this small area that was both experiencing both road repairs and the rehabbing of several old buildings. \u00a0So many unfamiliar things to be aware of \u2014 it was like being a student driver all over again. \u00a0\u00a0By the time I rejoined my kids at the hotel lobby, my head hurt, my eyes had that \u201cscrewed in too tight\u201d feeling (like when you first put on a stronger pair of glasses), I was randomly mispronouncing words, and was taking wrong turns down hallways. \u00a0Sitting around a hotel lobby and crayoning butterflies in my new coloring book was just what I needed to decompress.\u00a0It was the eldest\u2019s birthday. \u00a0We went to a museum, had lunch and went to some specialty shops, hung out at the hotel lobby to rest a bit, then went out to eat at a nice restaurant. \u00a0All these places were within the same square mile. \u00a0I figured I would drive down to the city, find a parking spot, enjoy the day, and then drive home.\u00a0I couldn\u2019t find my sunglasses before leaving the house, and it was really bright. \u00a0Then I couldn\u2019t find a place to park. \u00a0The parking in front of the museum is the short-term variety with coin meters, so I look for street parking, find myself in all the wrong lanes, finally give up on that, drop passengers off at the museum, and then go in pursuit of the multi-storey car park nearby.\u00a0Next thing I know people are calling me because I needed to already be there at the museum for the ticket time. \u00a0I\u2019d spent literally half an hour trying to get around a block to the correct turn-off into that\u00a0multi-storey car park, and then cruising circuitiously within the structure looking for an empty spot that wasn\u2019t either reserved for post office workers, or rendered functionless by sloppy parking.\u00a0Because Yes, an alarmingly large percentage of the people parked in that car park feel they need Sport-Utility Vehicles. \u00a0Not to navigate muddy, rocky pastures, nor to carry equipment through washed-out country roads, nor make deliveries up the rutted gravel side roads of mountain foothills, but to cruise around the rugged terrain of paved city streets to offices, schools and shops. \u00a0Older, crowded, downtown metropolitan streets, where the lanes are squeezed by parallel parking. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The old urban streets are narrow, and the parking spaces in such areas are also necessarily narrow. \u00a0But an alarmingly large number of people drive SUVs that don\u2019t really fit the given parking spaces. \u00a0A surprising number of them end up in that\u00a0multi-storey car park,\u00a0with a pair of wheels over the line into the next parking spot. \u00a0Some of the drivers are either so paranoid about their paint, so uncertain in their driving skills, so inconsiderate, or feel so entitled that they simply straddle the dividing line (centered over it) and use two whole parking spaces for their single oversized vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0Polysyllabic expletive! \u00a0There I am, part of a line of vehicles circling the structure, looking for available spots. \u00a0We drive along one side and then the other, slowly cruising up level after level in our pursuit of parking. \u00a0My Beetle is dwarfed by these overbuilt, gasoline-gulping, fat-arsed vehicles with their passenger windows that looked down upon my sunroof. \u00a0I finally park and rejoin the family. \u00a0\u00a0Then after the museum tour, \u00a0I am in the queue of vehicles waiting to go through the ticket gate to exit the pricey car park. \u00a0To my passenger side is an empty spot, and I pause to let an oncoming vehicle turn in. \u00a0The driver of the SUV turns to go across my lane into the parking spot \u2014 and then they realise that they are not going to make it at that angle and stop. \u00a0\u00a0They back up, and re-angle again to fit into the parking space.\u00a0Then they back up a\u00a0second\u00a0time, and re-angle a third time to fit into the parking space.\u00a0And even after that, they are\u00a0still\u00a0not parked between the divider lines.\u00a0Once finally positioned, agitated squawking ensues from inside the vehicle as the passengers do not have enough room to open the door and get out! \u00a0Meanwhile, the line of cars ahead of me had advanced, so I do too \u2014 obviously this driver needs space to manoeuver. \u00a0(I assume that everyone either crawled over to the driver\u2019s side to exit, or they gave up and re-parked it elsewhere.) \u00a0\u00a0Back when I learned to drive, we probably would have called such a manoeuver a \u201c4-point turn\u201d, meaning having to stop and change the direction four times. \u00a0Then again, we didn\u2019t even make such manoeuvers; we only did 3-point turns in lieu of U-turns when on narrow roads. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Slowly waiting for my turn at the ticket gate, I passed yet another such monster. \u00a0(The queue was really slow, hence time to take snaps.) \u00a0This SUV driver had backed the vehicle into the parking spot, which is no small trick. \u00a0Even so, they still were not centered between the lines. \u00a0(Maybe the vehicle that had been on their passenger side had also strayed over the divider line.)\u00a0Apparently the owner of the black car to the right of the SUV had come by and parked later, because it was centered within its parking lane divider lines. \u00a0I\u2019m assuming that the black car\u2019s driver was able to open their door enough to slide out, but it must have been a tight squeeze. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It took me a freaking HOUR to move my car from a pay-per-hour\u00a0multi-storey car park\u00a0by the museum to a free car park at the nearby restaurant where we would be dining. \u00a0I knew where I needed to be \u2014 I could see the restaurant. \u00a0I knew where I was (I wasn\u2019t lost) \u2014 I just could not get from where I was to where I wanted to be! \u00a0I probably travelled four or five miles, but when all was said and done, had effected a vector change of a whopping quarter-mile northward.\u00a0\u00a0So why was I driving around this large metropolitan area in pursuit of parking? \u00a0It\u2019s not that I prefer driving \u2014 I would rather be riding a subway or light-rail. \u00a0It\u2019s \u00a0because the public transit system in Big City\u00a0sucks. \u00a0No one can get the funds to develop a more viable mass-transit because too many people prefer their cars. \u00a0\u00a0(These digital photos were not manipulated other than to correct for lighting and to white out the license plates for the owner\u2019s privacy. \u00a0But it doesn\u2019t really matter where the photos were taken \u2014 those damn SUVs are EVERY-freaking-WHERE.)\u00a0", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/03/23/driven-to-a-frazzle/", "title": "Driven to a\u00a0frazzle"},

They don\u2019t teach you how to be famous. They don\u2019t teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don\u2019t teach you how to walk away from someone you don\u2019t love any longer. They don\u2019t teach you how to know what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s mind. They don\u2019t teach you what to say to someone who\u2019s dying. They don\u2019t teach you anything worth knowing.\u201d\n~ Neil Gaiman\u201cPay attention!\u201d my mom would command, \u201cLook at me when I\u2019m talking to you!\u201dAnd then I\u2019d wonder to myself, (Which? Pay attention to what she was saying, or look at her eyes when she was talking to me?)Eye contact among autistics is a funny thing; some can do it easily, some situationally, some rarely, a few never at all.  Interestingly, how well someone can make eye contact has no bearing as an indicator on how well one can socialize, the verbal-communicative abilities or other-communicative abilities, intelligence, sensory sensitivities, or any number of other traits sometimes associated with autism.  (I also work with children with other developmental disabilities who can make excellent eye contact, but have great difficulty with verbal communication and other kinds of social interactions.)Eye contact is also a cultural thing, as such is considered to be rude in other parts of the world, meaning that gaze aversion is not necessarily a problem elsewhere.So basically, one\u2019s ability to make eye contact when interacting with people doesn\u2019t mean squat in regards to other abilities.  It just means that making eye contact can be difficult.Personally, it\u2019s something I have to make a conscious effort to do in job interviews, doing public speaking, and in some conversations.  This conscious process distracts from other mental efforts, such as the extra work required by my Auditory Processing Disorder, and making the eye contact is also distracting in itself because it detracts from my ability to retrieve and process information needed for the conversation.  Some of my perceived \u201cmaking eye contact\u201d is really just me doing a little lip-reading when there\u2019s background noise getting in the way of auditory filtering and decoding.And yet, in this part of the world the eye contact issue is a big deal for some people, or so you\u2019d believe from reading various kinds of autism resources.  People spend great amounts of time ensuring that their autistic children learn to do this when they are expected to do so.Like teaching a Deaf child to lipread and use speech, some kinds of social training are emulator processes.  The perceived improvements in communication can be deceiving because the Deaf person is not necessarily getting the same quality level of communication from the process, and is working many more times harder than anyone else to get what they do.Recent research by Dr Gwyneth Doherty-Sneddon and others at Stirling University has shown that gaze aversion reduces the cognitive load (amount of mental processing required), thus enabling both adults and children to better recall information and to better formulate responses.  Requiring eye contact actually reduces the factual quality and the verbal complexity of responses.So when we teach and require eye contact, what we must ask is, Who really benefits from this?  Does it help the autistic?  Or does it mostly just make the neurotypicals (NTs) feel more comfortable?  Is the autistic really getting the same results (of being able to discern the non-verbal communication), or are they just going through the motions?This is important \u2013 it\u2019s not just window dressing designed to put others at ease \u2013 if the autistic person merely appears to be conversing typically, then the NT half of the dialog assumes that the rest of the communication is also happening.  And of course, when something isn\u2019t perceived by the autistic, the NT is frustrated and may erroneously attribute rudeness or lack of caring.  And/or, the NT is confused because the non-verbal signals the autistic is giving off don\u2019t jibe with what is \u201csupposed\u201d to be going on.In any regard, if one is not getting the real or perceived benefits, then it\u2019s just play-acting.  It\u2019s an elaborate social lie and a misrepresentation, and ultimately benefits no one.  Furthermore, trying to stamp out gaze aversion makes various kind of mental processing more difficult, and for crying out loud, no one needs more mentally-taxing work!Parents, therapists, educators and clinicians are focusing on the wrong thing (pardon the pun).  Eye contact or gaze aversion is merely a sidetrack issue.  What people are really concerned about is whether or not the individual of concern (child or adult) is truly engaged in the communication process.  Is there mutual participation, comprehension, and the ability to share understanding and information?  These are the real concerns that we need to be looking at.andrea", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/06/20/going-through-the-motions/", "title": "Going Through the\u00a0Motions"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t23 June 2006 ", "body": "Implementing personal change creates opportunities not only in the immediate sense, but also because you will find yourself connected to others in new and surprisingly beneficial ways.However, the ripples can ricochet back in unexpected manners. Personal change that moves towards social change is always a threat to someone \u2013 often masses of someones. People often find change to be a threat, or they find differences to be threatening. Agents of change that push at the paradigm are therefore met with resistance. (Excruciatingly earnest but ineffective revolutionaries typically underestimate the weight of social inertia that buffers systems against major changes.)But what is it that makes change \u2013 even social change obviously intended to improve opportunities for people \u2013 such a threatening concept? Why does challenging social assumptions create such opposition?A lot of it has to do with the discomfort of having the world view pushed and challenged. \"Cognitive dissonance\" is an emotional reaction to events that contradict what you know; they make your brain hurt, as it were. To be able to accept that what you are experiencing is real means that you have to change your attitude, OR if you are to maintain your beliefs then you have to change how you are perceiving things. So, do you adjust your understanding of the world, or do you imagine things to be different than they are?In this case, someone acting out of the paradigm (be it a social hierarchy, a expectation for a particular kind of social interaction, or a personal ability) challenges not just the hidden assumption that there is a paradigm. It also challenges that everyone must be contained and constrained within it, and that what they do is because of their position in that paradigm. It\u2019s an artificial social construct. It\u2019s not \u201creal\u201d except what we make real, and we can change that.If people can't imagine why you would act the way you do, they may erroneously attribute various motivations or faults to you, despite the lack of real evidence for such. They then try to \u201cput you in your place\u201d because you are acting out of character, and not fitting into the expected social r\u00f4les. When you are trying to push for social change of some sort, especially for acceptance of differences, you are going to get a lot of challenges to this new agenda of inclusiveness.People who assume they are normal can be trouble. They tend to go around changing the world to suit themselves; their standards are \"community standards\". \"I'm normal, so if I like it this way, almost everyone else will. Right?\u201d\n~Glyn WebsterInclusiveness is an extremely dangerous idea, because it redefines all of the miscellaneous parameters of what is \u201cnormal\u201d. A great many ideas about \u201cabnormal\u201d did not fully exist until someone came along and set down specific boundaries about what constituted \u201cnormal\u201d.Artificial boundaries exist everywhere. A lot of people\u2019s definitions of themselves are what groups they belong to, and those groups are partly defined by \u201cotherness\u201d \u2013 who and what they aren\u2019t. People who have spent their entire lives in a world defined by exclusion, where exclusion defines many of the others as being not-normal and therefore not-okay, often do so without any consciousness about this exclusionary paradigm. It\u2019s too entrenched and socially invisible.Inclusiveness will only become normal when there is no Other to exclude. To do that, we have to realize that in most ways, in all the important ways, everyone is okay-normal for who they are. (It is intentional behavior that is acceptable or unacceptable, not the intrinsic qualities of a person.) We all pay a great price when people must go around pretending to be something else than what they are and someone else than who they are, and trying to \"pass for normal\".andrea", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/06/23/moving-into-commitment-and-inclusiveness-part-2/", "title": "Moving Into Commitment and Inclusiveness (PART\u00a02)"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 June 2006 ", "body": "So much of what people have been blogging about lately is the necessity for major changes in what assumptions are made about the abilities and worth of people, all kinds of people, even those that have been considered to be of so little worth as to need removal from the gene pool or to not even rank the status of murder victim.High moral ground is easy to take. It\u2019s abstract, refers to grand sweeping generalities, and oddly, often doesn\u2019t make a lot of impact on our daily lives. It\u2019s easy to witness for big things against the big impersonal bureaucracies or in demonstration marches. But it\u2019s far harder to protest the steady barrage of small, deadly insults from family, neighbors, coworkers, neighbors, fellow church or club members and other acquaintances.Part of this lies in the fact that writing a letter to an editor, or posting on a blog, or doing a public presentation all give one the opportunity to plan ahead, to contemplate and improve wordings and rationales, and to deliver precise quantities of verbiage in a manner that is calculated to be clear and rational. You can define the problem and explain your position.Instead, real life happens.  And here we find ourselves in odd moments with unexpected opportunities to assert that NO, this is not right!  \u201cNormal\u201d injustices are easy to point out. \u201cNo, wait a minute \u2013 the end of the queue is behind me.\u201d That Mr Next-Guy-In-Line here in front of me is in a wheelchair doesn\u2019t matter; no one should be treated as a nonperson or noncustomer. (And then the interloper apologises to me for having cut in front of me, still ignoring the man ahead of me in line!)The unusual injustices are hard to point out. These are the things where the current paradigm so permeates culture that most people can\u2019t even see the injustices. When those are pointed out, most people do not even understand why they are problems. Pointing these injusticess out attracts dismissal. Expecting and then demanding fair treatment on someone\u2019s part earns denial. Being the recipient of denial and dismissal, not even being taken seriously, gives one the horrid sensation of fighting fog.Full-fledged denigration would almost be easier than denial. Anger (even excruciatingly polite righteousness) is easier to deliver. But being \u201con a mission\u201d when people fluff off your responses as unimportant or silly or borderline crazy or merely picky is very, very difficult.It\u2019s hard to advocate when people don\u2019t even understand what the hell you are talking about. You\u2019re not starting from ground zero, you\u2019re starting from the negative integers. You can\u2019t even protest the problem until you can define it for someone and then convince them it exists!Moments like that can paralyze one, especially when they happen unexpectedly, and you are left standing there gawping with profound indignation, but finding that the words just don\u2019t come. There are no set phrases laid down by Dear Abby or Miss Manners to initiate the right social scripts for some things. To ask for apology or to demand equal, human treatment requires the transgressor to understand the problem in the first place.\nHey, I\u2019m not crazy or contagious with some loathsome disease or going to harm your children or steal your wares. I\u2019m just exhausted from working nine hours and dizzy from the smells of the cleaning solvents and perfumes and new merchandise and all the crazy flickery lighting and background noises, and being ticcy, and having auditory processing delays, and flinching because my hyperacussis makes me overly sensitive to that sudden screech, and wearing my sunglasses inside because a migraine is creeping up on me, and HEL-LO Mr Cashier you don\u2019t need to turn your back on me so you don\u2019t have to acknowledge my presence and wait upon me, and Mommy you don\u2019t need to drag your kids away, and Ms Assistant Manager don\u2019t bother asking me if I want to sit down by the pharmacy so someone can call a responsible party to come fetch me. I\u2019m just a harmless shopper who needs to get a few groceries and go home and make dinner for the family and then get some rest! I\u2019m an otherwise Okay Person and I belong here!\nBeing able to advocate in such situations can be hard at first. It\u2019s certainly not a lack of desire. It\u2019s not necessarily a lack of ability. Given enough moments alone, some useful scripts can be formulated and practiced, to have on hand for those brain-dead moments. The hard part is overcoming the decades of inertia that have been trained into one. Be a good little victim.  Don\u2019t inconvenience people. It\u2019s not important. Who the hell are you to complain?Personal change is not always easy. It\u2019s not usually the cognitive impetus that is difficult; sometimes it\u2019s not even the emotional impetus. It\u2019s the inertia that holds us back, that prevents us from speaking up when something wrong is happening, or from speaking out and initiating changes. The internal change cannot be merely called forth just by wanting it.On the cusp of genesis is the threshold of inertia. You must gather sufficient momentum to force, to hurtle yourself through the portal. Up to that very grain of time is an oozing molasses of eternity that impedes the effort, although the mind is halfway on the other side. But mere movement is not enough, for mere movement is not progress. To overcome the inertia and move into change, you need sufficient commitment. Not just commitment to an idea, although that is first necessary, but commitment of the heart towards a goal, a purpose for something.Once that commitment is invested, the portal is not just a change from one room to the next, but a threshold that lets you fall upwards with a single large, fateful step \u2026\n\n\u201cHERE WE GO!\u201dPersonal change is dangerous, not for the person taking the step, but for everyone else. The person who makes that transition is pushing at the very assumptions of the common paradigm, because any major changes you make in yourself are going to create ripples that affect others.It\u2019s this ripple effect that creates some of the inertia \u2013 you have to want to step forward, not just for yourself, but also at risk of changing the way others relate to you.What helps create some of the crystallization of will is the realization that implementing change not only creates ripples, but also creates opportunities. \u201cNothing succeeds like success\u201d, and crossing that threshold is a success. It is not only a moment of empowerment, but also of genesis. It initiates a hub and lightning rod for other changes; you acquire some of the momentum of the universe, and previously unimagined and oft-unexpected things are now drawn to you; new webs of connectivity sprout and catch onto the new hub, and you find yourself meeting people and getting aid, encouragement and inspiration from unexpected sources. This liberation and delight also means that you are now an agent of change yourself, and can in turn connect with and help others \u2026", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/06/22/overcoming-inertia-and-moving-into-commitment-part-1/", "title": "Overcoming Inertia and Moving Into Commitment (PART\u00a01)"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t26 June 2006 ", "body": "\u201cBoy, you\u2019re asking for it!\u201d The teen towers over me despite being a stair lower, and the fierce glower makes me flinch away, which moment is my undoing.  The world spins as I am elbowed away, lurching drastically over the railing at the vertiginous two-story drop, then my footing slips and I am skidding down steps to crash on the midway landing.  The herd of students storms past me, an impediment to their passage between classes.  I didn\u2019t ask for that, I protest silently as I taste blood, still unsure of what had precipitated the swiftly violent interaction in the first place.\u201cWell, if you\u2019re going to choose to be irresponsible and leave your math book at school every day, then you\u2019ve just made the decision to not have any reading time tonight,\u201d declares my mother righteously. I meant to bring my algebra book home, really.  I\u2019m not trying to avoid the homework at all. I didn\u2019t \u201cchoose\u201d to forget my math book again.  Nor am I deciding to forgo my favourite leisure activity. Not at all. In fact, I don\u2019t remember being a part of any of that \u201cdecision\u201d process whatsoever. I didn\u2019t ask for that.My graduate school advisor leans back in his desk chair and announces, \u201cI need to know what your decision is.\u201d I\u2019m still numbly trying to absorb what-all his two page letter means.  A few months earlier after my first research proposal meeting, I had described some of my learning difficulties to my committee members, and each had said they would help. But now the results of such difficulties are being flung back at me, described herein as deficiencies.  He is informing me that I am being removed from a research Master\u2019s degree.  Decision? I have choices?  Apparently so. \u201cI don\u2019t make snap decisions about important things,\u201d I hedge, mostly because my brain\u2019s freezing in shock at this unexpected turn of events. The hourly bell jangles out in the hallway, making me wince as usual, which in turn produces a twitch of annoyance in him at my \u201cover-reaction\u201d. \u201cWell, let me know what you want,\u201d he says by way of dismissal.  After a few re-reads, the \u201cdecision\u201d proves to be rather a dilemma between outright quitting the program (not mentioned in his letter, but implied) or taking a terminal degree.  Which one did I \u201cwant\u201d?  I didn\u2019t ask for that.There is a seriously heavy, late-summer storm brewing outside, and the air is damp and prickly.  I finished the daily reading lesson ten minutes ago and am squirming hyperactively around in my seat with nothing to do.  My tights itch, and my dress sashes have come undone again, causing the calico to billow ticklishly. I\u2019m six years old and in second grade, and have not yet learned how to fidget acceptably; \u201cgood sitting\u201d, like \u201cgood penmanship\u201d, is something that I struggle to achieve.  I\u2019m wobbling on my chair from sitting on an ankle, and leaned over sideways across my desktop with one arm rocking back and forth off the side, staring distractedly out the classroom window.  Cumulus clouds are piling up into tumultuous towers and flattening at the top into an impressively green-grey anvil.  An actinic far-violet flash of lightning rips from one end of the cloud to another, and impulse wins out again \u2013 I am plastered to the window to see more.  \u201cAndrea!  Sit down in your chair.\u201d  The teacher trots me back to my assigned place, and no sooner than I get my behind on the chair seat, she clamps my shoulders to the chair back to emphasize how I am supposed to sit. \u201cYou really want to miss recess, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s reading time.  You need to stay in and read your assignment.\u201d  But I\u2019d already read the stupid story \u2026 spending half an hour more confined to my chair and reading it all over again, thus losing out my only opportunity to vent some energy and to go spinning on the playground carousel, wasn\u2019t what I wanted at all.  I didn\u2019t ask for that.Decisions?  Choices?  Hardly.Choices are between things you want, or at least will accept.  Situations like these aren\u2019t even \u201cforced choices\u201d. Even the phrase \u201cforced choices\u201d is part of the problem. (A forced choice should really mean a situation more like, \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve narrowed it down to coconut or fudge ripple; the ice cream store closes in five minutes, so you need to decide now.\u201d)  It still implies volition upon the part of the person.Situations like these really aren\u2019t choices; given more than one option, they are dilemmas or predicaments between bad option and worse option or intolerable option.  Some \u201coption\u201d indeed.Sometimes the situation is couched in the language of \u201cchoice\u201d, but has nothing to do with the person choosing for their self.  The consequences are really decided by someone else, and the language is a distractor meant to bamboozle everyone.  It\u2019s doublespeak meant to transfer the apparent (symbolic) power to the one person who in actuality has little power over the situation.It\u2019s also about obedience deceptively, attractively, cloaked as \u201cresponsibility\u201d.  If you\u2019re not being submissive to someone else\u2019s wishes, then you\u2019re \u201cchoosing\u201d to be irresponsible even if there is no malicious intent.  The punishment chosen for the transgression is tagged as self-selected and self-imposed, when it\u2019s anything but.If you \u201cchoose\u201d to have difficulties or misbehave, then you\u2019ve \u201cdecided\u201d to be punished by losing privileges like a much-needed recess, or having major plans derailed, (or if you\u2019re a student at JRC, missing some of your daily food ration or getting zapped with electric shocks) or \u2013I didn\u2019t ask for that.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/06/26/i-didnt-ask-for-that/", "title": "I Didn\u2019t Ask For\u00a0That"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t27 April 2008", "body": "\u201cClonal antibodies\u201d was the phrase that came to mind.  Which really had nothing to do with the news image I was seeing, it was just my brain doing the AD/HD-randomizer trick again.Or, maybe the words did have something to do with the photograph. I was looking at an AP Photo by Tony Gutierrez, one of many recent photographs of the mothers from the The Fundamental Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as they stood in front of the courthouse:Clonal was in a sense true.  All nine of these white women are garbed in nearly identical frocks, a rather loose-fitting style that the press is referring to as \u201cprairie dresses\u201d, made of plain pastel blue, lavender, teal or green fabric, with long sleeves pleated at the shoulders, bodices buttoned all the way up to the collars, and reverse-pleated ankle-length skirts.  Not only that, but they all have the same long hairstyle, with the bangs combed up into the French braid that goes down the back.  A couple of the women in the photo have greying hair, and there is some variation in height, but little else distinguishes one from another.  Antibody was (in an odd sense) true as well, in that their archaically modest clothing was designed to obscure the body shape, and conceal all but the face, neck and hands.But as I looked at the photograph (and other similar news pictures) I realised something unsettling:  I could not tell any of them apart from one another.  Aside from fresh military recruits in their uniforms and buzz cuts, I have never seen such uniformity in a group of people. (That some of them may be related to each other only adds to the similarities.)With my faceblindness (prosopagnosia), I don\u2019t really remember faces.  I end up building up a mental gestalt of other features that I use to identify people.  But when I am looking at a group of people, I can usually perceive some of the distinguishing characteristics, such as lighter or darker skin tones, longer or shorter hair, beards, glasses, unusual noses, tattoos and whatnot.  If I make an especial point to mentally tell myself, \u201cMary has a mole on her chin,\u201d then that helps me identify her (or it will, after I have sorted people out and figured out which names go with which bodies).  But if Jessica and Ashley both have blue eyes and long blonde hair and no unusual distinguishing characteristics, then I have a lot of difficulty telling them apart until I can pattern out their respective voice and gaits and mannerisms.One of the other distinguishing features that I use is clothing; most people have certain styles or garments that they wear on a regular basis. (I remember one researcher that frequently wore a bright yellow shirt, so he always reminded me of a goldfinch.)  If everyone is wearing the same style of clothes, then I have just lost an entire layer of distinguishing characteristics.  Even if their self-effacing clothing is slightly more modern than a burka or nun\u2019s habit, it still saps the individuality from the wearer\u2019s body shape, which removes a second layer of information. If everyone is wearing the same hairstyle, then I have lost a third layer of data.  When everyone has the same range of hair and skin tones, there goes yet another layer.  I have not listened to these people speak on broadcast media, but I am betting that they all have similar accents, having spent their lives in the same small community.  There disappears even more potential information.Because of my disability, I cannot easily distinguish the people around me.  And because all of these particular women have had no options in the way they present themselves, I really cannot tell any of them apart.  One polygamist\u2019s wife looks like any of his other wives, and their daughters are but smaller versions of the same.  Are people really that visually interchangeable to each other?  I have no idea. Presumably they can tell each other apart, from life-long familiarity.But as a faceblind person, I realise that I should avoid situations that involve lots of people in uniforms. I work in education, and suddenly the idea of school uniforms becomes very unsettling.  It almost makes me queasy.Even worse is the idea of being required to spend one\u2019s entire day, and even the entire life, wearing the same style of garment, and looking like everyone else.  It is appalling.  It\u2019s not that a person must show off or be ostentatious.  It\u2019s not that appearances are more important than the other qualities of the person.  It\u2019s that people are individuals, and should be allowed to present themselves as such.  Even when people dress similarly, they should be able to choose to do so.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/clonal-antibodies/", "title": "Clonal antibodies"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t29 April 2008 ", "body": "I did it!Today I actually put into action my previous plan.  It wasn\u2019t long* or eloquent, but it was polite.  A student made a remark about doing something \u201cretarded\u201d, and I asked in a sympathetic tone,\u201cPlease don\u2019t use that word.  You can say you\u2019re doing something foolish, or that you\u2019re tired, or even just being human.  We all have moments like this.\u201dThis post is a part of the annual BADD, Blogging Against Discrimination Day, which is being hosted at Diary of a Goldfish.  I spend a lot of blogging time discussing various disability issues, but for BADD I wanted to do something outside of the usual analyses. Like in my example above, I thought it would be useful to offer some alternatives to disability- or difference-related words that are frequently used not just as insults but also as disaparaging terms e.g. retard, retarded, tard, moron, cretin, lame-brain, spaz, mong, lame, having two left feet, cack-handed, blonde, gay, queer, psycho, schizo, short-bus, gyp, et cetera ad nauseam.Note that I said as disparaging terms; saying someone is gay to mean homosexual, or that your cat is lame because it has a leg in a cast is one thing, but dismissing something as \u201cThat\u2019s so gay,\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s a really lame excuse,\u201d is quite another.  (I will confess that I have used \u201clame\u201d in this way because I wasn\u2019t really thinking about it, but I\u2019m not going to any more.)In any regard, the acid-test is simple: when you are using a word that describes a group of people, or a characteristic of [a group of] people, and are using it as an insult, that is rude. The reverse is also true: if you are using an insulting term and ascribing to everyone in a group, that is stereotyping and rude. These negative words perpetuate social stigmas and stereotypes against people with disabilities. Using them continues to dehumanise people.  If the characteristic or attribute is something that a person cannot [easily] change, then insulting it or using it as an insult is wrong.  (Meaning, it\u2019s always open-season on ugly neckties, barring describing it with these sorts of words.)It is not enough to sit around and kvetch about what\u2019s wrong in the world; we must also offer things to do instead.  So, here\u2019s a starter-list of other words to use.  Not only do they not reference the negative stereotypes, but they are also less hurtful words \u2014 they take the event and keep it within the realm of ordinary human fallibility: things we all do.  In this way, we don\u2019t distance ourselves from other people as being other people \u2014 we just comment upon their actions.\ninattentive\nfoolish\nunwise\nill-considered\nrash\nsilly\nimpetuous\nfoolhardy\nreckless\nclumsy\nawkward\ninept\nsorry\nflimsy\nimplausible\nI would also like to direct your attention to The \u201cR\u201d Word Campaign.* Not long?

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 June 2006 ", "body": "Remember when you were a young school child and your class had the exciting event of a visiting speaker to the classroom? Later on after the presentation, your teacher then had the opportunity to use that event as the basis for an exercise on How To Write A Letter. Chances are the class\u2019 letters went something like this:Dear Mr Visitor,\nThank you for coming to our class to talk about blah.\nIt was very interesting.\nNow we know lots of blah-blah-blah.\nYours truly,\nA. Student*Having been the adult recipient of such, I can vouch that there\u2019s a not-so amazing consistency in the form that these letters take, and I\u2019m not referring to the construction paper covers. Whenever a number of people are invited to write a document, and their efforts are in direct response to a series of questions, there is going to be a formulaic quality to the answers.Requesting feedback on specific services in itself is not necessarily a biased thing; for example, when the employing colleges or inviting organisations ask the attendees for evaluations of instructors or guest speakers, there are specific factors about the presentation that are being assessed.However, when eliciting responses one has to be careful to not slant the wording of the questions so the responses are not biased. Similarly, verbal requests for impromptu responses or exit surveys must likewise be worded carefully to prevent coaching.It\u2019s very rare that every client or conference attendee will fill out an evaluation form; the office responsible for creating evaluation summaries has to realize that such volunteers are going to be somewhat self-selecting, if for no other reason than the fact that those were the people who weren\u2019t in a hurry to get somewhere else. On the other hand, a true evaluation has to look at all the all the responses returned. A cherry-picked group is never going to be representative of the entire cohort.When looking at any kind of response document, there are shadows behind the discourse that merit critical analysis. These include the unwritten assumptions of the author, such as who they considered to be their audience, what they presume the audience to know, and what kinds of details were deemed necessary to include to support the statements given.What is not included is also equally important. Unless the document is an expository theme or persuasive essay, there are beliefs about social reality that are built in the framework of the discourse and are not explicitly mentioned.These beliefs are assumed to be mutually held and self-evident. (You know, the sorts of assertions that when challenged, provoke a, \u201cWell of course we had to \u2026\u201d response.) Sometimes people aren\u2019t even aware of these world-views, because they are so encompassing, not unlike like fish being unaware that water is \u201cwet\u201d.I don\u2019t claim to be a forensic linguist, but as an author and behavioural observer, the following curiosities from the Judge Rothenberg Center\u2019s Web site (the 18 testimonial letters and excerpted quotes all referred to therein as \u201ccomments\u201d by JRC parents) certainly caught my attention.Like the children\u2019s thank-you letters, there\u2019s a formulaic quality to them. It shows through in the sentence structure and word choices. Theoretically it\u2019s possible that those letters represent the way the parents always compose missives; we naturally lack known writing samples for comparison. And yet \u2026 one gets the impression that there are leading questions that yield repeated patterns of content.Our child has X and did YYY. No place else helped him.\nJRC uses the \u201cGED\u201d skin shock device.\nNow he is controllable. The \u201cGED\u201d is the answer!\nHe has been there for years. We are very happy.Okay, that\u2019s a trifle simplistic; the testimonials that are letters are longer.  My example is a distillation of quotes.On the amazon.com site, you have probably seen the term \"statistically improbable phrases\", which refers to those constructions and idioms specific to the particular book being described. They are phrases that jump out of the text because they\u2019re not the sorts of things commonly found in writing.In this kind of critical analysis, if a writer inserts a few \"twenty-dollar words\" when the rest of the letter is just \"fifty-cent words\", they stand out. They are statistically improbable phrases, or compositional outliers. There will always be some terms that people will just pick up from interactions with staff (such as using the term \u201cGED\u201d). But in verbal and written communication most lay people don't go around using jargon specific to a particular discipline or industry. When those \"twenty-dollar words\" show up, well, one gets the impression that there likely are leading questions or requests guiding the effort. A prime example of this would be the Shields letter, which is composed of a series of declarative sentences, but also includes the expanded technical phrase:  \u201cGED\u201d skin shock device.Surprisingly, JRC is not just a temporary location for controlling children with behaviour problems; it\u2019s also an institution for lifetime confinement. Some of the inmates have been there for over a decade, at least as reckoned by the dates of their parents\u2019 letters.\u201cWe are the parents of a 35 yr. old autistic adult. He has been in this program since he was 19.\u201d (Shields)\nA 32-year old autistic adult has been in this place under the GED aversive system for over ten years. (Soucy)\nYet another person has been there for eleven years, also past legal majority. (Slaff)Another parent describes their child as benefiting from the GED (or rather, \u201cGED\u201d is the typed word repeatedly pasted over the handwritten note), because \u201cit helps her to eat better, exercise better, learn better, socialize better, and enjoy life better\u201d. ( Bognar) Personally I have to wonder how being the recipient of repeated electric shock punishment enables one to \u201cenjoy life better\u201d.Obviously, JRC feels the need to assert and validate the necessity for using the \u201cGED\u201d skin shock device; there are people such as myself who strongly disagree with the necessity and efficacy of using punishment. Lots of companies use testimonial letters to show off their satisfied customers. But this isn\u2019t about carpet cleaning. This is about people trying to convince us that systematic, repeated punishment under inescapable conditions, i.e. torture, is both beneficial and necessary.Now, what\u2019s one of our favourite fallacy flatteners?  The plural of anecdote is not data.  Or in this case, the plural of testimonial is not validation.andrea* Not to be confused with the author of Student\u2019s t-distribution, who was actually Mr W.

Well, it\u2019s not very useful to just stand around and kvetch about how bad things are; Podblack Cat offers even more Skeptical Books for Children (part 4), plus information about creating a Community of Inquiry in schools.

Let\u2019s have some good arguments and have a rational discussion about eugenics without the silly invocations of Hitler and the Nazis.\u201d But yikes!  Instead of annoyed and venomous chelicerates, he finds something worse:  a lid for the virtual Pandora\u2019s Box of Hitler Zombies, and ooh the trolls are vociferously stoopid.

There they are again, now trying to link Hitler to \u2026 Darwin. As Seth Manapio points out at Whiskey Before Breakfast, \u201cNow, first off, in the context of whether Darwin was right, it really doesn\u2019t matter if Hitler was a fan of his books or not. Hitler was undoubtably a believer in gravity as well, and that doesn\u2019t really reflect on Isaac Newton, and he was almost certainly a fervent believer in Displacement without that making Archimedes responsible for the holocaust.\u201dOf course, merely discussing something does not automatically mean endorsing it. Not that line of reasonable thinking has persuaded a single proponent of say, Abstinence-Only sex-ed programs.  WriterDD of Skepchick certainly had a youthful fling with such, and she notes that, \u201cBy the time I was 15 I should have been outgrowing that and learning how to emotionally and physically deal with adult issues and moral ambiguity, but I was afraid to.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t30 March 2008", "body": "Trichocereus candicansThere are few better times to visit a garden than when everything is unfolding in the fresh new flowers of the season.  If you\u2019re visiting a desert garden, spring is nice because it is not as hot as summer.*I\u2019m a serious \u201cgarden-geek\u201d and visit gardens where-ever I travel.  Hubby has perforce acquired a taste for gardens, albeit at strictly the tourist level.  He has even taken pictures of me squatted or perched in awkward positions as I strain to take pictures of plants, because well, that\u2019s what some of our vacation consisted of.  He will (most thankfully) exercise patience as I take pictures of giant compost heaps as well as rare blue poppies or blooming agaves.  We have also found that when you\u2019re jetlagged and desperately trying to stay awake to adjust to a distant time zone, a tour of a garden is a perfect way to get the necessary daylight exposure for the inner clock, and is a good opportunity to stretch and exercise airplane-cramped muscles.  Even better, it is an attraction that does not place heavy cognitive demands on the visitor just to enjoy it (which is important for those of us who cannot sleep on plane flights).So when hubby is looking for things to do with his papa, he thinks that a trip through a garden would be a great way to spend time together, and also get a change of scenery.  But is the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix accessible?  Hubby is hard of hearing, so pulling up their Web page on his Blackberry is his first route of information.  But he can\u2019t find the information he seeks, and then tries phoning.  Unfortunately that just yielded the annoying automated system. When you cannot understand the recorded message, having to go through the entire phone tree again to listen to it a second time is not only frustrating and laborious \u2014 the message is also not likely to be any more intelligible the second time around!Well, this lack of accessible information about site accessibility is really vexing.  It\u2019s also really surprising \u2014 Phoenix and the surrounding cities are full of seniors, due to the climate.  One would hope that large portions of the garden would be accessible for wheelchairs and walkers, but gardens aren\u2019t always.  In fact, many botanic gardens have gravel or wood chip pathways, or even put flower beds way out between expansive lawns, which turns garden tourism into wheelie triathalon events.Meanwhile, I\u2019m hanging around bored in an automotive waiting room as I get a dead headlamp replaced. Receiving his frustrated text message, I then start my own search.  I find that lack of accessibility information puzzling, and do a quick tour of their site, but it doesn\u2019t give any immediate answers. Huh. When I type \u201caccessibility\u201d or \u201cwheelchair\u201d into their Search box, it doesn\u2019t yield any page results, nor do the less-favored words \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201chandicapped\u201d.  That\u2019s odd \u2026 I then start reading through each of the different pages, and down at the bottom of the Hours and Admissions page there is a line stating, \u201cStrollers, scooters, wheelchairs and umbrellas are available to rent.\u201dWell, the Web site is pretty, and the page tabs are sensibly organised, but the search function is mediocre \u2014 entering \u201cwheelchair\u201d yields null results, and a visitor has to type in the plural form, wheelchairs, to get even this single bit of information!Presumably if they rent wheelchairs, there are accessible areas.  But how much of the garden is accessible?  Just the main building with the ticket gate, gift shop, caf\u00e9, restrooms and such?  The building and the main pathways? Most of the pathways?  We can\u2019t tell.::sigh::  Hubby looked through the photos on the Web site, and amongst all the close-ups of flowers, smiling faces, and architectural angles, he saw a few scenes of what looked like brick-cobble paths or gravel.  He texted back to me, \u201cI\u2019m suspicious.  The pictures I\u2019m seeing of the trails are not paved \u2014 instead they are hard ground or bricked.  Are paths smooth and clear?  The littlest bump or rock can make it difficult.\u201dI replied back, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long, I don\u2019t recall precisely, and that data is old to boot.  Call and ask what sort of paving; I remember some sidewalks and some hard-packed caliche.\u201dBut stymied by the lack of information, hubby finally gave up on that idea, and the two of them went elsewhere.  It may have been that the garden would have been sufficiently accessible, but to find out would have required a long drive out there, paying the entry fees, and then a long drive somewhere else if it didn\u2019t work out.  The  lack of accessible information about site accessibility had halted their entry to the garden just as surely as an ocotillo fence.  (More story below picture.)\u00a0Ocotillo: Fouquieria splendensI\u2019ve been to a number of botanic gardens in several countries.  Not until recently have I begun to make mental note of accessibility issues, and I don\u2019t have the first-hand perspective of being a wheelchair user.  But I can say that in the US, UK and Europe, botanic gardens will usually  have fully-accessible caf\u00e9s and restrooms, with the older places having more-or-less accessible facilities.  A visitor can expect the usual handicapped parking spots, and the curb-cuts between the parking area and the entrance. Some gardens have ticket windows or information counters that are low enough for a wheelie, and those with turnstyles at the entrance will have additional gates for access, albeit generally further away from the ticket windows.  (Gotta love all that unnecessary to-ing and fro-ing between the access points and the main pathways. /sarcasm)In contrast, garden gift shops are usually a lost cause.  Although the doors are accessible and the clerks willing to get things out of reach, the interior of every such boutique I have ever visited has been a traffic flow nightmare.  For inexplicable reasons, the gift shops are always in rooms that are really too small for all the (overpriced) merchandise being sold, so the books and clothes and tools  and postcards and dishware and souvenir swag and more books and sweets and greeting cards and terra cotta and games and periodicals and clogs and botanical prints and statuary and tchochkes and seed packets are all vying for space and attention, crowded onto every single tabletop, counter, shelf, wall, window and everywhere on the floor.  Shops like these are challenging for able-bodied people to navigate, and I have yet to see anyone in a wheelchair or walker more than a few feet past the door. (Such shops are positively horrifying to the parents of impulsive toddlers for all the attractive and expensive fragiles, and being a clumsy and impulsive sort myself, I will frequently walk around with my hands clasped at chest level and elbows drawn in, like a nervous mantis.)Even beyond the building, there are those aforementioned paving issues and other problems as well.Gardens put in pathways for a variety of reasons, not only to improve traffic flow and wayfinding, but also to keep their specimens from being trampled. The downside to paved paths is that they have the potential to reduce the amount of interaction between the visitor and the plants. Gardens can be highly sensory experiences, but only if designed that way. Displays that are all look-and-don\u2019t-touch become low on sensory variety. A fragrant rose that is in a sea of mulch surrounded a moat of pruned shrubbery is safe from \u201cfinger blight\u201d, but is also limited to just a visual experience.And if you\u2019re restricted to the pavement, are the various signs legible?  To be sure, many gardens have plant labels in with the specimens, which is necessarily unavoidable. Sadly, many individual plant labels are unclear because bulbs go dormant, plants flop or spread, and frequently there are several plants at different levels. Without any line-drawings of leaves, flowers or seedpods, visitors can only guess which label applies to which of the visible plants.  Yet most botanic gardens exist not just as pleasure gardens, but also as teaching gardens.  Therefore they have larger signs providing info-bites about the particular functional groupings of the plants.  I have seen an absurd number of signs placed well away from paths, up steep rocky slopes, or nailed two metres high up a tree trunk, and even a few that were facing towards fenced-off areas, where no one but a few smart birds could read them.  Maybe those people with binoculars in hand aren\u2019t looking for Gila woodpeckers nesting in saguaro cacti, but (unlike the visitor pictured below) simply want to read the educational signs without making expeditions across the scree of decomposed granite. \u00a0Later on, hubby reported about the alternative expedition they had taken, a scenic drive: \u201cWe went to a national forest with a lake, and then took a dirt road up into the mountains where there wasn\u2019t a soul. Massive yellow wildflowers in bloom. Will send you pictures when we get back to house. Wish you could have been here to see it.\u201d* On the other hand, in Arizona the \u201cmonsoon\u201d rains in July to September can produce fabulous acres of blooms.", "outgoing_links": ["https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/desertbotphx_triocereus-candicans.jpg", "http://www.dbg.org/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliche_%28mineral%29", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/desertbotphx_ocotillo-fence.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/desertbotphx_reading-sign.jpg"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/repelled-from-the-garden/", "title": "Repelled from the\u00a0Garden"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t31 March 2008 ", "body": "The last time I taught one of my gardening classes, I ran into an interesting intersection of  personal change, horticulture, and pedagogy.At the end of the sessions, the students have (optional) evaluation forms to fill out about the class and instructor.  On the front is a ranking various qualities of the facility, the topic, the instructor and so on, and the back has open-ended questions about what you liked best, suggestions for improvement, other courses and what-not.  These review forms are very helpful to both myself and the college.During the last class, under the \u201cwhat you liked best\u201d section, I got a comment that I\u2019ve never had in 15 years. Usually the positive remarks are about the handouts, the photographs, my sense of humor, and willingness to answer questions.  But today one of the evaluations had minimal responses, aside from this comment:\u201cPermission to change things in my garden.\u201dProbably the prompting remark on my end was something to the effect of, \u201cSome hostas have gorgeous, fragrant flowers, but some hostas have stupid little flowers. If you don\u2019t like the flowers on your hostas (which are usually grown for their foliage), it\u2019s okay to cut them off. The \u2018Plant Police\u2019 won\u2019t come and get you.\u201d It\u2019s one of my advice-as-shtick bits, and usually generates a few chuckles, so they remember it better.Sometimes in classes people ask about pruning shrubs.  Now on my end, I\u2019m less interested in the how-and-when of shrub pruning as much as why they\u2019re asking.  Usually the replies run along, \u201cWell, it keeps growing back!  And it\u2019s under my picture window/ by the front stoop/ et cetera.\u201dThere are a couple things going on: you can\u2019t really change the genes of the plant (nice plant, bad location), and sometimes we inherit poorly-placed plants put in by previous owners, or the home builders.  I\u2019m sure that over 90% of home builders know nothing about landscaping, and they plant these widdle 1-gallon size shrubs around houses to make them sell well.  Nevermind those Japanese Yews or Junipers are really Great Dane puppies, and then a few years down the road \u2026  well, you know how the story goes. Pruning such shrubberies is not a long-term solution; they\u2019ll just keep growing back.Sometimes people just have old shrubs that are half-dead and ratty. Amazingly, lots of people feel they need the \u201cpermission\u201d of someone \u201cofficial\u201d to cut down or rip out ugly, half-dead stuff!  I tell them, \u201cHey, if it\u2019s dead, cut it off. If you don\u2019t like it, rip it out!\u201d  Jeez \u2026 liberation by shovel.  Go figure.What is curious about the whole comment was not only that someone felt they needed that permission to effect a change in their existing landscaping, but that they realised they had that need, and were thankful for the opportunity.But gardeners don\u2019t really need my \u201cpermission\u201d to remove ugly, half-dead or unwanted plants from their landscape.  It\u2019s their yard.  They come to classes to get questions answered, and a whole bunch of information on a topic that is organised into fairly painless, digestible bites, with data to take home and review at their leisure.It\u2019s not just gardeners. Many people feel they need permission to make changes in their lives.Sometimes when people make changes, they face opposition by others.  It\u2019s not just replacing grass with flowers, getting a different haircut, or switching a college major.  When people make internal changes, they also change interpersonal dynamics.  Even if the internal changes and the resulting interpersonal dynamics are healthier, the others who benefitted in some way from the old dynamics (however dysfunctional) are vested in keeping the status quo.When we ask others for permission to change, sometimes we are not asking for permission so much as encouragement and reassurance that the idea is sound and that others will be supportive.There\u2019s a phrase one hears sometimes, \u201cBloom where you grow.\u201d  Like other trite homilies, it pretends to be profound, and sometimes is used to beneficial effect.  It can mean, \u201cFind imaginative and happy ways of making the best use of what you have to work with in life.\u201d  This is fine.I\u2019ve also heard the same trite phrase used in very negative ways.  That probably sounds odd; surely I misunderstood.  But no, sweet little fluffy homilies can be used to smother people just as can feather pillows.  \u201cThis is what you\u2019ve been given, and you shouldn\u2019t hope for or ask for anything else; don\u2019t you go getting above yourself.\u201d  Instead of a volunteer flower blooming beside the sidewalk, the person has become the target of a merciless Procrustean \u201cturf-head\u201d who is adamant about keeping everything shaved down to an even height.Here the gardener can well understand the plight of the little girl in The Secret Garden:\u201cMight I,\u201d quavered Mary, \u201cmight I have a bit of earth?\u201dOf course!

Thanks to the vaccination program, measles is no longer endemic in the United States, and ongoing transmission of the virus was declared eliminated in 2000.Of all the infectious diseases that can be prevented by vaccine, measles was and still is the\u00a0most deadly, and is the cause of half of the one million deaths that could be prevented. The World Health Organization says that,Children usually do not die directly of measles, but from its complications. Complications are more common in children under the age of five or adults over the age of 20.The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (a dangerous infection of the brain causing inflammation), severe diarrhoea (possibly leading to dehydration), ear infections and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death associated with measles. Encephalitis is estimated to occur in one out of 1000 cases, while otitis media (middle ear infection) is reported in 5-15% of cases and pneumonia in 5-10% of cases. The case fatality rate in developing countries is generally in the range of 1 to 5%, but may be as high as 25% in populations with high levels of malnutrition and poor access to health care.I\u2019ve also previously described the various fallacies around the conspiracy theories related to vaccines in my post, \u201cEpidemics of bad science, vs Epidemics and bad science\u201d.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 May 2008 ", "body": "Because you can get there so much faster if you use a big machine to throw you right over annoying factual hurdles in your way.I\u2019ve been meaning to dissect this issue for over a week, but a lot of things have been happening over here. A recent news story has prompted a lot of discussion, some of it rather ugly.  The short of it (and the news article in the Chicago Tribune is not terribly long) is that a 29-year old woman identified only as \u201cK.E.J.\u201d has been granted an appellate opinion in her favor.  The woman experienced a traumatic brain injury as a child, and according to the wording of the article, \u201ccannot be left alone to operate a stove or perform most household chores\u201d, although by having that bit of information alone, our perceptions of her are biased because it does not mention what she is capable of doing. Her legal guardian, an aunt, had filed a petition with the court to have her (fallopian) tubes tied.  All three judges on the panel were unanimous in their decision against this action.\u201cTubal ligation is a particularly drastic means of preventing a mentally incompetent ward from becoming pregnant,\u201d Judge Joseph Gordon wrote in the 36-page opinion. There are \u201cless intrusive and less psychologically harmful [birth-control] alternatives.\u201dThe readers\u2019 comments were much longer than the article, and many were downright rude. This situation is so fraught with over-generalisations and false dichotomies and conflations that it fair makes me dizzy. The biggest and most common fallacy of the lot was the combined false dichotomy + slippery slope assertion that it\u2019s Either she gets a tubal ligation Or she\u2019ll be popping out babies that she can\u2019t take care of and we\u2019ll be spending our tax dollars to support.  [Bang head here.]  More thoughtful discussions of this issue are to be found over at Feministing, although excursions into the Realm of Stoopid by some of the commenters are to be found there, too.Nowhere does the article state that she has a boyfriend.  Nowhere does it state that she is even having sexual relations with anyone at all.  Apparenlty she likes children, and the article quotes her,At a bench trial in 2005, K.E.J. testified that she hoped one day to have children. \u201cI will love taking care of them,\u201d she said. \u201cI will love, you know, to see how they grow.\u201dBut that is not to say that she is actually planning on having children of her own. That would involve having an intimate relationship with a man, and getting pregnant. Lots of people like children but never actually have any of their own.That disabled people are more susceptible to abuse is a problem, but a shocking number of people seem to leap right past the fact that sterilising people does not prevent abuse or rape. It just means that pregnancy cannot occur, so the abuse can more easily be perpetuated, because the results are more invisible.  Sexual abuse can also  involve other secondary problems beyond trauma and pregnancy, such as communicable diseases.There\u2019s a very bad history of forced sterilization upon disabled and/or poor people, and yes, I\u2019m talking about events in the U.S., and yes, even in recent decades.  A person could be subjected to forcible surgery for such eugenic reasons as being blind, deaf, epileptic, poor, of a native (aboriginal) race, of mixed races, alcoholic, having a physical deformity, cognitive disability or perceived mental illness.The whole point to such legal actions is that adults have the right to decide whether or not someone else will perform invasive, permanently altering surgery (pun intended).  The issue is less about whether or not she ever wants to have children, and more about whether or not she is allowed to decide if she can even make that decision in the future, or whether she will be forced to undergo surgery for someone else\u2019s convenience.Saying that you don\u2019t want to be forcibly sterilized is not the same thing as saying you want to have lots of children.Saying that you don\u2019t want to be forcibly sterilized is not the same thing as saying you are planning on having children.Honestly.  The woman has difficulties with some kinds of tasks in life, but she\u2019s still an adult.  She still knows what she does and does not want in life.  That the woman\u2019s aunt wants to do this really says more about the fact that there are insufficient social supports for care-giver respite, and for support services for people with disabilities (PWD) to live independently or semi-independently.  The problem is not that PWD exist, but that societies have not yet figured out how to better support members so they can in turn be happier, more socially integrated and more functional at home and in the workplace.I\u2019ve previously discussed how PWD are lumped into false dichotomies of devils or angels; the angelic disabled person is not-quite-human, a tragic but romanticized virgin on a pedestal of virtue.  But we are all human, and adults are still adults.  Having cognitive disabilities does not make one a mental child, it makes one an adult with adult feelings and interests and with fewer aptitudes for abstract learning.There\u2019s a difference between saying that people should be forcibly sterilized and that a particular individual would not want or be able to care for children.  There really is \u2014 it\u2019s about people having choices in their lives. Certainly not everyone who can bear children does.  Certainly there\u2019s no shortage of humans in the world, but I would think that the real concern instead would be about the people who have large families for lack of contraceptive availability. (Out of the millions of people on the planet, cases like this about the forced sterilisation of disabled people are not going to force the tipping point for zero population growth.)It\u2019s also pretty damn important to remember that sexual reproduction requires both male and female gametes \u2014 sperm and eggs.  If the woman is not able to tolerate various forms of birth control (due to other medical conditions), then the man she may be with can certainly undertake the responsibility for the birth control.  Duh!It\u2019s dangerous to assume that because a person has some kind of disability that they cannot be a good parent. (It\u2019s also equally dangerous to assume that just because someone does not have a disability that they automatically can be a good parent.) There are a surprising number of people out there with erratic skills levels. No court would blink twice at giving someone like my hubby child custody, even though he can hardly cook, doesn\u2019t know how to repair plumbing, couldn\u2019t sew together a garment, and can hear very little with his hearing aids off. But he\u2019s a white male who makes a good income, so therefore he\u2019s one of the favored class. On the other hand, a woman of color who could cook, fix plumbing, sew garments and was blind and/or unable to walk would not nearly as likely be viewed as a suitable parent. And what\u2019s the difference? It\u2019s about perceptions about \u201csuitability\u201d, which in reality have nothing to do with the actual parenting skills of either person! (This is no slur against my husband; he\u2019s a good dad.)Speaking of gender biases, were she male, would the guardian be as adamant about forcing a vasectomy?Granted, it\u2019s best to not have children when your current circumstances would make rearing them very difficult.  But anyone who claims that \u201cpeople who can\u2019t take care of children shouldn\u2019t have them\u201d is operating on false generalisations, because anyone and everyone can become impoverished or severely disabled.  And if that happened to you tomorrow, would you suddenly become an unfit parent?  Would it justify breaking up your family and depriving children of the parents who love them?  Of course not.Many people are concerned about placing the potential well-being of an imaginary child against the current well-being of an existing, real adult person. Since when are hypothetical people more important than real ones?  Furthermore, even if she did have a child someday, she wouldn\u2019t be doing it all by herself; there would be father involved.  It also drives me nuts when people assume that to be able to do something, one must somehow be able to do everything all by themselves.  Since when does anyone rear a child all by their self for 18-22 years?  No one does.  So it\u2019s really a false dichotomy to say that a person must be able to do everything all by themself to rear a child, or they shouldn\u2019t have children.Once again, this also runs along class lines \u2014 there are some really rich people out there who have little hands-on work in doing their own housekeeping or child-rearing, but it\u2019s somehow all okay because they can afford to pay someone else, rather than because they cannot do all of the tasks on their own.Another one of those giant leaps that commenters are making is applying one person\u2019s case to all disabled people.  There are blanket assumptions that people with disabilities cannot be good parents, or that not being able to be an effective parent justifies outright sterilisation.  The judges are correct in looking at cases individually, and deciding that drastic measures should not be automatically granted nor are necessary.Would K.E.J. be a good candidate for parenthood?  It\u2019s hard to say for sure, because we don\u2019t really know what her full range of skills are.  Chances are likely not.  But that doesn\u2019t mean that she is even planning to do so.  And as the judges point out, that does not justify forcing her to undergo a tubal ligation.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-sterilize-mentally-disabled-web-apr19,0,3957842,print.story", "http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2008/04/19/illinois-court-rules-against-forced-sterilization-of-disabled-woman/"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/05/03/catapulting-to-conclusions/", "title": "Catapulting to Conclusions"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t4 May 2008 ", "body": "It\u2019s spring, and with spring we were once again entertaining the invasion of the Little Black Ants*.  (Yes indeedy, sometimes the common names of insects are actually straightforward, and we have things like Little Black Ants or Soft Brown Scale.)   Every year I put out the bait traps and spend several days sponging most of the 3 mm. arthropods off the counters and drowning them in the sudsy dishwater, until the rest of the wee bastards have taken enough poison back to crash the colony.Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I like ants.  I think they\u2019re fascinating, and spent many happy hours of my childhood watching them.  I just don\u2019t want them in my house any more than they want me in theirs.It\u2019s tiresome for me, and it\u2019s tiresome for the family who are subjected to mum\u2019s infobites about the Formicidae, although this past week the kid finally understood why the alien race from the Ender\u2019s Game books was called the Formics.  (However, ants have nothing to do with Formica plastic, which just goes to show that etymology is as convoluted as entomology.)Ants will of course, leave trail-pheromones for other ants to follow, and these were all energetically tracking around in their proscribed invisible-Tube map pathways around my sink, the faucet, the countertops, the splashback tiles, the Kitchen-Aid mixer, the breadbox, the cutting board, the knife block, the dish (draining) rack, the electrical sockets and switches, the toaster oven, the stovetop (range), the sugarbowl and butterdish (both of which have lids \u2014 hey, we\u2019re not immaculate, but we\u2019re not stupid), the coffee and filter cannisters, and anything else that the human residents had left sitting out.(Insert clich\u00e9d maternal nagging to family about not cleaning up after snack-making.)The other afternoon when I was doing the washing-up, I stood there and observed their peregrinations until I was able to finally pinpoint the ingress spot.  Underneath the window ledge was a slightly chipped spot in the grout, and I waited to observe two ants disappear into the hole and not re-appear (which would have indicated a dead-end).  Ah-HA!  So yesterday I tracked down the remainder of the tube of tub caulk and clotted up the hole. I swabbed up the remaining immigrants (after photographing them). The good news is that no more ants have appeared today, which likely means that there\u2019s not another hole.  Maybe I\u2019ve licked the problem once and for all.Or, at least until another weak point develops in the grout.* These could be Monomorium minimum or some species of Crematogaster, but they were running around too fast to get a really good macro shot to tell which.

She told Piculas there had been a complaint about his performance at Rushe Middle School in Land O\u2019 Lakes.\nHe asked what she meant.\n\u201cShe said, \u2018You\u2019ve been accused of wizardry,\u2019 \u201d Piculas said.\nHe said the statement seemed bizarre to him, like something out of Harry Potter.\nPiculas said he replied, \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nHe said he also told Sinclair, \u201cIt\u2019s not black magic.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 May 2008 ", "body": "Why are so many math books poorly written?  Even many of the physical sciences books seem to have this terrible dichotomy between the text explaining the concepts, and the text explaining the calculations.  I suspect it\u2019s partly  because one person is writing the conceptual text, and another person is writing the calculations text.  I also suspect it is because both are written by people who are naturally good at the subject, just like most maths, chem, and physics teachers are naturally good at the subject.Well, you do want people teaching who are good at the subject.  But as many of us have noticed, being naturally good at something frequently results in people who cannot understand why others aren\u2019t equally good at it.  Once in a while those adepts become snobbish, because obviously the rest of the world just isn\u2019t smart enough to get the stuff like they are. Many of the others simply have little patience with students who \u201cmust be stupid because they can\u2019t figure out easy things\u201d and can\u2019t understand the material from having the previous explanation repeated again.Duh!  If it didn\u2019t make sense the first time around, why would repeating the same explanation make any more sense the second or third time around?  What we really need is a different kind of explanation.  Or, several different kinds of explanations, because what makes sense to one person doesn\u2019t always make sense to another.I tutor students in secondary and tertiary maths and introductory chemistry.  My students have various kinds of learning difficulties, and those standard textbook or math-teacher explanations often make very little sense to them.  I have to create visual or life analogies for things to make sense.  (Doing this often makes me understand the maths better; there\u2019s nothing like teaching something to really understand it.)My students, who are in their teen years all the way through middle age, are often rather bright, but they all have various learning difficulties, which means they do not easily learn things the way they are (traditionally) taught.  For most of us, \u201cthe easy things are difficult, and the difficult things are easy\u201d \u2014 once we can get past the simple calculations, we often find the more abstract stuff, like the concepts of calculus to be rather simple.  This makes absolutely NO sense to those adepts out there, but if we followed their ideas about learning, we would never get to the more advanced stuff to even be able to show what we could do.Frequently my students understand most of a process or a concept, but there\u2019s one little piece of it, some basic concept that they do not understand clearly, and that little speed bump makes everything downstream very confusing.  We break down the processes into small bits so I can see where their \u201cspeedbumps\u201d are.  I don\u2019t want my students to just learn \u201ctricks\u201d; they have to understand what they are doing, and why.  Otherwise they won\u2019t be able to take the information and apply it to new situations or to different kinds of problems.One of the things I run into in science is that the teachers will introduce new terms right in the middle of the descriptions of new concepts.  This means that the students are not understanding a word, so they can\u2019t get a grip on the concept, and by taking that detour to briefly define the word, they lose track of the concept.  This means that they often end up understanding neither the term nor the concept very well.  We really need to define all the terms first before diving into explanations of the concepts.  We also need to start from something that the students already understand, preferably something from real life that they understand intuitively.  That way we begin from a common place of understanding, and everyone is comfortable and thus open to learning and sharing new things.A couple of things really annoy me about some textbooks.  One is that they will only give just one example of how to solve something.  This is not right, because we don\u2019t want to know how to solve that particular problem, we want to know how to solve these particular sorts of problems.  To do that, we need to be able to generalise, and you cannot generalise from a sample of one.  We need at least two very different examples.  My other complaint is when maths texts will give you an example of how to do one of the simple problems, but do not give you an example of how to do one of the more complex problems.  Damnit, those are the ones where we are getting stuck!  We need those multiple examples of different kinds of problems to be able to generalise.There are several important points that I repeatedly stress to my maths students.  I never heard these points until I was in Calculus, which I think is a real shame, because I found them to be positively liberating.\nMathematics is not really about number-crunching.  Arithmetic is about number-crunching. Mathematics is about the patterns and relationships of (countable or measurable) things, and how we can figure things out. This is one of the reasons why I so enjoy the television show Numb3rs; they describe a lot of the really cool things about mathematics that the ordinary person would have never known existed.  They also use a lot of really cool visual analogies.  You should watch this show!\nIf you don\u2019t like the way something is, then change it! One of the reasons why we learn so many ways of solving problems in the various levels of algebra is to give us big tool boxes of different tools.  By having all those tools, we are able to keep re-arranging the statement until it is in a format that is easier for us to solve. With many problems, there is more than one way to solve it (many roads lead to Rome), so you can use whichever steps are easiest for you.  What, you hate fractions?  Then multiply both sides of the problem by the denominator(s) and poof! the fraction disappears.  Or, all fractions are really another way of writing a division problem, so divide and turn the fraction into a decimal number.\nYou have a natural mathematical ability. That is different from not being able to learn mathematics the way it is often taught.\nEvery student argues with me about having \u201cnatural mathematical ability\u201d; everything in their personal experience has proven to them that they have grave problems with the maths.  But I just remind them that Mathematics is not really about number-crunching; mathematics is about the patterns and relationships of (countable) things, and how we can figure things out.  I will re-iterate that the human brain just loves to find patterns in things (and will even create patterns when they don\u2019t exist, like seeing shapes in clouds or faces in objects).  A lot of mathematics is about the patterns of things, and using those patterns to figure things out.In factoring, we are looking for the evidence in the equation, those clues to what happened when someone multiplied previous pieces together.  \u201cOh, I\u2019m no good at that,\u201d protests my student.  I grin and ask, \u201cWhat if you came home and saw cookie crumbs and Sharpie marker caps.  What do you think happened?\u201d Of course parents will leap to immediate conclusions, and so can other adults and teens.  You are creating likely scenarios from the evidence given.  We can do the same thing in factoring, but we have to learn what kinds of evidence is there, and what it means.  People who are adept at the maths do this intuitively; my students need to have those things pointed out one piece at a time, with several examples.They need to have them listed for them on a piece of paper, so they can instead focus on listening, looking, and understanding, rather than on taking notes, and so they will have it available for them later on.  I do this note-taking form them because I am organising what information they need to know later on.I also use a lot of color to help group categories of information, or to mark which elements are the same from one step to another.  For example, in algebra when we are learning to group similar elements, I will color-code things. (I first check to see if the student has any color-blindness issues; there\u2019s no point in using both blue and green if they cannot tell the two apart!) All of the X-cubed things are one color, all of the X-squared are another color, all of the X are a third color, and all of the constants (numbers without Xs) are yet a different color.  Then it is plain to see that we have different \u201cbreeds\u201d of X and non-X items, and which of those can be added together, and which cannot.  You could even say that when we are counting how many apples we have, we are not including the numbers of bananas or oranges in with them.I am going to put some of my explanations for various math and chem concepts on a permanent page, and add to it as I remember them, meaning, it will be periodically expanded.  If you have particular things that you would like to have explained, or different ways of solving particular kinds of problems, then please ask!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/05/10/maths-chem-ranting2/", "title": "Maths * Chem =\u00a0Ranting^2"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 May 2008", "body": "\u201cHow can you not tell me when you are flunking English?!\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you ever do anything right?\u201d\n\u201cDo you really want to fail 8th-grade math and take it over again?!\u201dThere is no answer that is going to be acceptable to anyone. I mean, would you go up to your parents and say, \u201cI really want to fail beginning algebra so I can sit through units on order of operations and inequalities all over again\u201d?Of course not! What makes these so hard to answer is that they really aren\u2019t questions at all. They\u2019re accusations: You are flunking a class and didn\u2019t care to tell me about it. (Given that my mom was angry and yelling and all but shaking me in an arm-bruising grip, it\u2019s not surprising that I did not care to divulge the news.)Because these are not questions, they are not really spoken to elicit answers. Woe to the literal-minded aspie child who tries to make up for the transgressions by actually attempting to answer, \u201cI\u2019m trying\u2014\u201d\u201cYou certainly are! You\u2019re a very trying child.\u201dWhat is being demanded is a promise that somehow everything will be made better. You wish that were so, too, and feel even more powerless to change the situation. Beyond feeling inadequate to the task at hand, you also know that attempts to communicate problems will also be met with anger, hostility, contradictory messages, and impossible demands. No matter what you do, you won\u2019t be able to succeed.How do you answer questions like that?The answer is that you can\u2019t.  These are double-bind questions.  The classic example of a double-bind question is the old, \u201cHave you stopped beating your wife?\u201d  What makes it a double-bind is that it cannot be reasonably answered \u2014 one either says \u201cYes,\u201d and then has admitted to beating [his] wife, or one says, \u201cNo,\u201d and then has admitted that [he is] still beating his wife.  That example is pretty easy to pick out as being a double-bind.  A double-bind question is really a rhetorical statement phrased like a question.But examples like those above are less-easily identified as being double-binds.  They are usually delivered to children who have not yet developed the necessary critical-thinking skills to understand the fallacious reasoning, albeit they can still sense the inherent injustice of the question.  But even knowing that the question is unanswerable as stated is not enough \u2014 it\u2019s still adults asking questions, and adults are supposed to be right, and must be answered.  (It\u2019s enough to drive you nuts, maybe literally.)These double-bind questions can also be delivered to employees by dysfunctional bosses (or to students by school staff). In addition to the common \u201cDon\u2019t you\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t you\u201d phrasing, sometimes they take the form of equally-unreasonable \u201cIf-Then requests\u201d.\u201cIf you were really a good \u2018team-player\u2019 then you would do this for the company.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want us to improve our customer satisfaction index?\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t you produce a better accuracy rate than that?\u201dIn any regard, a double-bind question is easily identified by having two answers that will damn you either way.  There is no way to answer the question directly.  The entire premise is based upon pre-determined failure of the addressee.So having identified our dreadful situation, we need to be able to resolve it, and do so from both directions.  We need to know how to deal with such questions when others give them to us, and we need to know how to deal with children (or others) without unintentionally defaulting to these dreadful scenarios that we learned in our own tragedy-riddled pasts.ANSWERING:Given that the questions simply are unanswerable, the key is to respond to the actual problem, rather than trying to answer the question directly. Because you are being attacked, you want to make a positive statement about what you do like, about what you can do well, or about what you could do help improve the situation.\u201cI really like having things organised so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed by too many assignments at once.\u201d\n\u201cI want to find a better way of studying algebra that makes more sense, so I can master the techniques.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s great when we have enough time to really resolve customer issues so they don\u2019t happen again.\u201dIn our mental rehearsals, we imagine our opponents being so stunned that the situation is magically resolved.  But in real life, they simply reload and shoot again.  Worse, because you haven\u2019t played the game the way they wanted, they press again with more of the same, hoping you\u2019ll crumble under repeated pressure.  So, you have to hold firm, answer again with a different positive statement, and do so politely to avoid becoming that which you despise. It\u2019s important to not be too cheerful, because that comes off as just being flippant; you want to appear to be taking their concerns seriously, even as you are tip-toeing around the land mines.The important part is to not try to beat them \u2014 it is not only an unwinnable game, but it is also an evil game.  The goal is to avoid the game, and to cause them to no longer consider you a suitable target because you won\u2019t give them what they want in the way of interpersonal game-playing.ASKING:Every parent or spouse or boss has situations where things have taken a terrible turn.  It\u2019s our first impulse to get angry, and to start assigning blame.  But dwelling on what happened is not going to resolve the problem.  Even trying to dissect the situation and find out \u201cwhy\u201d is of limited use.  Usually people don\u2019t have a good reason why they did something.  Only pathologically disordered people set out to do terrible things from the start; the rest of us simply slide slowly down the path of problems, hoping things will get better and not knowing how or when to extricate ourselves.Even asking Why did you do this? is not helpful, because it can still result in double-binds, or at best prompts excuse-making.  Although it is good to identify where things went wrong (so we don\u2019t do them again), we should not dwell on assigning blame.  Going around blaming people, or making up excuses after being blamed, is great for creating drama but doesn\u2019t solve anything.  Worse, it can keep us stuck in the same vicious circles.The important part to focus upon is resolving the problem.\nWhat can be done in the near future?\nWhat can be done long-term?\nWhat can be done differently next time?\n\u201cSo, what do you need to be able to improve your accuracy rate?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would help you be able to organise your assignments better?\u201dSometimes the best way to fight things is to step around them and keep moving forwards.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/05/10/you-dont-say/", "title": "You Don\u2019t Say"},

Writing and spelling were always terribly difficult for me. My letters were without originality. I was . . . an extraordinarily bad speller and have remained so until this day.\u201d\n~Agatha Christie\n\u201cI was, on the whole, considerably discouraged by my school days. It was not pleasant to feel oneself so completely outclassed and left behind at the beginning of the race.\u201d\n~Sir Winston ChurchillA recent post on the ASCD Inservice blog describes \u201cMyths That Haunt Students\u201d.  The authors reference three points from Allison Zmuda:* They see learning that comes quickly as a sign of intelligence and learning that requires effort as a sign of their own lack of ability.\n* Students think school and life are disconnected.\n* They think learning is an orderly process rather than a messy, recursive, ongoing struggle. Even high-achieving students will shy away from challenging tasks and embrace routine assignments, which they find more comforting, Zmuda noted.These are fabulous points, and I would rush to buy the book referenced, if only I had the money and the time to read it (my current reading stack would literally be a meter high, were I so foolish as to stack the volumes in one place).When we mistake speed for ability \u2014 or rather, lack of speed for lack of ability \u2014 we misinterpret a person\u2019s intelligence and their ability to learn.  Students who have difficulty processing multiple sensory modes will frequently have problems keeping up with lectures or rapid-fire instruction.  Adult students who have been out of education for some time will also have problems because they are not used to, or aware of, how nuances in phrasing can impart important distinctions in material being presented.  Many students find that their unfamiliarity with the technical terminology of various disciplines gets in the way of understanding, not only in reading texts, but also in lectures, presentations, or even decoding what is being asked of them in assignments.Sometimes we feel \u201cslow\u201d because we cannot see how the material relates to other things in our lives; for students who are adept at a subject, those connections are \u201cobvious\u201d, and they can see how to use the material.  But students who are new to a subject, or who have had difficulties with it in the past, the connections between class material and practical uses are not so apparent. Sometimes students don\u2019t even believe that there is any connection; school and work and life are all separate realms.  It is important for teachers to make these connections explicitly, and provide several concrete examples.  Even better, they need to ask students to come up with their own examples of when they would use the information in ordinary life.  Doing this will allow the student to not only better identify the need for learning the material, and will be more able to remember the information later, but they will also have more ownership in their own learning.Frequently secondary (and early tertiary) students will just be looking for what are the \u201cright\u201d answers, or what the \u201cteacher wants\u201d, which is something of a shallow understanding of the purpose of the learning objectives.  Sometimes this results from students who are used to just being given information to memorise and regurgitate (focusing overmuch on state assessment scores can produce this).Sometimes it results from students who were assessed at simple taxonomic levels of learning, and who don\u2019t realise that they will eventually have to be able to do more in the way of analysis.  These are the students who will shortly be complaining about how hard the teacher is, and how the exams and assignments \u201caren\u2019t fair\u201d.  It may not be that the students are necessarily lazy (tho\u2019 sometimes they are), but that they are unprepared for how higher levels of education are going to operate, and what will be expected of them, and most importantly, how to do these things. Not everyone moves from concrete to abstract thinking easily, or in different subjects.A lot of my students have trouble with not only decoding the material, but also with putting the concepts into the context of the ideas in the chapter, and especially into the context of the whole course. They have trouble seeing how the assignments are set up to lead them through skill acquisition, and how they reflect the learning objectives.  Sometimes they have trouble discerning the \u201chidden curriculum\u201d of school culture, and understanding how they are supposed to initiate their own problem-solving and determining what they need, and work at broadening their learning and skills, and synthesizing  seemingly disparate bits of information from different classes.I\u2019ve seen some teachers who feel that doing this kind of teaching is somehow beneath them \u2014 that the students should somehow magically know everything they need about how to study, and when and how to ask for assistance, and what they should be doing outside of the stated class work.  I think this is nonsense.We expect graduates to have these skills, and we expect employees to have certain job skills when we hire them.  But the whole point to school (be it primary, secondary, trade school or college) is to educate students.  If you\u2019re not willing to explain to students what they need to know, and how they can learn that, and what they need to be able to do to succeed, then what are you doing in the business of teaching?  Teaching is an interactive process, not merely the \u201csage on the stage\u201d dispensing information.We also need to help our students understand that learning is anything but a neat, tidy linear process.  There\u2019s frequently a lot of review, of practice, stopping to put stuff into context, more review, more practice, looking at the context again now that things make more sense, et cetera ad infinitum.  In other words, it\u2019s highly recursive, and for students with learning difficulties, even more so.  When our difficulties mean that the performance is uneven because we can do something one day but not the next, it\u2019s especially frustrating.No one wants to believe that such difficulty is \u201cnormal\u201d, because it feels (a) stupid and (b) implies that we\u2019re going to be going through this stuff every time we learn something challenging.  But what we often don\u2019t see is how many other people are also going through struggles. That\u2019s one of the benefits to study groups \u2014 we lose the mis-impression that it\u2019s easy for everyone else.When i\u2019ve taken undergraduate science classes as a graduate student (making up deficiencies), everyone else thinks that I do well because it\u2019s easy for me.  Well, the concepts are easy, and I can make connections between seemingly unrelated things like nobody\u2019s business, but the memorising is just as difficult for me, and quite often the recall is even more difficult.  It doesn\u2019t help that I already have hundreds of scientific terms in my brain, because when I\u2019m trying to recall one, I just end up with even more near-misses.  I also know from experience that those really challenging classes are usually the ones that you\u2019re glad you\u2019ve had (past tense), because you have to stretch yourself to acquire new skills and will have those for further classes and work.In the end, speed is rarely the big concern.  (This is also why I don\u2019t like timed tests; if you\u2019re not actually needing to do something fast, like a medical procedure, then it\u2019s unnecessary.)  Quite often we have unrealistic ideas about how easily or quickly \u201ceveryone else\u201d learns, or how each of us learns.  Real life stuff is actually messy.

They eat all sorts of insects, including crop pests.  As you might expect by its behavior to me, they are not the least bit shy or afraid around people, and inside homes can be found around windows and other sunny places.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t18 May 2008 ", "body": "(Apologies for unsettling anyone\u2019s recent meal.)My news aggregator came up with this doozy of a quote the other day.  It was an editorial reply to an article about Kathleen Seidel, and I\u2019m not going to quote the entire letter. (Follow the link to read it yourself \u2014 if you want to reply to the author, do so on that newspaper\u2019s reply page.)I am one of those parents who has watched my autistic son go from being a vegetable to becoming human, thanks to chelation.Okay folks, let\u2019s get this straight.These are vegetables:These are children:It is quite insulting at the personal level, and damaging at the social level to describe people with autism or another other condition as being \u201cvegetables\u201d.  Doubtless the author believes that their child has improved due to the effects of an unproven \u201ctreatment\u201d for an unsubstantiated diagnoses (e.g. autism as mercury poisoning from vaccines).  But even if the diagnosis and the treatment actually had any factual basis, that would still not make such comments appropriate.How would YOU feel if your parents described you as a \u201cvegetable\u201d?Or as \u201chaving rotting brains\u201d?Or as a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d?Or that your condition \u201crelentlessly sucks life\u2019s marrow out of the family members\u201d?Or as \u201can empty shell\u201d?Or as \u201csoulless\u201d?Or that \u201cAutism is worse than cancer in many ways, because the person with autism has a normal lifespan\u201d?Or as having \u201cmad child disease\u201dOr that you \u201cwould have been better off aborted\u201d because regardless of your aptitudes or potential skills, your existance is automatically assumed to be a \u201cburden on society\u201d.I\u2019m not making these terms up; you can google them. People with disabilities face enough stereotyping, discrimination, abuse, bullying, and are murdered more often than those without. (I\u2019m not using hyperbole; click here or here.)  Describing disabilities in such sensationalistic terms and derogatory ways does nothing to help people become better educated, better integrated into society and employed, or become better accepted in their schools, workplaces, social organisations and families.More than that, one really has to wonder, What kind of parent describes their child in such insulting ways?  And does so to the entire world?

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t25 May 2008 ", "body": "A horrifying news story: a little boy in Florida kindergarten class was publicly humiliated and ostracized by his classmates, at the urging of their teacher.After each classmate was allowed to say what they didn\u2019t like about Barton\u2019s 5-year-old son, Alex, his Morningside Elementary teacher Wendy Portillo said they were going to take a vote, Barton said.By a 14 to 2 margin, the students voted Alex \u2014 who is in the process of being diagnosed with autism \u2014 out of the class.There are so many ways to mistreat those who ought to belong somewhere.  These means of intolerance, of expressing prejudice, range from the most passive to the most active.  But even the passive ones are cruel when they are intended to be exclusionary.  The outright active ones are the most vile.You can be snubbed, ignored by some of the people in the group. In this case, you are considered to not even be there as a real person worth interacting with. But \u201cjust\u201d being snubbed still hurts.\n(example: The Glass Box)You can be shunned, which is being ignored by everyone. This means that: (1) at one point you were part of the group in some small official way, and (2) you should be able to rectify your transgressions and (3) you still have the opportunity to rejoin the group, albeit likely doing so as the lowest caste (again).  This is contempt for the Other; the Other must somehow have done something bad, and therefore \u201cdeserved\u201d their fate.  As the target, you are given the responsibility for the failure to be integrated into the group. It is your fault that you have problems; you just need to \u201ctry harder\u201d to fit in and be a fully functioning member of the scholastic social scene. The hidden promise is that if you somehow manage to overcome whatever natural obstacles and artificial hurdles are put in your path, you will be accepted.\n(example: Being the Class Project: reflections upon false inclusion)You can be pitied, where people actually do acknowledge your presence, but still do not consider you to be an equal, much less one of Them. There is a difference between sympathy (compassion) and pity; victims receive pity, but nobody wants to be a victim!  Pity creates division and distance between people. By implying inferiority, pity prevents respect. Because you are defined by what you cannot do instead of what you can do, there is a lack of personal worth. The people who see only the \u201cbroken\u201d part are uncomfortable with a kind of Schadenfreude, a sense of relief that the bad thing (the disability) did not happen to them. Pity is like magical thinking, where people want to give Fate some kind of token payment to avoid similar disaster from befalling them. Above all, pity is disempowering.  It does not decrease burdens by sharing resources and abilities. The \u201chelp\u201d given to people often seeks to perpetuate the status quo \u2013 the person who is being the helper gets cosmic brownie points. Such \u201chelp\u201d is about doing things to people rather than doing things with them; it reinforces power inequalities and objectifies people. It is about maintaining these paradigms rather than empowering people.\n(example: Games people play, off and on the court)You can be bullied, singled out as someone sufficiently weird enough to be outside the group (and thus eligible for being a target because you won\u2019t be protected by others), or because you are sufficiently good enough at what you do to be a threat to the bully\u2019s status with others.  Bullies officially operate outside of the officially sanctioned power structures, although the Powers-That-Be will often turn a blind eye to their doings, and either blame the target for the bullying, or pretend that nothing bad is even going on, despite increasing mounds of evidence.  Sometimes the official denial, dismissal and displacement of blame are all used simultaneously, which is mindbendingly crazy-making.\n(examples: \u201cThat Kind\u201d and \u201cI Didn\u2019t Ask For That\u201d and \u201cTailor-Made\u201d and \u201cNo Congratulations Needed\u201d)And worst of all, you can be outcast, singled out in such a manner that you denigration and ostracism is deemed an appropriate treatment, or even a necessary treatment, by the Powers-That-Be.  An outcast is someone who is stigmatized because they have committed some transgression, or are behaving outside the group\u2019s norms. The group collectively shuns you with the goal of either correcting your behavior or of removing you entirely, to protect the collective identity of the in-group.\n(example: Odds Are\u2026)Alex hasn\u2019t been back to school since then, and Barton said he won\u2019t be returning. He starts screaming when she brings him with her to drop off his sibling at school.\nThursday night, his mother heard him saying \u201cI\u2019m not special\u201d over and over. Barton said Alex is reliving the incident. The other students said he was \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cannoying,\u201d Barton said.\n\u201cHe was incredibly upset,\u201d Barton said. \u201cThe only friend he has ever made in his life was forced to do this.\u201dThe real problems that must be overcome are not intrinsic to Alex, but are due to the others\u2019 lack of acceptance of him, and of not knowing how to work with him and the difficulties he has, rather than working against him. The usual reasoning goes, If you have problems, it is your fault. Because it is your fault, you should have to deal with the consequences. That sounds reasonable on the surface, but what it really means is that people are often punished for having problems.  For example, children become loners not because they cannot be friendly, but because they are rejected as possible playmates.When the students fail to fit in, the resulting punishment often teaches quite different lessons, not those about how to do school work or play with people, but rather lessons about power. \u201cI\u2019m in charge, so I can make you do what I want,\u201d is the message actually learned. A big problem is that the whole system seems sensible because it\u2019s so entrenched, and because it\u2019s easier to punish the person with problems, than it is to identify and resolve the underlying problems that are causing the distress in the first place. If a student acts up because there is something they cannot do cognitively or physically, then the student is \u201ctaught a lesson\u201d by being punished.  Naturally, the student then gets even more upset and frustrated and acts out, and then is described a \u201cproblem student\u201d. In truth, the student is punished or cast out for \u201cbeing a problem\u201d but rather for having problems.\n(example: The Crime of Punishment)In television game shows or \u201creality shows\u201d, the \u201cweakest link\u201d is cast out, leaving each of the successively smaller set of players struggling to become the remaining \u201cwinner\u201d.  Although there are elimination rounds in sports to find The Winner, education is not a competition.  The competition model for education sucks.  In such models, there is only one winner, and even that winner must in turn become a loser when they are dethroned by the next winner.  In such situations, everyone is ultimately a loser.In real life, what we want are people who can play and work with others.  In real life, we want everyone to win, because winning means that everyone is succeeding in learning the scholastic and social goals.We do not want to throw away members \u2013 we mend the broken links in the chain, to make a stronger and longer chain.I wish I could give Alex and his family a hug and encouragement.  Not everyone in the world is like his teacher Wendy Portillo, and the students to whom she is teaching the wrong messages. I do not need to tell them to be wary, because a great many people believe that such intolerance is so worth fighting for. But I want them to not be afraid \u2014 in reality, there are NO outgroups. We are all human beings, endless variations upon a genetic theme.Captioning / lyrics to YouTube (below) \u201cWhat the World Needs Now (is love)\u201d as sung by Dionne Warwick(Hal David/Burt Bacharach)What the world needs now is love, sweet love\nIt\u2019s the only thing that there\u2019s just too little of\nWhat the world needs now is love, sweet love\nNo not just for some but for everyoneLord we don\u2019t need another mountain\nThere are mountains and hillsides\nEnough to climb\nThere are oceans and rivers\nEnough to cross. enough to last\n\u2018Till the end of timeWhat the world needs now is love, sweet love\nIt\u2019s the only thing that there\u2019s just too little of\nWhat the world needs now is love, sweet love\nNo not just for some but for everyoneLord we don\u2019t need another meadow\nThere are corn fields and wheat fields\nEnough to grow\nThere are sun beams and moon beams\nEnough to shine\nOh listen Lord if you want to knowWhat the world needs now is love, sweet love\nIt\u2019s the only thing that there\u2019s just too little of\nWhat the world needs now is love, sweet love\nNo not just for some but for everyoneWhat the world needs now is love, sweet love\nWhat the world needs now is love, sweet love\nWhat the world needs now is love, sweet love", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/may/24/30gtteacher-lets-students-vote-out-classmate-5/"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/05/25/mend-the-link/", "title": "Mend the Link"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 June 2008", "body": "(Coffee-spew warning;\nswallow beverage before reading.)I\u2019ve been mulling over this post for a while now, and then several things reached critical mass, including a comment by a tutee, the recent post on Alex Barton (\u201cMend the Link\u201d), and some internet articles listing \u201ccommon questions asked in teacher interviews\u201d.Oh, plus this wayfinding sign displayed on the end of a \u201cstack\u201d at a library.  The numbers of course refer to the Dewey Decimal subject classification.  I like to think that whomever printed up the sign appreciated the ten-tonne irony; I also wonder just how many people actually notice it.(Post continues below picture)\nApparently one of those common teacher-interview questions runs along the lines of, \u201cHow do you maintain classroom discipline?\u201dWow.  That sort of phrasing gives me flashbacks of other people\u2019s experiences with nuns holding rulers or head masters holding paddles.  I must have lived a charmed life, because I was never in the sort of classroom where students got paddled; we merely got our self-esteem chewed down verbally, much like the rattly sharpeners chewed down our #2 pencils.  This is more insidious because the black and blue marks don\u2019t show, and because it\u2019s dismissed as \u201cmerely\u201d getting yelled at.But that\u2019s not what discipline is really about.  It\u2019s not about \u201cmaking children do what you want\u201d nor about \u201ccontrolling behavior with punishments and bribes\u201d (really two sides of the same coin).When my tutee and I were discussing details for a paper on his personal values in dating, the student (who had other alarming qualities), could only define \u201cdiscipline\u201d as meaning spanking.  Spanking, he said, was \u201cokay to do to children, because adults should know better\u201d.  What he would feel appropriate for an adult who somehow didn\u2019t know better, I didn\u2019t dare to ask.Corporal punishment as discipline \u2014 or the threat of such \u2014 does not work well.  It can stop bad behavior, but doesn\u2019t teach better behavior.  Worse, it teaches the wrong things.  Even bribes and gold stars don\u2019t work well, because the focus is shifted from what is being done, to what the reward is. Psychologists have found that extrinsic rewards are actually dismotivating in the long run. (Hell, even when I was a kid I knew this \u2014 I decided that if I really wanted some gold stars, I\u2019d go with my mom to the store, and buy myself a box of them. Miss Van House\u2019s chart of gold stars did nothing to actually help me learn my multiplication tables better; it merely displayed my difficulties to everyone else for them to give me further ridicule.)But what\u2019s scary is how often we find so many mixed messages in the system that relies upon \u201cbeating others\u201d by dominating them in hierarchies or in competitions:You shouldn\u2019t beat up your peers.  It\u2019s okay for adults to beat up on you.We want you to resist peer pressure and think for yourself.  We want you to believe everything we tell you about what are good values.*We want you to be a good team member.  Don\u2019t even think of asking the student next to you how they solved the problem; you do your own work.Be responsible.  Only do what we tell you to.We want you to be compassionate and look out for each other.  We want you to turn in your peers to the authorities when they are troubled.Cooperation is the key to success.  There can only be one winner, so you have to beat everyone else.Yeah, as if!When people talk about classroom discipline, they tend to fall into assumptions that unless the teacher imposes their will over the students and threatens them from the beginning, then the students will automatically misbehave.Having spent two years working in a self-contained setting with 30 students with emotional & behavioral problems, people will sometimes ask me if I think that kids are inherently bad.  It\u2019s an age-old question of philosophy and  Western religion (original sin and all that).  But it\u2019s not really an issue of whether people are naturally good or naturally bad \u2014 that\u2019s a false dichotomy.  People are just one more animal species, with each individual trying to get what they need from the social interactions.  Humans do horrible things and wonderful things, and mostly just do things that are varying levels and mixtures of good and bad.  Any behavior that gets a person what they need is in some way adaptive, but it may also be maladaptive.For example, when people lie, it is because they don\u2019t feel safe telling the truth.  In hostile environments, telling the truth is often demanded explicitly, but the implicit or covert message is that actually telling the real truth (as opposed to what those in charge want to hear) will likely get you in trouble too.  What then?  If you\u2019re a socially naive and honest little child (autistic or otherwise), you\u2019re likely to get in trouble, and then afterwards flounder in bewilderment as to why, and what you did wrong, and what really happened.So what then, is \u201cdiscipline\u201d?  The word means several things, as I reminded my tutee. It means self-control. Discipline also means training and practicing a skill, or a particular field of learning, such as science or mathematics or social studies.  He made a little polite social noise of acknowledgment, but I don\u2019t think the words got much past his auditory processing and working memory.  In his world, discipline meant beating up on someone to force them to do what you wanted, and he had seen little to refute that, or to change his perception of either the appropriateness or the necessity of doing the same.Then too, we have adults acting out when they get frustrated, and engaging in bullying behavior.  In really rotten systems, the principal bullies the staff and the students, the staff bully each other and the students, and the students bully each other and sometimes the staff. Even worse, everyone pretends this is normal and \u201cjust the way things are\u201d and sometimes tries to stop the worst of it by simply engaging in more of the same. (Cue Pink Floyd\u2019s album, \u201cThe Wall\u201d.) When students like Alex Barton do things they shouldn\u2019t, everyone then feels entitled to gang up on them in order to \u201cteach them a lesson\u201d.  Alas, it is the wrong, wrong lesson.The best alternatives I have found to the forcible method of class discipline (whether physical or verbal), is a model built upon compassion, upon open-ended exploration with the students about what they need and how it can be achieved positively, and upon thoughtful consideration of what the evidence we have for making these decisions.  It\u2019s even a model built upon acknowledgment that secondary students have already heard (and recited) the official rules a gazillion times, and that it\u2019s more useful to ask what problems might really happen in our science classroom and how we should prevent or handle them.It\u2019s all rather nicely summed up in this quote from a book that I really want to read soon, Democratic Schools, Second Edition: Lessons in Powerful Education, by Michael W. Apple and James A. Beane:\u201cThe two qualities that seemed to define our ideal citizen were empathy and skepticism: the ability to see a situation from the eyes of another and the tendency to wonder about the validity of what we encountered.\u201dEmpathy and skepticism; two great things that work great together!__________ # ___________* Some of these are mentioned in Alfie Kohn\u2019s essay, \u201cHow Not to Teach Values\u201d, as was mention of the quote from the first edition of the Apple & Beane book.", "outgoing_links": ["https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/c2008_andreasbuzzingabout.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Democratic-Schools-Second-Powerful-Education/dp/0325010757", "http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/hnttv.htm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/school-discipline/", "title": "School \u201cDiscipline\u201d?"},

A few houses away, there is the repeated doppler roar of someone taking advantage of the clear skies to catch up on overdue mowing.Cradled between layers of pillows, with the sheet and cotton quilt and heavy wool blanket pulled up to my ears, I lay stiffly. Mostly still asleep and not even close to the stage of stretching groggily or opening my eyes, my conscious awareness surfaces uncertainly through layers of internal sensory checks, transversing clouds of anxious, nonsensical dreams with endlessly repeating plot-less terrors.For some reason I could not yet fathom, the usual morning physiological data-gathering was running very slowly, as though entire sections of my brain either could not communicate or were withholding information.  At times like this, I am highly uneven, having some high cognitive functions but lacking other more basic ones.  Pieces of random information drift by, sometimes contained in the phonemes of words that repeat like the short loop of an advertising jingle, but slide away without having been decoded for any meaning.  I become briefly aware of just one or two sensory indicators of the outside world: water running through the sink downstairs, or the crackling of a cat\u2019s jaw as it yawns so wide the ears fold backwards.The mental sticky-notes I told myself at bedtime flutter by intermittently, \u201cI need to get up early to take the bags of brush down to the curb before the truck comes by,\u201d and \u201cI still need to do a prelab and upload it before 11:59 pm,\u201d and \u201cI need to finish that cover letter for the job app,\u201d and \u201cThe cable repair person may be here at 8:00 am,\u201d and \u201cI need to drive my daughter back to her college town.\u201d  Things to do, people to be, and most of all, irrevocable externally-imposed deadlines to meet. The bad part is, were this a Saturday, this could be much worse.Slowly the information collects, like tiles of satellite photos that must reach critical mass for the terrain to be understood.  One points out that I did yard work yesterday, several short jaunts out to pull weeds from the vegetable patch and to bag the pile of brush.  This means I will be achier today, and the stiffness will require me to move about more carefully for a few hours.  I should not plan on doing any heavy work today.But I don\u2019t yet stretch to test my joints, as the recalcitrant parts of my brain yield the messages previously withheld: my head hurts, a pain so large it has expanded beyond my brain case to my eyes, my ears, my nose, my jaw \u2026 somatically I feel like an embryo that is mostly giant head and bulgy eye buds,  primitive heart throbbing all the way from not-quite gills to the tip of the tail.  The analogy is more than apt; I want to retreat to someplace womblike, to a time before any serious neural development.  The world is too bright, too noisy, too heavy with gravity, too full of responsibilities, too full of wracking pain, and it is no wonder newborns cry out with their first gulps of air.An urgent report from the digestive system bursts into the command office: my stomach is zigging whilst the pipes south are zagging. A complaint for attention from the bladder and kidneys is shelved, and the verbal miao of annoyance from the cat curled by me is likewise ignored as I rummage up enough nervous commands to curl up my knees and squash a pillow against my abdomen.  Usually the pressure is enough to reduce the distress below the barfing threshold.Thresholds are everything.  I\u2019m running an understaffed mental command center with half the bridge crew incapacitated, and the messages don\u2019t arrive with any consistency, either never getting in, or haltingly reaching their destinations, and overloads on the pain processors keep clogging up the communication and motor control systems. Every small action I manage to perform physically is directed towards reducing some sensory input to a less intolerable level.This is a helluva day to have a severe migraine. In addition to the inescapable deadlines, the sensory overload is cranked up with subwoofers. The mega-wattage sunlight slices through the gap along the edge where the window shade wasn\u2019t straightened out.  Barefoot hubby is thudding down the stairs hard enough to rattle doorknobs, opening and closing and absurd number of kitchen cabinet doors, and slurping breakfast so loud I can hear it upstairs at the other end of the house.  He never realises how loud he is when he doesn\u2019t have his hearing aids on. It doesn\u2019t matter anyway, because everything sounds multiply louder than real life; even the crackle of turning pages is unbearable.\n\nOh please-please-please don\u2019t let the phone ring. This is so horrifying a concept that all of my energies are directed to pulling together information buried in different files: job functions says there is a phone in my bedroom; spatial memory reports that it is on the bedside table; proprioceptive memory claims that I could potentially reach it, but proprioception says a lot of things that are not entirely accurate.  I don\u2019t even know where on the bed I am relative to the bedside table.Having acertained all that, I lose conscious processing for an undefined time period while trapped in an inside-out whirlpool of psychedelic fractals that are trying to shred me into a mince of scrambled brains. (That\u2019s the poetic version; the real version was more like the being-torn-apart pain during latter end of L&D, trying to push an oversized baby through the birth canal, and the obstetrician urging push-push-push while the irresistible force fights the immovable object until I am seeing stars for needing to inhale again.)This latest spasm ebbs by, and some unidentified household noise skewers  through to my consciousness.  Eventually I remember that I was going to do something dreadfully important, but am left with naught but gnawing need and no memory of what. An alarm clock on someone\u2019s mobile phone sounds, and I grasp the intent again: unplug the damn land-line phone near my head. Sensor check; which side am I lying on? Left. That means my other arm is free. Quick, master the motor control \u2026There is no quick. I muddle through steps most people are not aware of: the abstract idea of moving my arm, of visualising moving my arm, of finding the sensations of the covers and pyjama sleeve to help locate my arm, of adducting and abducting and rotating bones and muscles and tendons and joints and ligaments, omigod every hair in my skin hurts as it brushes something ping-ping-ping, struggling with tangles of bedding, I want to get my arm free, I don\u2019t want to pull the covers off my head.Where the hell is the table?  Grope, grope, augh I\u2019m wracked with chills (the air conditioning is set to 75\u00b0F, now intolerable), oops spatial memory forgot the update about the half-dozen books stacked on the table.  I manage to knock books and phone to the floor.  Not good enough; don\u2019t want to listen to automated recording telling me the line is open. Must unplug something. Emergency data request is made to job functions; I pant with distress until the delayed reply says to unplug the line from the wall into the back of the phone. Crap, you know what that means: open one eye, just a little\u2013 !!!!! \u2014 just a little, try again, found it. Squinch out plug. Drop phone. Retreat under covers.Another pause.  It\u2019s not a break.  All that has worn me out, and the stretching is making my innerds lurch and gurgle.  (The only saving grace is that having had the hysterectomy, there are no more cysts and endometriosis gripping me in knots.)  I am curled under the covers, contemplating my navel with an intensity that Zen masters disdain, but all severe pain sufferers well know.More ebbs out to the uncharted depths, punctuated by waves that throw me briefly onto the beach of consciousness.  I may be able do small things that help when I am aware, but mostly I am just aware, and \u201cawareness\u201d is for public service campaigns, not hours-long episodes of head-splitting pain.Worse, I recall that I have deadlines. Things to do, people to be, and most of all, irrevocable externally-imposed deadlines to meet. I need to ask hubby to curb the bags of brush, and to wake the kid to hold vigil for the cable repair person. I need to take some medication, the sooner the better, but it\u2019s packaged by some masochist who sees fit to preserve tiny pills under two layers of cardstock and heavy foil, plus I need water as my tongue has glued itself to the high arch of my palate.But first I have to get hubby\u2019s attention.  Croaking his name yields no results; he still hasn\u2019t put on his hearing aids, and is in another room or floor of the house anyway.  Eventually I\u2019m inspired to fumble for my mobile phone (used as bedside clock while it recharges nightly) and call him.  This also yields no result as his phone was likewise parked, silently blinking.  At some point he wanders by while I\u2019m vaguely cognisant, and I flap a hand at him.  Through much communicative confusion, he finds my meds on the bedside table, I manage to swallow from a glass of water without spilling it on the bed, and lastly, he finally understands my reminders about the trash and waking the kid. Hours later I stumble and crash about, groping my way to the bathroom a mere six feet from the bedroom door, to soak in a hot bath.The good news is that things improved enough for me to complete and submit the necessary classwork.  At least it was a Friday migraine, instead of a Saturday migraine.  I had thought that an online class would be more accessible, and it mostly is, aside from the labs.  The instructor had posted in the syllabus that either being late for lab or missing the lab would result in being immediately dropped from class.  (Seems draconian to me, but I\u2019m not making up the rules.)  Although I understand the rationale for encouraging attendance in the intense and brief period for a summer laboratory course, I am not sure that the possibility of legitimate absences was fully considered.I would not want to see my entire summer\u2019s scholastic effort go to waste due to unavoidable circumstances, such as one of these migraines. I got a note from my doctor and made accommodation arrangements with the uni\u2019s disability access service department, which means that should I be too ill to attend, I will not be dropped.  But as the professor pointed out, the Saturday labs for this class are equivalent to four labs in the other classes, two from the previous week, and two from the week ahead.  Naturally, I cannot make up a couple labs ahead of time in the advent of an unexpected illness.Unfortunately, the deadline to change classes was Wednesday, and a couple of the labs that I would have needed to have done had already passed.  So I\u2019m stuck with this class.  If I\u2019m too sick to attend, I won\u2019t be dropped, but I will only be able to make up half of the points for the lab by attending two lab sessions with another class during the following week. This is when the \u201cRule of the B\u2019s\u201d applies; it doesn\u2019t matter if I feel like \u201cdeath warmed over\u201d \u2014 if I\u2019m not actually bleeding, barfing, blacked out, burning up with fever, or have a broken bone, I had better be there.Crap.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/06/07/horrid-day-for-a-migraine-could-have-been-worse/", "title": "Horrid day for a migraine.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t18 June 2008 ", "body": "So, the Kid is easing into classes at the local community college, with plans for taking the fall semester part-time and working.  The inevitable What-To-Take? question came up, with the idea being that a couple of classes should be general-education requirements, and the third something personally interesting. Well, I said, you should see what courses are required for an Associate\u2019s Degree. (A 2-year general education diploma, which can transfer to a four-year degree elsewhere).This is all well and fine, and various categorical listings are perused until realisation set in:  some kind of Oral Communications credit is needed, such as Interpersonal Communications or Public Speaking classes.  Oh noes!Why do I have to have a speaking class? complained the Kid.To be sure, many people dread taking their college Public Speaking class. Psychologists tell us that a dread of speaking to large groups of strangers is common, right up there with a fears of heights, spiders, or thunderstorms.  Then again, the average citizen did not have a preliminary diagnosis of Social Phobia.I remembered the teacher\u2019s comments on the Kid\u2019s earlier oral presentations in school:   Need to make eye contact. Remember to speak up. Use gestures, interact with the audience. Those comments had stuck in my mind, as about that time in history I was beginning to put things together and wonder if my own kid didn\u2019t have a bit of Asperger\u2019s.  Sure, there was eye contact with family and the couple friends.  But the general hanging quietly around the edges of large family gatherings was long ingrained, and by secondary school the strong reticence for striking up conversations with strangers or for joining school or civic clubs, was both inhibiting and inhibited by social interaction.I also remembered these same types of comments on my own class presentation grade sheets, back when I was in primary and secondary school.  I offered up some personal history, I remember taking Public Speaking when I was just a clerk, and I could not imagine when I would ever have to give a talk, much less who I would give it to, or what I would talk about. Of course, I have since given presentations to groups of hundreds, and been doing public speaking for over 15 years.  Life has a way of zig-zagging and putting one in unexpected situations, where any previous skills may suddenly be useful.But teens don\u2019t find such parent comments to be useful; they\u2019re always stories from Long Ago And Far Away, and have no conceivable bearing on the teen\u2019s own future life.  Such are the limitations of teen perceptions of both personal histories and of the possibilities of Life in general.The Kid looked through the rest of the general education requirements, and under the Social Sciences section, came up with an introductory course in Economics.  (I had always considered Econ to be within the realm of Maths, but I wasn\u2019t the one making these lists up.)  Econ was full of equations and would be easier for the Kid to digest conceptually than all those inscrutable sociological subjects.  Okay, I replied, Econ is good; it will transfer anywhere. And for the personal interest course?The introductory computer game design class, came the answer.Of course; silly question.  What else has the Kid been focused on for years now, but all flavors of card and video and online gaming, including working up the algorithms, character weightings, and testing of a home-made card game.Then I had a brain-flash, You know, if you\u2019re taking this class, why don\u2019t you see what Associates degree program it goes with?  You don\u2019t have to do the whole program \u2014 you can try it and see if that\u2019s what you want.  But it would make sense to see what the requirements are for the program, so you don\u2019t take stuff that doesn\u2019t work toward it.This made sense; who wants to take extra classes they don\u2019t need?  We noodled around and found the program, and looked over the requirements, noting that this class was one of the prerequisites necessary before even applying for the program, and \u2014OH!  Hey, look! I pointed out to the Kid \u2014 There are no oral communication course requirements! Someone out there realised that geeks are not going to want to take such classes, and found other courses more suitable to their future careers.  Oh, happy day!  Further examination of the requirements meant dropping and adding various classes, until a workable combination of time slots and still-open sessions was created.  We also toured the bookstore to see how bad the damage to the pocketbook would be, and were delighted to find that the three classes would require no more than $100 of books, which is about half of what most courses require. At last, the Kid had enrolled in classes for the fall semester, and even found a career goal to try out.And a class in Public Speaking is not even required.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/06/18/talking-to-strangers/", "title": "Talking to Strangers"},

In contrast, the number of blog post ideas continue to grow \u2026My daughter came up with the Force of Irony in her stories, as an actual force of nature that causes things to happen.  In turn, I came up with the idea that the Force of Irony can be detected by with an Irony Compass equipped with a needle of Absurdium.The recent spate of stories about severe thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes and flooding have filled newspaper headlines. There are also record numbers of tornadoes this year; over 1500 have been reported in this first half a year, and last year there were only 1093.  Meteorologists will be debated causal hypotheses for a while yet (including the inevitable dog-wagging tail of, \u201crecord-setting events are caused by keeping records\u201d).But this particular newsbit caught my eye:  over in Manhattan, Kansas, there was a tornado last Wednesday.  By various news accounts, it left a swath of destruction a mile long and half a block wide (in the typical Midwestern tornado track from southwest to northeast \u2013\u2013 map and pix 1, pix 2).  Judging by the damage and meteorological records, it was an EF4 scale twister, which is very heavy, indeed.  The best operative adjective is demolished.Kansas State University took over $20 million in damages to several of their Halls.  The uni president, Jon Wefald, stated,\u2026 the university\u2019s insurance policy carries a $5 million deductible, requiring it to pick up one-quarter of the estimated damage. He said the university had recently renegotiated that deductible down to $100,000, but the change would not take effect until July 1.Ouch!  That just hurts.  Sadly, compassion fatigue sets in as this sort of news is repeated in a number of cities and states.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 February 2008", "body": "Wheelchair Dancer had a recent post where she was musing aloud about why a neighbor might keep refusing various opportunities \u201cbecause she is a quad\u201d.  WCD and those commenting raised a variety of interesting possibilities to answer that question.  It\u2019s both a thoughtful and thought-provoking post, and reminded me of similar issues that I have encountered over the years.  (What I am describing may or may not be the same kind of situation as what Wheelchair Dancer\u2019s neighbor is dealing with.)Granted, we all have limitations.  Some of have have more limitations, and some of us have different limitations than most people.  And yet, we have all encountered those people who get \u201cstuck\u201d on their limitations, well beyond the whole (initial) phase of learning to accept and cope with whatever the causes and effects are from those disabilities.  They keep talking about what they CAN\u2019T DO, not just as a practical reference to \u201cno, that won\u2019t work for me,\u201d but as refutation to suggestions for a number of ordinary or alternative activities.Trying to earnestly offer suggestions to such entrenched Can\u2019t-Do frequently falls flat in a conversational game of \u201cYes-But\u201d, leaving one feeling frustrated and eventually rather disinclined to continue offering suggestions.Once in a while I run into this kind of thing with a tutee or student.  It\u2019s hard to tell if the \u201cCan\u2019t-Do\u201d attitude results from general discouragement, from a perceived need to \u201cprove\u201d to others the reality of the issues, from a need for sympathy (no matter how spiritually un-nourishing that may be), from a perceived lack of options, or possibly even a sort of passive-aggressive form of work avoidance where constantly playing Yes-But and being a victim of circumstance is easier than actually getting anything done.In any regard, after a while I realised that too many conversations end up in those same dreary circles.  I was sick of trying to be assertively positive and encouraging the student, and of offering suggestions that kept getting dismissed because of this-that-or the other thing.   Not only could I not \u201csolve\u201d their problems for them, they would not let me.I finally got tired of that routine, and decided to lob the conversational ball back into the student\u2019s side of the court, because after all, the responsibility ultimately lies with the student.  In an effort to disengage from the fatiguing interpersonal games, I stepped sideways out of the dance and changed my questions and responses.  For example:\u201cYes, I understand you can\u2019t do that; you have explained several times.  What I need for you to do is to tell me what you can do.\u201d\u201cOkay, instead of telling me about everything you don\u2019t understand, let\u2019s start back with the part that you do understand, and work from there.\u201d\u201cYou have been telling me about what people have been giving you that doesn\u2019t work.  Now, it would be more effective for you to tell me what does work that will enable you to succeed at this.\u201dGenerally the person is so entrenched in their Can\u2019t-Do habits that it takes several rounds of repeated querying to get out of the conversational rut.  At some point, the student either begins to rally and start coming up with small bits of positives that can be built upon (lots and lots of baby-steps to break out of that entrenched mind-set), or else one eventually realises that the student is being steadfastly resistant.At that point, it\u2019s ultimatum time.  It\u2019s nothing personal.  I just lay out the situation objectively, and explain the choices and consequences.\u201cOkay, what do you need to do to pass this class?\u201d  (Get a concrete, detailed answer related to grades on assignments and tests.)  \u201cYou can here for tutoring as part of what you can do to achieve those goals.  Telling me what you can\u2019t do does not help us get where we need to be.  If you want assistance in the material, then you need to work with the various teachers and tutors.  I cannot help you unless you can focus on what you do know, what does work for you, and what I can do with you.  Okay, for the next text, you need to know these definitions, and be able to answer the questions in the study guide.  Where do you want to start?\u201dIf after all that the student still spends the tutoring sessions complaining and not making progress, then I discuss the situation with the tutoring director, who may in turn give the student several options.  One of those options may include suggesting revisiting medical or physical therapy  services. Another may be scheduling with counselling services, as students who keep refusing to find solutions may not only not pass classes or graduate, but also will have problems with employment and relationships.  There are a variety of different reasons why someone would (unconsciously) sabotage their social or work successes, but identifying and resolving those go beyond the world of teaching into the realm of therapy.The good news is that such resistant students are very rare.  Usually when people with various disabilities get stuck on Can\u2019t-Do, they are either repeating the diminished expectations they grew up hearing, or are  still in the early part of disability where the level of understanding has not gone beyond Can\u2019t-Do into Do-Differently.  Sometimes it takes persistent reassurance and similarly-challenged peers to model that such goals can be achieved.Whining once in a while may be cathartic, but it won\u2019t get you far \u2014 for success you\u2019re gonna need chutzpah*.* Chutzpah:  Yiddish for audacity or nerve", "outgoing_links": ["http://cripwheels.blogspot.com/2008/01/possible-disability-tension.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/02/03/just-cant-do/", "title": "Just Can\u2019t Do"},

Change is a bumpy process; sometimes it makes me uneasy about unknowns, often eager for new things, and frequently ambivalent from both.Over in the tarantularium, I noticed that one of the crickets was also going through some changes. The plastic wall of the box is the reason for the slightly blurry quality of the photograph.  There\u2019s really no excuse for all the bad puns and silly jokes about Superman, strippers, training wheels on bicycles et cetera, except for the otherwise dryness of the subject and the stressed busyness of my recent days.Our own maturation is not nearly as profound as those faced by the holometabolous, such as caterpillars that metamorphose into butterflies.  Hemimetabolous insects like these crickets have fewer structural differences between the nymphs and adults; in addition to becoming sexually mature, they also develop full-size wings.  (The \u201cteenage\u201d crickets just have stubby little wings, not even as useful as training wheels on a bicycle.) The male below has just molted.  His exoskeleton is still soft and pale, and the wings have not yet been fully inflated.  A little while later, the wings were fully extended, and his exoskeleton (shell) had \u201ccured\u201d and darkened to a deep brown.Molting seems bizarre to those of us who have our structure support on the inside.   (I imagine that arthropods would find vertebrates strangely inside-out.)  But climbing out of your skeleton is vital when it covers you and you need to grow \u2014 think of it as being analogous to having to buy new shoes for growing children.  The new, larger exoskeleton is made before the old one is removed, and it is underneath, so therefore a bit wrinkled up.  (Random thought:  that\u2019s probably why Superman wore a leotard-like costume under his Clark Kent suit; amazing the cape was never wrinkled \u2013maybe it was some space-age fabric from Krypton.)The first step is called apolysis, which is started by the release of ecdysteroid hormone messengers that cause the cuticle (hard, shell part) to be separated from the epidermis, the living cell layer under the cuticle. Once the old cuticle is popped loose, those cells release molting fluid into the space underneath the cuticle.  Word buffs:  ecdysis means to shed or strip, so a fancy word for a stripper (exotic dancer who removes clothes) is an ecdysiast.On that entertaining note, we move to the next stage, the creation of the new cuticle.  First the epicuticle (outside-most layer) is built by secretions from the epidermal cells, followed by the middle layer (technically the inner epicuticle) and the third inner layer, the procuticle.  That sounds pretty dull, but once these three thin layers are created, then things get interesting.  That molting fluid is activated and begins to dissolve the endocuticle, which is the much thicker layer between the procuticle and the epidermal cells.  Material that is being dissolved is then recycled and used to build up the new cuticle. Just before the removal, the outside layer is covered in wax to help waterproof the insect.  (No, not TurtleWax like you buff on your car, insect wax.  But same general purpose.)Once all that refurbishing is done, it\u2019s time to \u201ctake it off, take it all off\u201c.  This is the tricky part, and every now and then a critter doesn\u2019t quite make it.  The insect gulps a lot of air (aquatic arthropods gulp water, naturally) and then contracts its muscles until the old exoskeleton cracks along the \u201cseams\u201d or edges of a few sclerites (sclerites are like plates in armor).  Because all but the epicuticle was dissolved, the remaining cuticle is actually rather thin.Crack, pop, climb out, right?  Not quite.  Cuticle covers the outside of the insect, and also invaginates and lines other structures, like the anus and the structures of the head.  Yes, they must pull their shells out of their butts and their faces.  I\u2019ve always imagined that pulling off old facial cuticle would feel something like engaging in a heavy-duty sinus-clearing session with the tissues.  (\u201cInvaginate\u201d simply means that an outside layer is folded or turned in to create an inside layer, and yes, I know that invaginate and anus are an odd combination of words \u2014  I don\u2019t make these things up!)After the insect has successfully managed this feat, leaving behind the fragile husk of its old exoskeleton (now called exuvia) the new exoskeleton can be fully expanded, ditto the wings.  Butterflies emerge from their crysalids with their wings folded up like umbrellas, and insects must pump hemolymph (insect \u201cblood\u201d) through the veins to expand them.  The wings dry, and the exoskeleton cures and hardens in a process called sclerotization, which is similar to tanning.The arthropod is now ready to face the world again, assuming it was able to find a safe place to molt.  Molting is not only intrinsically dangerous, but it leaves the arthropod vulnerable to predation.  Humans and others animals are especially fond of eating soft-shell crabs, which are crabs that, as you may now guess, have just molted.  (Poem / lyric after the photo.)[Photo description:  newly-molted male cricket sitting atop a rock.  He is a soft ivory color, and his wings are still crumpled up.  The exuvia, or cast-off old exoskeleton is crumpled up behind him.]METAMORPHOSISThe time has come,\nNew information.\nWe\u2019ve been waiting\nFor the transformation.Changes happen every day\nRespond in many ways.\nOld days for new\nOld ways to renew.Working from the inside out,\nIs what it\u2019s all about,\nUsually it\u2019s an itch.\nSometimes it\u2019s a bitch,Getting stuck is hell\nMidway tween the shells,\nBut don\u2019t you scoff,\nAnd ask, Can I pull it off?Hey, it\u2019s all we know,\nEvery body\u2019s gotta grow.\nChanges happen every day\nRespond in many ways.The time has come,\nNew information.\nWe\u2019ve been waiting\nFor the transformation.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/02/02/metamorphosis/", "title": "Metamorphosis"},

Plus, we also like them just because they\u2019re so damn gorgeous!  This batch of posts has some terrific photography.Ants may be industrious, but by all accounts they may be easily outwitted.

Meanwhile, GrrlScientist is Living the Scientific Life where she describes, \u201cBerry Butts: Parasitized Black Ants Resemble Red Berries\u201d.  More weird parasitism:  \u201can amazing example of a parasite that causes its host to resemble a luscious red berry \u2014 all so the parasite\u2019s eggs are passed onto birds, the next step in the parasite\u2019s life cycle.\u201d  The ants continue their march (one by one) across the Interwebs, and at his Myrmecos Blog, Alex describes how we can find \u201cAnts from a Kilometer Up\u201d by using Google Earth to find their mounds.  (Gee, if you make it that easy, won\u2019t the grad students waste their time doing silly things like catching up on sleep?)So what do Superman, strippers and training wheels have to do with arthropods? That was my recent post inspired by changes in the job scene and a cricket in the tarantularium.  Susannah (AKA Wanderin\u2019 Weeta) is also watching insect changes, as she has a Lep snoozing away in crysalis, remarking that \u201cLooks like January is Moth Month\u201d.  You can just barely make out the structures developing \u2026Representing the non-arthropods, Aydin \u00d6rstan has a tale about shells as well, \u201cA friend went to Nigeria and all I got was igbin* shells\u201d.  Of course, you will have to go to Snail\u2019s Tales to find out what \u201cigbin\u201d is! Like Aydin, I think I\u2019ll pass on that particular recipe described; anything with the adjective \u201crubbery\u201d sounds suspicious. Meanwhile, pascal has been doing Research at a snail\u2019s pace and references one of Aydin\u2019s previous posts, presenting a thought- provoking post about how past and future climate change affects the persistence of the land snail, Hendersonia occulta.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t9 February 2008 ", "body": "The other day (er, week) I promised to post some thoughts on AIT, so here they are.There are plenty of treatments offered to cure or improve Auditory Processing Disorder (APD).  Auditory processing is not just about hearing. Hearing is the sensory business that the ears do, and the auditory processing is what the brain then does with the signals from the auditory nerves. The ears also have the semicircular canals, which provide us with information about balance \u2014 that sense of balance, along with the proprioception of our joints, ligaments, muscles, tendons and bones, give us the sensory information we need for co\u00f6rdination. In auditory processing disorder, the sensory part of hearing often works just fine; it is not a hearing problem, it is an understanding problem. The ears are getting the information and are sending suitable signals; but there are some \u201ctangles\u201d or \u201cspeed-bumps\u201d in the interpretation of the signal.One treatment popularly lauded on Web advertisements is Auditory Integration Training (AIT), which is supposed to also help problems related to tinnitus, hyperacussis (oversensitivity to high-pitched and/or sudden noises, or sound in general), autism, ADD or ADHD.  Depending upon the practitioner, AIT may also be sold as effective treatment for dyslexia, stuttering, depression, speech delay, and even head-banging or echolalia.  That\u2019s quite a list of highly diverse issues, which immediately sends off mental warning bells.AIT was developed by Dr Guy Berard, who is also the author of the (out-of-print) book, Hearing Equals Behavior,\u201cEverything happens as if human behavior were largely conditioned by the manner in which one hears.\u201d(Hmn, I bet a lot of Deaf people would beg to differ with Dr Berard\u2019s assertion!)So how is this method supposed to work?  From the various Web sites describing it, AIT uses pre-recorded music, which the client then listens to in modified form through headphones.  Difference frequencies of sound are filtered or adjusted through a device such as an \u201cAudiokinetron\u201d.The process of listening to such treated music is supposed to \u201cre-train\u201d the brain to better understand what is being heard. Usually treatment involves 10 to 20 such half-hour sessions of sitting and listening (in addition to before, during and after consultation sessions).  After the client has listened to these recordings (the sum of the active part of the treatment; as measurements before or after are peripheral), they are never supposed to use headphones for listening. I have yet to find out why using headphones ever again could somehow undo the treatment, as opposed to listening to music without headphones.I find the concepts behind AIT to be curious at best; how can listening to pitch-modulated music help a person better understand speech, such as distinguishing phenomes, identifying word-breaks, or following one person\u2019s voice when there is background noise?  These are the sorts of issues that frequently appear in APD.  So am I missing some vital behavioural or audiological details here in these descriptions?Of course, it would be foolish to dismiss something merely because I do not understand how it is supposed to work, just from the descriptions given.  Not being a \u201cSpLaT\u201d (Speech Language therapist /pathologist) myself, I sought the opinions of professionals, and went to the American Speech-Hearing-Language Association\u2019s Web page to see their Position Statement on Auditory Integration Training (C)2004:In 1994, the American Speech-Hearing-Language Association (ASHA) Subcommittee on Auditory Integration Training (AIT) concluded that AIT, a method proposed for treating a variety of auditory and nonauditory disorders, was experimental in nature and had not yet met scientific standards as a mainstream treatment. The subcommittee recommended that ASHA develop a position statement and guidelines regarding AIT as soon as more research findings became available. The 2002 ASHA Work Group on AIT, after reviewing empirical research in the area to date, concludes that AIT has not met scientific standards for efficacy that would justify its practice by audiologists and speech-language pathologists.*Their Technical Report goes into much more detail as to why they reached that conclusion.  Some of those reasons include serious problems with research methodology. For example:\nThe 1994 Bernard Rimland & Stephen Edelson study examining AIT with autistics lacked a control group and showed no statistically significant difference in sound sensitivity. \nTheir 1995 study did not have a well-matched control group, and no differences were seen regarding hearing between the control and test groups.\nThe 1996 Bettison study and 1997 Zollweg, Palm, and Vance study also lacked control groups, and neither found differences between the different treatments given.\nThe 1998 Yencer study also found no differences between the treatment, placebo and control groups.\nAnd so on. The report also lists concerns about the safety of equipment sometimes used in AIT practice.Likewise, the American Academy of Audiology also describes AIT is \u201centirely investigational\u201d, and they state that:  \u201cThe Academy believes that prospective, systematic research of this technique is needed to demonstrate its efficacy. \u201cThis statement is also affirmed by the Educational Audiology Association (link is pdf file).  The Policy Statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics states, \u201cAlthough two investigations indicated AIT may help some children with autism, as yet there are no good controlled studies to support its use.\u201dA more recent 2006 study by Sinha, Silove, Wheeler & Williams looking at AIT for autism spectrum disorders concluded, \u201cAt present there is not sufficient  evidence to support its use.\u201dBut don\u2019t a tiny percentage of audiologists and other service providers use AIT?  As audiology professor Maurice H. Miller PhD noted, \u201cIn conclusion, and despite enthusiastic reports from some understandably well-meaning parents and practitioners, AIT has not met criteria for effectiveness and safety.\u201d Unfortunately, good intentions, or biographies and glowing letters are not the same thing as good research data.Doubtless there are some parents out there who will protest that their investment in such treatment has been well-rewarded.  Once again, this is why we use double-blind studies, because people will unconsciously see improvements, and will also assign any improvements (regardless of the cause) as resulting from the latest treatment.  If your child has improved in some manner or another, that\u2019s fabulous!  Children do make leaps and improvements as they mature.  (One of the hallmarks of children with various disorders is that the maturation is slower or erratic compared to their peers.)  Certainly, consciously focusing upon understanding what is heard results in better comprehension because the person is using more mental resources to process the sensory input.  Getting lots of attention also frequently improves behaviour as children seek to please their parents and other adults, because children (like everyone else) like attention, especially positive attention.Let me clarify: if I am seeking a treatment, whether it is considered to be a medical intervention or an educational intervention, then I want to know that it has been tested to ensure the actual efficacy, and that the \u201cresults\u201d we are seeing are not merely from expectation effects, experimenter effects, \u201cregression to the mean\u201d (cause-and-effect issues that result from fluctuating severity levels), or placebo effects.So what\u2019s the big deal about control groups and all? Because we want evidence-based practice. We have to be able to sort out what changes happen over time in response to a treatment, and what changes simply happen because of maturity or whatever. In other words, we want to be able to prove that a treatment is doing something before we spend lots of time and money on it.If your insurance company won\u2019t pay for AIT, it might not be just because they are cheap (and there are certainly no lack of legitimate complaints about medical insurance companies in general).  It is probably because they are cheap and will not pay for a treatment that has no proven benefit, one that has been dismissed by a number of professional organisations.Sure, I would like a solution to this issue, but I don\u2019t believe that AIT is part of it.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PS2004-00218.html", "http://www.asha.org/docs/html/TR2004-00260.html", "http://www.audiology.org/publications/documents/positions/PedRehab/ait.htm", "http://www.audiology.org/NR/rdonlyres/1E53B25E-6E3C-4A70-A5AB-164227DCF41D/0/ait.pdf.", "http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;102/2/431", "http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/adc.2006.094649v2?rss=1", "http://www.drf.org/hearing_health/viewpoints/072803.htm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/02/09/fishing-with-the-wrong-bait/", "title": "Fishing With the Wrong\u00a0bAIT"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t16 February 2008", "body": "This How-To post is dedicated to a pal of mine who was commenting about how hard it is to get the apartment (flat) tidied and cleaned up.  I was trying to describe how I used Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs, natural supports, and the Premack Principle together as means for organising this most mundane set of chores.In this case, we don\u2019t mean that housekeeping is \u201chard\u201d in the sense of physically mopping a floor, but hard in the sense of figuring out where to start, how to keep the momentum going, getting the job finished, and even figuring out what to do with stuff.  The so-called \u201cexecutive functions\u201d of planning, execution, self-monitoring et cetera are not limited to office work \u2014 they are just as necessary in the realm of what used to be referred to (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) as \u201cdomestic engineering\u201d.Amazingly, tidying and cleaning a small apartment is more difficult  than doing the same in a full-size house.  Granted, the larger house has more rooms, which in turn means more square area to be vacuumed or mopped, and may mean twice as many toilets and tubs to scrub.  But the problem with the tiny domicile is that the average 21st-century post-industrial resident has a certain amount of Stuff for daily living, and that amount of stuff does not shrink proportionately just because the domicile does.   (I love the German word for \u201cstuff\u201d, Kram, because cramming my Kram into odd places is what I spend a lot of tidying time doing.)  Worse, small residences usually lack great amounts of storage space.  Unless you are spartan in your personal possessions by dint of poverty or strong design aesthetic*, you have more stuff than the meager cabinets and closets will hold.Of course we have to pick up first to clear the surfaces so we can clean them.  But we could spend all day trying in vain to get things picked up, especially if we have AD/HD and are easily distracted.  Picking up is way too recursive \u2014 you pick up one thing to put away, take it to where it belongs, find something at the end point or en route to the end point, pick it up, maybe put away the first thing, try to put away the second thing, maybe manage to do so without being distracted by the third thing, or get interrupted by a phone call or a cooking timer or remember something else or\u2026Heavens, at that rate you would need to get your shoes re-soled before you got the place picked up!  And in all that, you\u2019re making a half-assed attempt at trying to clean things as well, because you got thirsty and found something moldy or spilled in the fridge and \u2014ARGH!To make any headway in my own domestic engineering, I finally had to set up a hierarchy, somewhat similar to Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. The needs are dual, based upon the needs of the residents for living there, and also upon the housekeeper for being able to get things done effectively. My own order of operations is set up as much as possible for natural supports to be created.The bottom of the hierarchy has the most important need.  In the housekeeping world, this is sanitation.  We have to keep things clean enough that we don\u2019t endanger our health.  You might say that everything related to housekeeping revolves around that premise, but really, some things are more important than others \u2014 as my friend Deanna has noted, \u201cNo one ever died from oven grunge.\u201dThe next level is that morass of decluttering and organising that I refer to generally as \u201ctidying\u201d. As far as I am concerned, a room achieves a state of Tidy when I move in and have finished unpacking, or when I repaint and put things back to rights.  The rest of the time (some 99.8%, I\u2019d hazard) is merely focussed upon the process of tidying, not upon achieving perfect results.  Tidy seems to be a state of grace achieved by decorator homes on photo-shoot day, and by hotel rooms between guests, but is hardly a state of affairs in places where normal people are living on a daily basis.  I don\u2019t worry about achieving it, although I do like my interior environment to get much closer during the odd times when we have company.The other levels include maintenance (stuff like cleaning windows that helps keep things in nice shape, but is not vital to hygiene), and at the top of our domestic pyramid, aesthetics.Many of us are simply trying to stay on top of the bottom hygiene tier, and would like to achieve the tidy tier.   We envy those people who have achieved domestic self-actualisation by having all their rooms at the pinnacle of excellence, the aesthetic  home.  (Behind that envy is a small sense of incredulity, and we might wonder that such people have [1] better-trained residents who pick up after themselves, [2] better-paying jobs that allow for paid help to do the scutwork, or [3] useful OCD tendencies, or [4] some combination of the above.)So, here\u2019s my battle plan for Housekeeping in 12 Steps (ordinal steps, not footsteps):1. Herd all the dishes into the kitchen. Actual dishwashing occurs a bit later \u2014 random dirty mugs and spoons will (for a while) continue to appear out of nowhere, you know.  (If you really have a lot of dishes strewn about, maybe you need a plastic tub for gathering them up, like a smaller version of what restaurant bussers use.)2. Empty all the rubbish and garbage (and change litterboxes) and then immediately take it out to the dumpster. I don\u2019t park it at the door, or worse, in the middle of the room, because I will trip over it and spill it and then have an even worse mess to clean up.  I learned a very important tip from a professional custodian \u2014 don\u2019t leave the replacement trash bags in the box in some cupboard somewhere \u2014 put them in the bottoms of the wastebaskets right where you need them.  That way when you remove one full bag, there\u2019s another bag waiting there to line the wastebasket right away.  That saves you at least one trip, or probably several, because most of us have several wastebaskets.3. Gather up all the laundry for washing, including stripping off the bed linens and the towels and stuff, and sort that into the respective piles.  Doing this impels me to keep moving, because I hate not having clean sheets \u2014 or any sheets \u2014 on the bed, so I have to get them washed and done soon.  If I am doing laundry in another part of the building, I set a timer to remind me to keep going back promptly to keep the loads moving.  (Usually I do the sheets first and dark clothes after those, because I\u2019m going to put the cleaning rags in the hot water/whites load.)  While I am picking up random clothes, I also grab the empty hangers, so they all end up at the washer-dryer where I need them.  It\u2019s too much bother to go back to fetch hangers when I\u2019m pulling out a load from the dryer, and it\u2019s worse bother to have even more shirts to iron because they sat squashed in a basket for days until I need to wear them.By this point I feel like I actually have some momentum, because one job is finished and another has been irrevocably set into motion.4. If you hand-wash dishes, then fill up the sink with some hot, soapy water and start the dishes soaking.  (We\u2019re letting them soak in hot, soapy water because the food is dried on them.) If your sink is too full of dirty dishes to be able to plug it, then you need that busser\u2019s tub to hold the extra dirties.  If space is really tight, then make sure the burners are cool and set a rimmed  baking sheet on the stove and use it for spare counter space.Another basic need beyond sanitation is keeping the apartment and the utilities, meaning, getting bills paid.5. Next it\u2019s time to tackle some of the paper-paper-paper. I could spend all day at this, so I DO NOT sit down!    Sitting down means getting sucked into  looking at things, both the things I need to look at, and the many-more things I don\u2019t need to look at.  All I am doing right now is flipping through the papers to pull out things that can be thrown away, and bills or documents that need to be attended to. Although I try to have everything automatically deposited and paid, there are always those random things that require personal attention.  There\u2019s something deadly about thinking that I will \u201cget around to\u201d paying that bill or following up on that letter later on.  Whenever possible I follow the \u201cOHIO Rule\u201d (Only Handle It Once),  so usually when I get my post I stand by the wastepaper basket and immediately sort stuff into junk \u2013 magazines \u2013 business. When housecleaning, I sort out the bills and things that need attention, and I put those on my chair seat so they don\u2019t get lost, and so I don\u2019t forget about them.Feeling virtuous by having located several things I had forgotten that I must attend to, I then pull myself away form the paper-paper-paper before I get sucked into it and/or the Internet / computer that is also at the desk. That\u2019s another reason why I set stuff on my chair:  it impedes sitting. (Am I clever or what?)6.  I\u2019m a procrastinator, so dealing with some of that paper is really a type of productive procrastination, because next up is the important hygiene task of cleaning the bathroom.  ::blech::  I employ the Premack Principle, and promise myself a snack after I finish the bathroom.  Scrubbing the bathroom reminds me to remove the used towels and bath rug to the appropriate laundry pile if I had not already done so.7.  Having that well-deserved snack takes me back to the kitchen, which reminds me that I need to finish washing at least one load of dishes. Normally when I\u2019m not strapped for time, I wash dishes after each use, rather than letting them pile up.  It\u2019s simply easier to put a wee squirt of dish soap (washing-up liquid) on the scrubby-sponge and clean off my bowl-spoon-mug than it is to clean up several meals\u2019 worth of dirty dishes.  Of course, sometimes I am too much in a hurry to get someplace else and thus have to leave the dishes, or else other people leave dishes.  So, the dirty dishes pile up.  I will enjoy my snack, and then wash one drying-rack full of dishes and let those drip-dry while I attend to more housekeeping. Meanwhile, the next batch of dirty dishes goes in to soak (changing out suds if necessary).8. Ah, it\u2019s time to move the laundry loads.  When the sheets are out of the dryer, I force myself to straightaway put them back on the beds.  I hate wrinkled sheets, I loathe making beds when I\u2019m dog-tired, and I need my bed surface back to rights because that\u2019s where sit to match socks and fold stuff.  Now, I like fancy socks, but hubby just wears the same dark socks on work days.  So when his socks get thread-bare, I toss all of them and buy a bunch of replacement socks that are all the same.  My point to the wholesale sock-replacement is that I have better things to spend my life doing than sorting socks!  Plus, hubby frequently does his own laundry, and he has some colorblindness issues and couldn\u2019t always tell when things were mismatched.  (Let it be said that the two of us have different opinions on what constitutes \u201cworn\u201d, but some of the socks I have tossed were more see-through than a negligee. I really don\u2019t understand guys sometimes.)Wardrobe debates aside, I have made great progress on the housekeeping front, but by this point the enthusiasm has begun to wane.  There are only a few hurdles left \u2026 better put on some music!9. Clean out the fridge.  This means checking the dates on the meat and dairy items, and throwing away any leftovers that are more than a week old. (How the hell do I remember?  I try to clean out the fridge on the same day of the week, or else I just toss anything I didn\u2019t make in the past couple days.) The drawers get washed out and the sticky spots wiped off the shelves and the door handles.  Frequently we have a grocery list magnetted to the fridge, and cleaning-out is a good time to add to that.10. Clear off the floors to vacuum, sweep or mop.  Of course, there is stuff on the floors, just like there is stuff on all the other horizontal surfaces, and we are already familiar with the recursive picking-up issues.Well, here\u2019s the secret to getting things picked up:  grab a large, sturdy laundry basket and a small rubbish bag.  Just go around and pick up all the clutter, and drop things into either the basket or the rubbish bag. (Remember, we already picked up most of the dirty dishes and clothes.) Ta-da! Instant surfaces!  Once you have exposed those surfaces, put down the basket, toss the last bag of rubbish, and do the floor cleaning and table wiping.11. If this was a song, we would be singing the chorus again. Move laundry again, if necessary.  Put away clean dishes and rinse off the second batch and set it up to dry. Wipe off the counters and the stove. Get something to drink, and change music if necessary.12.  Finally attend to the Basket O\u2019 Clutter.  Instead of putting away one thing at a time and making trails like drunken Spirograph patterns all over your residence, you simply take the basket to each holding location (closet, cabinet, drawer) and unload the stuff that belongs there.  Then your basket is free for the last load of laundry.  Yes, you have to put that stuff away now, or you won\u2019t have the basket for bringing back the laundry!Well, as odd as that system may sound to some, it works for me. As the saying goes, \u201cYour mileage may vary.\u201d* I admire them, but I don\u2019t really believe those photographs of people\u2019s homes in architecture and decorating magazines.  Everyone really has boxes of tissues and wastepaper baskets and bottles of hand lotion and the not-really-clean-not-really-dirty clothes to be worn again before washing and all other mundane objects of real life.", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premack's_principle", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/02/16/maslow-cleans-house/", "title": "Maslow Cleans House"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t18 February 2008 ", "body": "Last week I took two of our cats to the vet for their annual check-ups, including the Rabies, Feline Distemper, and Feline Leukemia vaccines. Some years ago we lost one of our cats to Feline Leukemia; the poor kitty died just a few months before the vaccine was available.This Saturday past I reminded my gardening students that if they cannot remember when they last had a Tetanus booster, they they should go and get one, because a booster is recommended every ten years. The number of people to have survived Tetanus is vanishingly small; it\u2019s pretty much a death sentence.  It\u2019s also easily prevented by a simple vaccine.  Sure, your arm is a bit sore for a couple of days, but that beats dying an extremely painful and highly unnecessary death.  As I reminded my students, \u201cYou get your pets vaccinated, you get your children vaccinated, so you should get yourself vaccinated!\u201dExcept there are a few people who don\u2019t want to get their children vaccinated. A drop in vaccinations means not only that some people get sick, but a drop in vaccinations also means a loss of \u201cherd immunity\u201d, meaning that most of the population is not immune, so there are enough people who can catch and then transmit the disease.  When you make a decision to not immunise, you are not making a decision that affects just you and your children.  You are a making a decision that affects everyone else in your community.That is why we had recent epidemics of mumps and measles in the UK and the US, leading to hundreds of sick people, and some who were disabled or killed.  Because I work with students in various schools, I get lots of exposure to viruses.  I had not previous had a mumps vaccine or the disease, so during those epidemics I went and got the MMR.  Now I\u2019m protected against Mumps, Measles and Rubella (even though I had the other vaccines in \u201963 and \u201970, the combined vax helps boost my immunity).  I also went through the Hepatitis B series that year.So yes, I\u2019m a big proponent of vaccinations.And no, I do not subscribe to the hysteria generated by a few noisy, well-meaning but seriously-deluded or paranoid people who believe that there is a world-wide conspiracy to poison children and make them catch autism or ADHD or whatever.A few people get hysterical because some vaccines used to contain a preservative (thimerosal) that was a mercury compound containing ethyl mercury.  They liken that to the same mercury compound found in fish (methyl mercury) or to elemental mercury.  That is a horrible mis-comprehension of basic chemistry.  The types of elements, the numbers of atoms, and the arrangement of those atoms are all important \u2014 different compounds have different characteristics. For example, sodium hypochlorite is what\u2019s in bleach that makes it a good disinfectant because it is toxic to micro-organisms (and in larger doses to bigger organisms), but sodium chloride is common table salt.  The composition of molecules matters!The fact is that even years after thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines, we still have new cases of autism and ADHD being diagnosed.  Studies in several countries have repeatedly found no causality between vaccines and autism.  Autism is often diagnosed when children are two or three years old, but doesn\u2019t mean that their vaccines \u201ccaused\u201d it.I see absolutely NO reason to believe that either my own issues or my children\u2019s issues were in any way caused by the vaccinations that we have received.There is no world-wide \u201cconspiracy of harm\u201d between various vaccine manufacturers and the hundreds of health departments and physician groups in nations around the world. Rather, there is a world-wide effort to eliminate highly-contagious and dangerous diseases that can  disable or even kill children and adults around the world.Another problem with the anti-vax (anti-vaccination) contingent is that they feed the  media those heart-tugging sob stories full of \u201cpoor abused citizen railing against big, bad company\u201d that the news media are so fond of broadcasting.  Unfortunately, the average news reporter does not realise that they are being duped by these earnest-but-misled parents, by the well-connected \u201cpersonalities\u201d, or by the odd doctor or pseudo-medical professional who is selling quack cures.  What is needed to balance out all the nonsense in the media are sensible counter-stories from the rest of the world.In my country, one such physician group is the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AAP is sending out a request for ordinary citizens, meaning YOU, to help counter the alarmist nonsense.  Bloggers like myself are also helping by passing along this message.  The letter is below.andreaHello,\nAs part of our ongoing response to media stories regarding autism and vaccines, the AAP communications department is compiling a list of parents who support the AAP and are available for interviews. We are looking for two types of parents who could serve as spokespersons:\nParents of children with autism spectrum disorders who support immunization and who do not believe there is any link between their child\u2019s vaccines and his or her autism.\nParents of children who suffered a vaccine-preventable illness. This could be a parent who declined immunization, whose child became ill before a vaccine was available, or whose child was ineligible for immunization.\nWe are asking for your help identifying parents who would be good spokespersons. They do not need to be expert public speakers. They just need to be open with their story and interested in speaking out on the issue. We will contact candidates in advance to conduct pre-interviews, to offer guidance on talking to reporters and to obtain a signed waiver giving us permission to release their name.\nIf a parent were placed on our list, we would offer their name and contact information to select media. We hope to build a list of parents from a wide range of geographical areas.\nAs the Jenny McCarthy and \u201cEli Stone\u201d stories illustrate, this issue is likely to recur in the national and local media. The AAP is committed to doing all we can to counter such erroneous reports with factual information supported by scientific evidence and AAP recommendations.\nThe anti-vaccine groups often have emotional family stories on their side. The ability to offer a reporter an interview with a similarly compelling parent who is sympathetic to the AAP\u2019s goals is a powerful tool for our media relations program.\nPlease contact me if you have any questions or to suggest a parent to interview.\nThank you,\nSusan Stevens Martin\nDirector, Division of Media Relations\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/02/18/a-shot-in-the-arm-a-slight-kick-in-the-butt/", "title": "A shot in the arm, A slight kick in the\u00a0butt"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t17 February 2008", "body": "I\u2019ve not been posting much lately, due to a combination of a head cold (you would think that would result in more sleep, but good sleep still eludes me), major changes in my job schedule, an evening class that I\u2019m taking sucking up time with studying, new Saturday classes that I\u2019m teaching sucking up time with preparations, and ongoing communication blips between my household wireless router and the AirPort card in my MacBook.  I think the wireless problems annoy me most of all, because it\u2019s being able to rely upon the little things that enable us to deal with the big things.Having digital communication blips reminded me of the other sort that we sometimes deal with around here.So. I have a teenager of the typically reticent sort, who at times is given to answering open-ended questions in monosyllables.  That in itself is not particularly uncommon.  What we do run into are situations where the Kid is still learning what needs to be actively communicated, rather than assuming that others will know what is wanted or planned.  These are the little blips of \u201cmindblindness\u201d that we sometimes run into with the Asperger\u2019s and/or AD/HD kids.  (Adults have these problems at times too \u2014 the difference being that we have figured out the more common situations, but still miss moments here and there, leaving our spouses and co-workers puzzled or annoyed).What are these communication blips?  The range all over the place, popping up unexpectedly from a lack of sharing necessary details to failing to coordinate plans.For example, one day the kid asked me to make him some food.  Turns out all that was wanted was just a sandwich.  What\u2019s so special about Mom slapping together bread, mustard, cheese slice and some turkey is beyond me, but you know, it\u2019s \u201cmanna from mama\u201d.  And then as I am starting to repackage the ingredients there comes the protest, \u201cNo!\u201d  After brief discussion, I find out that what was wanted was a double-decker sandwich (three slices of bread with fillings in two layers) which was not mentioned.  Something else wanted was that the shaved turkey slices be flattened out, as they\u2019re packaged accordian-folded.  I adjusted the sandwich. But by this point, I said in a very low-key manner, \u201cI\u2019m your mom and I love you, but I\u2019m not telepathic. You have to TELL me and communicate these things.\u201dOr, the kid needs to make up a quiz that was missed when out sick.  Ever since 4th grade, we have been working on the whole planning ahead business of, \u201cWhat will you need to do tomorrow; what do you need to take with you?\u201d Now by 11th grade the routines have been built in and things generally run much more smoothly.  Generally the cell phone is kept charged, the textbooks are not lost, the shoes are easily found, car keys and wallet are parked someplace consistently, and so on.  All systems are \u201cGreen for Go\u201d when planning for the obvious.It\u2019s the contingency planning that is still problematic.  So to get that quiz made up, the kid has to be proactive to not only remember that the school day will have something extra and unusual in it, but must also remember that some kind of arrangement needs to be made with the teacher to schedule that make-up quiz.  Sometimes the teachers will lead in that scheduling, but teachers are busy people too and have lots of students, and it is really the student\u2019s job to ensure that they get their work (and make-up work) completed.  The kid just assumes the teacher knows.  Maybe the teacher does.  But even so, without prior arrangements, sometimes a stop by the classroom after school results in the student finding an empty classroom!To be honest, not all of these sorts of omissions are from not realising that the other person does not know one\u2019s plans or preferences.Sometimes there\u2019s the inertia issue, of moving out of the usual routine to initiate the necessary conversation. This may sound odd, but routine conversations follow an expected pattern, and thus are easier to initiate and follow.  They are easier than finding both the right moment and the energy to create novel queries.  (We\u2019ve all had days when we were too tired to make one more phone call to follow up on an order, or schedule a repair, or change an appointment, or deal with a particularly energy-sapping person.  Now, imagine that kind of inertia happening frequently, even in situations you want to initiate.)Sometimes omissions in communication result from not realising that what was an established routine with one person was simply just a dyadic routine, rather than a general routine that most people do. The extra details did not need to be shared because they were previously established. Then when one is no longer dealing with the same other person, all those previously-established expectations are no longer there.  It is hard to pick up on the subtleties of the \u201chidden curriculum\u201d at school or work, and it is especially more difficult when one does not realise that there are even going to be some differences that need to be sussed out. This is when our students run into confusion about how the usual interactions are supposed to run, and then they may make complaints about how one new teacher or boss does everything \u201cweird\u201d or makes \u201cunreasonable\u201d expectations (\u201cunreasonable\u201d in this case really meaning \u201cunexpected\u201d).How do we resolve these things?Sometimes we learn how to observe situations and analyse them for what others will be expecting.  This depends upon having previously built up mental frameworks about how things are supposed to be done in various situations.  We then compare those previous protocols with how things seem to be running in the current situation, try to identify where there may be differences, and then determine how to adapt our responses.  This is all rather laborious, and is one of the reason why being at school or work all day is so fatiguing and requires some time alone to recharge.  (Imagine if the initial confusion of your first few days on a new job kept re-occurring even after you had been there for weeks and months.)More loquacious people try to be pro-active by mentioning the details that we think the other person may need to know.  This can work really well, or it can lead us to the other end of the communication spectrum, that of \u201cdata-bombing\u201d others with what they feel are trivial details, or we are making too frequent interruptions of post-scripts to requests and directions, or we are simply providing unnecessary amounts of information.For the more reticent, if we can get past the inertia problem, then one of the best ways to resolve them is to ask if the other person needs more information, or how they want something to be arranged. This works great if we are able to tell exactly where we are needing clarification.  Unfortunately, often both people in the conversation have no idea of where the communication blips are occurring. All that can be seen is that Somebody is forgetting to mention important details.Sometimes that Somebody is me.  Sometimes that Somebody is another person.  Both ends of the interchange can be exasperating.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/02/17/communication-blips/", "title": "Communication Blips"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 February 2008 ", "body": "The other day at the college I was waiting for an elevator (lift).  It\u2019s rather slow, but  a sleet storm was heading in and I was especially achy.  Just a few feet away was a bulletin board for a program the college runs, including a series of non-credit weekend classes for people with Down\u2019s and other developmental or cognitive disabilities.  One of the things thumbtacked to the board was a yellowing newspaper clipping. The photograph showed a young man busy in his kitchen, with his father standing nearby, watching him.  The article began by mentioning how lucky the young man is because he has resources to help him learn to live independently, to get his own apartment, to get a job to support himself, and other important things.He is lucky.\u201cLucky\u201d is one of those stock newspaper words that seems to be required in stories about disabled people.  It\u2019s right up there with \u201camazing\u201d, \u201cinspiring\u201d, \u201cchallenged\u201d, \u201cjourney\u201d and a dozen other terms that I\u2019m blanking on just from sheer nausea factor.  (I\u2019m sure you can think of several others.)  I finished reading the story by the time the elevator moseyed up to the top floor.  By the time I descended three levels, I had gathered up a fair bit of annoyance.I am beginning to hate the word \u201clucky\u201d. It is misleading.  It conflates different meanings together and glosses over problems.Although the young man is fortunate to have these opportunities, he did not get them by random chance.  The job training, the job placement, the housekeeping skills, the acquisition of an apartment, all of these things were thought up, initiated and followed-through by numbers of people working together across town.  Not only do these efforts require people to work directly with him, they require funding and personnel to coordinate and maintain such programs for others with similar needs.Furthermore, if he is \u201clucky\u201d to have these opportunities, then that is obliquely referring to the fact that his is an exceptional case.  Although some of these supports are in place, they are haphazard, irregularly funded, inconsistently applied, and highly scattered in availability.When media stories talk about how \u201clucky\u201d someone is, there is frequently a heavy implication that the fortunate event happened through some kind of random chance.  It is as though the newsworthy quality resides in the propitious combination of \u201cdeserving needy person\u201d and \u201cunexpected good fortune\u201d.  Some of it fulfills an inner child-like need for the universe to be fair and for good things to happen to those who need them.But another, more important chunk of it is that it quietly absolves most of society from responsibility.  Things just happened by luck.  Some folks are just lucky, and others just aren\u2019t.  That\u2019s just the way it is.  (Maybe if you are sincere enough and use the right charms, you can be lucky, too!)  I don\u2019t believe in \u201cluck\u201d.  Random chance permeates all existence, but there are no quasi-magical good or bad forces or d\u00e6mons of Luck.But think about all this, about all the things that have taken place for these needs to have been fulfilled.  People worked together to make this happen.  They built new social structures, working against the cultural inertia and resistance from others\u2019 prejudices.  Those structures need to be maintained and enlarged.  Many more people with similar difficulties need those supports, and do not have them.  As noted by the mere existance of this \u201castounding\u201d newspaper article, the young man is indeed fortunate to have been one of the few who has these services available.Luck has nothing to do with it.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/02/22/not-so-lucky/", "title": "Not so lucky"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t28 February 2008", "body": "Funny short story:Hubby and I are at the local pub having a Guinness.  Naturally, the big-screen televisions are on, and he asks me, \u201cAre you watching the basketball game?\u201d\nAre you kidding?!  I think to myself, and answer, \u201cNo.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a slight pause, then he asks, \u201cAre you staring at the ceiling fan?\u201d\nBusted!\nWell you know, I\u2019m there to relax, right?  Chatting with hubby about life, and enjoying my ale is only part of that.A pal of mine is very stressed. Sadly, this is a common problem. But even worse, over the years the repertoire of natural coping methods have been so discouraged, extinguished or suppressed that my pal can hardly name what is helpful. Now that is really sad.We all have ways of dealing with stresses.  They can be roughly divided into three general categories: organisation [O], timing [T], and soothing activities [S].  I have denoted each with an initial because the text flow did not easily lend to listing these in categorical sections.Prevention [O]:  We avoid situations that we know will be stressful.  Sometimes we can have someone else do a task for us, or set things up so the task does not actually have to be done.For example, automatic paycheck deposits eliminate the need for stopping by the bank to make deposits, and automatic bill payments eliminate the need to keep track of bills, remember to pay them on time, write out checks, purchase and keep track of stamps and get them on the envelopes, mailing the bills, and doing the checking account balance.TIP:  I finally got smarter \u2014 I keep my stamps in my checkbook because paying bills is when I usually need a stamp.  And if I\u2019m at the post office with a parcel, then I can check my supply of stamps when I pay for the parcel.Limiting [T]:  We reduce how much time we spend in unavoidable situations that are stressful. Frequently we do that by carrying on as much communication through e-mail or other indirect means.  \u201cIndirect\u201d in this case means not engaging in face-to-face meetings where we have to have to recognise people, do all the cognitive work of listening \u2014 recalling \u2014 answering, possibly engage in a lot of eye-contact, and get to and from the meeting place.  (Oh, and of course, remember the appointment, figure out what you need to take, and get there on time.  ::sigh:: )Having someone come visit your home or office eliminates the need to travel.  You also have a pretty good idea that if Joe has a 1:00 appointment, and a guy shows up around 1:00 looking for you, it\u2019s probably Joe.  But receiving visitors also creates stress because someone is imposing upon your personal space or safe zone. Most of us have far larger \u201cpersonal spaces\u201d than the average person of our local culture does.If you cannot easily conclude the meeting, that may reduce how much control you have over the duration.  I have seen some people conduct meetings in places without chairs, because this prevents inertia from settling in and the meeting droning on past the point of productivity.  (Of course, for someone using a wheelchair, a standing-only meeting would be rather uncomfortable from both ergonomic and interpersonal perspectives.)One of the best ways to limit meeting time is to be prepared, so the meeting can be conducted more efficiently.Preparedness [O]: We  can reduce considerable stress by getting information together ahead of time, and put it into a format that we can easily refer to when meeting with people.Handouts for the others are especially useful so we don\u2019t have to recall everything. Sometimes we can even prevent having to present all the details, and can just refer to the points in brief.  Handouts can even reduce a certain amount of the NT discussion-fluff by distilling necessary information, rather than everyone going through what each of them thought was going on, with the whole recursive conversational process of:  polite enquiry \u2014 self-deprecating remarks \u2014 presenting information \u2014 complimenting everyone \u2014 comparing information \u2014 repeating self-deprecating remarks \u2014 confirming information \u2014 and more compliments.  (No wonder meetings take so damn long!)  Handouts are also vital if you want to be sure that others will not mis-remember or forget important details.For example, I have a piece of paper in my wallet with my diagnoses, medications, doctors, and drug reactions; all the docs and nurses love this as they can just photocopy the current version for my charts.  Before I meet doctors, I make myself a note card with a list of symptoms, the intensity and duration of those symptoms, and what kinds of questions I want to ask.  This really helps because by the time I have described most of the \u201creasons for this visit\u201d information to the nurse who does the initial assessment, I have trouble remembering what all I need to say to the doctor, much less remembering what I have told whom.The same kinds of details are helpful for meeting with people, such as SpEd committees. Sometimes I make discrete notes about how I want to interact at the meeting, such as what kinds of enquiries would make good warm-fuzzy chit-chat with the people, or how I want to introduce issues in a manner that demonstrates common concerns and offers cooperative resolutions.TIP: I also like to bring a printed agenda. Amazingly, if yours is the only agenda, people will often default to it in a kind of bureaucratic autopilot.  (\u201cPaper beats rock\u201d \u2014 printed public agendas beat out individual\u2019s mental lists.)Spacing in Time [T]:  Giving ourselves down-time between especially stressful things during our day.  In school this may be scheduling classes with break periods between them, or having classes on different days.  If travelling to a meeting, then we allow an extra day (or at least a night) to get settled in and acclimate and prepare, rather than arriving somewhere after hours of travel and then having a meeting right after checking into  a hotel.It should be noted however, that putting things off can also increase stress by creating free-floating anxiety related to the anticipation of the event.  Sadly, even if we\u2019re good at procrastinating getting things done, we can\u2019t always seem to put the stress on \u201chold\u201d as well.  Worrying is not the same thing as being concerned or being prepared.  Being prepared will reduce worrying.  Worrying in contrast is what happens when being concerned goes beyond what is reasonable or useful.  There is nothing virtuous or beneficial about worrying just to be worrying.Spacing in Place [T]:  Maybe we could call this \u201cspacing out in place\u201d because that\u2019s what often happens.  In this case, we\u2019re taking a break by changing locations, removing ourselves from the noisy, crowded parts of the building to the quieter, more solitary places.  It may not be a long break in time, but by giving ourselves a break from the overstimulation, we can relax and recharge a little before tackling the next event.Some kinds of buildings are hard to find \u201csafe zones\u201d.  It does no good for a boss to say that you \u201chave an office\u201d when all you have is three and a half cubicle divider walls in a giant \u201ccube farm\u201d full of noisy people with their two dozen lunch odors, numerous phones, the drone of countless pieces of electronic equipment, and endless racks of flickery fluorescent lights.  There is a bit less of the feeling that one is constantly on display, but still no effective quiet zone.  Sometimes there are odd quiet places, like the supply room, atria at the ends of corridors, storm shelters, and of course, toilets located in a less-used part of the building (basement, top, or corner locations).  Even going on brief \u201coffice building infiltration\u201d excursions to find underused nooks can be a short mental vacation.  It would be nice if there were more quiet places to rest outdoors; sadly, most of the ones around here have been colonized by the nicotine addicts who aren\u2019t allowed to smoke in classrooms or offices.Stimming [S]:  We can de-stress between situations, and also during situations. Ways of de-stressing vary considerably from one person to another, and can include things like: rocking or swinging; watching the surf, flickering wind-blown tree leaves, a spinning ceiling fan, or a sparkling waterfall; shuffling around manipulatives (buttons, marbles, smooth stones, tiles et cetera); watching the screen saver, or graphic equalizer of the music player; running hands through sand or small pellets; petting animals or soft fabrics \u2026 stims are sensory in nature, and are not generally \u201chobby\u201d activities.A lot of stimming activities are done to help channel fidgety ADHD energy, and/or to reduce stress.  The sensory input of a favorite stim can also help focus the attention.  Focus reduces the number of stimulus inputs and allows the brain to process fewer sensory channels, thus making them more manageable.  Limiting the number of input channels also makes it easier to process the sensory channel(s) that  we do need to attend to.For example, staring at something pleasant instead of trying to attend to a lot of eye contact will allow for more attention and active memory to devote to auditory processing.  Wrapping one\u2019s forearms and/or hands up in snug gloves, bandannas, tape or elastic bandage may help re-direct attention from the distractions and annoyances of clothes, shoes, air currents ruffling skin and hair, or chair upholstery.Energetic de-stressing [S]: Exercise is great for increasing endorphins, for using up nervous energy, for improving physical condition, and for releasing knots of stored tension.  Rhythmic activities are especially good, such as jumping on a trampoline, running, dancing, bicycling, skating, or even raking.Calming de-stressing [S]: Quiet activities give the chance to take a break from life.  Many of these are sensory activities but are distinguished from stims in that they are often related to hobby activities (which somehow makes them all socially acceptable):  meditation or prayer; assembling puzzles; doing paper games like crosswords, sudoku, cryptograms, or folding origami;  playing video games or computer puzzles like Planarity or Tetris; knitting, crocheting, quilting or embroidery; squeezing stress-balls, kneading dough, winding new skeins of yarn into balls \u2026 the number of possibilities are huge.Don\u2019t ask me why some sensory stims like watching the surf or fountains are considered \u201cnormal\u201d but other sensory stims like staring at flickering tree leaves or spinning ceiling fans are considered \u201cabnormal\u201d.  Culture is something that develops over time, and is often full of inconsistencies.  Sometimes all one has to do is to point them out, \u201cSome people like to watch the surf; I like to watch ceiling fans.  It\u2019s great \u2014 no sand in your shorts!\u201dSo readers, I would like to take an information-gathering survey and ask, \u201cWhat do you do to deal with stress?\u201d", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_exploration", "http://www.planarity.net/#"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/02/28/328/", "title": "De-stressing with O.T.S."},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t27 February 2008 ", "body": "I tossed and turned all night.Well, not really.  Tossing and turning implies far more bounciness and  energetic mobility than I had.  Rather, I woke up every couple hours when it was time to shift to another sleeping position.  There were no comfortable positions to be had (there never really are), but with enough pyjama-straightening to remove the deadly little wrinkles pinned under my hips and shoulders, by shifting the spare pillows to completely pad between my bony knees and feet, and plumping up my head pillow again, I could reach a level of acceptable discomfort and fall asleep again.I get plenty of REM sleep; in fact, it seems like all I do is dream because any disturbance wakes me from a dream.   (An article in Scientific American describes just how more interrupted sleep results in longer and more intense dream periods.)  I just don\u2019t know that I\u2019m getting enough deep, restful sleep.  When I\u2019m sick I\u2019ll be in bed for eight to ten hours more-or-less sleeping, but I still seem generally stuck at six-hour nights.  I can\u2019t remember the last time I slept through the night, but it was several years ago.The good news is that my OB/GYN put me back on the hormone patch again, and three weeks later, no more hot flashes \u2014 w00t!   Half a year ago my GP took me off my HRT (hormone replacement therapy, as I\u2019ve had a hysterectomy due to endometriosis & ovarian cysts), because he thought it was giving me hypertension.  He also cut my arthralgia med dose in half.  Shockingly, being in pain makes my blood pressure go up, so I went back to the dose prescribed by my rheumatologist. Well, after half a year of supremely crappy sleep due to hot flashes every 30-90 minutes all night (and day) I couldn\u2019t stand the brain-deadness from such chronic sleep deprivation, and my rheumatologist told me to see my OB/GYN for another opinion.  (Gee, if I had been getting more sleep, that might have occurred to me.)    Well, my OB/GYN was unimpressed with my GP and put me back on the patch, saying, \u201cOnly a man would do something like that,\u201d and made me promise that I would let anyone take me off the patch. Yes ma\u2019am!My neck is making that annoying grating-squeaking noise again.  It sounds horribly loud from perspective of the control chair my homunculus occupies inside my skull (meaning, I imagine sitting inside my skull, like the captain of the Enterprise looking out through the twin viewing screens of my eyes).  Someone ought to dispatch a Starfleet engineer to crawl through the Jefferies Tubes and apply some lubricant to my cervical vertebrae.  Probably no one else can hear it, unlike when I eat something chewy and my jaw repeatedly pops, or when I kneel and my knees make cracking noises as though I had stepped one of my size 10 boots atop an egg carton.Speaking of knees, Thursday last I skidded on an icy patch of sidewalk and was this close to crashing.  Thankfully I didn\u2019t as I was carrying my MacBook in my briefcase.  (Carrying a computer or camera is like carrying a baby; you go through all sorts of ergonomically horrid contortions to protect it.)  Instead I stayed upright by virtue of locking one knee, which meant bending it backwards more than knees are generally meant to bend.  I don\u2019t know how much hypertextension my knees and elbows have, as the doc has not formally done a Beighton score on me, but I\u2019m definitely good (or bad, as it were) on the other signs.  In any regard, the next day I awoke with such overall muscle and joint aches that I was very thankful that my current job does not require me to be in until 10:00; I simply would not have been able to clock in at 7:30.Maybe I should find something different for breakfast.  I need to eat before taking my meds, but eating means getting out of bed and going downstairs to the kitchen to make my oatmeal, which is daunting on a dreich* morning when it\u2019s sleeting outside and just opening my eyes magnifies pain.  (Don\u2019t suggest keeping saltines at my bedside; the wheat does the Macarena through my kishkas**.)I must say, some days I feel like I\u2019m outsourcing my pieces-parts with all these docs. Even the dentist gets a piece of the action with the NTI bite-block that so nicely (and immediately) halted the TMJ-related headaches.  So the bite-block is one definite improvement.  So is getting back on the hormone patch.  Getting my Clonidine dose doubled was also really helpful, as taking it before bedtime suppress the muscle tics that had for decades meant taking an hour or more to fall asleep. Getting to sleep in \u201cjust\u201d half an hour is fabulous, for which I\u2019m thankful to a previous psychiatrist who first prescribed it.   (My half hour is still downright glacial compared to hubby\u2019s zero-to-snoring in five minutes.  How the hell does he do that?)So, some things better, some not so much.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t29 February 2008", "body": "\u201cHow long can it take to walk out the door?\u201dOther people ask us this.  They are incredulous as we struggle to get to places on time, much less with all the materials we needed to have.We also ask ourselves this when we are getting ready or planning.  Surely, we think to ourselves, merely walking out the door and getting into the car takes almost no time at all.As if!And that\u2019s why we struggle to get to places on time.It takes us far longer to \u201cget our shit together,\u201d to remember everything we need, and then get into the car, and unload all the baggage, settle down, and get ready to drive.  The least speed-bump in the getting-ready process (like a mislaid car key) throws everything into chaos, which stresses us beyond dealing with that little event, often resulting in getting so distracted from our tediously-created coping methods so that we forget something we usually can remember, or almost-forget and have to go back in (maybe more than once) to fetch something nearly forgotten.Take a deep breath.Let it out slowly.Yeah.  Just thinking about these situations reminds us of all those crazy days, weeks and months and years of them.  We remember all the scolding, the embarrassment of being late, of missing appointments, of getting to places without something important or even the most necessary thing that may have been the reason for us going there in the first place.Just being stressed about trying to leave on time makes things worse; the clumsiness increases.   Even after finally getting ready one morning (in N-recursive steps, as usual), I have then been finally ready to go, had all my stuff together, had my car key in hand \u2026 and then somehow spilled everything out of my purse.  I kept trying to scoop everything back in, making things worse.  I got to my first appointment with the new doc nearly half an hour late, and spent the first two minutes trying to explain why I was late.  Fortunately, docs who deal with AD/HD patients are used to such problems. (Amazingly, or not-so-amazingly, he didn\u2019t even ask to see my diagnostic documentation.)The problem is three-fold. Firstly, we have a poor sense of time passage. Secondly, we have a poor sense of time estimation.  And thirdly we \u2026 (where was I going with this?  oh yeah) we get distracted easily.  Mix those with poor organisational skills, sprinkle heavily with the anxiety from fear of repeating the previous embarrassments, and we end up with the usual frantic situation.Time passage is elastic for most people \u2014 time drags when we\u2019re bored, and flies by when we\u2019re having fun.  But not everyone gets so obliviously focused on what they are doing, and lost in the moment that not only minutes but hours will slide by unnoticed. I have been so enthralled in a current interest that I have forgotten to eat. Schedules are really helpful for me to help maintain some consistency in my eating and sleeping.People with AD/HD will chronically under-estimate how long it takes to do anything.  This is partly related to that elasticity of time issue \u2014 we don\u2019t really realise how long it took to do something last time.  It\u2019s also partly related to the distraction issue, as few things ever get done in a straightforward manner.  And when one is hyperactive as well, it\u2019s hard to complete something without mixing in other tasks simultaneously.  Starting and completing single tasks in a linear manner is just not in the book of tricks. (\u201cBehold the human pinball!\u201d)By the time I was in graduate school, I became fond of collecting data.  I realised the importance of objective, measurable information for solving some kinds of problems.  So I started keeping track of how long it actually took me to get various things done.  After a month\u2019s time, I had accumulated ten days\u2019 worth of data points.  (I kept forgetting that I was meaning to collect data, or would look at the starting time but forget to check the clock again right when I\u2019d finished.  You know \u2026 )The results surprised even me.  Not only did I become aware of just how non-linear any of my processes were, but everything took much longer than I had anticipated.  I thought that getting my coat, keys and bag would take a minute or two.  It really took longer, and not just because I was interrupting myself by grabbing something extra I needed to take (like the bag of trash for the rubbish bin), or by looking for something I had not put in the right place (like door keys that were left in a jacket pocket because yesterday my hands were full of mail).The whole process took longer not only because of those typical asides, but also because I was not including a good number of steps.  I didn\u2019t just put on a jacket, pick up a backpack, and walk out the door.  I also:\nput on my shoes,\nzipped up my backpack,\nswitched off all the lights,\nchecked to make sure the coffee maker and cooker were turned off,\nmade sure that there weren\u2019t any cats at the back door waiting to be let back inside,\nlooked out the window to make sure I had the right kind of coat,\noften remembered to do my \u201cpocket Macarena\u201d to be sure I had my keys and stuff,\npicked up my bags,\nstepped outside,\nchecked the door lock,\noften stuck some envelopes in the post box,\npicked up the morning newspaper and sometimes a piece of stray rubbish,\nunlocked my car,\nput the bags into it,\nremembered my lunch bag and went back in to fetch it,\nstepped outside,\nchecked the door lock again,\nfinally got into my car,\nstopped to agonise over, Did I check everything? and then told myself sternly that, No, I don\u2019t need to go back and check that I checked.\n\u201cHow long can it take to walk out the door?\u201dAbout ten minutes.That ten-minute average did not include mishaps like the spilled purse, mislaid keys, or suddenly remembering that I needed to take something extra with me and then having to find and assemble the thing.Timing yourself in how long it  actually takes to complete things is very illuminating.  I highly recommend it as a parent-led exercise for helping your ADD/ADHD teens get a better understanding of how to monitor their own personal realities.It\u2019s very easy to dismiss one day\u2019s leave-taking time as being anomalous, \u201cbecause I had to do this one thing, and I never have to do this one thing normally.\u201d  Once you have collected data for some ten days, the unmistakable trend is there.  Sure, that one day was anomalous because of having to do that one thing, but you know what?  Every day is anomalous because of something-or-another.  That\u2019s just the way our days run!\u201cHow long can it take to walk out the door?\u201dI like the \u201c50% Rule\u201d which means that projects often run either 50% over budget or 50% past deadline.  Using the 50% Rule means that I tack on another five minutes to allow for the mislaid keys and whatnot.  I should really try to leave 15 minutes before I actually need to be backing out of my parking spot.Boy, that 15 minutes sounds like a gross estimation.  But over the years, I have found that for me, it\u2019s just about right.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/02/29/time-to-go/", "title": "Time to go"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 January 2008", "body": "I\u2019m not dissing a great protest song.  I am however, getting really tired of the whole \u201covercoming one\u2019s disability\u201d clich\u00e9. For someone who does spend a lot of effort dealing with issues, that may sound odd. Why don\u2019t I want to \u201covercome\u201d my problems?To overcome one\u2019s disability does not just means to succeed in doing things in life that are personally difficult. It also carries the social and verbal subcontexts that one has not only succeeded, but also triumphed.  You\u2019ve beaten the disability (against all odds, of course) and won.  The sports / war metaphors get really heavy, and they are described as if the disability is separate from yourself. You\u2019re engaged in an ongoing battle, where everyone is keeping track of your score like fair-weather fans. But somehow it\u2019s a battle against your disabled-self. Being able to separate yourself from the disability, to hold its limitations at arm\u2019s length as it were, ennobles you because you have become closer to a \u201cnormal\u201d person. The unspoken social contract says that if you can remove the disability and redeem yourself as a normal person, then you will earn the rights, privileges and responsibilities of full personhood.Assuming of course, that you can keep it up. There are always higher hurdles to be leaped, and previous records that must be maintained. Slackers can\u2019t be winners; choosing to resort to non-standard methods that are more enabling and less stressful is just giving up.  Oh, you poor pitiable thing. (/sarcasm)But disabilities are not completely extrinsic things from our selves and our identities. Of course, no one wants to be known more for their disability than for their personality, and the other factors that make up who they are. There are many sorts of disabilities (especially the physical and health-related sorts) that many people would be perfectly glad to not have. But despite the problems that go with them, our various disabilities are still part of who we are; they shape our lives.But how much can we extricate disabilities and their effects from personhood?  I\u2019ve previously blogged about \u201cperson-first language\u201c. The philosophy behind this is that the person is more important than an impairment they have; that a person should not be known by a diagnosis. And indeed, \u201cperson-with\u201d makes better rational linguistic sense when the \u201cwith\u201d is a temporary (or preferably temporary) condition, as in \u201cperson with broken leg\u201d or \u201cperson with cancer\u201d. But person-first language can be prissy and awkward, and sometimes is simply benign earnestness at being polite \u2013 well-intended but treacly. Or, person-first can be Politically Correct at its most obnoxious, demonstrating a belief that the condition is \u201crecoverable\u201d and thus meaning something should be done about it. My autistic pal David jokes about how he \u201chas autism \u2014 I keep it in this little box\u201d. The point of course, being that rather than something that can be extracted or cured or a shell that can be peeled off, autism is rather something that permeates a number of things in a person\u2019s entire life. It colors the perspectives and the social world and communication and a number of other things, not unlike the ways that being a Deaf person makes one different.Despite the fact that disabilities are necessarily \u201cdisabling\u201d, they are not wholly problematic. There are a number of things that are more disabling by how the social world runs, and by the construction of the architectural environments. Out in the wild, my hyperacute hearing is hardly a problem, aside from rare thunderstorms. In the urban or industrial environment, such sensitivity can be exhausting and stressful. It\u2019s only when I need to be able to identify hundreds of different people in professional realms that the faceblindness is problematic; I could certainly cope with the limited number I encountered in my naturally constrained \u201cvillage\u201d when I worked from home and met with others under the controlled circumstances of arranged appointments. Give me an LCD monitor and incandescent or sunlight conditions, and I can do computer work for hours without complaint; it\u2019s the fluorescent lights and television-type monitors that give me headaches with all their damn flickering.There are a number of things that are really more about differences than handicaps. It\u2019s less about the fact that we \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d Do This or can\u2019t Do That. It\u2019s really about the fact that most people Do This or Do That to achieve particular goals, or to fill common human needs. But we don\u2019t all have to do things in those same ways to achieve those goals and needs. It\u2019s only if we place verbal speech as the \u201cnatural, necessary and desirable\u201d form of communication that hearing impairment or speech difficulties are disabling. Filling buildings with stairs and narrow passageways and heavy doors disable anyone who is not limber on two feet or doesn\u2019t have a lot of aerobic stamina. Big, mechanically noisy rooms full of fluorescent lights will fatigue or overwhelm a number of people with a variety of conditions. What is so damn virtuous about being able to tolerate working in crappy environments?\u201cBeating\u201d and \u201covercoming\u201d the disability is not the only means removing its negative influence from life. Rather, accepting disability and figuring out how to do things differently is how we best succeed.  It does not mean that we have resigned ourselves to \u201cgiving up\u201d.Like millions of others, I would not be the same person, and would not have the same abilities without my own various cognitive quirks. This leads us to something important about the discourse of disability:Requiring everyone to meet the same achievements, while continuously increasing what all those requirements must include, necessarily results in an ever-shrinking pool of citizens that meet the codified parameters for \u201cacceptable normalcy\u201d. Every time you slice off the outliers from yet another bell-curve, you end up settling for the common denominators of mediocrity.One of the prime social benefits to having, keeping, valuing and listening to those who are different is that such people will perforce have perspectives outside of the norm. Like travelers in our own culture, we can perceive things that are invisible in their normalcy and ubiquity to others. Cultural progress depends upon being able to define and evaluate social structures. We need the diversity of perspectives to keep dragging the human race forwards.We all have plenty of things to overcome, but I bet they aren\u2019t the things most people think some of us need to overcome!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/03/i-will-not-overcome/", "title": "I Will (not)\u00a0Overcome"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t5 January 2008 ", "body": "Just a couple of quickies here while I\u2019m busy preparing for some new classes.Firstly, the 77th edition of the Skeptic\u2019s Circle is up at WhiteCoat Underground, with a rather humorous post by PalMD, \u201cThe Overmedicalized Edition\u201c.  I love reading these circus posts because it\u2019s a good way to find great new blogs!Secondly, there\u2019s the \u201cDecember Pain-Blog Carnival\u201d at the How to Cope With Pain blog, also run by  a  physician blogger.And for the \u201cbread\u201d part of this post, here\u2019s a recipe that was a big hit last week, home-made waffles!  Yes, it\u2019s a bit more work than buying the frozen sort and throwing them into the toaster, but I guarantee that these tasted a helluva lot better than the frozen sort.  The guys couldn\u2019t even tell they were gluten-free, THAT\u2019S how good they were!  (All the frozen GF waffles I\u2019ve ever tried were as dry as Styrofoam.)Because I\u2019m an ADHD-forgetful sort of cook and clumsy and somewhat arthritic, this recipe comes with assorted tips, including some in case you\u2019re not used to making home-made waffles.  Read through directions for tips before cooking.WONDERFUL WAFFLES (GLUTEN-FREE)Special equipment:  waffle iron, mixer to whip egg whites, and if you have one, a blender and a towel. If you don\u2019t have a blender you can use the mixer, BUT beat the egg whites before mixing the other ingredients, so the beaters are clean and dry for the whites.\nInspect the mixer and blender to ensure nothing has fallen into the bowl or pitcher, that the bottom is securely screwed onto the blender pitcher, and that you have the lid to the blender.\nMake sure you have all the ingredients on hand before you start cracking:\n4 large eggs, separated\n1 \u00bd cups milk (360 ml)\n\u00bc cup oil (60 ml)\n1 1/2 cups GF flour mix (about 150 g, depending upon blend)\n5 teaspoons baking powder (25 ml)\n1 tablespoon sugar (15 ml)\n1/2 teaspoon salt (2 ml)\nFind the no-stick spray to use on the waffle-iron plates, even if it\u2019s supposed to be a \u201cno-stick\u201d surface.  If you don\u2019t have no-stick spray, pour a little vegetable oil into a drinking glass, and use a clean 1.5\u2033 (4 cm) wide natural bristle or heat-resistant barbecuing brush, as synthetic bristles may melt or scrunch up \u2014 YCIHIKT (You Can Imagine How I Know That).  I put the oil into a drinking glass so I can stand the brush upright in the glass, rather than having it constantly fall off the edge of the wee bowl of oil, thus making another mess for me to clean off the counter.\nClear some space on the kitchen counter, and plug in the waffle iron for it to heat up while you\u2019re doing the mixing.  The plates should be shut while it\u2019s heating, for safety and efficiency.\nCrack 4 eggs, separating them into yolks and whites.  The yolks go into the blender, and the whites go into the mixer bowl. Fresher eggs have \u201cbouncier\u201d yolks and separate more easily (just so you know; it\u2019s not like you\u2019re really going to have both fresher eggs and older eggs sitting around). Eggs will crack in half more easily and neatly if you knock them on a sharp, thin edge (table knife) than a wide, blunt edge (rimmed bowl). TIP:  if this is an iffy task for you, then crack each egg over a small (separate) bowl so you can fish out the bits of shell before adding to the other yolks and whites.  There are also egg-separater gizmos one can purchase \u2014 get one that you do not have to hold onto to use.\nUse the mixer to whip egg whites to soft peaks. I like my KitchenAid stand-mixer because it can do its own thing without me holding the mixer up in the air (vibration is hard on my joints). Yes, the beast cost more, but it has outlasted three hand-mixers, and it kneads dough, too!  It\u2019s worth buying something like this because it enables more cookery.\nUse blender to mix the milk, oil, egg yolks, and dry ingredients. If you put the wet ingredients into the blender before the dry ingredients, the batter is less likely to end lumpy.  I still have to stop and scrape powder off the top edges once during the blending, but that\u2019s pretty minor.  TIP:  to reduce the awful blender racket, put a folded towel between the blender bottom and the countertop; this reduces the cabinet-as-acoustic-chamber for the motor vibration.\n[Remove the mixer bowl from the stand.] Pour batter from the blender down the side of the mixer bowl so it slides underneath the egg whites.  Tilt the bowl to a comfortable angle, and use a rubber spatula or spoon to fold the ingredients together.  \u201cFold\u201d means to stir the ingredients together slowly and gently in vertical circles; the batter will have the consistency of almost-melted ice cream.\nSpray both plates of the waffle iron with no-stick spray just before pouring in the batter.  Re-spray before cooking each waffle. Even if your waffle iron is so miraculously non-stick that you didn\u2019t need to do this for traditional waffles, you will need to do it for GF waffles; YCIHIKT.\nThis is enough batter to make several waffles.  Pour in just enough batter to fill the bottom plate, and then wait several seconds for bubbles to start forming before closing down the top plate. This allows the batter to partially \u201cset\u201d so you won\u2019t have a bunch of goo oozing off the edges that will have to be scraped off later on; YCIHIKT.\nBake until the signal light shuts off (if your iron has one) or until the waffles are appropriately crispy.  TIP:  our family likes to warm up the syrup(s) so the waffles don\u2019t cool as fast while we\u2019re eating them.\nYou can also sprinkle some cinnamon into the waffle batter, which is nice if you are topping them with apple stuff.  Some people like to add a teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract; I keep forgetting to do this.  I\u2019ve also tried almond extract, which made the waffles taste like holiday cookies, but hubby prefered traditional waffles.TIP:  if you want to add blueberries to your batter, use either fresh ones or still-frozen berries \u2014 thawed blueberries will \u201cbleed\u201d and turn the batter a pale teal-green color; YCIHIKT.  They still taste good, but \u2026", "outgoing_links": ["http://whitecoatunderground.com/2008/01/02/skeptics-circle-77-the-overmedicalized-edition/", "http://www.howtocopewithpain.org/blog/184/pain-carnival-december/", "http://www.chefscatalog.com/catalog/product.aspx?scommand=search&search=KitchenAid%2b300%2bImmersion%2bBlender%2b%252489.99&item=21730&sourcecode=7W2PF2002"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/05/bread-and-circuses/", "title": "Bread and Circuses"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t6 January 2008 ", "body": "A four-year old autistic boy, Noah Breakiron, is in the news for being cured of lead poisoning.\u201cWe have a child here who is virtually indistinguishable from his peers and that\u2019s certainly not what he was a year or two years ago,\u201d added Pediatrician David Berger, MD.The article also says,Because the symptoms of autism and lead poisoning are so similar, Noah\u2019s parents say they will never know which one came first, autism or lead poisoning.Huh?  A child might possibly have both autism and lead poisoning, but they are not the same, nor are the symptoms similar.  Let\u2019s review a list of possible symptoms of autism, as described on the Mayo Clinic page (not all autistic children will exhibit all these traits):Social skills\nFails to respond to his or her name\nHas poor eye contact\nAppears not to hear you at times\nResists cuddling and holding\nAppears unaware of others\u2019 feelings\nSeems to prefer playing alone \u2014 retreats into his or her \u201cown world\u201d\nLanguage\nStarts talking later than other children\nLoses previously acquired ability to say words or sentences\nDoes not make eye contact when making requests\nSpeaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm \u2014 may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech\nCan\u2019t start a conversation or keep one going\nMay repeat words or phrases verbatim, but doesn\u2019t understand how to use them\nBehavior\nPerforms repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand-flapping\nDevelops specific routines or rituals\nBecomes disturbed at the slightest change in routines or rituals\nMoves constantly\nMay be fascinated by parts of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car\nMay be unusually sensitive to light, sound and touch\nGot that? Now let\u2019s look at the symptoms of lead poisoning (list also from Mayo Clinic):Signs and symptoms in children\nThe signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in children are nonspecific and may include:\nIrritability\nLoss of appetite\nWeight loss\nSluggishness\nAbdominal pain\nVomiting\nConstipation\nUnusual paleness (pallor) from anemia\nLearning difficulties\nLead poisoning sure doesn\u2019t look like autism to me; do those sound the same to you?  And although learning difficulties may be present in addition to autism, they are not part of the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for autism.  Furthermore, there is absolutely no good evidence that autism is caused by lead poisoning.Sure, there are a few toys with dangerous levels of lead out there.  And toddlers do chew on toys.  It\u2019s possible for a child to get lead poisoning from toys, although leaded alkyd house paints used before 1978 are more common sources.  The important thing to remember is that with any kind of poison, the danger is always in the dosage.  Everyone, everywhere is exposed to and even carries minute, trace amounts of metals simply because they are ubiquitous in the environment.  For example, I\u2019m sure I have microscopic amounts of lead in my body, simply because I was alive for decades when leaded gasoline was used (it was banned in the US in 1996).  But that doesn\u2019t mean I have lead poisoning. So how is lead toxicity determined?  By blood testing, as further described by the Mayo page:Doctors use a blood test to detect lead poisoning. A small blood sample is taken from a finger prick or from a vein. Lead levels in the blood are measured in micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL). An unsafe level is 10 mcg/dL or higher \u2014 a guideline set by the CDC.And the treatment?For more severe cases, your doctor may recommend treatment called chelation therapy in addition to removal from lead exposure. In chelation therapy, the medicine (chelating agent) you take binds with the lead so that it\u2019s excreted in your urine. Doctors may treat some Class III cases and many Class IV cases with the oral drug succimer (dimercaptosuccinic acid).\nDoctors treat lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dL of blood, which fall into Class IV or V, with a chemical called ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). EDTA is administered through injections in your veins (intravenously) and may be combined with the drug dimercaprol (BAL). Depending on your lead level, you may need more than one treatment. The therapy may not reverse damage that already has occurred in cases of severe lead intoxication.A view of Dr Berger\u2019s Web site for \u201cWholistic Pediatrics\u201d describes that the well-established standard of a blood test is not preferred,We are also concerned about heavy metal toxicity in our patients. Many people with chronic disorders have mercury, lead and other heavy metals accumulating in their body.\n\u2026\nWe have found that a chelation challenge test is the best way to identify the presence of toxic metals.Unfortunately, the chelation challenge (provoked test) is not accurate for determining levels of heavy metals. Chelation not only collects but concentrates metals, which are then excreted in the urine at higher levels than would normally be present.  The \u201cchelation challenge\u201d gives inflated lab results that do not accurately reflect the levels of heavy metals actually in the body, and thus is not a good diagnostic tool for heavy metal poisoning.  It seems odd that a pediatrician would choose to use this test.Care must be taken when giving treatments for heavy metal poisoning.   The standard treatment is to remove lead from the environment.  In cases of extremely high levels, intravenous chelation is used.  It does not, however, undo all the effects of lead poisoning.What kind of test was used to determine the lead levels in Noah?  The article does not say, nor does it mention the type of chelation used.  Did Noah have lead poisoning? Possibly.   Did the chelation treatments given to him get rid of his autism?  That\u2019s doubtful.  Without knowing more, it is impossible to comment upon the veracity of Noah\u2019s medical diagnoses or the appropriateness of subsequent treatment.  And that\u2019s not really the point of this post.The reason I mention this poorly-written story is that by chance or design, it links \u201clead poisoning\u201d with \u201cautism\u201d and suggests that treatments for the former will eliminate the latter.Like with any kind of therapy or treatment marketed for autism, we must remember that autism is a developmental disorder.  The development of the child is slower or erratic compared to age-peers. However, that is not the same thing as developmental stasis.  The continued acquisition of skills by autistic children are often attributed to the therapies given to them, rather than simply due to maturation. Autistic children who are not given the scores of dubious therapies also improve as they mature.Put simply:\nLead poisoning is detected through blood tests.\nLead poisoning can cause learning difficulties, but is not the same thing as autism.  The symptoms of lead poisoning and autism are very different.\n\u201cChelation challenge\u201d tests are not accurate for assessing levels of heavy metals.\nChelation can be used to remove heavy metals from the body, with intravenous EDTA reserved for high toxicity levels.  However, removing those from the body does not undo all of the effects of severe heavy-metal poisoning.\nChelation will not cure autism.\nAutistic children continue to grow and develop at their own rates, sometimes to the point that they do not require extra school services or therapies.  At that point, they are autistic children who do not require extra school services or therapies.  (Yeup, they\u2019re still autistic.)\nChelation as a treatment to \u201ccure\u201d autism has a sad history; currently Dr Roy Kerry is to stand trial for the death of a 5-year old autistic boy, Abubakar Tariq Nadama, who died in 2005 from a chelation session. In that case, mercury was the perceived toxin. But as the evidence for autism-as-mercury-poisoning repeatedly fails to hold up under scientific scrutiny, in scores of studies around the world. Mercury-based thimerosal (preservative) in vaccines was removed back in 2002, so mercury cannot easily be blamed for the ongoing cases of autistic toddlers (yet people still keep trying, especially those who are emotionally invested in the idea or financially invested in selling their products). We\u2019re already seeing the peddlers of bogus autism cures change their stories.Doubtless the focus will be switched to lead. Lead contamination in toys has been a hot news topic, just as has autism. It\u2019s easy for the two things to be conflated in the minds of concerned parents. If you search on the internet for treatments for lead poisoning, you will find an incredible number of things being sold, many of which are useless or dangerous. Although chelation is prescribed for severe cases of lead poisoning, it must be done with care; also in 2005, a 2-year old girl, Alyssa Renee Rodriguez died after she was given the wrong chelator. The numbers of news stories about lead poisoning simply create a ready market for the purveyors of unnecessary therapies and dubious cures.

Usually parents suspected something was \u201coff\u201d for quite a while, so having that validated is a bit of a relief.Of course, then once the suspicions are confirmed, there are often new kinds of feelings while adjusting to the new daily reality.  Frequently there are skirmishes with school districts or other bureaucracies.  Sometimes there\u2019s a bit of a grieving process for not having the perfect little darlings imagined during pregnancy.  Some families have issues with relatives not understanding, accepting or even \u201cbelieving in\u201d whatever problem with the child is dealing with.  Nasty episodes can erupt in extended families if one of the parents is accused of \u201ccausing\u201d the problem or bringing \u201cbad blood\u201d to the lineage.And of course, a number of parents eventually realise that the child\u2019s issues are echoes of some of their own issues.  Going through these things is very complex, sometimes stressful, and often enlightening.  Having a child with a disability does not automatically tear a family apart or make the siblings resentful; depending upon how the parents respond to the issues and to each other, it can strengthen the family members\u2019 ties to each other, and lead people to be more compassionate and less judgmental.So losing the label can mean that the family has (finally!) managed to get beyond a lot of those stresses.  Or so it seems.But what does it really mean to \u201close the label\u201d?  It can mean a number of things.\u201cLosing the label\u201d can mean that the child has matured and caught up with their age-peers.  One of our children lost this kind of label.  The formerly \u201cspeech-delayed\u201d child is now a highly verbal English major.  Developmental timetables are averages for populations, and there will always be some outliers to those averages.  It\u2019s good to remember that the skills of a toddler are not always indicators of adult achievement.\u201cLosing the label\u201d can mean that the child\u2019s problem has been \u201ccorrected\u201d or \u201cremediated\u201d.  The problem has been effectively overcome, to the point where it\u2019s no longer a significant problem.   The therapists, the school district that may have employed them, the family, and the child have all succeeded in the neatly-documented IEP goals.  Dyslexic children are one example of this category, and they grow up to be dyslexic adults, some of whom have few problems, and some of whom have to work a bit harder to read and write.This second category was the kind of label that I lost.  After a few years of speech therapy, I no longer had a speech impediment. My diction was sufficiently clear and standardised, per the goals of the speech and language therapist.  That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m \u201ccured\u201d, just that my speech is sufficiently normal.  In truth, people have always asked me where I am from because of my \u201caccent\u201d.  I have lived in a whopping two states; they asked me that in the state where I was born and spent my childhood, and they ask me that in the state where I now live, several miles from where my parents grew up.  But the problem is not cured, just remediated.  Some days I have difficulties enunciating, or intermittent stuttering.  At those times I tend to over-compensate, which sometimes yields a kind of \u201cReceived Pronunciation\u201d clarity that only adds to the accent-like quality.  And yet I do a lot of public speaking, and have also recorded books for the blind and print-impaired.\u201cLosing the label\u201d can also mean that the child has improved their skills or matured and no longer requires special services. People who learn to successfully cope with AD/HD and do not use medication would be an example of this category.  They are doing sufficiently well on their own, and because are not using medication, are no longer under a physician\u2019s care for the issue.  Some children do seem to grow out of their AD/HD.  Some just grow out of the more visible hyperactivity part, still retaining the \u201cexecutive functioning\u201d type issues.  Others don\u2019t grow out of the problems, but adapt and learn to compensate.  In such cases, \u201closing the label\u201d means they have slid out from under the umbrella of needing services.  The original condition may still be there, but it\u2019s not extremely problematic.In any of these categories, the now label-free child is sufficiently able to function like most of their peers.  They may even be (to use a horribly trite phrase) \u201cindistinguishable from their peers\u201d. I always find to be something of a humorous goal, as most people then spend years of effort trying to distinguish themselves from their peers.  Sometimes \u201cnormalcy\u201d is just mediocrity, and not nearly as exciting an achievement as we\u2019d once thought.  If you\u2019re going to be not-normal, then you might as well get some enjoyment and distinction from it!But you will also notice that in these categories, rarely is the original diagnostic condition completely cured, removed or gone.  The child or adult is now a successful dyslexic, AD/HD, autistic or whatever child or adult.  And yet, when a person is ill or stressed or overwhelmed, they may find that some of the condition re-asserts itself by creating little problems.  Losing the label doesn\u2019t always mean losing the condition, just losing the severity of the problems associated with the condition.  Losing the label doesn\u2019t mean that one doesn\u2019t have to try a bit harder, or manage things a little bit differently to succeed. It is something of a foolishness to expect that if someone has lost their label that everything is peachy-keen fine, smooth sailing from now on.Having lost the label means that one can also lose some of the support systems, and thus have lost some of the accommodations.   Having lost the label means that one can also lose some of the acceptance and understanding that doing everything things requires a bit more effort, and that when stressed, doing everyday things requires even more effort.They say you should label jars, not people.  That can be a helpful attitude, insofar as people are more than the sum of their descriptors.  But part of the reason we create labels is to describe things and to validate them, and without such labels others would frequently resort to other descriptors that are much less helpful.  Labels are not bad unto themselves; it\u2019s how we use them that matter.One of my coworkers made home-made jellies for Christmas.  She got the batches of different flavors mixed up, and apparently all the flavors were made with red juice. So everyone ended up with a jar labelled \u201cMystery Jelly\u201d. I think mine might be cranberry-apple jelly.  I\u2019m not sure, but it really doesn\u2019t matter.  The jelly is yummy, and the effort to do all that canning is much appreciated.Losing a label is often a highlight or milestone in a child\u2019s life.  But like my two jars of jam and jelly, whether or not there\u2019s a label, it is what\u2019s inside that counts.  The label may describe the contents, but the presence or absence of the label doesn\u2019t change what\u2019s inside.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/08/mystery-jam-and-other-achievements/", "title": "Mystery Jam and Other\u00a0Achievements"},

But there\u2019s something especially protective about the way parents are on behalf of their children (blood relations or not; there\u2019s more to parenting than DNA). Maddy just had one of Those Very Bad Days. This post is dedicated to her, and to everyone else who has been such situations.  You don\u2019t mess with mama bears.  Or any species of protective parents.  Even if we parents are stunned by the utter meanness, stupidity, lack of consideration, or bureaucratic idiocy, that doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have those flashes of utter savagery flick through our hearts.The difference being that usually we think before we speak.  Or, that we suffer badly from l\u2019Esprit de l\u2019escalier and the appropriately witty or remonstrative remark doesn\u2019t occur until the moment has long passed.  Or, all we can do is stand there and sputter.So here is Mildred the Mantid.  She was mother to more than I could count and an amazing hunter with ninja-like reflexes and deadly skills.  And before you make any comments, the whole story about female praying mantids biting the heads off their mates is somewhat apocryphal, and quite likely an artifact of being stuck in a small laboratory cage with nowhere to dash off.However, having watched Mildred dispatch a number of dinners, I can tell you that she would start her meals by first biting off the head of her victim, quickly and neatly dispatching whatever had wandered too close.  Brains are relatively fatty, so are good calories in a world of lean, crunchy critters.  Then she would leisurely rip off the wings, because there\u2019s no good eatin\u2019 in insect wings.  Ditto the ends of the legs.  And when finished, she would daintily begin to groom herself, much in the same manner that a cat does, brushing off her antennae, and nibbling down each of her six limbs from the thorax all the way down to the tarsi.  Then she would flick her wings back into a comfortable position, and compose herself to waiting there quietly, all over again.  Even when she was \u201cvery preggers\u201d, all large and ungainly from being egg-heavy (photo on right) Mildred was a predatory force to be reckoned with.Don\u2019t Mess With Mom.Don\u2019t go saying dumb-ass, idiotic, rude, uncaring, insensitive, presumptive, judgmental things about our children \u2026\u2026 because then we have the lovely image of the fabulously wicked female mantis, who after sitting perched in her pose of Absolutely Shocked bug-eyed stillness, will \u2014 in a flash \u2014 reach out with her raptorial forelegs to grab the  intruder and BITE THE HEAD OFF.There.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2008", "body": "A recent news item on the BBC describes current research into treatments for tinnitus.  For those of you without this unwelcome companion, tinnitus is a perceived but non-existent whistling, whining, buzzing, whooshing, squealing, or similar noise.  It may be intermittent or constant.  For many people it is downright annoying, but for some this perceptual problem is debilitating.There is no cure for tinnitus, despite a plethora of nonsense being hawked on the Web.  (Even treatments such as Auditory Integration Therapy don\u2019t actually hold up well under controlled studies.)   My tinnitus is a 14-17 kHz whine, like high-pitched piece of electronics or the whining of a particularly shrill radiator. Like other people with tinnitus, I had to learn to get habituated to the sound and try to ignore it, or will frequently mask the annoyance with fans or other forms of \u201cwhite noise\u201d, or with music.One of the hidden problems is that the noise can interfere with listening to real sounds, and that because no one else experiences it, they don\u2019t understand how utterly DAMN ANNOYING that constant, freaking unending whistle is!  Worse, just when you are most tired and stressed and need rest, it is the most troubling, because there are fewer distractions when you are trying to get to sleep.  The fact that the piercing noise is entirely subjective doesn\u2019t help either; no one else thinks that someone should be bothered by something imaginary.But although the sound is not real, the problems resulting from having a constant squeal either right next to, or inside your head, are quite real.But for Kate Cook, a busy working mother of two and presenter of the documentary Longing for Silence, the effects of the condition are debilitating.\nShe has had a high pitched whistle inside her head for 25 years and the impact on her life is huge. It never goes away and when she is tired or stressed the volume swells to unbearable levels.\n\u201cAfter a long day you have got this incredible noise inside you. A whistling, squeaking, almost physical sensation in your ears. That is when you feel really really lonely. And because it is a silent symptom to everyone around you, there is this hopeless feeling of being on my own with it,\u201d says Kate.The article describes a few trials with magnetic or electrical stimulation, or even a transient relief from lidocaine an\u00e6sthetic. As hopeful as these may be, I still want to see data from larger numbers of patients.  The testimonials of a few are even less useful here than they are for other kinds of treatment trials, because tinnitus is largely a subjective phenomenon, and thus the potential for placebo effects are greater.You might well ask, what does it matter if it\u2019s a placebo or real if the problem is gone?  Because rarely does any kind of treatment, be it pharmaceutical or surgical, come without associated risks.  I want to know that the likely results outweigh the likely risks.  Nothing in life is guaranteed, but because I don\u2019t believe in luck or magic,  I want information with a level of reliability.Not only that, any experimental treatment is expensive.  I could not afford it, and insurance companies sure aren\u2019t going to spiff for something unless they think it\u2019s worth it.  Unfortunately, I suspect that even a proven treatment for an \u201cimaginary\u201d problem would be dismissed by those hard-assed corporations with their eyes on the almight profit margin.   Tinnitus is not a medical emergency, it\u2019s just a bloody quality of life issue.Hell, after all, who needs peace and quiet?", "outgoing_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7175306.stm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/12/quieting-the-noisy-silence/", "title": "Quieting the Noisy\u00a0Silence"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t11 January 2008", "body": "I hate hearing about \u201cboth sides\u201d in news pieces. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to hear what people have to say; rather, my complaint is with the whole idea of \u201cpresenting both sides\u201d.I should note that I\u2019ve been a freelance writer for various local and national publications. So let me explain a bit about what the press does before I explain the reasons for my statement.Journalists and reporters are encouraged to find stories that fill a number of requirements; depending upon their editors\u2019 preferences, they may be looking for background to current events, introducing new discoveries, showing the personal sides to big events, exposing wrongdoing, educating the public, describing controversy, or providing inspiration. (I find it somewhat disheartening that the press is so slanted toward \u201cstories\u201d rather than \u201cnews\u201d. I think this reflects a lot of the emphasis on warm-fuzzy human interest elements at the expense of focusing on actual information. Maybe I\u2019m just a jaded scientist, but I like more details and verified facts in my news.) Of course, most news items stories combine several of these aspects.There are a variety of different kinds of journalists and reporters. Some journalists have large amounts of specialised background in particular fields that they use to understand, put into context, and interpret the news, which enables them to know how to sift through information, evaluate it and present it in a manner that is intelligible to people who aren\u2019t as well-versed.In contrast, many live media reporters tend to have more background in the presentation of the news, and frequently have to reduce an hour or more of recording down to just a few minutes of \u201csound bites\u201d arranged in the popular three part news-program format of: When we return, we\u2019ll tell you this amazing news; Here I am telling you this amazing news; and My co-anchor just told you this amazing news.Okay, you were probably aware of most of that. But to get those Controversies! and New Discoveries! and Inspiring Personal Stories! and Expose Wrongdoings! (excuse me, Expose Alleged Wrongdoings!), they frequently follow the dictate of getting quotes and information from both sides. Of course, sources who can deliver \u201csexy\u201d sound-bites are especially preferred by live media reporters.So what\u2019s wrong with presenting both sides? We want balanced reporting, right?Several things. Firstly, the formula for both sides lends the assumption that \u201cboth\u201d means \u201ctwo\u201d. In real life, there are always more than two sides to anything. Real life is not games of chess or Go with just two opponents. We all know this intellectually, but it gets lost in the usage of \u201cboth\u201d and in the constraints of describing controversies in a few minutes of broadcast time or a few inches of column space.Secondly, reporters (and an alarming number of journalists) will falsely ascribe equal weight to \u201cboth sides\u201d of a controversy. This is especially disastrous in science & health reporting. Most journalists and reporters don\u2019t have a sufficient background in the particular science field they are reporting upon to be able to evaluate the quality of the science research. That in itself is not the bad part \u2014 the bad part is that what they should be able to evaluate is the background or the integrity of the person who is sourcing the exciting new information to the press.Let\u2019s face it; scientific research is complex, and without an understanding of the context and the significance of the statistical analyses, new study findings can give the impression that scientists don\u2019t agree on anything. You can find someone (even a someone with a PhD) who disagrees with any given theory or finding. Look long enough, and you can find geologists who don\u2019t believe in plate tectonics, meteorologists who don\u2019t believe in global warming, biologists who don\u2019t believe in evolution, doctors who don\u2019t believe in the need for basic double-blind studies to verify treatments, probably even geographers who don\u2019t believe the earth is round. On the non-science end, I bet you could even find a few teachers who believe that some children can never learn anything.But that someone, even a person with a background in science or the medicine branch of science, believes something contrary to what the other 99% of their peers trust to be true, does not mean that such contrary views are of equal weight.Being contrary is not the same thing as being skeptical. Having a novel theory doesn\u2019t automatically mean that a person is a brave pioneer rallying against ossified conventional thinking. Real science is self-correcting, and plenty of former standard, conventional ideas have fallen by the wayside as further research upholds the new ideas. Plate tectonics was a novel idea once, and work by many people has supported the idea, and the idea has also helped explain other aspects of geology, so it is now the conventional paradigm. In real science, if a novel idea repeated fails to be supported by different methods of research, then it is dropped. In fact, researchers test the worth of their ideas by trying to disprove them, rather than by picking out random bits of facts that support them.Lastly, reporters will often go for the emotional angle, which quickly leads the trail out of reality-based news. \u201cTruthiness\u201d is favored over facts, belief is favored over evidence, testimonials are favored over data results, and of course, a few distraught citizens without any science or medical background are favored over thousands of doctors, hundreds of researchers, and entire libraries of impartially-tested evidence-based practice. \u201cIf it bleeds, it leads\u201d and if it doesn\u2019t actually bleed, then impassioned tears are a close second.Worse, anyone can claim that a set of facts go against their \u201cbelief systems\u201d and suddenly magic fairy dust gets sprinkled over the news story, so now any sort of nonsense is acceptable, no matter how foolish or dangerous it is. Unfortunately, things do not cease to exist simply because we decide that we don\u2019t like them, or that they don\u2019t fit the way we believe the world ought to be. Clapping hard enough does not make Tinkerbell real.What would you think of a news story about the latest Around-The-World race if the reporter felt obliged to give equal time to \u201cboth sides\u201d by interviewing someone who believed in a Flat Earth?What would you think of a news story about an earthquake if the reporter felt obliged to give equal time to \u201cboth sides\u201d by interviewing a seismologist and someone who claimed that earthquakes were due to the movement by the giant animal that holds up the world?What would you think of a news story about children with autism if the reporter felt obliged to give equal time to \u201cboth sides\u201d by interviewing a geneticist and a parent who believes in a world-wide conspiracy by numbers of governments and pharmaceutical companies who want to poison children\u2019s brains?[edited to correct typographical error]", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/11/both-sides-now/", "title": "Both Sides Now"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 January 2008", "body": "On my page about Auditory Processing Disorder, someone had enquired if using ALDs (Assistive Listening Devices) in the classroom would be helpful.  Her daughter, like many students, did not want to be singled out by using them and perceived by her peers as being \u201cweird\u201d.  I thought I would expand upon the response to include more information.  Please note that these suggestions are slated more toward APD and general educational design suggestions, rather than toward ALD equipment for students with severe hearing loss.Although ALDs do work to an extent, they may not be the best choice for some situations.  We should also note that although schools focus on the deficiencies of the student\u2019s hearing, listening comprehension, or attention, quite frequently some of the deficiencies are really in the design of the school classrooms. These make it more difficult for students with APD, ADHD, or hyperacussis, and they also make it more tiring for the instructors who must spend all day trying to talk over noisy environments, and for the other students.  (More on this aspect in the latter part of this post.)One type of ALD is an FM or infrared system that involves a microphone (for the teacher) and receiver headphones (for the student).  Naturally this is highly visible, so not everyone wants to be singled out in this manner.The microphone must be positioned correctly, so the speaker\u2019s voice does not fade in and out of range (you may have experienced this yourself when sitting in presentations or conferences).  Of course, both pieces of the equipment needs to have fresh batteries and be in good repair, or it\u2019s useless.Sometimes microphones with speakers are recommended for teachers so they can broadcast better to the students in the back of the room.  Usually the speakers are not high quality, and such systems just add to the amount of noise, rather than improving the clarity of communication!Because the microphone is used by the primary speaker, it presents problems if anyone else in the classroom speaks. Either the mike is passed around when there are group discussions or questions, or the listener does not get comments and queries by the other students in the room.  The latter not only removes a layer of information, but can also lead to reduce social inclusiveness because the person with the headphones loses the small commentaries that may not be part of the formal instruction, but are part of the socialisation and informal culture of the classroom.  Even if the microphone does get passed around, the other students\u2019 lack of familiarity with holding the mike where it can pick up their voices and the considerable junk-noise of passing the microphone do not improve the listening experience.I will say that there are special situations when an ALD such as this would be especially good, such as when the teacher is doing instruction during a bus ride, in noisy places like zoos, factory tours, science museums and so on.  It should also be made clear (and probably reminded) to the teacher that PA announcements are often unintelligible to people with APD (or hearing loss) \u2014 this means that messages will need to be passed on, and the teacher should not rely on the student being able to follow those announcements, except where they are simply following the herd of students. (I\u2019ve had my family page me at airports and other places, and I not only couldn\u2019t understand the page, I couldn\u2019t even tell that I was the one being paged!)There are alternatives to using an ALD, which should be considered and probably tried before deciding to use the ALD.Students with APD should get \u201cpreferential seating\u201d, which is often used for ADHD students as well.  This means sitting near the teacher and/or instruction board or instruction area.  The point is to reduce the amount of space and distractions between the student and the source of information.  This is especially helpful if the student does some lip-reading (not everyone with APD is even aware they do this).The teacher should be careful to not address the students when writing on the board.  (Unfortunately, most teachers start out very conscientious, and then after a few days revert back to their old habits.) The student will have to get in the habit of asking, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d or \u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d or may have to advocate after the fact.  Meaning, when everyone has started on the work, raising her hand, and then when the teacher comes by to talk with her, point out that the teacher was talking to the board (again) and she couldn\u2019t understand everything.  She could also have a special hand-signal to make when the teacher turns back around from the board, to alert the teacher of the missed communication.Have the instructor turn on captions to broadcast media \u2014 these are good for the ESL students, and they help the other students catch the terms and spelling of details they need from the program. It\u2019s best for the teacher to not point out that they are turning on the captions for your daughter specifically \u2014 just turn them on, and if anyone asks, simply explain that they are on so everyone can more easily understand the dialog. That\u2019s the truth; there\u2019s no one need for one person to be singled out.As I referred to earlier, the classroom design can aggravate APD and ADHD difficulties.  Not all of the problem should be set at the feet of the student!\u201cNoise\u201d is composed of a number of factors.  Most people just think of the volume (measured in decibels).  But there is also the complexity factor \u2014 it\u2019s hard to focus on one sound source when there are other sound sources going on at the same time.  There is also the noise-to-signal-ratio factor where clarity is important, and clarity can be lost from not just background noise, but also echoes, unclear speech, and poor transmission equipment (fuzzy speakers, tinny receivers and so on).ALDs are often recommended because the student (or employee) is having trouble hearing or understanding because the room is atmospherically noisy.  This is in large part due to bad environmental design \u2014 too many hard surfaces, noisy HVAC (air conditioners, radiators, fans), various kinds of equipment, lots of voices at once and so on.  Please note that \u201cnoisy equipment\u201d does not mean it has to be loud by OSHA standards \u2014 students who are distractible and/or have APD problems and/or hyperacussis will find the noise levels in an average classroom to be more of a problem than many of their peers. (This also applies to many students with autism.)Things like area rugs, draperies and acoustic tiles (or new, much more effective acoustic tiles) will help muffle a lot of the echo and reverberation.  Turning off equipment when it\u2019s not being used helps more than people realise, and is also important to save energy.  If there are times when multiple instruction is going on (for example, an aide helping a few students) then setting up an area with a couple of those portable, upholstered cubicle-type dividers will help not only your student, but also be more effective for the aide and the other students. It\u2019s always easier to \u201csell\u201d an idea when the benefits to numbers of people are described.I don\u2019t believe that students with ADHD or APD should not even be in settings with the \u201copen classroom\u201d design that was in vogue some decades ago, as having several different classes and multiple instructions and larger numbers of students milling around is just too much to deal with effectively. Schools that have tried to retrofit open classroom areas into individual classrooms often end up with inadequate materials (due to budgetary issues).  Unfortunately, merely pulling a folding divider wall between two rooms does not adequately damp all the noise that seeps through.  A suspended (common) ceiling that is sometimes added along with the partitions does not effectively mute sound, but rather serves to transmit the sounds from one room to the next.Likewise, rows of file cabinets are also poor excuses for walls between \u201crooms\u201d in libraries or other resource rooms.  It\u2019s hard for adults to work in such environments, so I don\u2019t know why we expect that children should find it easy. Furthermore, pretending that experiencing classes in such poorly-divided greatrooms is good practice for working in \u201ccubicle farms\u201d is nothing more than piss-poor rationalisation, what Alfie Kohn refers to as \u201cgetting hit on the head lessons\u201d (justifying bad educational practices as preparation for more of the same).Sadly, there are a great many districts that are suffering from insufficient classroom space.  Teachers and students end up in a variety of locations that were never meant to be classrooms, and have had only minimal modifications, usually hanging up a whiteboard and cramming in some desks and chairs.  In addition to features like thin, hollow \u201ctemporary\u201d walls that have been there for years, odd room shapes or cramped conditions (including putting the board on a free wall rather than one that works with the traffic flow or desk orientation), and ventilation quirks we often find that these ad hoc classrooms are poorly placed with respect to other functions of the school.Usually school architects try to create noise-buffer zones between the classrooms and the other functional areas of the school, such as the gymnasium, lunch room, kitchen, power plant, or specialty classrooms such as shop (wood/metal/engine working) or band instruction.   These desperation classrooms are stuck in all sorts of bad locations, even in part of the custodian\u2019s storage area. I remember having my Government class in a tiny room set in the back hallway by the gymnasium (it was probably once the coaches\u2019 office), and the students reached the room by virtue of going through the boys\u2019 or girls\u2019 locker room.  We spent the entire time assaulted by the locker room and pool chlorine smells, and the instructor had to talk over the noise from the adjoining gymnasium and natatorium.Many older school buildings were designed in eras when passive lighting and ventilation were more commonplace.  These frequently have high ceilings hung with banks of fluorescent lights and tall windows that are usually shaded by metal blinds.  Those high ceilings and the hard surfaces combine to accentuate the noise echo and reverberation, and the banks of fluorescent lights are often noisy in their own regard. Because the fans are beneath the windows, the air flow will create ripples and rattles in the blinds, even when teachers try to pin down the bottoms of the blinds with stacks of extra textbooks.  These are the sorts of rooms where general amplification speakers are especially un-helpful.In summary, Assistive Listening Devices are helpful for reducing some of the noise-to-signal ratio.\u00a0 However, they cannot substitute for effective interpersonal communication skills, and can only mediate some kinds of environmental noise problems.\u00a0 They are not an easy fix to the problems faced by a student with APD.\u00a0 As I have mentioned before, our various assistive devices do not remove our cure our problems, but rather, are part of the system of coping methods.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.alfiekohn.org/teaching/edweek/bguti.htm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/13/alds-in-the-classroom/", "title": "ALDs in the\u00a0Classroom"},

These two-second shocks are described as feeling like a bee sting, and people to whom this is prescribed must wear the equipment through their waking hours, so such stings to their torso or limbs are unavoidable.  According to a recent article in Mother Jones:Of the 234 current residents, about half are wired to receive shocks, including some as young as nine or ten. Nearly 60 percent come from New York, a quarter from Massachusetts, the rest from six other states and Washington, D.C. The Rotenberg Center, which has 900 employees and annual revenues exceeding $56 million, charges $220,000 a year for each student. States and school districts pick up the tab.\nThe Rotenberg Center is the only facility in the country that disciplines students by shocking them, a form of punishment not inflicted on serial killers or child molesters or any of the 2.2 million inmates now incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons.  Over its 36-year history, six children have died in its care, prompting numerous lawsuits and government investigations.JRC  is called a \u201cspecial needs school\u201d because the student-age residents sit at computers every day to do instructional programs.  Many of the residents have a variety of psychiatric or learning difficulties, including autism, cognitive disabilities, ADHD, bipolar, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia or other problems.  No psychiatric medications are allowed, and counselling is minimal; whatever the sources of the resident\u2019s problems, the treatment is the same.The problem inherent in such a single-solution scheme is that it does not address the causes of the resident\u2019s problems, just the inappropriate behavior that results from them.  It\u2019s no small wonder that even when people leave, the root problems are not solved, and they continue to have difficulties.  Therapeutic approaches need to be individualised \u2014 what works for a child with depression and OCD is going to be different than what works for a student with Asperger\u2019s and ADHD.  Treatments cannot be designed by diagnostic labels (which are generally descriptive rather than prescriptive) but more by what their individual problems are, and how those problems developed.The Rotenberg Center does not sell something cutting edge; pain aversives were first trialled in the 1960\u2019s, but have not been used by anyone else, and has been considered to be not within \u201cbest practice\u201d for years.  Even by the 1980\u2019s, Dr Skinner had an about-face on the use of aversives, and declared that they are not beneficial; although they may temporarily stop a problem behavior, they are not effective in the long term, and the recipient responds by escaping, attacking back, or sinking into the apathy of learned helplessness.Centers like JRC that bill themselves as solutions for intractable children play upon parents\u2019 fears, and describe problems in exaggerated terms.  The premise \u2014 and promise \u2014 is based upon a giant false dilemma, that there are no other options, it\u2019s the place of last resort, and it\u2019s use their methods or else the child will simply go wild.  Parents who have not previously found an effective solution are willing to hand their children over because they are desperate.JRC is unique because they have cornered the market on a service that no one else wants to sell.  That does not make it a good or a necessary thing.  I find the whole concept utterly horrifying.Other posts on JRC:A Very Painful Problem  Certainly, zapping someone with unavoidable, painful electrical stings on bare skin will stop them in their tracks. It stops the self-injury by that default. Punishment will stop people from doing something, at least while the threat of punishment still exists.  But it doesn\u2019t help us figure out why the person was hurting themself. It doesn\u2019t teach them how to identify when they are stressed, and to learn different, effective, safe ways of dealing with those stresses. There are students who have been incarcerated at the Judge Rotenberg Center for years past their legal majority. That system does not provide them much in the way of tools to live successfully outside of the institutional environment. \u2026If hurting yourself is bad, and hurting others is bad, how is it then okay to use intensely painful aversives on someone? We don\u2019t even use things like this in prisons. Why is it deemed \u201cokay\u201d by school districts and courts for children with learning disabilities and emotional problems to be subjected to this kind of treatment? People who injure themselves have a very painful set of problems. But we as a society have an even greater problem. Allowing such treatment to happen and continue is unconscionable.I Didn\u2019t Ask for That  Situations like these really aren\u2019t choices; given more than one option, they are dilemmas or predicaments between bad option and worse option or intolerable option. Some \u201coption\u201d indeed.  Sometimes the situation is couched in the language of \u201cchoice\u201d, but has nothing to do with the person choosing for their self.The Crime of Punishment   Aversives in the form or corporal punishment (such as the electroshock apparatus used at JRC) teach both the giver and the recipient that aggression and inflicting pain are acceptable and appropriate ways of responding to people when they don\u2019t do what someone else wants them to do. Unfortunately, lots of people have learned this \u201clesson\u201d all too well \u2026 Not only does punishment as behaviour modification set up and maintain coercive power systems, but it also distances teachers and others from their students, and puts them into antagonistic roles, rather than as partners in education (contrary to what many school districts\u2019 mission statements assert).Making Sense of Rules   Being given absolute rules circumvents the learning process, and later when they need to adapt to novel situations, leaves the learner in the lurch, stranded without the knowledge of how to devise new strategies. They only have a limited number of tools in their social toolbox, and little knowledge of how to build new kinds of tools. If we go telling children what to do for their entire lives, then we shouldn\u2019t wonder that they become young adults without the ability to think for themselves and to be responsible without someone monitoring their actions.Being Unruly    People who are heavily invested in punishment and reward systems, invested ego-wise, security-wise, and/or financially-wise (such as the JRC), will try to assert that not using the punishment and rewards to control behaviour will result in gross misbehaviour and chaos.  This is a false dilemma; there are other ways of teaching our children.", "outgoing_links": ["http://uppitydisability.blogspot.com/2008/01/1-14-07-blogging-against-aversives.html", "http://uppitydisability.blogspot.com/2008/01/1-14-07-blogging-against-aversives.html", "http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/school_of_shock.html", "http://www.motherjones.com/cgi-bin/print_article.pl?url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/experts_on_matthew_israels_methods.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/false-dilemmas-how-to-sell-pain/", "title": "False Dilemmas: How to Sell\u00a0Pain"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t16 January 2008", "body": "\u201cLet me get this straight \u2014 the student is not doing well in class.  They\u2019re not able to learn the material from the way it\u2019s taught.  So your solution is to give them remedial learning lessons, to try teaching them how to learn the \u2018right\u2019 way.  All this remedial learning process is getting the student and the parents and the teachers frustrated, and the student is getting further and further behind their peers academically.\u201dI keep hearing about how some teachers or therapists or ABA workers feel that they have to teach their autistic (or other) clients \u201chow to learn\u201d before they can teach them content.  This is absurd!  Every child knows how to learn, and automatically learns.  Even incredibly simple organisms like wasps can learn without being taught \u201chow to learn\u201d.What these people are really meaning is that their clients and students do not learn the \u201cright\u201d way, meaning the way that is expected of the student in narrowly-defined settings.  They don\u2019t learn or demonstrate their learning the same way as \u201call the other children\u201d.\u201cBut the child doesn\u2019t even know how to sit at the work table!\u201dI rather doubt that the child does not know how to sit at a table.  Rather, the issue is that the child does not understand the instruction (or the need for following it), or cannot remain at the table for very long.  Being forced to sit at the work table may even have acquired a negative connotation that the child is trying to avoid.So for example, how does such a problem get resolved in a secondary school setting? I have several students who are dyspraxic and have ADHD (among other things).  When I do lessons with each one, I scribe for him.  The student is frequently learning over the edge of my desk, or standing and rocking from foot to foot, or pacing back and forth.  It\u2019s not that these teens don\u2019t know \u201chow\u201d to sit at a desk, or that they don\u2019t know \u201chow\u201d to write.  Rather, making them hand-write their responses to essay questions while sitting still at a desk interferes with the actual learning of information and the subsequent demonstration of that learning.  They get too fidgety to focus, and get bogged down in the frustration of forming letters to the detriment of recalling information and formulating responses.Do students need to know basic classroom expectations, such as paying attention to instruction, not interrupting others when they are working, being respectful, and being responsible for completing and turning in assignments?  Yes indeedy!  But you will notice that I did not include \u201cstaying seated in chair\u201d in that list.  The reason that teachers have traditionally required students to stay seated quietly in their seats is to help ensure that they are working responsibly.  But we need to remember that the ultimate goal is \u201cworking responsibly\u201d rather than \u201cstaying in chair\u201d.This concept of \u201cremedial learning\u201d is based upon the same kind of rationale as:\nmaking lefties learn right-handed penmanship\nmaking the deaf learn to lip-read and speak instead of using sign language\nmaking dyspraxic students learn to work with increasingly smaller and fiddlier lab equipment or manipulatives\nmaking students with auditory processing problems learn to be better listeners by using recorded instruction (often scratchy old tapes)\nThere\u2019s a saying, \u201cIf you do what you\u2019ve always done, you\u2019ll always get what you always got.\u201d   And Albert Einstein said, \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\u201d.Do people realise that if a student doesn\u2019t learn well using a particular process that what they need is not \u201cremedial learning lessons\u201d but rather \u2014 a different teaching process?   Universal Design for Learning is not a new concept; educators have long since realised that if you offer instruction using several different methods from the start, that you do not have to go back and retrofit the instruction for a particular student\u2019s learning needs.  Quite simply, \u201call\u201d the other children don\u2019t learn the same way.  Our particular students of focus are just more extreme examples of different abilities and learning styles.So why do we keep insisting that when students have problems learning by a particular method, what they need is to learn how to learn the \u201cright way\u201d? And no, I\u2019m not talking about learning effective study methods; I\u2019m talking about the fallacy of endlessly trying to improve the student\u2019s \u201cweak\u201d areas.  Weak areas are supposed to be about knowledge and skill levels that need more practice or clarification to fully acquire and integrate the knowledge.  \u201cWeak areas\u201d should not be when the student\u2019s has particular sensory, processing, or motor problems that create differences in the way the student works best.Although we want our children to be able to improve upon these kinds of difficulties, tying those to their social acceptance or their learning progress is wrong.  If the goal of education is to acquire knowledge and skills, then we want to use the media and processes that work most easily for the student.  Not only does the student learn more easily and quickly, but the reduced stress also enables them to retain information better, enjoy the content, and be more likely to pursue further education in the subjects.  Reducing learning stresses also makes the non-academic aspects of the school experience better.In addition to disengaging the process of remediating difficulties from primary instruction, we also need to remember that not all differences are automatically difficulties.  Being deaf or left-handed is only disabling when instruction is primarily oral or the equipment is exclusively designed for right-handed people.No one needs to be taught \u201chow to learn\u201d.  Teaching however, is another matter.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cast.org/research/udl/index.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/16/remedial-learning-lessons/", "title": "Remedial Learning Lessons"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t17 January 2008", "body": "And now for something light, because it\u2019s been heavy blogging lately, and there\u2019s more around the corner.Once Upon A TIme I used to be a newspaper proofreader.  And once a proofreader, always a pain in the ass, because I pay attention to the wording of the things I read (and hear).  Here are some things that drive me abso-bloomin-lutely-nutz, from the realms of horticulture, entomology, and the exciting intersection, er, catastrophic collision of science and marketing. Disclaimer: these are all my own unbiased opinions.Some years ago, a student came in and said that she wanted a \u201ccarefree garden\u201d, one that bloomed all the time and required virtually no care.  I blinked a few times in disbelief and could only reply, \u201cPlastic?\u201dThere\u2019s always good, clean dirt. Although a person can have fumigated soil or \u201csterile\u201d seedling media (that\u2019s nursery-sterile, not surgically sterile, meaning free of pests and pathogens), but dirt by definition is what gets tracked across the kitchen floor, lodged under your fingernails, or ground into the knees of your pants.  \u201cDetoxifying mud bath\u201d should join that for all-around absurdity.Then there\u2019s trying to explain to my students that there are no such things as \u201cnatural gardens\u201d.  No matter what style the garden is, if it is a garden, it is inherently un-natural.  Gardeners work tirelessly against the entropy of succession by ruderals (profligate weeds) and woody plants.  Gardeners interfere with the sex lives of their plants, deadheading them to promote more fresh flowers, and prevent re-seeding.  Even gardeners who prefer to limit their horticultural impulses to locally native plants still don\u2019t have \u201cnatural gardens\u201d.  They set out plants in artificial arrangements, they do things like installing 90% forbs and 10% grasses and call the results \u201cprairies\u201d (which are really grasslands with flowers), and of course, they still prevent succession by ruderals and woody plants.Ditto \u201csafe pesticides\u201d. Pesticides are poisons \u2014 they are designed to kill things. Granted, a few are not toxic to humans, and a few are behavioural (they make the insects want to quit eating, or leave the plant, in which case they are really repellants, rather than insecticides), but even so \u2026  \u201cSafe pesticides\u201d is just wishful thinking.  Let\u2019s add \u201cnon-toxic insecticide\u201d to that.\u201cChemical free\u201d is another favourite.  \u201cI want my children to be safe!  I only feed them chemical-free, natural food.\u201d (note *) A chemical is a substance with its composition defined in a chemical manner, meaning the proportions of the elements.  Water is a chemical, because each molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom bonded together.  The only \u201cchemical-free\u201d thing is a perfect vacuum.  How about a snack with \u201call natural artificial flavoring\u201d.  WTF?No, you cannot have the \u201cbigger half\u201d.  Parenting tip:  have one child cut the highly desired goody in half, and the other child gets to choose first.  You\u2019ve never seen such precision slicing!  Plus, you no longer have to slice and hand out the halves and then deal with the sibling fallout. What, you have more than two children?  How often do three or more people all want the same thing anyway?  (Must be really easy to order pizza at your house, if they do!)  Maybe they would like some \u201cmini pound cakes\u201d.  Pound cake is made with a pound of butter, a pound of flour, a pound of sugar, and a pound of eggs, hence the name. A pound cake is not meant to be cupcake (fairy cake) size, not even a white chocolate flavored one.Butterflies are insects.  You can\u2019t say you \u201chate insects but like butterflies\u201d.  Get over this entomophobia.  While we\u2019re at it, there are too, male ladybugs (also known as ladybird beetles). Coccinellids have sex like other insects. No, those chartreuse spotted beetles on your cucumbers are not \u201cgood bugs\u201d, they are pest spotted cucumber beetles.I used to think that \u201cringing silence\u201d was an oxymoron until I got tinnitus.  Now all of my environmental silences are accompanied by subjective ringing noise.\u201cMiraculous scientific discovery\u201d  Man, I hate marketing nonsense like this.  No.  No \u201cmiracles\u201d.  Things may be amazing, timely, unexpected or even fortunate, but I don\u2019t believe in \u201cluck\u201d or \u201cmiracles\u201d.  Please don\u2019t go calling inventions (new things that people have created) \u201cdiscoveries\u201d; discoveries are when people find out about something that already exists.Creation science. Needs no explanation.  Ditto homeopathic medicine.And just for fun, here\u2019s my favourite redundancy:  fried chow mein noodles   Chow mein means fried noodle, so saying fried chow mein noodles is like saying, \u201cfried fried noodle noodle\u201d.(What, now you have \u201cfried-fried-noodle-noodle\u201d stuck in your head?  You\u2019re welcome; always glad to share.  What\u2019s a little echolalia between friends?)* I cannot remember who, but another blogger also recently mentioned this same bit of nonsense.

(Thanks to some of my literate readers who answered with replies giving some of these exact same redundant pleonasms!)What a busy day it has been!  Two long tutoring sessions followed by company for dinner; it\u2019s all like such an imaginary dream.Because of her past history with forgetting to completely finish assignments, one of my students with ADD & ADHD and I cooperated together to determine what her normal everyday homework study schedule would be.  This took a while, as she kept having sudden impulses to do things like verify the actual true ISBN number of the fiction book she was writing her essay report on. (At this point, I reminded her to back up everything (manuscript documents, photograph pictures  and et cetera) from the classroom PC computers onto CD disks.) She\u2019s also rather loquaciously verbose, and kept getting sidetracked by telling stories about her other classes.  As part of her Bachelor\u2019s degree, she needs a computer course, and she described with specific details how the instructor began to start with the basic fundamentals of BASIC code, which was a relief to her and her fellow colleagues, as the more advanced  fundamentals would have been excessively too much.Another of my students is an Asperger\u2019s autistic who has a persistent obsession with predicting future changes to his  regular routine. The resulting effect of all this is that he needs a safe sanctuary where he can go to relax and de-stress when there is an unexpected emergency. He is also concerned about the lab work and field trips related to his zoology class, such as having an unintentional accident with the sharp point of the scalpel blade, causing him to hemorrhage blood until he was killed dead. Even the zoo animals worry him; an asp snake might bite him with its fanged teeth full of poisonous venom, or he might possibly even fall down into the lagoon pond and drown to death.  We had a long discussion about the probabilities of dire things actually happening, and what he could do to deal with such events.After that it was time to try out my new money card at the student center.  I read the instructions on the LCD display, and tapped my PIN number into the ATM machine and reached into the empty hole where the money should be, but apparently I had erred and had to enter the numbers over again.  (I really need some rest and sleep.) Because the invited guests would be arriving immanently soon, I stopped by the giant supermarket to get some food & groceries, including ingredients for the shrimp scampi with spaghetti pasta.Once I returned back home, it was time to get the appetizer ready, so after digging around the back of the cabinet, I found  the voltage converter adapter, plugged my slow-cooker into the the AC current, and  combined together the salsa sauce with some queso cheese, melting them together until everything was boiling hot.  I was even able to add some fresh chives to the dinner; given the necessary essentials of fertilizer nutrients, my seedling plants in the hydroponic water-garden are growing larger every day.  I\u2019m also really excited about the innovative new cultivars I\u2019m going to be trial testing in my outside yard.The good news is that while I was cooking dinner, I heard on CNN news another news story about vaccination shots. The knowledgeable experts doubted what the live witness had to report because of the missing gaps in the testimony. The end result of today\u2019s testimony was that the sum total of all this data information should prove beyond doubt that the medication drugs were not  the causal reason for the successful achievement of academic schoolwork by the undergraduate students.

The state\u2019s capital city is not only home to the infamous Fred Phelps and his Westboro Baptist Church, and has recently been the battleground for Intelligent Design vs Evolution counter-counter-legislation by the school board (currently with the majority ruling pro-science),  but now the capitol is host to the paranoid propaganda by the CCHR.  CCHR is the Citizens Commision on Human Rights, which despite the generic name is really just a front for Scientology. Their exhibit is titled, \u201cPsychiatry: An Industry of Death\u201d (well, no hidden biases there). Correspondent for the Kansas City Star newspaper, David Klepper, writes that the \u201cthe Capitol sees its share of traveling displays and wandering weirdness\u201d.  He notes that any group that can pay the fee is allowed to put up a display as long as it is not obscene, and describes the content thusly:Among the claims: up to 25 percent of psychiatrists rape their patients; overmedication kills thousands and enslaves many more; and 10,000 people die from electroshock therapy every year.Essentially, the multimedia show also asserts that psychiatry is to blame for (among other things): Hitler and the Holocaust, the 9/11 terrorist acts, shootings at schools, and are planning world domination. Wow.  Granted, there are justifiable complaints about historical abuses and current malpractice in psychiatry, but it is an argumentum ad absurdum \u2014 aw heck, an outright Reductio ad Hitlerum \u2014 to declare that anything and everything ever associated with psychiatry is the ultimate in evil.  (Even the psychiatric-survivor advocacy group MindFreedom International wants nothing to do with the CCHR.)Like other denialists, Scientologists make bizarre assertions, such as things like ADHD or various illnesses and disorders due to chemical imbalances and other causes simply don\u2019t exist.  But aside from the whole mass of denial and absolutism, plus the usual dread trinity of fear, hate and loathing that are typical of cults and cult-like organisations, there\u2019s an interesting aside to such claims.  (That\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d in the sense of horrified fascination.)What mystifies me about so many different kinds of groups, is the false dichotomy between brain and body.  What is so special about this spectacular mass of neurons?  How is it that neurons in the skull  are not considered to be just a part of an organ system, just as neurons in the torso or limbs generally are?The brain is what you use for your sensory processing, perception, attention, cognition and emotions*, as well as a variety of other \u201chousekeeping\u201d functions related to running a body, such as coordinating the actions and feedback of moving about, or maintaining temperature homeostasis.  The latter is the \u201cboring\u201d stuff that most of us don\u2019t care about except when it quits working right.  But even though the former list of mental functioning seems more like a \u201cblack box\u201d of uncertainty, it is neither magical nor mystical.  Consciousness and all the other functions are fascinating, complex, and only partially understood, but in the end the brain still works by the basic rules of genetics and biochemistry.So how can people claim that diseases caused by chemical imbalances and other causes in one part of the body are real, but diseases or syndromes caused by chemical imbalances and other causes in another part of the body are not real?At the end of Klepper\u2019s article is the quote,Psychiatrists shrug at the allegations, saying Scientology has a long history of bizarre claims about the profession.\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t really able to support their position with any scientific data, which they tend to ignore,\u201d said Michael Burke, president of the Kansas Psychiatric Society. \u201cThe public seems to be able to look right past the Scientology hoopla.\u201dWell, we can sure hope so.There is no shortage of medical quackery out there that claims to treat or cure most anything (or everything), but even those who are more inclined to stick to evidence-based medicine for most somatic issues will veer off into the realms of pseudoscience and utter bullshit when treading into the territory of the psyche.  By virtue of being the organ where thinking (supposedly) occurs, the brain magically becomes a 3-pound exemption to medical science.  The brain gets disembodied from biology.I guess we just have to chalk it all up to cognitive biases. Or maybe we should call them cognition biases.* For all you students out there, those five functions spell out the mnemonic SPACE.  I guess if one of those goes wrong, then you\u2019re a space-case.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t21 January 2008 ", "body": "Here in the States, today is Martin Luther King Jr Day, a \u201cbank holiday\u201d honoring the civil rights leader.  This means that as a school employee, I get the day off, which in turn means that I have the opportunity to not only contemplate civil rights, but also run errands to places I can\u2019t go because my work hours are the same as their business hours.  The exceptions of course are my bank where I need to visit my safe box, and a couple of colleges where I need to visit with people about getting teaching certification.  Holy conundrums, Batman!Anyway, reading through the news brought several things to my attention, and helped clarify some of my own dream for humanity, especially with regards to both diversity in academia and the rest of the work world, the academic responsibility for preparing our students, and the social and political valuation of real science.Firstly there is the need for an under-recognised diversity. In my future Bathtub Reading list will be a book by Scott E. Page, The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools and Societies.  The University of Michigan professor examines how diversity improves the problem-solving abilities of various organisations, with evidence as supported by both case studies and mathematical modeling.  Most people think of \u201cdiversity\u201d as encompassing the usual identity groups of race, ethnic origin, sex, gender and so on.  Page is not referring to these minorities, though.  In an interview in a recent edition of the New York Times article by Claudia Dreifus, \u201cIn Professor\u2019s Model, Diversity = Productivity\u201d, Page was quoted, I mean differences in how people think. Two people can look quite different and think similarly. Having said that, there\u2019s certainly a lot of evidence that people\u2019s identity groups \u2014 ethnic, racial, sexual, age \u2014 matter when it comes to diversity in thinking.Page says that organisations need this kind of cognitive diversity because it helps them solve problems and be more productive.Because diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.\nPeople from different backgrounds have varying ways of looking at problems, what I call \u201ctools.\u201d The sum of these tools is far more powerful in organizations with diversity than in ones where everyone has gone to the same schools, been trained in the same mold and thinks in almost identical ways.\nThe problems we face in the world are very complicated. Any one of us can get stuck. If we\u2019re in an organization where everyone thinks in the same way, everyone will get stuck in the same place.\nBut if we have people with diverse tools, they\u2019ll get stuck in different places. One person can do their best, and then someone else can come in and improve on it. There\u2019s a lot of empirical data to show that diverse cities are more productive, diverse boards of directors make better decisions, the most innovative companies are diverse.\nBreakthroughs in science increasingly come from teams of bright, diverse people. That\u2019s why interdisciplinary work is the biggest trend in scientific research.He also points out that merely getting a good score on the Graduate Record Exam doesn\u2019t describe a person\u2019s ability to do original or creative thinking.These are very important points, and graduate schools and businesses need to remember them when looking for future student and faculty members and employees.  In my own Dream, I would have the following as recommendations for diversity:Being \u201ccompatible\u201d does not mean \u201cthinks just like the rest of us\u201d.  Being a \u201cteam player\u201d does not mean \u201cwon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d.  Being \u201ccompetent\u201d does not mean \u201cwill be able to do things the same way the rest of us do them\u201d.  If you really want diversity the way you say you do in your Mission Statements, then you must be willing to not only accept but welcome people who have different opinions, different skill sets and yes, different needs.  Do not mistake \u201ctolerance\u201d for acceptance, or mistake \u201cacceptance\u201d for welcoming.    (I\u2019ve discussed the Trouble With Tolerance before, and also the general lack of diversity in university faculty.)Secondly, there are reminders of how the educational systems are inadequately designed.  A recent editorial in the Kansas City Star, \u201cHigh school students need help meeting colleges\u2019 expectations\u201d:Federal statistics show that as many as four in 10 college freshmen require at least one remedial course. The rate is higher at community colleges. More than 80 percent of freshmen in the Metropolitan Community College system need catch-up courses.\nHigh schools are preparing more young people to enroll in college. But many students are not being groomed to succeed in higher education.\nThe cost of that failure is exorbitant. Young people pay college prices for remedial courses that don\u2019t result in college credits. The odds of these students staying in school plummet.Not only are students often ill-prepared for mathematics and communication courses, they are often way behind in the sciences.  Even though the Pennsylvania and Kansas state school boards are (currently) back on track for teaching evolution as part of the K-12 science curriculum (howsoever small a part that actually is), both Texas and Florida are having their own upheavels with board members trying to push Intelligent Design into the curricula, as described by PZ Myers on his Pharyngula blog, such as the recent post, \u201cWhat\u2019s your school board like?\u201dThere is a serious disconnect between what is getting taught in schools and what students need for college or for their post-secondary vocations.  The Star editorial also noted,In a recent national survey by the non-profit research and assessment firm that develops the ACT test, 65 percent of college faculty said their states\u2019 standards prepared students poorly or very poorly for college-level work. But most high school teachers thought they were readying students for college by meeting state requirements.If that wasn\u2019t depressing enough, Bug Girl links to a Flicker photo stream by photographer/blogger Sweet Juniper, who did some urban exploration / infiltration around the abandoned Detroit Public Schoolbook Depository.  The pictures of endless pallets of 1980\u2019s era schoolbooks and teaching media that are slumped mouldering in original shrinkwrap, or burned, or rotting away with fungi and Ailanthus altissima (Tree of Heaven) seedlings growing in them are just horrifying.  Not only is the utter waste of materials inexcusable, but one also needs to realise just how impoverished the city and school district have been for decades, and how little in the way of quality education and social services has been given to the students and other residents.  Looking at the photos is like viewing stills of some post-holocaust sci-fi flick, but with the chilling knowledge that this is all real!None of these issues are going to be resolved by the No Child Left Behind Act, which seeks to \u201cimprove\u201d education by relying on all students achieving the states\u2019 various standardised test scores to evaluate district, teacher, and student performance. (Yes, each state sets its own standards.) As it stands now, the NCLB is totally unrealistic; the goal is that by 2014, 100% of students (even those in special education, immigrants, and disadvantaged students) will achieve the same high reading and math standards.  Not only that, states are having to cut their own school funding budgets with disastrous consquences, and  Bush\u2019s 2008 budget will reduce the federal funds that supplements the states\u2019 by over a billion dollars.In my own Dream, I would also have the following as recommendations for education and science:Set some national standards for K-12 subject content. \u201cLocal control\u201d should be about enriching the curriculum to reflect the region\u2019s natural and cultural histories, not about creating inconsistencies from state to state in what students are taught in the basic K-12 curriculum.We want to know that our teachers are qualified, and that the schools have the resources they need, but \u201caccountability\u201d does not mean punishing districts, teachers and students for not being able to achieve unrealistic goals.  Our real goals are for students to have the opportunity to learn the theoretical knowledge and practical skills they need to succeed in college work and in post-secondary employment.  To do this we need better communication between state college regents boards, school districts, and professional organisations for various disciplines.  We cannot as a nation succeed in scientific and technical innovation when the standards for science education are in constant jeopardy, when funding for both general education and basic research is grossly inadequate, when the dissemination of research information is suppressed, and when pseudo-science, medical quackery and magical thinking are held up in both the media and in political realms as being equal to or greater than sound scientific knowledge and critical thinking.And in summary, I would ask each of you,What are your dreams?You have to know what your dreams are in order to achieve them.And most importantly,What is the point of having dreams unless you are going to do something about them?", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0691128383/ref=ord_cart_shr?%5Fencoding=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&v=glance", "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/science/08conv.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&ref=education&pagewanted=print", "http://www.kansascity.com/340/v-print/story/452224.html", "http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/01/whats_your_school_board_like.php", "http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/01/20/detroit-in-photos/", "http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweetjuniper/sets/72157603302647339/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCLB", "http://www.nea.org/esea/storiesfromthefield.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/01/21/my-own-dream/", "title": "My Own Dream"},

It\u2019s never on time and they always get the same thing, but there\u2019s always plenty to eat, with leftovers to nosh on the next couple of days.So there you are, peacefully focused on business, when alla-sudden you are bombarded by a dozen sack lunches raining down on you and your cubicle!That\u2019s what happened to Rosie.  Again.As soon as I popped open the access-hatch on the top of her habitat, she scuttled hurridly over to a side wall and clung from an upper corner.  I don\u2019t think it anthropormorphising too much to say that she was alarmed, for I was hurridly dropping in over a dozen large crickets, along with their block of artificial diet and packaging.  Then my giant hand scrabbled around inside to retrieve the piece of cardboard egg carton and shake off the crickets still clinging to it.  That bit of packaging gives them something to hang on to during shipping and handling, but it would simply clutter up Rosie\u2019s room.Escapees are always a possibility, and annoying to both capture and return, so I hurridly snapped the access-hatch shut.  The crickets are discombobulated from being dumped out of their shipping container and bouncing around everywhere, with a couple of them landing in the white sake cup that is her water dish. Only after the hatch has been shut and the crickets settled down does Rosie go to check out the latest \u201cmanna from heaven\u201d.It\u2019s not easy being a pet-store cricket \u2014 they go from a life that revolves around food and (once matured) around sex, to being dumped someplace strange with a predator.  As things stand right now, the block of artificial diet has tumbled to one end of the habitat, and the rock the crickets are hanging on is at the other end.  Rosie snags a few nearby crickets, tip-toes around her habitat to see if there are any other changes (photo), and then retires to digest by parking in her little flowerpot.I realise that I need to find a better way of transferring the crickets, as the whole process seems alarming to all the arthropods involved, and is nerve-wracking for me as well due to the risk of escapees.For the arachnophobic, I put the picture \u201cbelow the fold\u201d.\u00a0I have to use an extension tube to shoot this, which makes for a rather shallow depth of field; it\u2019s hard to get everyone in focus when they\u2019re 4-6 cm apart.These are immature crickets, as distinguished by wings shorter than their bodies.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t2 December 2007 ", "body": "Most people think of children with Attention Deficit HYPERACTIVITY Disorder as being kids who bounce off the walls, sometimes literally so.  Several years ago, there was some debate as to whether or not our kid had ADHD.   All of the disorganised, inattentive, losing-things, forgetting-things details were there, as well as the bedroom floor that was invisible from clutter.  Certainly the kid couldn\u2019t sit through dinner without hopping up from the chair several times.  But in school the kid behaved somewhat differently (as children often do), and remained appropriately seated.  Because the kid is also rather reticent, there wasn\u2019t the frequent class interruptions that one gets with the talkative sort of ADHD student.The kid is now 16, and not surprisingly, has matured as well as gotten older.  Years of developing support systems at home have paid off in some areas; the kid rarely has to hunt down two matching shoes, and does a rather good job of keeping track of the daily pocket necessities.  However, there are still the missing assignments that result in low academic marks, and I\u2019m realising that I need to once again start asking to have multiple-item instructions repeated back, to ensure that the attention hasn\u2019t wandered off during mention of items 2 through N.Of course, the kid still fidgets (as do I).  The fidgets tend to change over time and according to availability.  Nice weather results in bouts of jumping on the big back yard trampoline to wear off some of the boingy-boingy before settling down to school work. Pausing to think while writing essays results in shuffling cards, listening to music, or clicking the carabiner clip of the combination flashlight-keyring.  Reading books can be done sitting on the giant exercise ball, standing partially on a scooter, while chewing gum, or jiggling a leg.  Memorising details is often accompanied by bouncing a hand-ball.  At home we\u2019re also blessed with four cats, which provide plenty of opportunity to give one furry friend or another its required pets and scritches.Fidgeting can be defined as a \u201crepetitive sensory-motor activity\u201d, which puts it into the realm of \u201cstimming\u201d.  But unlike some types of stimming activities that enable a person to withdraw and de-stress from an overwhelming situation, fidgeting helps the person stay engaged with the world and on the task at hand. (I don\u2019t include interfering or self-injurious behaviors in the realm of \u201cfidgets\u201d.)Fidgets are invaluable when the local environment doesn\u2019t provide sufficient kinds of stimulation, which makes it difficult because the brain craves a certain level of input, and lacking it will resort to seeking non-relevant external input (such as staring out the window or interacting with a peer), or by creating non-relevant internal input by mentally \u201cwandering off\u201d into the world of speculative daydreaming.  For example, the margins of my school notes tend to get covered in triangles, just as Bev\u2019s are filled with squares.  While at my home desk, I have the option of watching my various arthropods, the beetle, crickets and tarantula.Of course, not all fidgets are useful in all situations \u2014 noisy ones would be a bad choice in classroom or office settings because they would be distracting to other people.  So a person must have a repertoire of fidgets, including those that are appropriate to different situations and are respectful of others\u2019 needs.But an unobtrusive fidget is a functional adaptation.  It\u2019s a useful stimming activity that helps regulate chaotic sensory inputs and enables focus.  As such, it is not something to be discouraged by teachers, parents or others because it is perceived as \u201cbeing childish\u201d or \u201ca stereotypy\u201d.  Instead, appropriate fidgets need to be encouraged as useful coping strategies.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.buckaball.com/proddetail.asp?prod=GY022P", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/03/its-not-like-you-think.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/12/02/the-fine-art-of-fidgeting/", "title": "The Fine Art of\u00a0Fidgeting"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t5 December 2007", "body": "Today\u2019s post includes a recipe. It\u2019s a really quick recipe, \u201cquick\u201d in the real-world sense, not quick in the warped cookery-book sense that means standing at the stove for 45 minutes. It\u2019s also from scratch, so you can adapt it as necessary to fit your own dietary requirements. The ingredients are common pantry things, too.On days like this, I need comfort food. It\u2019s a long day at work, as working with 28 students who have emotional & behavioural issues can be. I\u2019m tired of the temper tantrums (teenagers being like toddlers with hormones), and hearing the \u201cF-bomb\u201d tossed about. I\u2019m especially tired of a trio of acting-out 8th-graders who collectively are the BD equivalent of acid+base+catalyst. Two of the teachers/staff are off sick, which means that they\u2019re death-warmed-over sick, unlike several of the present teachers/staff members who are among the walking sick. I\u2019m in the second category, and get to spend all morning crunching spreadsheet data, which given the way the students have been, was something of a blessing despite the fact that number-crunching is hardly my fave activity. The teacher has a substitute (of sorts), but of course there are no subs for paras, so we\u2019re short-handed.I have the intense desire to go crawl into a hot bath after work, but get home and discover that my son\u00a0has beat me to it, having spent yesterday at home sick and then dragged through a school day. So I get a snack and find that somehow we\u2019re missing a couple gallons of milk that I\u2019d bought at the grocery two days ago. Cuss. I go out to the garage and find them still in the trunk/boot of my car, where we\u2019d missed unloading them. Eeuw \u2026 gingerly set the two warm jugs of milk into the rubbish bin. Go back in the house and then my sock squishes into a puddle of cat-gack that one of them barfed up. Everybody has things that absolutely cannot stand; I can deal with blood and gore just fine, but wet socks absolutely gross me out. This pair of socks has one heel that\u2019s getting threadbare, so I simply toss them into the rubbish as well. I clean up remains of cat-gack that my foot missed.Retrieving the cleaning-up materials from the kitchen yields the discovery that for some unfathomable reason, one of the cats barfed onto a stovetop burner. I\u2019ve no idea why any of them would be up on the counters, and querying the quartet of felines produces nothing but blank stares, Hear no evil, See no evil, Speak no evil, Eat no evil. As if! Someone was gnawing on the spider plant! (Chlorophytum comosum \u2018Variegatum\u2019). I go fetch my slippers for my cold feet, and then start dismantling the stove-top for cleaning.Days like this call for comfort food \u2014 quick and easy comfort food, the sort you can eat with a bowl and spoon. I pull out a bag of spiral pasta and a couple tins from the pantry. I zapped some Romano green beans in the microwave for a side dish because we had some in the freezer.PASTA PARMA ROSASome shreds of Parma ham would be fabulous in this sauce, but who has that just sitting around? But even without it\u2019s still tasty. Quantities are rough guides; use what you have. Depending upon your ability to multi-task, this takes about 15-20 minutes to make.\u00a0 Chunky pasta shapes work better than slippery spaghetti.\nStart a pot of water to boil for the pasta.\nIf you have some on hand, mince half a small onion and a couple cloves of garlic. If not, dig around and find a couple tablespoons of dried onion flakes and/or 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder.\nOpen a 14-ounce / 400 gram tin of chopped tomatoes, and set them to draining. Or, dice a couple-three fresh tomatoes.\nOpen a tin of condensed milk, or measure out 2 cups half-and-half / half a liter of single cream (or dairy substitute).\nWhen the water is boiling, start pasta to cooking; don\u2019t forget to set the timer!\nCook the onions, garlic and tomatoes in 2 tablespoons of olive oil or butter, on medium heat. If using dried, add them at this stage so they will rehydrate in the tomato juice.\nGive the pasta a stir so it doesn\u2019t cook into a big noodleblob.\nWhen the tomato mixture no longer looks very juicy, stir in a couple tablespoons of flour. Add a sprinkle of pepper (white pepper if on hand) and half teaspoon of salt or to taste. Pour in the milk. Turn heat down so the sauce doesn\u2019t scorch.\nStir pasta again. Turn strainer upside-down and whack it inside the sink if the bits of tomato stuck to it offend you. Rummage around and find a big serving bowl and spoon.\nToss in a handful (about 1/4 cup if you\u2019re a measuring person) of shredded Parmesan cheese into the sauce, and a handful of minced ham if there\u2019s some around. I have also substituted a slice of bacon to great success \u2014 scissors make dicing the bacon much easier. Substitute half-cooked bacon for the oil at the beginning, and saut\u00e9 the onions et cetera in the bacon fat.\nDrain pasta when done cooking. Dump the pasta into the serving bowl, pour sauce over it, and put the rest of the Parmesan on the table for adding atop individual servings.\nNest the cookpots in the sink, tossing in the cooking spoons, along with a squirt of dish soap/ washing-up liquid, so the sauce doesn\u2019t harden while you\u2019re eating.\nGo eat your food while it\u2019s still hot!\n\t\t", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_plant"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/12/05/comfort-time/", "title": "Comfort Time"},

I would think that the TS would be a fairly easy diagnosis for their specialist to make, especially if various people at home and school have documented lists of various motor & vocal tics.  The ADHD diagnosis can sometimes be trickier, if only because the more noticeable tics tend to overshadow things, but given the frequency with which these syndromes are co-occurring (I hate the term \u201ccomorbid\u201d), no one should be surprised.  Likewise, AS also tends to come in these \u201cpackage deals\u201d.But the reason I mention all this is to comment about one of the aspects of the interview process that she mentioned:They did not think, for various reasons, that he has Asperger\u2019s, mainly because he is highly creative and also has a sense of humour (doesn\u2019t take everything literally as most asperger people do).  Boy, talk about literal-mindedness! There\u2019s nothing like absolutes to mess up diagnostics.  When people start throwing around concepts like \u201calways\u201d and \u201cnever\u201d, I get the impression that their experiences with different students (or clients, or adults, or children) is limited to memorising narrow diagnostic criteria and the obligatory (brief) psych rotation during training, rather than with numbers of rather diverse, real people.Asperger\u2019s or autistic kids do not:\n always take things literally;\nnever have a sense of humor;\nalways have flat affect;\nnever make eye contact;\nalways drone on incessantly about their special interests;\nnever have friends;\nare always computer or math whizzes;\nalways demonstrate stereotypical flapping, rocking, or stimming;\nor lack imagination \u2014 as the man himself said:\n\u201cIt seems that for success in science and art, a dash of autism is essential.\u201d\n~Hans AspergerAfter all, everything is relative \u2014 we\u2019re comparing how the person is compared relative to their peers.

Three of us have had migraines this week, possibly related to such.  There\u2019s nothing worse than waking up to a migraine with the blinding blue snow-glare piercing one right through the eyes to the brain, or the sleet-magnified echo-chamber effect of having a Boeing jetliner come grinding down the street and then going by again and then OMG going by a third time (jeez, it\u2019s the bloody snow plow scraping off the ice), and let\u2019s not forget crickets that suddenly mature to start chirping (STFU!), and lamp timers that develop annoying rattles (my apologies to recent house guests).Even worse, the weather\u2019s bad enough to make driving dangerous, but not bad enough to cancel school \u2014 teh suckage!Meanwhile, today I\u2019m snugged down at home, and have just made up some lentil soup (a vegetarian Indian recipe) in the crockery-cooker, so recipe at end of post (apologies to folks down-under who are contemplating summer fare).But there are the very good parts, including family in town for an early Christmas, and being also blessed with necessities like warm homes, full larders and effective medications.  We also have a number of little things that not only delight us in small ways, but even make life just so much more pleasant, and reduce our stress loads.  As usual, \u201cyou don\u2019t appreciate something until you\u2019ve lost it\u201d so we often don\u2019t realise just how much these mean to us, and how supportive they are, until we\u2019re away from home.  Here are some of my faves, which fall into two categories:  technology that enables me to do things, and creature comforts.\nThe internet. It\u2019s hard to imagine life without this font of information, fun and community.  Howdy to you all out there!\nMy MacBook. Years ago I got my first personal computer with word processing, and haven\u2019t looked back.  I store my music on it, create PowerPoints to show pictures and illustrate methods in my gardening classes, keep track of my calendar, use it to download and modify and print pictures, play games, and of course, write and store all sorts of documents.\nTo take all those fun pix I have my digital SLR.  No more 35 mm film to load and get developed or slides to scan!  I can shoot over 600 photos before downloading, which means plenty of shots to get just the Right One, and I can play around with interesting angles.\nMy New Beetle beeps to let me know I\u2019m low on fuel, and furthermore, will beep again the next time I start up the engine to remind me that now I really need to fill the gas/petrol tank.  It also has heated seats which sounded like a ridiculous frill until the first winter, and then I realised that I could get myself warmed up by the end of the first kilometer of driving, rather than by the time I\u2019d reached my destination.\nMy microwave that gives me a reminder beep a minute later, when I\u2019ve forgotten something in there after the finish beep. This is fabulous for the AD/HD brain!  Sometimes it takes that second reminder beep to penetrate past the hyperfocus to alert my consciousness.\nAnd since I have that extra small microwave from when I had a second home in my campus apartment, I now keep it in my bedroom where it\u2019s invaluable for also warming up my Rice Sock. The rice sock is simply a tube sock filled with 1 lb (1/2 kg) of dry rice, and knotted shut. I warm it up for a minute or two in the microwave, and then drape it where-ever I\u2019m cold, stiff or sore. Unlike an electric heating pad, it eventually cools down, so there\u2019s no risk of burns, and it conforms to my body much more nicely.  It\u2019s even nice in the summer, when I keep it in the freezer to cool down by draping it over my neck or forehead.  Any time of year it\u2019s great for draping across my eyes to shut out the light.   Everyone needs a rice sock!\nShearling slippers for the chronically cold feet; thankfully these things \u201cwear like iron\u201d (last a long, long time) as I wear them around the house for all but the barefoot months of the year.\nMy mug warmer, a small electric hot plate that keeps my coffee or tea Just Right for however so long.\nOld, soft 100% cotton pillowcases, ironed blissfully smooth (bonus if the bed linens were dried on a clothes line and smell like sunshine).  Cotton also feels cooler in the summer time.\n\u201cA few of my favourite things\u201d is the theme for the next Disability Blog Carnival, being held right here on the 13th.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 December 2007 ", "body": "Sometimes after a child gets a diagnosis (or diagnoses) the parents begin to realise many of the same issues from their own childhoods, and on through adulthood. In our family it took the opposite route. It took years to really see the aspie qualities of my kid, partly from unfamiliarity, and partly because in a geeky family like ours \u2026 most of those qualities are \u201cnormal\u201d. Not until the teen years did the social issues, the APD issues, and ADHD-related educational issues really become unavoidable. The tics went away after several years, as happens sometimes. But I think there was less \u201cdenial\u201d as there was unawareness and a sense of internal normalcy: \u201cthis is just the way we are\u201d.A very nice article by Benedict Carey illustrates this: Your Child\u2019s Disorder May Be Yours, Too Mr. Schwarz, a software developer in Framingham, Mass., found in his son\u2019s diagnosis a new language to understand his own life. His sensitivities when growing up to loud noises and bright light, his own diffidence through school, his parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 special intellectual skills \u2014 all echoed through his and Jeremy\u2019s behavior, like some ancient rhythm.\nHis son\u2019s diagnosis, Mr. Schwarz said, \u201cprovided a frame in which a whole bunch of seemingly unrelated aspects of my own life growing up fit together for the first time.\u201d\n\u2026\nIt can alter the present, too, if parent and child have enough common ground. Mr. Schwarz, the software developer in Framingham, said he became in some ways like a translator for his son, who\u2019s now 16.\n\u201cI think there are a lot of parents of kids with these diagnoses who have at least a little bit of the traits their kids have,\u201d Mr. Schwarz said. \u201cBut because of the stigma this society places on anything associated with disability, they\u2019re inhibited from embracing that part of themselves and fully leveraging it to help their kids.\u201dOur understanding of diagnoses mean changes over time, and we leave or entirely skip that stage of grieving over not having a promised \u201cnormal\u201d child, or possibly even viewing the issues as horrible things that must be cured at all costs.  Instead, we find that our children are different rather than damaged, and that we ourselves are oft times different as well.  We move from grief to acceptance, and realise that acceptance is not the same thing as resignation.In fact, we do not have children with broken wings, but we are in many ways flocks of different kinds of birds, not unlike the diversity of finches that Darwin found in the Gal\u00e1pagos, all adapted for slightly different niches.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t12 December 2007", "body": "I\u2019ve spent hours observing and recording the actions and reactions of insects and humans. I\u2019m a behavioural observer, but I don\u2019t consider myself to be a Behaviourist.  Despite the usefulness of Behaviourism for training animals (including humans) to perform particular tasks, I find that school of thought to be too limiting for understanding and helping people.Some years ago when I was taking my MSc in entomology, I studied insect behaviour.  One of the professors introduced us to Miller & Strickler\u2019s \u201crolling fulcrum\u201d model* for how insects respond.  Essentially this idea states that there are internal factors (of varying strengths) that affect how much an insect responds to of excitatory or inhibitory stimuli.  The example given was that even if you smell something really appetising, if you\u2019re not hungry then you\u2019re not going to eat it.  It was presented as something profound, but my internal response was along the lines of, \u201cDuh!\u201d (My external response was to continue doodling triangular pursuit curves on the margins of my lecture notes.)In other words, even with their very tiny brains, insects are not just stimulous \u2013 response animals, and you cannot simply predict that X amount of stimulous will produce Y amount of response. For example, on my end this meant that in a lab experiment to measure feeding response, I would have to deprive my research subjects of food long enough to be sure they would be hungry, but no so long that they would be getting weak or dehydrated.But sometimes subjects will exhibit aberrant behaviour, simply because they are individuals.  A few will have outlier responses in choice or non-choice experiments, and sometimes even in classical or operant conditioning experiments. They demonstrate the  fabulous Harvard Law of Animal Behavior: \u201cUnder carefully controlled experimental circumstances, an animal will behave as it damned well pleases.\u201dAt first glance, these outliers seem to be \u201cbadly wired\u201d \u2014 they don\u2019t respond to things they way they \u201cought\u201d to, totally ignoring how the behaviourists, entomologists and ecologists expect the animals need to behave to optimise their \u201c4-F\u201d abilities (feeding, fleeing, fighting, and um, fornicating). But the point of behavioural ecology is figuring out how organisms\u2019 behaviour adapts to different ecological conditions.When conditions change, so must the responses.  One of the main tasks of a successful organism (or species) is to find its niche.  And as we learned in ecology, if there\u2019s too much competition in the existing niche, then one has several options: change location on the macro scale (emigrate), change location on the micro scale (use a different part of the plant or environment), change time on the macro scale (migrate), or change time on the micro scale (different time of day).  Sometimes organisms engage in niche-partitioning where they divvy up resources, and sometimes they create whole new niches.  (Once Upon A Time, a dung beetle said to another, \u201cI know!  Let\u2019s take a chunk of this dung, roll it into a ball, and then bury it in a hole to feed the kids!\u201d /joke)But conditions are not the only things that change. So do the frequencies of genetic traits in a population, which (if consistent among numbers of individuals) sometimes give rise to what the taxonomists will variably call breeds, races, biotypes or subspecies. Genetic diversity can lend the opportunity to offer different ways of responding to the environment, whether that\u2019s a changing environment or a relatively static one.Beyond the 4-F abilities and the niche, there is the task of managing stresses. Beyond the obvious physical issues, it would be hard to guess what things stress out insects.  (Although when I dump a dozen crickets into Rosie\u2019s habitat, I suspect that they tend to freak out, \u201cOMG a giant spider!\u201d because they end up clustered on the far side of the rock. Right now one is looking over the edge of the flowerpot where Rosie is parked inside, and I imagine him blowing a raspberry at her as he waggles his antennae, but that\u2019s just anthropomorphising.)  On the other hand, a wide range of things stress out humans, and some of those stressors are things that affect only small percentages of humans.Of course, humans should be included in the animals cited by that Harvard law, and the more complex the range of behaviours that an organism has, the more complex and variable the responses will be.  Not even B. F. Skinner thought that people were simplistic stimulous-response organisms.  But even though he tried to explain mental processes simply as more behaviour, his behaviourist methods can be too limiting.  If all one looks at is observable behaviour, then the processes and motivations are likewise limited.Even in the world of functional behavioural observation, there\u2019s the dichotomous view that people are doing things either in an effort to \u201cget / obtain this\u201d or to \u201cprotest / escape / avoid\u201d that. We have internal factors of changing perceptions, opinions, biases and other cognitive events.  We also have (referring back to that rolling fulcrum concept) highly variable sensory levels.  Some people have much more variable or sensitive sensory worlds, or even frequently-changing levels of perceptual-channel processing that affect the interactions between their inner and outer worlds.  A lack of understanding of this in the observer can yield some lopsided or erroneous perceptions about the environmental Antecedants, much less the resulting Behaviour-Consequences.At first glance, these outliers seem to be \u201cbadly wired\u201d \u2014 they don\u2019t respond to things they way they \u201cought\u201d to, totally ignoring how the behaviourists expect them to behave.  But again, the point of behavioural ecology is figuring out how organisms\u2019 behaviour adapts to different ecological conditions.  Human genetic diversity yields people with different ways of responding to the environment, whether that\u2019s a changing environment or a relatively static one. If one person out of a hundred reacts differently to the same situation, their reaction probably serves some functional purpose for them.  Different doesn\u2019t necessarily mean wrong, just different \u2014 any behaviour that serves a functional purpose is adaptive!  There\u2019s nothing like spending hours observing students to realise that the same situational antecedants don\u2019t necessarily produce the same behaviours or consequences.  And when observing the results of various attempts to train, shape, fade, extinguish or instill specific behaviours, we find that our students are not nearly as tractable as lab rats.  Frankly, it is not easy, nor always desireable to shape or manipulate our student\u2019s behaviours with various positive & negative reinforcers (or punishers).  Such methods do have their uses, but we need to be mindful that intrinsic self-motivatione is something the student will always carry with them, whereas our extrinsic modifiers may not.More so than any other animal, humans spend a lot of time changing their environments.  We can more successfully work with students\u2019 individual wants and needs by engaging them in shared ownership of the learning process.  We do that by giving them more choices in how they acquire and then demonstrate their learning, so they can adapt their environments to better fit their individual needs.  Too often we try to make all the students fit the same niche, and then don\u2019t understand why they cannot all succeed.  (The reason we have \u201cspecial\u201d education is because \u201cnormal\u201d education is too narrow of an environment to provide enough niches.)Sometimes we forget that one of the important basics of education is figuring out what you are good at doing, and how to use that to achieve your goals \u2014 we don\u2019t want to spend too much of our time endlessly trying to improve our weak areas.  We also want our students to be able to learn how to identify what their own needs are, and different ways of meeting those needs.So why do I end up spending so much time observing people, even when I\u2019m not doing so for an official assessment?  Because one of my own needs is making sense of people, and figuring out how people determine what their needs are, and how they work to achieve them.* Miller J. R.,  Strickler K.L.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 December 2007 ", "body": "\u00a0Description:   a photo of part of my desktop, a faux-oak surface with several items lined up along the back edge, (left to right) a clear green plastic desk lamp; a piece of mirror glass on the desk holding  the quartet of a green-swirled globe of art glass from Scotland, a faceted crystal, and a small green beaded keepsake tin, and a purple glass tray with green beach glass from the North sea and pieces of granite from Loch Ness; a green glass bottle; several clear green plastic desk accessories including a stapler, tape dispenser, page holder, a tool caddy with green scissors and pens and suchlike, and in front of these is an electric mug-warmer with an old mug bearing the inscription, \u201cSAVE THE EARTH (IT\u2019S THE ONLY PLANET WITH CHOCOLATE)\u201d.  The photo has the post title added in the blank area near the top that reads, \u201cA FEW OF OUR FAVORITE THINGS\u201d.As you may have guessed, shiny or clear green objects are some of my favorite things.  This photo doesn\u2019t even show the prismatic green tissue box, photo frame, green fidget-widgits, or Rosie\u2019s habitat with the green lid.  Having these things on my desk to use and admire makes me happy.  (And that is the mug-warmer I mentioned in my own post on favorite things.)We all have a number of little things that not only delight us in small ways, but also make life just so much more pleasant, and even help reduce our stress loads.  These tend to fall into three categories:  technology that enables us to do things, creature comforts, and human interaction.  Got your cuppa?  Cats and dogs settled down?  Then let\u2019s begin!Techno-wowAt Planet of the Blind, Stephen Kuusisto finds that his favorite things \u201cfar more challenging and complex topic when filtered through the grinder of disability\u201d and then manages to find quite a few things, including tastier hot dogs (that\u2019s some disability grinder!)  Over at The Gimp Parade, Kay is eying an interesting vehicle in a photo from Laos, what appears to be a beautifully done moped-taxi for a wheelchair user. Greg at Pitt Rehab also has a list of spiffy hardware \u2014 including some pirate booty \u2014 when he describes \u201cA few of my favorite things\u201d.   Dave Hingsburger says with more than a note of covetousness, \u201cI Want a Ted\u201d \u2014 of course, you\u2019ll have to bop on over to his blog Chewing The Fat to find out just what a \u201cTed\u201d is.Creature comfortsBroadcast media can be a great diversion. Sometimes Wheelchair Dancer finds herself getting the blues from \u201cThe News of the Day\u201d. So when not practicing, performing or recovering from such, she can be found doing some TV watching, catching up on episodes of CSI and contemplating \u201cDisability on TV\u201d in episodes of L-word.    (I might note that there\u2019s been a number of disability-related episodes of CSI  as well.)   Mar\u00eda Fern\u00e1ndez presents an uncommon subject in her Learn a foreign language blog, a YouTube of one of Victor Manuel\u2019s Songs done en Espa\u00f1ol, a poignant song about love and mental disability, \u201cS\u00f3lo pienso en ti\u201d.Books rank high on many people\u2019s lists. Sunny Dreamer titles her post \u201cBright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens\u201d \u2014 and then mischievously goes on to describe \u2014 books and movies!  Nihilistech over at Brightly Colored Sporks of Revolution has managed to read over 60 books so far this year.  (I\u2019m flabbergasted!)  On the other hand, Miss Crip Chick is vexed and says, \u201ci don\u2019t feel so special today\u201d as her bookstore doesn\u2019t carry any of the sort of disability books that she wants to buy, just warm-fuzzy books for caregivers.  Ettina takes time to list a number of her special interests at her Abnormaldiversity blog (I had to smile reading the list, as we\u2019ve had so many of these at our house, too).Human interaction\nCilla Sluga writes a powerful post at Big Noise, where she describes that supporting others by teaching activism has \u201cNo Shortcuts\u201d.  Dr Deb Serani posts a reminder about something that slipped by me, December 3rd is/was International Day of Disabled Persons, a \u201cDecember \u2018Word\u2019 Awareness Day\u201d sponsored by the United Nations.   Another INTJ, Warren Wong goes for the practical and offers some concrete tips for \u201cHow To Feel Better And Be Happier\u201d on his Personal Development blog.The humanities played a large role in a surprising number of people\u2019s posts. In an essay that transcends the inner and outer worlds, Donimo\u2019s Body of Work blog includes examining the complexities of autumn leaves in \u201cFall under Foot\u201d, but is still left yearning for greater vistas.  Sarah Lewthwaite looks at provocative and sometimes disturbing sculptures in her post, \u201cDisability Rights and Wrongs: Mona Hatoum\u201d on her blog 32 Days Remaining.  Looking into the future of history studies over at her blog, Knitting Clio, Heather Munro Prescott examines how clarifying guidelines for \u201cHistorians and IRBs\u201d can make research easier and better. Looking back into the past, The Purloined Letter examines \u201cBodies in Art\u201d of the Renaissance and finds a little person in a less commonly-seen pose. This reminds me of the article describing an angel with Down syndrome in a 16th century Flemish painting of the nativity.  Which in turn leads me to one of my favorite posts in this Carnival, the Teen Possibles who announce: \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to have Down syndrome\u201d!Did you miss writing a post earlier, or were you too busy to get a blog entry submitted for this Carnival?

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t16 December 2007", "body": "Bath time.  I steady my balance by holding the sides of the tub, and ease myself into the hot water. There I play \u201cWhat\u2019s My Bruise\u201d, trying to figure out how I acquired all the motley souvenirs. There\u2019s a large turquoise blodge shaped like Antarctica on the top of my right foot, a constellation of dark purple marks on my left knee, several random fading-green spots on my forearms, various dull plum-coloured dings on my thighs and calves, and a deep tissue olive-green zone the covers most of the fleshy area between my left thumb and the back of my hand.  As usual, I have no idea how or when these happened.  I bruise easily, and between my joint hypermobility and crappy proprioception I\u2019m always bumping into things.   There\u2019s nothing to do about the bruises, but I monitor them to make sure that things do heal up and disappear within a couple of weeks (my mother had diabetes), and to watch for infections (like the ingrown toenail cellulitis for which I just finished a round of antibiotics). And so it goes.Unless you have a rare CIP mutation (Cogenital Insensitivity to Pain), you\u2019re familiar with aches.  We\u2019ve all experienced the ordinary headache, the run-of-the-mill bruised limb, the annoying paper cut.  These \u201cowie-boo-boos\u201d are annoying and ephemeral.  Many people experience severe but thankfully brief* pain with childbirth or traumatic events such as broken bones or appendicitis.  Yet none of them begin to describe the issues faced by those with chronic pain problems such as arthritis or TMJ, or the re-occurring severe pain of migraines.We tend to view pain as strictly a physical problem, treated with various analgesics and/or physiotherapies.  You hurt, you take treatment, the pain goes away, your wound heals, the event stops.  That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work, and if it doesn\u2019t, then you\u2019re not doing it right.  We even have child-birth classes to teach people the \u201cright way\u201d to have pain (yes, I say \u201cpeople\u201d because their partners are there to learn how to reinforce the appropriate responses during L&D).But chronic and re-occurring severe pains don\u2019t follow that socio-medical model.  Not only do they not respond in the simplistic and linear fashion, they are also not just physical phenomena.  Pain becomes a cognitive issue, and an affective (emotional) issue as well.  Chronic pain varies in its intensity and may abate for short periods, but there is generally no expectation of it going away permanently.  The person suffering from this has to come to grips with the new state of affairs, realising that this is the \u201cnew normal\u201d, and then re-organising their life around ways of dealing with it.  Re-occurring severe pain varies in its frequency and duration, and a person may have days or possibly weeks between episodes, but even during those there\u2019s still the knowledge that it will return.  The migraineur too must re-organise their life around ways of dealing with it.WARNING:  graphic pain descriptions in this one paragraph:\n\nIn such circumstances, we become aware of the different types of pain and its accompanying symptoms: shooting pain, stabbing sensations, throbbing, burning, tightness, stiffness, tenderness, bone crushing, blinding pain, eye-watering pain, tightness around the crown, lead poured atop the brain, wracking pain,  pins-and-needles, skin-crawling sensations, cramps tying your viscera into knots, nausea, numbness (not as useful as it sounds), blurred vision, tunnel vision, seeing stars, disturbing buzzing sensations (like a phantom mobile phone or pager vibrating), synaesthesia or hallucinations, hypersensitivity of skin contact, generalised teeth aches, hair hurting (I know, I know \u2014 external hair is dead material, but I swear it still hurts), clumsiness, dizziness, vertigo, loss of balance, chills and/or sweating, abhominable ticklishness of the ear hairs, speech difficulties,  tremors, \u201cbrain fog\u201d including confusion or loss of concentration, disorientation, paradoxical increased mental acuity right before crashing, being snappish, depressed, extreme fatigue and/or insomnia \u2026 the list seems inexhaustible.If you\u2019ve never had these, then just stop and remember the worst case of the flu you ever had.  And then imagine never completely recovering from it and having periodic rebounds.Legitimising the reality of pain is difficult.   If you complain, then you\u2019re \u201cjust being whiny\u201d.  If you don\u2019t mention it, then no one realises just how difficult your life is, and assume that you\u2019re not functioning well because you\u2019re lazy or stupid.  Other people tend to view the episodes of being less obviously in pain, or episodes between migraines, as being evidence that the person affected has \u201crecovered\u201d (like they are supposed to) and that the issue is gone (and thus accommodations are no longer needed).When visiting doctors, there\u2019s a fine balance to strike between self-advocacy and being explicit enough for them to understand the magnitude of the problems (yes, plural), and how those problems interact and magnify each other, but also avoiding coming off as being a neurotic female or a prescription-seeking druggie.There are these bizarre, disability-related social expectations about pain: not being able to fix yourself up or overcome the problem or find a \u201ccure\u201d is seen as a kind of moral failure \u2014 you\u2019re simply not trying hard enough.  Well, I have news for you all:  being in chronic pain is very trying, and I work hard to both get things done and to take things easy on myself when I can (ever the difficult balance).I\u2019ve been on a prescription-level dosage of Naproxen for several months now, and it is effective at managing the arthralgic pain and keeping it down to a tolerable background noise (somewhat like the nociception version of tinnitus, albeit more real).  With any luck, the medication will continue to be effective for me for months or years to come. Like other incurable problems, the issue may temporarily improve or worsen long-term, but it never goes away.  Because of that, one is treating the symptoms for a very long time, and bodies have the annoying \u2014 and alarming \u2014 ability to eventually become insensitive to various analgesics.  So I\u2019m cautious about maxing out my tolerance for a particular medication.On the other hand, one can get so used to being in pain that they hurt themselves worse.  I don\u2019t mean \u201cused to\u201d as in \u201cnot bothered by\u201d \u2014 of course the pain still permeates how I feel, and how well I manage to do everyday things, and how well I cope with other issues.  In this case, \u201cused to\u201d means that the pain level has unfortunately become so omnipresent that I become habituated to it.  Think of chronic pain as being like the household clutter that becomes part of the background scenery to where you don\u2019t realise how bad it\u2019s getting, and despite this \u201cpain clutter\u201d I keep trying to do everything full-tilt until I crash, thus crashing much worse.But as we deal with the physical side of pain, we must also deal with the cognitive and affective sides of pain as well.  There\u2019s the primary suffering of the physical pain, but I try to keep the suffering limited to that, rather than letting it suffuse my life with the secondary suffering of wanting what I can\u2019t have, and railing against what I\u2019ve lost. I am not attached to my pain; I am attached to what I have learned having come through it.Sometimes I can deal with the pain not by trying to ignore, avoid or escaping it, but rather by leaning into it. Now this goes against everything one does naturally, as pain prompts an escape response.  But when I focus on the pain and try to describe it to myself, quantifying and qualifying how it\u2019s affecting me, it loses the ability to be scary in the free-floating monstrous way.  Becoming more aware of exactly where it is makes me more aware of where it isn\u2019t, and how it is limited.  Being more aware of what it is like at that moment distracts me from wobbling perseveratively between past episodes of remembered pain and anticipated episodes of continued pain.  The most useful thing I learned in childbirth class was to consciously remember to breathe, and breathe deeply, as a means of riding through the intense waves and relaxing slightly between them.I can accept the fact that I have to deal with pain without feeling like I\u2019m giving in to it.  I don\u2019t want all this pain!  And that\u2019s okay \u2014 I don\u2019t have to want it; I just have to deal with it.   I\u2019m a practical optimist; I don\u2019t expect magical cures to be developed, but I\u2019m not resigned to a dismal life.  Shit happens, we cope, and we move on.And sometimes we stop and kvetch, because you know, shit happens!* Not that 36 hours of back-labour is \u201cbrief\u201d in the world of childbirth, but it is necessarily limited in duration.  Plus, one has a baby to show for it, unlike a migraine.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/12/16/its-a-real-pain/", "title": "It\u2019s a Real\u00a0Pain"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t18 December 2007", "body": "OMG Zombies!  The leper-outcast-unclean-undead are on the move, seeking to steal away our chilluns and Eat Their Brains!Except I\u2019m not talking about the latest sci-fi movie with Will Smith.  I\u2019ve finally gotten to the point to where I can speak reasonably about the horrible \u201cransom notes\u201d campaign by the NYU Child Study Center.  Their billboards and magazine ads describe children with OCD, ADHD, depression et cetera as being stolen away and held hostage by their disorders. In an article in the New York Times, the organisation\u2019s description of the effort says,We hope to both generate a national dialogue that will end the stigma surrounding childhood psychiatric disorders and advance the science, giving children the help they need and deserve.Excuse me?  How the HELL does this horrifying campaign \u201cend the stigma\u201d?  The stigmas that people with such conditions face are NOT caused by the conditions, they are caused by societal attitudes!  Such negative, one-sided publicity only reinforces such.The demonisation of differences creates fear, loathing and hatred of not only the disorder/disability, but also the person \u201chorribly afflicted\u201d with such (/sarcasm). It\u2019s bad enough that media personalities are describing autistics as \u201csoulless shells\u201d, now we have children who were stolen away, who can do no good \u2014 they will be a family burden, a drain on social resources and will surely self-destruct.Quoted in an article in the New York Daily News, Dr Koplewicz, director of  center, calls the campaign \u201cedgy\u201d:\u201cIt\u2019s harsh and edgy and shocking but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nearly as shocking as the diseases themselves, and the lack of treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for psychotic disorders to be equal to physical disorders.\u201d(\u201cOoh look \u2014 we\u2019re doing Good Works and attracting lots of attention with our \u201cedgy\u201d ads \u2014 aren\u2019t we just so clever?\u201d)    But that\u2019s not \u201cedgy\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s cutting, deeply, stick-the-blade-in-and-twist-it cutting.  And \u201cpsychotic disorders\u201d ?  Things like ADHD or Asperger\u2019s are not psychoses.  (You\u2019d think Dr Koplewicz would know better.) These ads do a disservice to millions of children and their families by using such gross inaccuracies to describe disorders in such terms. Way to go to end that stigma, man.Demonisation separates the accused as being not-quite-human, and thus outside the realm of deserving public goodwill.  Demonisation discredits advocates, including self-advocates of the group being slandered.  After all, one can\u2019t expect \u201cpsychotic\u201d people who were kidnapped by diseases, who are \u201cunable to socialize\u201d, who are a \u201cdetriment to [themselves] and others\u201d to be knowledgeable, helpful citizen who want to and who can participate in society.I\u2019m really, really tired of the \u201cWar On X\u201d campaigns, and the \u201cTerrorism\u201d metaphors.  Ransom notes is another terrorism metaphor, and it\u2019s especially cruel and disrespectful to those families whose children really were kidnapped by (real, live) criminals.If you have a child who has a disorder (such as bulimia), the last thing you want to read is a crude magazine ad framing the problem in catastropic terms.  This isn\u2019t helpful; it isn\u2019t productive.  It doesn\u2019t make your life any easier with your co-workers or boss when you have to take time off work to take your child in for an appointment.  Making such issues \u201cshocking\u201d doesn\u2019t put a sympathetic face to a problem when you have to broach the subject with extended family members.  All this negative press makes it more difficult for people to discuss problems, to get support from their various social networks, or to be willing to consider anything but the most radical forms of treatment that must surely go with such terrifying diagnoses.And can you imagine how reading this giant billboard would make feel if you were severely depressed:We have taken your son. We have imprisoned him in a maze of darkness with no hope of ever getting out. Do nothing and see what happens\u2026DepressionWell, I don\u2019t have to imagine \u2014 I\u2019ve been severely depressed, and I can say that the \u201chopeless\u201d scenario is guaranteed to NOT HELP.   Doomed, we\u2019re doooommmed. ::shudder::  These kinds of ads certainly don\u2019t inspire me to patronise the NYU Child Study Center.  The whole tone is very unprofessional, and the catastrophic emphasis doesn\u2019t lead me to expect good results from their practice.

It is given to \u201cthose people who have blogs we love, can\u2019t live without, where we think the writing is good and powerful.\u201d  Each person giving the award then gets to select \u201cthree things they believe are necessary to make writing good and powerful\u201d and nominate five deserving people.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 December 2007", "body": "Well, with all the buzzing going on around more noisome news, I was certainly glad to find something sweet during a recent forage of my news source trapline*. It\u2019s a new-ish piece of Assistive Technology (AT) for communication!  But this post isn\u2019t just about a nifty little mechanism (which I\u2019ll get to in a minute); it\u2019s about the social stuff around using ATs to communicate.A variety of disability bloggers have discussed different electronic mechanisms they use for communicating with others**.  There are a number of hurdles faced by users of augmentative communication (aug-comm), and unfortunately they are often greater in number than other kinds of AT. With any tech, there\u2019s always the issues of finding out about it, trying it out, affording it, the learning curve, dealing with maintenance issues, upgrading to newer models when something gets too worn out or is simply too archaic for customer support or technical compatibility, working it in with other hardware in your life (\u201cIt\u2019s a great piece of equipment, but my chair doesn\u2019t come with a trailer so I can\u2019t simply schlep it everywhere\u201d) and other annoyances (\u201cHow is anyone s\u2019posed to type on these tiny buttons?\u201d).But communication AT has its own strange set of social-disability type hurdles.  Our culture so inextricably links communication with speaking that we run into a great amount of resistance and outright denial that communication can even happen without speech.  Oralism reigned supreme in the world of Deaf and hearing-impaired education (and frequently still does).  People also assume that others who can hear adequately should also be able to speak.  They often assume that someone with an inability to speak easily, fluently and/or regularly must have a severe cognitive impairment.   (Cue old rant about \u201cdeaf and dumb\u201d where dumb = supposedly mute and stupid.) They often associate \u201cnot being able to say something\u201d with \u201cnot having anything to say\u201d.  Even perfectly verbal wheelchair users find that the presence of the chair sometimes demotes them to the social realm of non-persons, where waiters, store employees or service workers will ignore them and/or attempt to route all the conversation through anyone else nearby.  Joel Smith does a good job of describing how some parents react to giving their children AT as \u201cgiving up\u201d because struggling to be normal is deemed so much more important than making your thoughts known.  (And then people wonder why kids have meltdowns!)But folks do need to communicate, and people employ a wide range of means: sign, TDD (TTY / textphone), mobile phone texting, Instant Messaging (IM), voice synthesizers, e-mail, writing, picture boards \u2026 But whatever means one uses, the other person must also be willing (and able) to work with the medium.  And there\u2019s the crux of the issue.  The AT we use must not only be useful to us physio-mechanically and succeed with regards to the signal-over-noise ratio, it must also work with our psychosocial needs and the greater cultural needs.Before the days of readily-available e-mail, we had a TDD at home for when my hard-of-hearing hubby wanted to call deaf / HoH friends, or needed to make more complex phone calls to companies for technical information related to his computer work.  Nowadays my hubby has a Blackberry for texting and emailing, as well as a mobile phone that can send the incoming signal directly to his hearing aids. (He sometimes uses a hands-free lavalier mike when talking on the phone this way, which because no one else can hear the incoming signal, makes him look like he\u2019s standing there talking to the voices in his head.)  These newer things are fabulous sorts of ATs because they involve tech that everyone else is using as well, so it\u2019s socially \u201cnatural\u201d.\nYou might naturally conclude that someone with normal hearing (or even hyperacute hearing) would have no need of communication AT.  But with my auditory processing issues, I sometimes have difficulty with phone conversations, especially when talking to people with whom I am not familiar, or if we\u2019re discussing topics and names that are new to me.   Additionally, I once had a student who used a Dynavox (or Lightwriter or another similar type-to-speech synthesizer), and because I found the electronic voice difficult to understand ended up having to read his text window more than listening to it.  This proved to be an awkward situation, as he found it hard to converse with someone who kept wanting to look over his shoulder.Furthermore, when I\u2019m really tired, my clarity of speech drops, and some days I just have sporadic bouts of stuttering. When I focus on the enunciation, it slows me down and reduces my ability to do all the recall and planning of what I\u2019m saying.  The motor planning of speech detracts from my cognitive planning of speech, and normally my ADHD brain wants to be two paragraphs ahead of where my mouth is.  If I am focused on things going on around me and trying to \u201cwing it\u201d with regards to talking, then things don\u2019t always come out phrased clearly.  I drop words, get phrases out of order, forget names or pull a previous (irrelevant) name from my \u201cword buffer\u201d.  I got about four hours of sleep last night due to health issues, and by this afternoon I was running into such speech-production issues at least twice an hour (although due to the sleep deprivation, my brain was in no way racing anywhere).In other words, I don\u2019t come off as sounding very intelligent.  And although I\u2019m generally a highly verbal sort of person, I still find that I frequently have trouble discussing issues outside of my usual realm of chatter.  There have been times when hubby and I have taken our laptops to a local coffeehouse to enjoy a cuppa and discuss household issues via Instant Messaging.  Being able to read and type my responses gives me the opportunity to review what\u2019s been said and think about what I\u2019m trying to express without the verbalising getting in the way.  He in turn not only gets the conversation captioned, but also gets the face contact that is so important to him.Which (yes, finally) gets us to this spiffy AT.  The UbiDuo is a pair of unfolding keyboards plus text screens, which two people can use to wirelessly text conversations with each other in a face to face setting.  The article refers to deaf people who use it to communicate with hearing people, including extended family members,  co-workers, clients and others.  This is not only helpful for reducing the wait and expense of scheduling and hiring interpreters, but also improves family and personal life.  Of course, the device won\u2019t replace interpreters completely, because it\u2019s limited to two to four users.I suspect that twenty years ago this device would not have been as well-received with the general public as it is now in the 21st century.  Nowadays a far greater percentage of the general population is used to texting information through e-mail, IM or mobile phones.  The UbiDuo has the benefits of being socially natural and enabling more direct face contact and interpersonal communication.  We can only hope that other forms of aug-comm are better received as the general public becomes more exposed to them.  Of course, this means that we must continue to provide that exposure, and to advocate for others to have access!Further resources:\nThe article about the UbiDuo.\nAmanda at Ballastexistenz blog has an impressive listing of articles by and about autistic aug-comm users.\nTees, mug et cetera on this self-advocacy theme of \u201cNot being able to speak is not the same as not having anything to say.\u201d\n* \u201ctraplining\u201d is when bees make regular tours of known nectar sources by visiting them at particular times of day  \u2014 sometimes I think that honeybees are better at remembering things on their To Do lists than I am \u2026\n** Sorry, I\u2019m tired and can\u2019t remember who-said-what-where.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t24 December 2007", "body": "Today I finally got around to decorating the tree, which shows you just how behind I am with things. (But the bedroom painting and sofa-futon assembly is done!) The Kid chose to go shopping instead of decorating, and I requested some wax worms from the pet store (for my Fiery Searcher beetle), and some groceries.  There was about a two second pause, and then the kid asked me cautiously, \u201cThose wax worms aren\u2019t related to the groceries, are they?\u201dAfter reassurances to the negative, I handed off the extended grocery list, and started opening the crates with the holiday stuff. While decorating the tree, I remembered some stories of past years.  These are from the:\u201cSome Days I Just Don\u2019t Understand People\u201d FileSome years ago, my mother asked me what I wanted for Christmas. \u201cWe really need new towels for our green-and-white bathroom,\u201d I volunteered. Our current towels were over a decade old, and getting raggedy with holes and rips and threadbare spots.Christmas came, and I unwrapped a large box of towels. It was one of those co\u00f6rdinated sets, two bath towels with two matching hand towels and two matching washcloths. And they were all pink. I don\u2019t like pink; I haven\u2019t liked pink since I was a small child. Nothing in my house was pink, especially not my bathroom. Each towel had a big embroidered appliqu\u00e9 on it, with the bath towels having dinner-plate size areas that were too stiff and rough to make them usable for drying off. I was unfolding a towel and asked her, \u201cDo you think they will soften up after they\u2019ve been washed a few times?\u201d\u201cOh you\u2019re not supposed to use them \u2014 they\u2019re just to hang up for show,\u201d explained my mother. She was pouting because I wasn\u2019t ecstatic to have a functionless gift. This was not unlike my birthday, when she had given me a heavily-ruffled blouse full of scratchy lace, that was four sizes too large.~~#~~A few years later, I worked temporarily at a local garden center on weekends and evenings.  They had extended their evening hours until 9:00, but few folks had caught on yet. Maybe it was the freezing rain on that Friday night, and the snow on the Saturday afternoon.  But by Sunday the roads had been cleared, and the customers were finally trooping through the store more-or-less steadily.I was shelving, and overheard a customer ask the store manager, \u201cDo you know anything?\u201d  (Now what would Miss Manners reply to that?)Some wit at the corporate head office decided to put the dog chews and bird seed on sale for 1/3 of their regular prices; I think that\u2019s what they mean by a \u201closs leader\u201d.  So customers would trot in with their coupons to buy just 99 cents of seed and leave again, after much wandering around and asking questions about the other merchandise.\u201cCan I buy just nine feet of this eleven foot tree?  The top\u2019s not really pretty.\u201d  No, they didn\u2019t want the tree merely trimmed down (as people sometimes do), they wanted to pay for just part of the tree.  But because we bought an eleven-foot tree from the grower, that was the price we had to sell it for.  Unlike a side of beef that gets pieced down to primal cuts and then steaks, Christmas trees are a whole-unit item.\u201cWhere are the extension cords?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re all over here,\u201d I answer, pointing to a small end-aisle display of brown lightweight extension cords and orange heavy-duty extension cords.\nCustomer, disdainfully: \u201cI don\u2019t like this brown; do you have any blue ones?\u201d\n\u201cNo.  All of the extension cords we have are over here,\u201d I answer, smiling despite chapped lips. This was a small garden center folks, not a gianormous hardware store that stocks extension cords in \u201cdesigner\u201d colors.The phone rang.\u00a0 I picked up the receiver with one hand, and use the other to cover my free ear and block out the background noise of the endless tinny Christmas carols that were giving me a headache.  \u201cGarden center and pet store, this is Andrea,\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any ponderosa pines?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but we do have white pines, with or without flocking.\u201d (\u201cFlocking\u201d is the white artificial snow stuff they spray on trees.) I was thinking, ponderosa pine Christmas trees?\n\u201cI want a ponderosa pine to plant outside.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any balled-and-burlap live Christmas trees to plant outside, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a Christmas tree, I want a landscape tree.\u201d\nIn December? The ground had been frozen for weeks; everything was covered in snow and ice!  \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, we\u2019re not selling landscaping materials at this late date.\u201dI was standing with a customer in front of the ornament rack, pointing to hooks and replacement parts for Christmas tree lights (fairy lights).  \u201cDo you need any ornament hooks or or replacement bulbs?\u201d I asked, always ready to save customers an unnecessary trip back to the store.\n\u201cNo, just these balls,\u201d she replied, holding a box of glass ornaments.\n\u201cThen I can ring that right up for you \u2026 That\u2019ll be $13.92.  Do you want a sack for those?\u201d\nCustomer, staring at  her box of purple glass balls, \u201cOh, do you have any of that wire stuff you use to put these on the tree?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I responded, unplugging my key from the register and walking back to the aisle where we just were.  I held up two different packages of hooks, \u201cWe have long ornament hooks, and short ornament hooks.\u201d\n\u201cOh.  What\u2019s the difference?\u201dAnd this, O Best Beloved, is why I don\u2019t work in retail any more.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/12/24/stories-of-yesteryear/", "title": "Stories of Yesteryear"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 December 2007", "body": "I am in the waiting place.  Again.  Still. It\u2019s annoying.I can be patient; I\u2019ve spent hours waiting and watching for things to happen when doing outdoor photography, waiting for the sun to be covered by a cloud so the light is not so contrasty, waiting for the eternal wind to not blow so hard, waiting for an insect to alight somewhere, waiting for it to quit raining, et cetera.But at the core, I like to operate and make my decisions based upon facts.  A lack of (what feels like) sufficient or useful data leads me to milling around, stuck until I can figure out where or how to get the information I need. I also like to know what I\u2019m going to be doing, so I can be prepared and plan around the other things in my life.  One of the ways that I reduce stresses in my life is by limiting these free-floating anxieties.Merely being in the limbo of putting things on hold because I\u2019m stuck waiting is annoying, but I\u2019m an adult.  I can deal with feeling like I\u2019m stuck on a dreary flight circling over O\u2019Hare airport, waiting for a runway to free up.  There\u2019s no point in having a hissy fit because that won\u2019t change anything.  So why am I grousing?Because my health is suffering from the delays.   The arthralgia medication isn\u2019t helping enough lately.  Quite possibly because I\u2019ve not had a solid night\u2019s sleep in four months due to hot flashes/night sweats every 30-90 minutes. I got better sleep when I was nursing newborns! (Though frankly I was not sleeping well before the hot flashes.)  My joints and muscles ache all over.  I get frequent headaches.  I have more bruises than ever, and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m just being clumsier from the exhaustion & stiffness, bruising more easily, or both.  I\u2019m sweating hot and shivering cold and hot and cold and hot and cold, regardless of the time of day or where I am.  My stamina is lousy, and I\u2019m mentally mushy half the time (again, good sleep would help).  I feel like I\u2019ve had the flu for five months \u2014 it\u2019s almost as bad as the summer I had mono and Lyme.About a year ago, I realised, \u201cBoy, my joints ache a lot \u2026\u201d After a couple months of that, I decided to see my GP.  So in March he suggested I see a rheumatologist for the chronic joint pain.   I saw her in May, and she put me on better analgesics for the arthralgia. A few months later my GP took me off the HRT, as well as cutting my analgesics in half because he thought they were causing hypertension. (By November I ended up going back to the higher levels of analgesics because not surprisingly, pain makes my blood pressure worse.)  My blood pressure has normalised again, but without the HRT I was thrown into menopausal hot flashes.   My rheumatologist suggested I see my old OB/GYN about them, which had I not been so bloody tired might have occurred to me \u2014 it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve not seen her since the last follow-up after the hysterectomy several years ago.  So in November I made an appointment with my OB/GYN, but there wasn\u2019t an opening until December, and then we had to reschedule for January because she was out delivering a baby, as happens with OB/GYNs.About a year ago, I realised, \u201cBoy, my joints ache a lot \u2026\u201d  Now I\u2019ve moved up to \u201cBoy, I can\u2019t sleep and I\u2019m having a lot of headaches and I ache all over.\u201d It takes weeks to see yet another doctor.  I sure hope something gets resolved. I\u2019m signed up to take an evening college class next semester, but lately I\u2019m just wiped by the time I get home from the para and tutoring work.But meanwhile, I have \u2026to wait.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/12/22/circling-over-ohare/", "title": "Circling Over O\u2019Hare"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t27 December 2007", "body": "Today I joined hubby for a short visit to the health club.  I\u2019d not been in a large number of months, but decided that this would be a good opportunity to scope things out with regards to what they had.  I need to get back into the habit of getting some regular exercise.  I figured that scoping things out ahead of time and figuring out what I needed, and when I was going to go, would be a good way of easing back into the habit.  Why wait until New Year\u2019s Day to make a resolution?There are a number of good reasons for me to get some exercise, but an equally weighty number of reasons why it\u2019s been increasingly difficult to do so.\nExercise is good because it improves sleep, and I\u2019ve not had a solid night\u2019s sleep in months due to frequent hot flashes. But it\u2019s hard to go exercise when you\u2019re tired, achey and exhausted all the time.\nIt helps maintain bone density (my maternal line has osteoporosis riddled through it) and calcium+vit D supplements aren\u2019t enough.\nRegular exercise will help me get back in the habit of stretching regularly, which not only helps me monitor my ROM (Range of Motion) in various joints, but also maintains flexibility.  This doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal \u2014 the thing about being hypermobile is that I\u2019m naturally bendier than the average human; where most people struggle to touch their toes, I can bend over (with my knees locked) and place my palms flat on the floor.  Except for when I push myself out of bed and lurch unsteadily down the stairs first thing in the morning, I don\u2019t really appear to be as stiff as I feel \u2014 my \u201cstiff\u201d frequently puts my ROM into the realm of \u201cnormal\u201d, which makes it hard to explain to docs that, No, I\u2019m really stiff today.  Of course, the flip side is handling myself carefully; I have to do my stretches slowly so I don\u2019t injure myself.  But regular stretching will help prevent accidental sprains and subluxations, especially when I stumble or fall.\nExercise is good for endorphins, which mean less pain \u2014 hooray!\nDoing weight-bearing exercise will help me maintain and increase muscle mass and strength.  The club has circuits of various weight-training equipment (Nautilus, Cybex et cetera) as well as free weights. Of course, the challenge is to protect my joints at the same time.\nToday I stretched out, and did a slow round of the Nautilus equipment, taking care to make notes about settings.  I moved through the machines slowly and was careful not let the weights drop or thump at the lower and upper ends of the movements (which would jar my joints), and remembered to inhale during abductions (pulling limbs away from my torso) and to exhale during adductions (pulling limbs in towards torso).  I read the directions for each machine carefully, employed the seat belts, adjusted the seat heights to fit my frame, and set the weights two levels lighter than where I had last used them a few years ago.  That proved to be effective; I could get through at least one rep of ten for each, with the weights set at anywhere from 30 pounds (about 13 kilos) for the tricep curl, to 60 pounds (about 27 kilos) for the leg curl, depending upon the type of machine.Adaptation is everything when it comes to doing a workout.  I discovered that I won\u2019t be able to use the lateral raise machine for the deltoids and trapezius muscles, as it puts too much pressure on the sides of my elbows.  For those I will have to use a pair of 20-pound (9 kilo) free weights.  Note to self:  pack weightlifting gloves!  And I\u2019ll have to buy some sneakers (trainers).  I must remember take my newly-repaired iPod \u2014 the good thing about ubiquitous personal media players is that gyms no longer feel compelled to blast their (crappy) music everywhere, as everyone is listening to their own favorite music.  When plugged into my music, I can be off in my own world and not need to chit-chat with anyone.I abhor sit-ups; no matter what style of sit-ups or crunches are in vogue, they always give me headaches (maybe that\u2019s related to the TMJ).  But at the college gym I discovered the \u201ccaptain\u2019s chair\u201d, which is a high chair without a seat.  You climb up, hold onto the hand-grips, and slowly curl your legs up to your chest, either straight or angled left or right.  I really like this piece of equipment because I don\u2019t end up with tight or stiff neck muscles, or sore spots on my vertebrae.But it\u2019s not enough to just stretch before I work out.  I need to be sure my meds have kicked in, and that my muscles are warmed up before I start. Before doing a few speed-walk laps around the track and stretching, I can take a hot shower at the gym and then change into exercise clothes. Then when I\u2019m done, the remedy for aches is cool packs, such as a (knotted) tube sock filled with a pound of small beans, which can be kept in the freezer.  (This is also nice for something cold on the back of the neck or the forehead.)I hate aerobics classes. I have problems with co\u00f6rdinating my arms and legs at the same time, and the  instructors are constantly changing the movements, leaving me half a step (or more) behind.  I hate the loud, stupid music they play.  Worse, the activity triggers asthmatic coughing fits, and most aerobics is really hard on the joints. Fortunately, the club has a variety of low-impact classes, such as yoga,Tai-Chi, pilates, even bellydancing (which I\u2019ve not done for years). Of course, the trick is finding a time slot when I can attend; I start work at 7:30 and will be attending evening classes twice a week. Doing any of those would be good for my flexibility, strength and balance.  Depending on how the instructor does the class, it could help my blood pressure.  But do I want to get out of bed at 5:00 am for a 6:00 am class?Then again, even if I just do the weight circuit, I still need to plan a regular workout time into my weekly schedule.  I\u2019m too tired at the end of my work day, and studies will occupy my evening time. Can I get to sleep early enough for morning workouts?  Would there be enough time for a wardrobe change and driving to work?  Time will tell.  Because right now it\u2019s winter, which means no gardening exercise.  I need those benefits for my overall health.  Plus, anything that would help the insomnia or headaches would be grand.It\u2019s time I get more active, and get more proactive about improving my health.~~#~~Ooh-ooh!

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t25 December 2007", "body": "Amidst all the shopping and cooking and driving out to fetch people and trips to the market and other sundry holiday activities, there are a few quiet spots in my holidays.  I recently made a Clove-Orange, a sweet-smelling object sometimes used to scent closets or wardrobes. The fruit eventually dries out, leaving the cloves stuck in a leathery-hard sphere.  If kept someplace dry, it will remain in this fragrant condition for months on end.It\u2019s a simple task to stick whole spice cloves into an orange (or in this case, a Clementine) if first one uses a thin tool to pierce the skin of the fruit.  I usually use a pointy Japanese chopstick (hashi, pictured) but one could also use a darning needle.  The purpose is to just pierce the skin, not impale the fruit, to more easily plug in the cloves without them crumbling.  Naturally, I like to line up my cloves, but they may be placed in any pattern.  The finished orange can be tied up with a ribbon to be hung up, if desired.I find the activity to be very calming, and a lovely sensory experience.  I\u2019ve done it as a horticulture-therapy activity with students as well.  It\u2019s one of the few crafts that doesn\u2019t worsen for having been forgotten in a locker for a few days.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t27 December 2007 ", "body": "Again.A short news item caught my attention today. Unfortunately, it looks like a fabulous example of bad science, with lousy sampling methods, correllation trying to equal causality, and a heavy dose of confirmation bias.  Add in a big dose of well-connected media personalities, and it\u2019s absolute chum-bucket for indiscriminate news sharks.Dr Lawrence Rosen thinks there is probably some kind of \u201cenvironmental problem\u201d causing an \u201cautism cluster around St. Anthony\u2019s school in Northvale\u201d, New Jersey.  Why is that?  \u201cThe initial study included interviews with 24 current or former school employees who had children after working at the school. Their 42 offspring included 24 with developmental disorders \u2014 and 10 of them have autism.\u201dOh, and \u201cThe school serves children with autism and other learning disabilities.\u201d  Are we not surprised. ( /dry humor )\nSaying that something around the school \u201ccauses\u201d large numbers of autistics (et cetera) is like saying that swimming pools \u201ccause\u201d large numbers of bikinis.  This is a good example of poor  incidence / prevalence surveying \u2014 the numbers cited were from an informal poll taken from a few staff members\u2019 recollections,  not an exhaustive one that looked at the entire population over time.  It\u2019s all too easy to get bias from a small, self-selecting sample group especially when using post-hoc data, because of confirmation bias in the memories of people who have reinforced each other\u2019s perceived patterns.  (For better or for worse, the human brain is prone to seeing patterns that aren\u2019t there, and we better remember things that reinforce and confirm our biases.)It is also a good example of aggregation by niche availability. Firstly, there is a great demand for schools that specialise in autism and other disorders, so people who have the means to do so will move to areas that provide such.  It\u2019s has been found by demographic analyses that there are areas in the country that have higher ratios of special education (SpEd) students because they offer more services for them. (I would love to see a GIS analysis of this.) On her Autism Vox blog, Kristina Chew PhD points out that Bergen County, where the school is located, is one such area. The biotic and abiotic factors of the area don\u2019t necessarily cause the higher incidence rates, any more than larger numbers of medical-supply companies \u201ccause\u201d higher levels of retirees to be in need of disability aids!  When they are able to do so, consumers and suppliers will naturally concentrate in geographic areas; suppliers move to where consumers are, and when suppliers  are immobile (such as schools) then those who need them will move. This is a well-understood phenomenon; ecologists refer to these resource areas where populations collect as sinks. Secondly, a lot of people who get into the work world of special education have particular issues themselves, or have family members with similar issues.  (They are often the better sort of SpEd professionals.)  So the sampling group here may have a biased gene pool for quirks. Additionally, when it was still open, St Anthony\u2019s school was a specialist school, so likely its staff would have been composed of higher numbers SpEd teachers  and SpEd professionals, rather than normal teachers.  This also biases the sampling group, weighing it with a particular subset of the education population.Unfortunately, Rosen appears to be looking for evidence that will fit the hypothesis, rather trying to disprove the hypothesis, as is properly done in research.Looking up Rosen, we find that he specialises the altie fringe of medicine, giving talks about the \u201cintegrative\u201d treatment of autism and decrying the role of toxic autism-causing mercury in vaccines.  According to the article, Rosen is \u201cmedical adviser at the Deirdre Imus Environmental Center for Pediatric Oncology\u201d.  So what is the D.I.E.C.P.O. (more correctly known as the Dienviro)?  Why, it\u2019s one of the organisations that flogs the \u201cdon\u2019t vaccinate \u2014 mercury causes autism\u201d nonsense.  If you\u2019re not familiar with her name, Dierdre Imus is married to radio shock-jock Don Imus, she writes articles for the Huffington Post with her company selling media hype about environmental toxins, and the company also sells \u201cgreen\u201d cleaning products.  (Remember, the key to marketing is to create consumer need: convince your buyers that they are using toxic materials and therefore could be contributing to any number of disorders and diseases.)  Because of her autism = mercury poisoning views, she is also on the board of directors for the National Autism Association: \u201cDeirdre Imus is a leading advocate for children affected by autism. Her efforts have been instrumental in broadening public knowledge of the link between toxic exposures and the development of autism spectrum disorders,\u201d said Rita Shreffler, executive director of the National Autism Association (NAA). The mission of the NAA is to educate and empower families affected by autism and other neurological disorders, while advocating on behalf of those who cannot fight for their own rights.\u201c\u2026 on behalf of those who cannot fight for their own rights\u201d?  Apparently people are ignoring advocacy efforts, like the recent petition by no less than 22 different disability rights organisations that helped halt the \u201cransom notes\u201d campaign. If you can convince the public that children-with-autism are the focus, and ignore the fact that they grow up into autistic adults with their own opinions and abilities to communicate them to the world, then no one will bother to look for other opinions.Meanwhile, this \u201cnews\u201d item is actually one of those little press releases meant to set the stage for further media follow-up.  The news industry is always on the lookout for heart-string tugging events, and numbers of (relatively dry) research studies in various countries disproving the mercury-autism hypothesis just don\u2019t have the newsy sex-appeal of well-connected personalities who can deliver \u201cshocking\u201d quotes while selling their particular \u201ccures\u201d to the problem.Sadly, we live in a post-enlightenment era when \u201ctruthiness\u201d and exciting sound-bites outweigh good science.  It\u2019s all too easy to make money from pathos generated by decrying the \u201chorrible\u201d issues of \u201cafflicted\u201d children, rather than lessening the stigmas of disability, or providing any real improvements in education or social supports.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071226/UPDATES01/71226003/-1/RSS", "http://northjersey.com/page.php?qstr=eXJpcnk3ZjcxN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXkzJmZnYmVsN2Y3dnFlZUVFeXk3MTU1MDc3", "http://www.autismvox.com/about-northvale-nj-and-autism/", "http://www.dienviro.com/index1.aspx?BD=18700", "http://www.dienviro.com/index1.aspx?BD=18455", "http://www.autisticadvocacy.org/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=23"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/12/27/epidemiology-bass-ackwards/", "title": "Epidemiology Bass-Ackwards"},

From the AfriKids Web site, they explain:\u2026 a child born with deformities or defining characteristics in the area was considered a \u2018spirit child\u2018 who must therefore not be allowed to live with humans, for fear they will bring bad luck into the lives of the family. Such children, the paper gathered, were subjected to various forms of inhumane treatment aimed at terminating their lives.\n To prove their innocence, the deformed infants are given deadly locally prepared concoctions, which the people believe can only kill \u2018spirit children\u2019.The practice has been with the people for ages. Until the interventions of some NGOs including Afrikids, the people in the area generally accepted the practice as a traditional norm, which should be conserved and continued.There are a number of reasons why a child may be born with various deformities, including random genetic chance, maternal malnutrition, and diseases such as polio or rubella.  Of course, polio and rubella can be prevented by vaccination.  Other news in recent years included Nigeria, where polio vaccines were strongly resisted by local authorities (this article from New Scientist, 18 November 2003):Laboratory tests by Nigerian scientists have dismissed accusations that the polio vaccine given in a mass immunisation campaign in the country is contaminated with anti-fertility hormones and HIV.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) drive to rid the world of polio hit a major obstacle in October when immunisations were suspended in three regions in northern Nigeria due to rumours that the vaccine was laced with the HIV virus and hormones to render women infertile.\nSome Islamic clerics suggested the vaccine is part of a Western plot to depopulate Africa. However, test results from experts recruited by the Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria gave the all-clear on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe vaccine is free of any anti-fertility agents or dangerous disease like HIV,\u201d said Abdulmumini Rafindadi, at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital in Zaria, according to the Nigerian newspaper The Guardian.But before you start getting cocky from your ethnocentric place in some Westernised, \u201cfirst-world\u201d country, stop and remember:  superstition isn\u2019t just for the illiterate third-world masses. Cloaked in modern pseudo-science or religious devotion, it\u2019s enabling our neighbors to abuse and kill children.Consider Amy Burney, a five-year old girl from the Bronx (New York City) who was poisoned in April 1997:Convinced that the child was possessed by demons, Angelee Burney and Ms. Downing forced her to drink a toxic brew of ammonia, pepper, vinegar and olive oil, the police said. The women wrapped her body in a floral sheet and tossed it in the garbage bin outside their apartment building in the Kingsbridge section, the police said.Consider Terrance Cottrell, an eight-year old autistic boy from Milwaukee who was suffocated during an exorcism.When Junior arrived at the Faith Temple Church he was asked by the minister to lie on the floor. The boy\u2019s trainers were removed to lesson the blows of his kicks. Sheets were also wrapped around him to stop him scratching. During the \u201cprayer\u201d service, Hemphill reportedly used one hand to hold Junior\u2019s head to the floor and one knee to press down on to the boy\u2019s chest. Cooper, meanwhile, held one of Junior\u2019s feet while Tolefree held the other. Another woman, Monica Carver, was lying across the boy\u2019s chest. All the while, Hemphill whispered into Junior\u2019s ear, ordering the demons to leave him. Junior apparently struggled throughout, with Cooper and Tolefree occasionally losing grip of the boy\u2019s feet and the 157lb Hemphill having to bring Junior forcefully under control.\nIt was only after two hours, however, that the adults noticed Junior was blue in the face, soaked in his own urine and not breathing. When Hemphill heaved himself up, both he and the boy were drenched with sweat. But the boy\u2019s body was lifeless.Or an un-named 14-year old autistic boy who was severely beaten during an eleven-hour exorcism during August of this year.Police say the exorcism turned violent and that Uyesugi, under the guise of \u2018God\u2019s work\u2019, battered and beat the boy.\n\u201cSticking fingers into the boy\u2019s mouth while he was restrained on the bed, causing him to vomit. And this happened several times. Family said that Mr. Uyesugi told them this was to cast the demons out,\u201d said Detective Swain.\nPolice say Uyesugi also punched the autistic teen in the face during the ritualistic beating that lasted for eleven hours.And of course, there are plenty of well-intentioned but misguided parents in the US and UK who refuse to get their children vaccinated for fear they might \u201ccatch autistic\u201d, thus allowing the recent outbreaks of measles and mumps, and the resulting disabilities and deaths as described in this previous post.Oh sure, we\u2019re all intelligent, well-educated peoples.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t14 October 2007", "body": "I went in to get my driver\u2019s license renewed.  Part of that ended up getting my name entered correctly into the system; convolutions on my name seem to follow me everywhere!  And of course, there\u2019s always the ordeal of  smiling for the photograph.  This involves a story in two parts.No one looks good in their identification photos, or at least that\u2019s the impression I get from hearing people\u2019s comments.  They complain that the picture \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like\u201d them.  Sometimes people feel compelled to pull out their new license or employer ID tag or school ID card and show it to me, which leads me to shake my head sympathetically and say something blandly supportive, like, \u201cYeah, what can you do!\u201dTruth be told, I can\u2019t really recognise people from their ID pictures.  I don\u2019t even think that the pictures look necessarily lousy, aside from obvious annoyances like having a \u201cbad hair day\u201d, crooked clothing, or less-than-steller compositional framing. True, identification photos always have that flat, full-front angle that removes distinctive profiles, and the artificial lighting saps the natural color from most everyone\u2019s skin tones.  I\u2019m sure those are some of the reasons why people don\u2019t like their ID photos.But one part that I\u2019m missing is the, \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like me\u201d.  I don\u2019t know what gestalt of features most people use to identify each other. Oh, I know intellectually it involves the face, the whole hair-eyes-nose-mouth-chin-ears business.  But the features I use to identify people, their voice and gait and overall body shape and side profile and hair style and frequently-worn clothing, are not represented well (if at all) in still photographs.  I can match up isolated facial parts and say, \u201cThat\u2019s the same nose shape in both of those pictures\u201d \u2014 this is how I can identify a few politicians, such as Richard M. Nixon.   I just can\u2019t draw the same connections other people do between radically different photographs of the same person with different hairstyles or at different ages, and cannot readily pick out a specific individual in group shots.Being able to match a single feature doesn\u2019t help me; in fact, it actually gets me into \u201ctrouble\u201d.  People will be showing me photographs of someone with whom I am not extremely familiar.  \u201cOh, he looks like Harrison Ford!\u201d I exclaim, pulling a rare and tenuous facial identification link between the photograph I\u2019m being shown, and one of the very few actors whom I can identify some of the time.  This of course prompts immediate denials from everyone, because their friend in the photograph \u201clooks nothing at all\u201d like Harrison Ford.  I made that connection because their friend\u2019s eyes had the same crinkles around the cheeks that Ford\u2019s do (or, did through his 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, which are the limits of my identification span for the actor).  Then in the next photo I mistake their friend\u2019s father for him, because they share that one similarity of feature at the same age.  Nevermind that the friend is 43 in the first photo, and was 21 in this second photo of him and his dad.  I can\u2019t tell that the 21 year old and the 43 year old are the same person \u2014 there are too many surface changes, and I don\u2019t get that mysterious personal je ne sais quoi that distinguishes one person\u2019s face throughout their life.Once I am very familiar with a group of people from having been around them a long time, I can use a sort of mental flow-chart to sort out who\u2019s who, such as in a departmental group photo. But even then, I am distinguishing between knowns, playing an elaborate mental game of \u201cMatching\u201d because I know the names from mental column A have a one-to-one correspondence with the bodies in illustration set B.  When looking at a group photo of professors from a previous decade, I had to rely on projecting probable changes in hairlines, and looked for small structural irregularities to make what few guesses I could.Unfortunately, some people mistake \u201cbeing able to distinguish between knowns within a set\u201d with \u201cbeing able to recognise between a set of knowns and a set of unknowns\u201d.  It\u2019s been suggested to me that I could learn my students\u2019 names more quickly by studying their pictures from the school\u2019s ID database.  Well, I can pick out maybe two or three live bodies sitting in the room when comparing them to the school ID photos on the class seating chart, but that\u2019s only because they are physical outliers from the mean \u2014 there are two dark-skinned students, one of whom is quite small and one of whom is very large, and I can pick out one Hispanic girl from several because she has a mole near her eyebrows (or maybe she\u2019s an South Asian girl with a bindi; I would have to investigate more closely).As for the rest of the students, they are as yet well, not quite indistinguishable but definitely un-distinguished, a monoculture of white middle-class teens.  (Sometimes I can\u2019t even easily distinguish males from females if they have shoulder-length hair and are wearing baggy hoodies.)   It takes being around a person for a few weeks to build up my own gestalt of distinguishing characteristics, and then after doing that I have to make that mental link between the name (which I have learned independently from reading it days before) with that mental \u201cflavor\u201d the person creates in my memory.  Even so, because I have to consciously identify people (instead of quickly and unconsciously recognising them), I\u2019m not good at automatically naming someone, especially if there are other things filling my working memory buffer, like trying to follow and understand one voice among many, or mentally recording a sequence of events.Even given that seating chart, I\u2019m still using process of elimination to figure out who\u2019s who in the classroom; having those named photos doesn\u2019t do me any good when I\u2019m watching hundreds of students swarm through the hallways, because I cannot recognise (much less find) which ones are \u201cmy\u201d students.  It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t get to know my students as individual people; I learn their personal interests and educational needs and names rather well.  It\u2019s just the lifelong difficulty in hooking up those mental databases with their faces!  Unfortunately, I\u2019ve yet to come up with a quick, polite, and reassuring way of explaining that, \u201cI know who \u2018you\u2019 are as an individual, I just don\u2019t easily recognise that this body in front of me is that same \u2018you\u2019.\u201d  In the vernacular, \u201crecognising\u201d someone automatically means know that a face is familiar, and which personal dataset goes with that face.  People understand not always remembering the name, but they don\u2019t understand the disparity between knowing the person and knowing the face.When I get my own ID photo taken, I don\u2019t really worry about how good the photo looks, or if it \u201clooks like me\u201d.  Instead, my goal is to get a photo that appears somewhat friendly or happy-looking to others, rather than one that resembles a police \u201cmug shot\u201d.Thanks to the good advice of some coworkers, I\u2019d gone to a license station when it wasn\u2019t crowded.  It was in fact, so un-crowded that there was only one person ahead of me in the first queue.  (Being a state bureaucratic office, there were of course separate queues for every conceivable step, including a basic vision test, paying the fee, filling out the written exam, and getting the photograph taken.)  This meant that by my final stop, the photographer was getting bored and chatty, and was more inclined to be helpful since there wasn\u2019t a pileup of impatient people bookending me.\u201cOh, you weren\u2019t smiling in that picture, do you want to take it again?\u201d she asked, pointing to her monitor where the image was displayed.\u201cI felt like I was smiling \u2026\u201d I offered, remembering the well-rehearsed steps I had carefully taken.  As a child I had stood before the bathroom mirror, playing games with the person on the other side as I matched up the expressive effects seen on the silent girl, with my self-conscious proprioception.  To \u201csmile for the camera\u201d I needed to widen lips, contract cheeks to the point of crinkling the corners of the eyes, look at the camera lens.  I\u2019d long since given up on trying to make a \u201cbig smile\u201d for portraits, as the artificial grin ended up lopsided and generally showing off more gumline than teeth.  I assured her that the photo looked fine.  After all, my hair wasn\u2019t out of place, and I didn\u2019t have that surly stare found in the \u201cWanted by FBI\u201d posters.I\u2019ve always had trouble smiling for pictures.  There were several years of early school photographs where I had a serious expression, which invariable made my mother annoyed at me because I wasn\u2019t producing the sorts of cute pictures she wanted for showing off to people.  Then no sooner did I figure out how to do the \u201csmile for the camera\u201d response, when I entered the preteen \u201cugly duckling\u201d stage, and past that was the orthodonture stage where smiling was awkward if not sometimes painful.  Some of us are just not naturally photogenic.  I feel like I\u2019m smiling; my face is relaxed, eyes are bright, cheeks are rounded.  But apparently the smile is subtle, or there\u2019s some other bit of posture missing.It\u2019s not just that the \u201cbig smile\u201d is missing from photographs, it\u2019s also that people don\u2019t always recognise when I am smiling naturally, or am feeling happy.  Usually it\u2019s obvious when I\u2019m happy; I\u2019m animated and grin and laugh.  But sometimes my moods are entirely mistaken; I can be contentedly concentrating on something I\u2019m doing, and people think I\u2019m mad or upset.  These misinterpretations by others have produced confusion, and sometimes frustrated discussions between myself and my family, or myself and my husband.Maybe it\u2019s the intensity of the focus that gives them that impression, or maybe I\u2019m lacking some kind of nonverbal communication, or am giving off different cues.  I don\u2019t know.   Certainly I lack the awareness of just what it is that I am doing differently, be it not-doing or doing-instead. Even when watching videos of myself, the differences are not apparent to me.  Of course, I remember what I\u2019m feeling or doing when I watch those videos, so I can\u2019t really observe myself with full objectivity. Plus, even if I lacked those memories, there\u2019s no guarantee that I would interpret myself the same as others do.  Interestingly, I have read similar comments by autistics who have also had their moods misinterpreted, or who have also had difficulty producing the \u201cappropriate\u201d face upon that familiar command, \u201cSmile!\u201d", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/14/smile/", "title": "\u201cSmile!\u201d"},

My HRT was also dropped for the same reason, so I\u2019ve not had a good night\u2019s sleep the past month due to frequent hot flashes.  Kinda sucks, but life goes on.Then I\u2019m slowly flapping my left arm, trying to get it into my left jacket sleeve, which is absurd because normally I can reach my arm around backwards so much that I can even scratch my own back. But I\u2019m stiff in the morning, and hubby reaches over to help me get my jacket on.  I realise with great annoyance that this is a \u201ctell\u201d, a very visible sign of impediment.  In a couple of hours I\u2019ll be working normally, but not yet.  All life is change, and we all have things to cope with, but some signs are bigger landmarks in the psyche than are others.  This one I find annoying, maybe because it\u2019s so stereotypical.Mornings are not a great time for me; I\u2019m really a late-night person.  It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not functional in the morning \u2014 I can do all kinds of tasks.  It\u2019s just that the planning and talking parts of my brain are slower to get up to running speed.  I\u2019m not good at remembering to do things that I don\u2019t normally do in the morning, and sometimes forget even the things that I do usually do (like um, taking my ADHD medication).  I\u2019m not chatty, and have zero interest in discussing articles in the newspaper.Planning and choosing things is too much in the morning.  So I\u2019ve learned to pick out my clothes the night before, all the way down to the underwear and socks.  Even if I don\u2019t actually pack my lunch the night before, I still figure out what I\u2019m going to take, and will sometimes leave a nonperishable ingredient on the counter to jog my memory.So morning\u2019s aren\u2019t great.  But now I\u2019m struggling to master the dainty zipper-pull on a skirt, or tie my boot laces, or pull on my jacket.  Surprisingly, buttons are still okay.  But even so, I\u2019m just dressing more slowly.  And after a week of getting to my first school just barely on time or a couple minutes late, I realise that this has turned into a trend, and that I must re-configure my morning schedule.I need to allow myself a quarter hour more to get ready.  That\u2019s not a lot, really.  But it makes the difference between running perpetually almost-late and getting there in plenty of time.  So I need to haul myself out of bed just a wee bit earlier.  Nevermind that I\u2019m more tired since my sleep is lousy.  Okay, I should in turn go to bed an hour earlier to see if I can\u2019t make up for that a bit.  Better creaky than cranky.Things change, so I must adapt.  Again.  Notice a trend, identify a problem, find a way to work around it.    Mustn\u2019t grouse, and all that.::sigh::", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/19/time-to-get-dressed/", "title": "Time to get\u00a0dressed"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t17 October 2007", "body": "Just one of my students.  I heard that he didn\u2019t come to school today because he\u2019s not up on all of his vaccinations.  I don\u2019t know if that is something intentional by his family, but I kinda doubt it \u2014 he\u2019s in high school, which means he\u2019s had years of previous vaccinations accounted for.  Probably people got busy and forgot to take him in to the doctor or the county clinic to get whatever\u2019s due at his age.Like other school districts in the state, this one requires that the students be fully vaccinated per the list issued by the state health department.  There\u2019s a 60-day period after the beginning of the school year for students to get caught up, and after that date, students don\u2019t get to attend until they\u2019ve done so.   (There is also an exception clause allowed by the state, requiring that abstaining parents or guardians to provide a medical exemption signed by a MD/DO every year, and they sign a religious exemption. Note that the doctor has to be an actual physician, and that the child is getting regular medical attention, to help insure some baseline of health monitoring. Note also that the parent also has to claim exemption for religious reasons, not just because they think that vaccines might be more dangerous than the long list of highly infectious and sometimes debilitating or deadly diseases.)So naturally, my children have had their various vaccinations over the years.  In recent years I\u2019ve also had the MMR, at the tender age of 45. Why? Because a bunch of fools in the UK and the US haven\u2019t vaccinated, thus allowing mumps and measles epidemics to happen. I\u2019m old enough to not have had the MMR because it didn\u2019t exist when I was a tot, nor did I get the Mumps naturally. Because I work in several secondary schools and a college, I\u2019m very much exposed to large populations of potentially infectious students. (I\u2019ve also recently finished the HepB series, and also get my tetanus booster every decade, and the annual flu shot.)Keeping the general population free of these preventable diseases is important not just at the individual level, but also to help prevent the transmission.  This is important to help maintain \u201cherd immunity\u201d, because there are those few ultra-devout religious people who abstain from vaccinations, because there are a few people with severely compromised immune systems who cannot receive vaccinations, and also because no vaccine is 100% effective (there are a few recipients who don\u2019t retain antibodies).  Generally, if 85% of the population has been vaccinated for a particular disease, then there\u2019s enough resistance in the general population to create the necessary \u201cfirebreak\u201d and prevent these highly contagious diseases from being spread.Those epidemics didn\u2019t have to happen.  People did not have to die.  Yes, DIE.  Because mumps and measles are not harmless childhood diseases, mere spotty versions of the common cold.  A lot of those diseases that we vaccinate to prevent killed or disabled people.  But due to the foolish MMR scare, vaccination rates dropped, with only 50% of the children in some parts of the UK.  As a result, there were epidemics of measles and mumps in the UK, and a subsequent epidemic of mumps in the US.Unfortunately, people forget how severe such diseases can be:  The real victims of Britain\u2019s MMR scare\u201cThese children are the other side of the coin,\u201d said MacMahon. \u201cPeople need to realise that if their children are not vaccinated and they get measles, they might not only be sick and miserable. They can get pneumonia, they can get encephalitis and they can die.\u201dTwo boys, who could not get the MMR vaccine because they had received organ transplants, became disabled due to measles:Although both children survived, they have been left with lasting damage.\nJoe, who was discharged from hospital at the end of August, is unlikely to regain the full use of his left leg and has partial paralysis of his tongue and throat.\nMatthew, who was not discharged from hospital until December 21, is more severely disabled. His optic nerves were permanently scarred by the virus and he is now registered blind.\nHe is also virtually confined to a wheelchair and has had to drop out of his mainstream school. Karen said: \u201cBefore he had measles, he could go out, he could play football, he could do what he wanted.Measles can also kill:Naomi Pop, just 14 months old, was among the victims. Her mother, Maria, 20, was not unduly worried when Naomi contracted measles just four weeks before she was due to have the triple jab. She said: \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Measles, so what?\u2019 I mean, how bad could that be?\u201d\nWithin a few days Naomi had developed acute pneumonia. It took a year for her to die. She suffered several infections and progressive brain damage and finally died on March 14, 2001.Measles, Mumps and Rubella should be as extinct as Smallpox. I would love to have to explain  to young people what these diseases were, just as I do my Smallpox vaccination scar.  Hopefully my missing student will be back in class tomorrow or the next day.AN UPDATE to this post.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t18 October 2007 ", "body": "Back in another lifetime, I did clerical work downtown in the Big City.  One day the gal at the desk next to me came back from her lunch break and she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a crazy woman down on the corner just standing there picking at the air.\u201dI thought this description to be odd, but Helen couldn\u2019t really explain further.  Full of \u2018satiable curiosity, I decided to take my lunch at a nearby taco stand just past that corner. At first I couldn\u2019t figure out who my coworker was talking about; there was just the usual crowd of professional, retired, and miscellaneous people hanging around the bus stop.  So I bought a three-pack of tacos, and stood out on the sidewalk to munch them and watch the crowd.A few minutes later I finally figured out which person was the \u201ccrazy woman\u201d that Helen had referred to.  There was a young adult standing there in a rather nondescript frock and crocheted hat, with a white walking-stick in one hand.  She was standing at the bus stop, finger-spelling in the air in front of her face.Oh, I thought to myself, she\u2019s Deaf and signing to someone.  Then I realised that she had a white walking stick, and not only wasn\u2019t looking at anyone, but her eyes were half-shut.  Oh, she\u2019s blind, too, I thought to myself.  So why would she be finger-spelling in the air?  I pondered that as I went back to the office, my short lunch break nearing an end. Maybe she was just thinking out loud \u2026  I then realised that I\u2019d just muttered that statement aloud to myself, and blushed self-consciously.\u201cShe\u2019s not a \u2018crazy person\u2019,\u201d I explained to Helen upon my return, \u201cShe wasn\u2019t \u2018picking at the air\u2019, she was finger-spelling in sign language.\u201d  I asked my coworker if she hadn\u2019t seen people signing before?  No, Helen replied.  I reassured my coworker that the woman didn\u2019t look crazy to me.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know \u2026\u201d she answered, one of those phrases I had come to learn that meant she was done discussing something, without any change in her views but hesitant to express outright disagreement.I sighed and went back to my endless pile of work.  Finally 4:30 came around, and I clocked out, then returned to the corner to wait for my own bus.  I sat on the bench, thinking about my day, sometimes muttering a few words softly to myself.\u201cCrazy people.\u201d  Whenever someone appears on the scene who\u2019s different and not understood, they became a Crazy Person.   Relegated to the fringe of humanity, and talked about in disparaging terms.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 October 2007", "body": "It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve posted any insect photos.  But it\u2019s autumn, which means that the Monarchs Are On The Move.  A couple of weeks ago I came home and was walking up to the front door when I passed the pair of butterfly bushes (Buddleia davidii) and noticed a rather runty-looking Monarch nectaring.Then I did a double-take, and thought to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s not a Monarch \u2014 THAT\u2019S A VICEROY!\u201d  (This was one of those odd times when I mentally caption dialog, even the all-caps.)  I dashed back to my car to grab my camera, as I didn\u2019t have a photograph of this particular butterfly yet.The Viceroy (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae Basilarchia archippus) looks very similar to the Monarch:  it\u2019s an orange butterfly with a black body, black margins the wings, and a few white spots in the margins.  However, its wingspan is smaller (about 3 inches / 80 mm), and the hindwings have a thin stripe running parallel to the outer margin.For comparison, here\u2019s a photo of a nearby New England Aster (Aster novi-angliae) with a Monarch (Lepidoptera: Danaidae Danaus plexippus).  The wingspan of this butterfly is about 4 inches / 100 mm. Of course the Monarch is famous for it\u2019s transcontinental migrations.  The butterflies heading south to over-winter in Mexico are not those which came up this spring, but rather are their grandchildren or great-grandchildren.  In other words, these particular butterflies are migrating to a place where they have never been.  Monarchs & Viceroys are also a famous example of \u201cBatesian Mimicry\u201d.  Monarch caterpillars eat milkweeds, and retain the icky poisons in the milky sap of the plants.  If a bird or some other animal eats a Monarch, it\u2019s likely to soon throw up, and the bird learns that those orange and black butterflies are nasty!  (Of course, that individual butterfly is now history, but its brethren gain some protection from the bird\u2019s learning experience.) The Viceroy catepillars generally eat willow and poplar leaves, so the butterflies don\u2019t have the poisons that would cause such a strong reaction.  But the butterflies look similar enough that the Viceroys gain this protection by mimicking Monarchs.  Interestingly, we now find that some Viceroy caterpillars do include milkweeds in their diet, which only reinforces the predators\u2019 response to the mimicry.The New England Aster is a meter-high late-blooming perennial.  As a garden specimen, it\u2019s less-than-stellar for its gangly, leggy growth, somewhat floppy habit, and propensity to seed volunteers.  As a wildlife habitat resources, it\u2019s fabulous for providing late-season nectar, and mine are always draped in numbers of Monarchs when they make a refuelling stop.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/20/movers-and-fakers/", "title": "Movers and Fakers"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 October 2007", "body": "A few weeks ago I was teaching one of my gardening classes when a student came up to me during break and identified herself to me again.  I\u2019d already taken roll at the beginning of class by way of having the students tell me their names, as no one ever mispronounces their own name.  Despite having heard her say her name and also seeing in print where I\u2019d checked it on my roster, I hadn\u2019t made that connection.I know her.  Or, knew her \u2014 we\u2019d had a class together about eight years ago.  Once she pointed that out, I recognised the name as being familiar, and excused myself by way of saying that I\u2019m really bad at remembering faces.  We asked each other polite little questions about what the other was doing now, and then break time was over and I diverted my attention back to teaching.Every day for a semester, we\u2019d sat together at the same lab table.  During a school semester, I will generally learn to identify a student or two.  A handful of other students will be familiar upon seeing them in the classroom, or out in the hallway studying before class.  The teacher I will remember after the semester, at least for several months afterwards.But people who don\u2019t repeat during my lifetime will fade from my ability to identify them.The ordinary person might not be surprised that it\u2019s hard to recognise the once-a-year people.  I see my departmental secretary maybe twice a year, as I only teach after business hours.  I don\u2019t know who she is when I see her any more than I know who my ophthamologist is, except for the fact that I expect to meet someone matching a couple of the vaguest identifiers when I am in their respective offices.It\u2019s the people who were regular satellites in my days, whom I saw for months on end, that everyone assumes I \u201cought\u201d to be able to remember.  And I do remember that there were such people in my life.  Given a couple minutes, I can usually dredge up a name from memory.  But no matter how many hours I spent with them for a few days a week, these people are more like comets than distant moons in the solar system of my life.  They exist in the firmament, bright and notable for a period of time, then disappear from view and fade away.A great portion of the inability to know these people later on is that one of my main mental crutches for identifying people, that large portion of the \u201clikelihood set\u201d for meeting someone, is the location.  Once the class is over, once I am no longer working for that company, once I no longer attend meetings at that same time and place, I don\u2019t have that necessary cue for distinguishing between the people whom I expected to see there.Even then, I\u2019m often fuzzy on personal details.  I learn to associate names with sets of nonfacial characteristics.  But figuring out who\u2019s who during my first weeks, and then tracking the changes in those identifiers (new haircuts, glasses, major wardrobe changes, weight loss and such) keeps a large portion of my awareness busy.  When you spend time just learning to identify people, there\u2019s less time and energy available for absorbing the personal details that help create interpersonal bonds. These things other people do so easily, so unconsciously, recognising each other, engaging in chit-chat, and following the changing group social dynamics, are things that I do consciously.  Some days I\u2019m too focused on work to spend the extra effort required to puzzle out what\u2019s going on in the \u201csoap opera\u201d side of the business world.The next week one of my students was someone who had attended the same church a couple decades ago.  How in the world do people remember these sheer numbers of individuals they saw briefly once a week, oh so long ago?  Knowing who is who, what they used to do, the details of their personal lives, who they used to work with, their particular skills, and their social connections, all attached to their faces, is just too much. Artificial memory aids don\u2019t help me; it does me no good to collect pictures of people or yearbooks or business cards with photographs as I can\u2019t recognise people from their ID photos.Faceblindness not only makes immediate daily life more difficult; it also plays hell with networking. There are literally hundreds of people out there who know who I am when they meet me again.  But I am adrift, wandering through life surrounded by crowds of effective strangers.  I can hardly keep track of them when I am with them.  When my hubby forwards me newsbits about how a large percentage of jobs are acquired through networking rather than the anonymous process of filling out forms, I can but sigh heartily.  It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about people. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not friendly, or helpful. I get excellent employee reviews. But the sad fact is that I cannot remember masses of people well enough to keep track of them.For the faceblind, networking is all work, and not much net. There\u2019s especially little social \u201csafety net\u201d when one has more \u201cknow-how\u201d than \u201cknow-who\u201d.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/20/rare-sightings/", "title": "Rare sightings"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 October 2007", "body": "I was putting away clean laundry, and unexpectedly found the kid draped across dad\u2019s bed, reading a book.  He looked up at my puzzled expression and explained that he was looking for someplace comfortable and quiet to study.   The kid usually studies at his desk near the living room, but dad had been watching football.  I nodded, \u201cGood plan.  It\u2019s not a good idea to study in the bed where you sleep.\u201dLater on I found the giant mixing bowl, a hand towel, and damp spots on the bathroom floor. I swabbed up the spots, tossed the towel into the laundry basket, and returned the bowl to the kitchen for washing.  Usually the  kid remembers to put the equipment away, but he\u2019d been especially absent-minded today, forgetting  a variety of tasks halfway through.  \u201cAre your feet okay?  Is your toe bothering you again?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d he replied, \u201cI just wanted to soak my feet, and the bathroom is all quiet-like for reading.\u201dI chuckled, definitely understanding that.  \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a lot easier to focus when you\u2019re all by yourself.  I never could study with people around me.  I can even tell you where all the quiet little nooks are at the university library,\u201d I added, putting in a small plug for higher education.\u201cOh, useful!\u201dI\u2019m glad to see the kid settling down to developing better study habits, especially by way of determining what works best for him.  Like many people, sometimes he works on the simplistic kinds of homework by way of multitasking:  listening to music, IMing a friend, and fidgeting around with toys. But as he moves into the more mentally-demanding work, he\u2019s having to develop different methods.Some days it\u2019s really hard to stay focused.  Depending upon the task, some kinds of environments are more conducive than others.  When I was in college dorms, I tried several times to sit out in the lounge area of our floor and study.  But the constant traffic and hallway noises of people chatting with each other and talking on their phones and televisions and music players and everything else made it too difficult to focus.  (That was even supposed to be the \u201cquiet study floor\u201d!)  Some people are happiest with others around.  Instead, I found the presence of others to be not only distracting, but in some ways unnerving.Even big rooms, no matter how socially \u201cquiet\u201d, interfered with my concentration.  The ground floor of the library, with the tables around the perimeter of the periodicals and reference stacks, was unsettling \u2014 there were too many people moving about, and I hated the feeling of someone coming up behind me.  Having my \u201cradar\u201d on meant that much less mental energy, and lessened my ability to become absorbed in the materials.The best sort of reading and thinking room is small, quiet, and isolated.  It doesn\u2019t have to be as spartan as a hermit\u2019s cell, but it does need that sense of being apart, to allow one the mental space to think through things.I\u2019ve been painting walls in order to swap furniture between bedrooms, with the plan of making the smallest bedroom a sort of library, so we can finally get these endless boxes of books into some semblance of order.  The library will also have a good reading chair, lamp, and small table for a teacup and snack.  Best of all, it will be the room furthest away from the living room hub-a-bub, a quiet nook with a door.  If the kid is needing such a place to study, then I\u2019d best get this project finished sooner than later!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/22/a-nook-of-ones-own/", "title": "A Nook of One\u2019s\u00a0Own"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 October 2007 ", "body": "That was the phrase (from some science book of my youth) that came to mind the first time I stepped into a college lecture room with seating for some 200 students.  The room was a broad wedge shape, filled with stadium seating of fixed chairs with small right-handed desktops.  Down at the bottom was the instructor\u2019s desk, a series of chalkboards, and a pull-down projection screen.  Something was written on the chalkboard, but most discouragingly, I couldn\u2019t read it from the back of the room.  That meant I would also likely have trouble understanding the speaker, so I advanced down to the front row. Even moving to the front of the room was awkward (if not physically discouraging) because the terrace effect of the seating meant walking two paces forwards and stepping one down, an unnatural rhythm.In such rooms, some professors would do a lot of writing on the board (usually still lecturing, which meant that they were talking to the board and were even less intelligible), and some profs would just stand there and lecture at us for the entire 50-80 minutes, sometimes writing a few things on the board. Some used slide presentations or overhead projectors, and only a few had moved to PowerPoint to merge the illustrations and text.These were not classes from the 20th century \u2014 this was just a couple years ago.The students around me were often visibly bored.  Well, those that came.  Some of them engaged in napping, with varying levels of discreetness.  A few sat in the back and chatted with or texted friends. A lot of students took notes, or appeared to be doing something on paper.  Few students volunteered questions, and fewer profs actually elicited dialog with and between students \u2014 most who asked questions of the students were just doing so to see if anyone had done the assigned reading.The \u201csage on a stage\u201d backed by those ancient chalk beds is a teaching style that\u2019s over a century-old.  Here\u2019s a very interesting YouTube video,\u2026 summarizing some of the most important characteristics of students today \u2013 how they learn, what they need to learn, their goals, hopes, dreams, what their lives will be like, and what kinds of changes they will experience in their lifetime. Created by Michael Wesch in collaboration with 200 students at Kansas State University.It\u2019s not just a very thought-provoking video \u2014 due to it\u2019s text-driven style, it\u2019s totally \u201copen-captioned\u201d as well!

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t21 October 2007", "body": "So I\u2019ve been painting walls, which is something I actually enjoy doing.  I pace myself, and switch hands frequently to keep from wearing out too fast.  This is the second room of the current painting spree, which means that it\u2019s been nearly a month since I bought the can of paint, along with the other necessary miscellany one ends up getting from a trip to the hardware store.  Before I could start painting the room, I had to spackle in a gazillion holes, because it used to be inhabited by a teenage girl who had naturally put up dozens of posters and postcards and drawings over the years, leaving the walls riddled with push-pin holes in much the same manner that the moon is riddled with craters.That break in time partly explains why I ended up with the wrong color of paint and didn\u2019t notice until I\u2019d applied it to two walls.  I\u2019d already painted the foyer and half the stairwell, and by then was in that Zen mode of peaceful mindless working.  It\u2019s also a similar color to what I\u2019d painted a room in another house, so it seemed familiar in an acceptable way.  Plus, it was really close to one of the colors I\u2019d planned on using.  I was  going to paint most of the walls a creamy 7003-11 Muslin Wrap, and a single wall in a nook a pale turquoise 5003-7A Harbor Mist.The paint that was given to me was a 7005-11 Mint Spritzer.  7005-11 and 7003-11 are very similar numbers, and Mint and Mist are similar names.  Given that I was picking up a bunch of stuff and had spent the paint-mixing time looking over wallpaper border samples, I didn\u2019t notice the mixup.  The store puts a wee dab of paint on the mix-ID sticker on the lid, but one wee dab of pale tint looks like much another wee dab.  The pastel mint is also very similar to the pale turquoise, and it had been long enough since I\u2019d made my color selections that I\u2019d forgotten that the pale green tint was supposed to be the accent, not the main color.Yeah, they gave me the wrong paint.  But custom-tinted paint, like puppies or bathing suits, is a non-returnable item once you\u2019ve taken it home.   And I had not noticed, and had used a fourth of the can before I\u2019d realised that fact.  I\u2019m feeling pissy and annoyed because I got The Wrong Paint Damnit.    It\u2019s not a bad color; like I said, it\u2019s similar to a color I\u2019ve chosen before.  But this mis-tint is like so damn many things in my life, Not what I asked for, Not what I needed, and Not what I was supposed to get.But Oh Well.  Here I am with bedroom walls in the palest of mint greens.  I ran short and picked up a quart to finish off the last wall, and had just enough to cover the inside of the closet as well.  Obviously I can\u2019t use the pale turquoise 5003-7A Harbor Mist for the accent color; it\u2019s too similar, but not in an analogous way \u2014 it would just look like a mis-match.  I suppose it can be used on the walls of my large pantry closet or some such; there\u2019s only a quart of it, so it won\u2019t go far.We all end up with \u201cmis-tints\u201d in our lives. Things that are  Not what we asked for, Not what we needed, and Not what we were supposed to get.  We end up with too many of the wrong sorts of things, and not enough of the right sorts of things.  Such is life.  What matters is what we do with those mis-tints, and how we can reduce or nullify the negatives, and turn the unexpected results into positives.The whole mint ice-cream effect of the bedroom walls is growing on me; there\u2019s nothing as fine as freshly-painted walls, and it\u2019s a cool, restful color.  (Nothing at all like institutional pea green that gives me the heebie-jeebies.)    While I was at the hardware store, I went and examined the color chips. Should I decide to go back and paint the single back wall of the nook in a contrasting color, I found a warm brown 2004-7A Italian Roast.  It\u2019ll be lovely.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/21/mis-tint/", "title": "Mis-tint"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t28 October 2007", "body": "When commenting on a previous post of mine, andreashettle asked,I\u2019m curious: how DO you help students understand the difference between blanket cynicism and healthy, balanced, thoughtful, analytical skepticism?\nI don\u2019t ordinarily teach. I\u2019m in a different field. But I\u2019ve done a little tutoring and teaching in the past. And sometimes I run into a student who has learned something about the concept of \u201cbias\u201d \u2014 and has become so good at spotting potential sources of \u201cbias\u201d that they refuse to believe ANY potential source of information at all, even the ones that are reasonably reliable and trustworthy (or at least, the ones that make an honest attempt to be, or that experts in the field have judged to be good sources). For example, they may reject peer-reviewed academic sources published by universities because of possible \u201cbias\u201d! It was frustrating trying to get through to them that \u201cbias\u201d is not an either/or paradigm \u2014 yes, every source and every author has a certain set of \u201cbiases,\u201d but there are degrees of bias and there are ways to avoid the more blatant sources (say, an advertisement from a company that *of course* wants to make their product look best) while still learning something from the safer sources. And there are ways to intelligently evaluate sources to identify the ones that are trustworthy enough to be used as sources for their research paper or literature review or whatever they\u2019re doing. But for them, there is no distinction: they\u2019re all biased, period.\nI don\u2019t really anticipate being in a teaching situation again, at least not in the near future \u2014 but just in case \u2026 any tips? I\u2019m thinking particularly of students who seem to have very black/white thinking, who don\u2019t seem to be able to parse fine gradations very well, and who also seem to have a tendency to pick a few specific things that some teacher has taught them in the past and cling to them so tightly that they seem incapable of admitting that what they learned could still be refined in some way\u2013or could even be just point-blank wrong.\nThanks!Wow, yeah.  Students who are cynical can indeed be extremely tiresome.  Those who mistake cynicism for skepticism aren\u2019t quite so bad, as they are usually amenable to further education that will broaden their outlook, especially if it\u2019s presented as \u201cmore ways to be clever\u201d.But then we have students like those whom you mention, the jaded, snarky, closed-minded sort who think in absolutes. Blanket cynicism is just intellectual laziness, and someone who is cynical and doubts everything is just as poor at thinking as someone who is gullible and believes everything.  The cynic uses their personal biases instead of critical thinking to reach their conclusions.  A cynic is highly resistant to examining new information and prefers to keep their established opinions, but the skeptic welcomes the opportunity to examine new evidence and is willing to change their understanding.Cynicism often involves a particular kind of dogmatism, a negative view that disbelieves the good intentions or generosity of others, and cynics are frequently self-centered.  As you have observed, they can be inflexible in their thinking \u2014 flexibility would require work from examining, evaluating and possibly reconsidering previous views.  It\u2019s far much easier to decide that a few chosen \u201cfacts\u201d are true, establish a set of biases and preconceptions, and then doggedly try to fit those onto everything they run into.  Naturally, this approach doesn\u2019t work well, and further interpersonal conflicts and tensions result.  There is also a great deal of cognitive dissonance that results, which increases the inner and interpersonal tensions.  Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t easily resolve into the cynic being willing to re-examine their beliefs and accommodate new information.There are very few absolute givens (such as laws of physics).  In real life, most things run on levels of probability.  But saying that something isn\u2019t \u201ctrue\u201d because it cannot be 100% guaranteed to happen all the time under every single circumstance for every single person is simply taking the reductio ad absurdum: \u2026 a type of logical argument where one assumes a claim for the sake of argument, derives an absurd or ridiculous outcome, and then concludes that the original assumption must have been wrong as it led to an absurd result.Sure, everyone has some bias.  However, we can be aware of those, and employ means to help counter them \u2014 this is why scientific experiments use double-blind studies!  We also use large numbers of research subjects to help reduce the variability in the data due to the natural variability in individuals (human or otherwise), plus control groups, random assignment, and so on.  In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s actually rather humorous that the cynic who complains of bias is exhibiting a massive bias of their own \u2026One way to address some of this rigid thinking is to turn the tables around, and ask the student how they would design experiments to assess the validity of an assertion. (Don\u2019t ask them to \u201cprove\u201d something; that just falls back into the trap of absolutes.) Start with facts that they also recognise as being true, and build from there.You might, at other times, avoid the whole argument scenario and explore what sorts of things the student is afraid of, meaning how they have felt that people have \u201clet them down\u201d, and instead of seeking to place blame (which is an easy way out that resolves nothing and just perpetuates the feelings of hurt), ask them what they can do that will provide whatever it is they are lacking, and how they can get that in new situations. It may well be that part of the pain comes from the fact that the student has not been able to identify just what it was they did not get (interpersonally, rather than materially). We can\u2019t fix problems when we don\u2019t know what it is that\u2019s going wrong!Similarly to cynics, societies will revert to their tribal minds when they feel anxious because of high levels of change. Our cultures are partly belief systems about the way we think the world ought to be, and social changes on multiple fronts destabilise that, requiring too many re-evaluations about our concepts. So social groups react to massive social change by becoming more conservative, more isolationist, and more black-and-white in their thinking. The same is true for individuals; the cynic finds that the world is much more multifaceted, amorphous, and complex than they are ready to deal with, and they retract into a defense of trusting no new information.Boiled down to the basics, everyone wants the same things. They want to be recognised for their successes and individual skills, they want to be useful, they want to be helped in a way that respects them, and they need to feel safe and know that they can rely on others.To be skeptics, we have to feel safe enough to explore new things, and to open ourselves up for having our beliefs challenged, and then be able to re-evaluate them.", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/28/skepticism-about-cynics/", "title": "Skepticism about cynics"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t30 October 2007", "body": "I wasn\u2019t kidding. There\u2019s yet another case up that illustrates the reason why we need the ADA Restoration Act:Orr used to close his pharmacy for 30 minutes every day at noon, and eat lunch. That helped him control his diabetes. The new boss ordered him to instead stay in the pharmacy and eat between helping customers. Orr tried, but his blood glucose levels fell. He got tired easily.\n\u201cWhen he came in and fired me,\u201d Orr says, \u201cI asked him why I was being fired and he told me straight out: Because you\u2019re diabetic.\u201d\nWhen Orr was fired, he sued under the Americans with Disabilities Act. But a judge threw out his case, agreeing with Wal-Mart that Orr should not be considered disabled under the ADA. The reason: With his insulin, he could control his diabetes.Um, aren\u2019t employees supposed to have an actual break from work during their lunch breaks?  Doesn\u2019t Wally-World have pharmacy technicians who can run the till for half an hour?Over at her blog, ReunifyGally, andreashettle describes a different case,Carey was living in Georgia and had 20 years of experience working as an electrician when he applied for a better opportunity at a General Motors\u2019 assembly plant in Arlington, Texas. GM offered Carey the job pending completion of a pre-employment physical examination. During that exam, GM\u2019s physician asked Carey to raise his arms above his head. When he saw that Carey could only get his arms to shoulder level, the physician asked how Carey would perform overhead work. Carey, who had performed such work in the past, responded that he would use a ladder. Despite the fact that other electricians in the plant often used ladders or hydraulic lifts to do overhead work, the physician revoked GM\u2019s offer of employment. (48)\nCarey challenged GM\u2019s decision.  Even though GM revoked its job offer because of limitations resulting from Carey\u2019s muscular dystrophy,(49) GM argued that Carey did not have a \u201cdisability\u201d and was not protected by the ADA.(50)As I explained before in my August 23rd post, \u201cMitigating Measures\u201d, you can be considered \u201ctoo disabled\u201d to do the job, but \u201cnot disabled enough\u201d to qualify under the ADA.  This is a direct contradiction of what the original ADA was designed to address, and why we need the ADA Restoration Act.Last time my congressman was in town, I went to visit with him about this issue.  Unfortunately, I was too late in the line and ended up with only the opportunity to hand-write a last-minute note for one of his assistants to pass on to him.  Some days later, I received a letter in reply.  Most of the letter was devoted to describing the purpose and history of the bill, which is nice, but really just so much filler.  (Behold the joys of the word-processing generated modifiable form letter.)  The actual lines of reply read, \u201cPlease be assured of my continued support for programs serving those with disabilities and their families.  Rest assured I will keep your views in mind should I have the opportunity to vote on this measure or similar legislation during the 110th Congress.\u201d\u00a0 Blah-blah-blah \u2026 sadly, even this highly-generic reply doesn\u2019t really say how he plans to vote; so at this point, it doesn\u2019t hardly matter which Congress person the letter was from.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t27 October 2007", "body": "(That\u2019s N for an unspecified number.)Thank goodness I have that extra 15 minutes built into my morning routine, because I needed all of them today.  It was one of those mornings when I\u2019m amazed that I got out the door and where I\u2019m going without having achieved some minor catastrophe.  The whole ADHD routine would be quite comical were it not so damn typical.Of course, there are a few people who \u201cdon\u2019t believe in\u201d AD/HD.  And there are people who believe that it exists, but can\u2019t quite get their brains wrapped around the whole How and Why of it.  You know, What could possibly be so hard about something as straightforward as getting dressed, eating breakfast, and driving off to work? Well, it\u2019s like this:I wake up, for the umpteenth time.  This isn\u2019t really part of the ADHD, but is reflective of crappy sleep due to hot flashes, combined with the fact that I\u2019m one of those rare people who doesn\u2019t need an alarm clock because I\u2019ve one in my head.  (That only sounds great until you realise that it means I get jetlag something dretful.)  I\u2019ve a headache because I forgot to wear my TMJ biteguard last night, plus, my joints ache.  It\u2019s hard to get out of bed, but after a while I have another hot flash, which is my cue to roll out of bed and get dressed before I get cold again.  Toilet, deodorant, wash face \u2014 ooh, I\u2019m having a rare case of \u201cbed head\u201d and need to wash my hair this morning, despite having washed it last night.  I return to the bedroom for my bath towel, which I\u2019d left behind on the rocking chair last time instead of hanging it back up in the bathroom.Once I return to the bedroom, I realise I forgot to get my clothes sorted out the night before.  I did remember to iron shirts then (finally, four days later on Thursday, tho\u2019 Sunday would have been a better time), so I decide to wear a nice button-down shirt and jeans.  Damn, I forgot to wash the laundry last night \u2014 I could have pulled those jeans from the basket and worn them again another day, except some soggy kitchen washrags were dumped on them, ditto smelly socks.  That nixes the jeans idea.I stand in front of the closet, staring at clothes.  On an industrious day I\u2019d actually organised articles into actual clusters for specific outfits, all neatly lined up.  What to wear \u2026 No dresses; just can\u2019t deal with pantyhose today, as my head hurts too much.  Realising that reminds me that I need to eat breakfast soon so I can take some medicine.  It\u2019s going to be cool today, um \u2026 okay, I\u2019ll wear a white turtleneck, plaid skirt and boots.  I remove the sweater and skirt from hangers and toss the clothes onto the bed, making a cat jump off in annoyance.  Rummage around in the dresser, and realise that I can\u2019t find my white bra, and I can\u2019t wear a jog-bra with a turtleneck because it gives me that stupid \u201cuni-boob\u201d effect.  Oh, crap, back to Square One.  Put turtleneck and skirt back on hangers and into closet.  Okay, I\u2019ll wear the black turtleneck and the other plaid skirt.  Find black bra, but can\u2019t find black tights.  Oh for crying-out-loud \u2026 I see a baggy olive-green sweater (jumper) on the shelf, which I wear with a khaki shirt and brown corduroy pants. Rummage through dresser drawer to find once again the jog-bra, and grab panties (knickers) and socks.  Finally I\u2019m dressed.  This is why I pick out clothes the night before.Clothes, check.Doing buttons reminds me that I need to take my meds, which in turn reminds me that I need to eat.  My day is chock-full of these annoying But-Before chain reactions; I can\u2019t just do something, but have to do something else first, and invariably will do the but-before yet forget the thing for which I was doing that antecedant.  I amble stiff-kneed downstairs to the kitchen.Oh thank goodness, I did remember to prep the coffeemaker the night before!  I punch the Start button, and then stare at the pantry for a minute before deciding on a bowl of corn flakes. Before I can set the cereal bowl on the counter corner by the fridge to fetch the milk, I have to move my lunchbag aside.  As a matter of habit, I put the lunchbag in the way (after removing the dirty dishes) as a prompt to myself to put food into it the next morning.  Of course, it\u2019s still half an hour before I have to leave, and I don\u2019t want to let cold food sit out that long (in addition to the commute time), so I say aloud to myself, \u201cI need to pack my lunch when I come back downstairs.\u201d  I grab a spoon and the bowl of cereal and start to head back upstairs to eat at my computer, when I realise that I forgot my coffee.  Do a U-turn and pour coffee.  Fetching the vanilla soymilk for the coffee makes me realise that I\u2019m already running behind in my morning schedule, so I\u2019d better get my lunch food packaged.  I find a lidded bowl, scoop up some soup, and then set a carton of yogurt atop the soup lid so I don\u2019t forget it.  Feeling clever, I shut the refrigerator door on my packaged food, and then notice that the vanilla soymilk is still sitting on the counter.  Sigh and open the fridge again to put it away.  I grab my mug of coffee, and turn to head back to the stairs (again), but trip on the kitchen trash can in the middle of the kitchen floor \u2014 oh yeah, it\u2019s there as a reminder to myself that today is Trash Day.  I nudge the trash can out of the way and notice my bowl of cereal on the counter, grab it, and head back upstairs.Breakfast, check.All these little cues to myself, the placement of objects to jog my brain, are difficult habits to build.  They have to be rational and inescapable, little \u201cincompatible behaviours\u201d that mean I if I\u2019m doing A then I can\u2019t do C until I first do B. They work great as long as I am successfully running through the little subroutines without getting distracted by D after I\u2019ve done B but before I got to C. Unfortunately, I get distracted a lot.  That\u2019s one reason why routines are so important in my life; they are enabling, and without them I get discombobulated.I scan my email subject lines, read a few blogs, and glance over the newspaper headlines to make sure nothing unusual has happened that I should know about in detail before evening.  Satisfied that the rest of the world is bumping along in its usual dysfunctional way, I shut my laptop, knocking over the medicine bottles I\u2019d left awkwardly close as a reminder, and wrestle with the lids to retrieve pills.  Note to myself:  ask pharmacist to not give me child-proof lids, especially not on the pain medication (I make this same mental note every morning, and uselessly never think of it again until the next morning).I suddenly realise my feet are cold because I didn\u2019t put my boots on yet.  Where did I leave my boots last time?  Find boots, put them on.  I trip over my purse, which spills some of its contents, and repacking it reminds me to put my car key and such in my pants pockets.  The car key in turn reminds me to grab my mobile phone on the bed-side book stack. Having put on my boots and packed my car key and mobile, then I notice my morning\u2019s pills still huddled on the desktop, so I finally take my medication.Meds, check.Slurping the pills down with the last swallow of coffee reminds me to grab my dirty dishes.  I pick them up  and then trip over the dirty clothes dropped on the floor last night.  I take the clothes to the laundry basket, and head downstairs with the dishes.  Oh yeah, the trash can is still in the way.  That cues me to go clean out the litter box, and I hand off the bag of trash to hubby, who\u2019s heading out the door.  Hooray, I remembered the trash and the cat litter!Wow, I need to get going. Put on bomber jacket \u2014 where\u2019s my fedora?  Stop, think \u2026 oh yeah, I left it in the car last night because my hands were full.  Oh!   Hat \u2014 head \u2014 hair.  Yikes, I still gotta wash my hair real quick!  Take off jacket and leave it on the stairs, so I don\u2019t have to hunt it down again.  Grab towel from rocking chair, stand over the tub and use shower wand to shampoo hair really quick.  Blow-dry hair.  What time is it?  I haven\u2019t put on my watch yet \u2026 it\u2019s in my purse, which reminds me to fetch my purse. Go back downstairs.STOP.  Luggage check. This is the other hard part of my routine.  Remembering isn\u2019t so hard, it\u2019s the \u201cremembering to remember\u201d or remembering to stop and think and ask myself what it is I need to remember.  I do the \u201cpocket Macarena\u201d, patting down each pocket to be sure I have what I need for the day: left pocket = pocket knife and index card with ToDo list, right pocket = car key and pen and little tin of balm (I\u2019m trying to train myself to lubricate my torn cuticles instead of biting them).  Balm is missing, stop, think \u2026 oh I bet I left it in a blazer pocket.  Go back upstairs to fumble through blazers hanging in closet, find balm.  Stop by the kid\u2019s bedroom to say goodbye and make sure the teen hasn\u2019t fallen back asleep or become willingly \u201ctrapped\u201d under a mere nine pound kitty-cat.  Back downstairs.  I put on my jacket, pick up my purse and realise that I still have a hand free \u2014 yikes, forgot my lunch!  Return to the kitchen to put the lidded bowl of soup and the yogurt carton in the lunch bag, and while returning the trash can to its proper space under the kitchen sink, notice the coffee maker is still on and flick it off.  \u201cOoh, I\u2019m-good, I\u2019m-good.\u201dLuggage, check.Finally I am out the door, and on the road to work.  I have used up all of my 15-minute time buffer, and as long as I don\u2019t run into more than one random traffic slow-down, I will still get to work on time.  I am, by most anyone\u2019s standard, an ADHD person who is coping successfully.Then while at a stop light, I remember to dig my ID tag from my purse and clip it on.A few miles later, I realise that last night I forgot to call someone back about scheduling me for a speaking engagement.  At the next stoplight, I transfer the sticky-note with her phone number from my purse to a blank space on the dashboard above the radio controls. Hopefully next time I get into the car, I will notice it and call her before I leave.  Because they are irregular events in my daily schedule, appointments and phone calls are two things that I have difficulty remembering; phone calls to make appointments are even worse.Nearly at work, I realise, Damn, I got sidetracked too many times, and forgot to brush my teeth.Postscript:\u00a0\nEarlier today there was a muffled holler from the bathroom as the kid called me, \u201cMOM?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCan you get me a towel?\u201d\u00a0 Once again, a nameless Someone had taken a bath and forgotten to check for towels first.\nI pick up three towels scattered on the teen\u2019s bedroom floor and deposit them in front of the bathroom door. \u201cHey, some people hang their towels back up in the bathroom when they\u2019re done with them \u2026\u201d\n\u201cWho would do something like that?\u201d he teased back.\nGee, wonder where he gets that from?", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/10/27/how-to-get-ready-in-n-recursive-steps/", "title": "How to Get Ready, in N Recursive\u00a0Steps"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t1 September 2007 ", "body": "So I\u2019m meeting again with one of my science tutees.  As usual, I started off by asking what he wanted to work on that day.He didn\u2019t know.  Not because he\u2019s a slacker.  But because, he explained in earnest and slightly frustrated confusion, because he wasn\u2019t sure what precisely it was that he was having trouble with.It took some reassuring on my part that This is okay, and that figuring out where one is having problems is part of the whole learning and tutoring processes. You have to be able to identify where and how things aren\u2019t going well before you can address the issues.So we sat down with the materials and started going over different ways of reviewing things, as I asked him what had or hadn\u2019t worked well for him before as studying techniques.  And not surprisingly, he couldn\u2019t say.  Meaning, he wasn\u2019t able to answer that question simply from my verbal enquiry.  It was also difficult to pull up random examples just off the top of his head. His experiences had not been encoded into his memory as analyses, so the search came up empty.  And I quite understood that.  After all, if he already knew what he needed in the way of study methods that worked well for him, he wouldn\u2019t be in such need of tutoring!  Sometimes we tutor content, and sometimes (like here) we tutor process.  And process is trickier, because people don\u2019t learn things the same way (e.g. flash cards don\u2019t work for everyone).Further into the session, the stress levels were getting reduced, and we were able to focus on a particular issue.  He had to be able to distinguish between pictures of different kinds of human tissues, and in the study lab had run into frustration trying to explain to someone else that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see\u201d what they were talking about.Ah-ha \u2026 now I understood what was going on. He\u2019d had one of those circular conversations that results from two people using the same word to mean different things. Our conversation detoured from ligament tissues to brain processing.So my explanation went something to this effect:The two of you are using the word \u201csee\u201d to mean two different things.  That\u2019s because there are two different parts to seeing things.  The first part is sensing, where you use your eyes to see, and your ears to hear, and your skin to touch.  Your sensory organs interact with the environment, and send the signals to your brain. That\u2019s what the other person was referring to.  The second part is perception, where the brain interprets what those signals mean.  That\u2019s what you referring to when you said you couldn\u2019t \u201csee\u201d the pictures.\nUnlike sensing, perception is learned, which is why babies and toddlers sense things in so many ways, like putting things in their mouths.  We learn what things are like, and learn how to make sense of them and to identify them.  To do that, we have to figure out what details are important to identifying them.  So if you\u2019re able to tell different makes of cars apart, you\u2019re looking at the shape of the windows and bumpers and so on.  If you\u2019re learning to identify different birds, then you look at the shape of the beaks and tails and so on.\nOnce you learn which kinds of features are useful to distinguish and identify different things, then the process becomes more automatic.  It goes from conscious effort to unconscious identification, and it becomes easier and much quicker.  So in the case of different tissues, we look at the pictures and compare how they are the same and how they are different, and what different kinds of parts we can see. For example, there are different shapes of cells, and different arrangements of cells, and also different accessories in the tissues, like collagen fibers.And from there, we identified how the textbook pointed out specific components of the tissues, noting which kinds of components were in which kinds of tissues, and we traded different descriptions of what familiar objects the different tissues looked like.  We looked at several examples of each type of tissue, because you cannot generalise from a sample of one; looking at only one picture means that you only learn to identify that specific image, not the concept that picture illustrates.I took this detour for several reasons.  One reason was to help him understand just how the confusion had happened between himself and the other person, so he could identify and resolve such issues later on (self-understanding and self-advocacy).   Another reason was to help him understand a bit about how the brain works, so he could more readily identify other similar kinds of learning situations.  And the last reason was so we could return to the content studying by analysing what it was that we were doing, so he would have that as a concrete and more conscious process for other situations.Ultimately, getting all the data stored in his brain is his job.  But along the way, we were able to identify some of the speed bumps in that process, how the learning process works,  and hopefully we\u2019ve laid some groundwork for being able to identify and analyse difficulties in the future.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/09/01/seeing-things/", "title": "Seeing Things"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t2 September 2007 ", "body": "Yes, that \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d, the book by George Orwell.   That\u2019s what I was reminded of, or rather, I was reminded of the famous quote, \u201cAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\u201dPainting walls certainly gives one time to think, and I was stuck on the annual Muscular Dystrophy Telethon. Jerry Lewis is the comic who for years has been the host of the annual MD Telethon broadcast on US television.  The program itself is designed to be a real tear-jerker, prompting people to send in money out of pity and guilt and good intentions.  Lots of people hate the program. We hate the paternalistic attitudes that perpetuate the whole medical model of disability, and reinforce the warped picture the equates disabled people as helpless, hopeless victims needing cures and charity, rather than accommodation and equal social standing and social rights.In the negatively stereotypical telethon world, the disabled person can only be brave by quietly clinging to others and not advocating for themselves, by staying hidden out the way and not asking for equal access, and by cultivating \u201chope\u201d that someday they can be \u201ccured\u201d to become normal, thus regaining their status as a full member of society and become a real person.Well, medical cures and preventions are well and good, but are nowhere near soon, and what people really need are more practical things, the equipment and accommodations and acceptance into general society that will let them live their lives.  No one wants to put their life on \u201chold\u201d waiting for some possibly non-existent, or distant future mythical-magical cure.  No one wants to be stuck at home,  much less in an institution, and thought of as a horrible burden, a non-functioning person who has nothing to contribute to their family, a non-working person who has nothing to contribute to their workplace, a non-sexual person who has nothing to contribute to their spouse, or a non-adult person who has nothing to contribute to their children.Jerry Lewis plays up the pity card heavily.  I\u2019ve previously discussed the various social problems created by pity, so I won\u2019t go repeating myself on that score.   What choked me up (in disgust, not in sadness) was his \u201chalf a person\u201d quote.  It originates from the September 2, 1990 issue of Parade magazine, from the article titled, \u201cWhat If I Had Muscular Dystrophy?\u201d:When I sit back and think a little more rationally, I realize my life is half, so I must learn to do things halfway. I just have to learn to try to be good at being a half a person \u2026 and get on with my life.Ick. That\u2019s when the Animal Farm parallel hit me:All humans are people, but some humans are more people than others.Half a person. Not a real person.  Not a full citizen in society, but someone second-class. Forever dependent, focused upon all the things they cannot do, always left out.  And why are people left out?  Not because they\u2019re disabled, but because of the entrenched bigotry against disabled people that permeates our cultures.  Simple things that should be ordinary, practical, sensible things, are instead viewed as horrible hardships upon everyone else.  Problems are seen in a warped world-view of false dichotomies:  either the person cannot do something the normal way, or they get cured and then they\u2019ll be able to do things.  There\u2019s no accommodated way of doing things in that unrealistic story.I can\u2019t stand to watch the program.  I can\u2019t stand the crass exploitation, seeing children (and their families) used as tragi-cute pawns for pathos.  I can\u2019t stand to hear Jerry Lewis snivelling.  I can\u2019t stand to see the whole routine repeated year after year after year, the horribly treacly music, the pleas to \u201csave Jerry\u2019s kids\u201d. The program is a tear-jerker, and Jerry Lewis is a jerk.\u201cIt is an uncomfortable truth, in social work, in government activity, and in charitable endeavors, that actions which are intended to help a certain group of people may actually harm them.\u201d\n~Laura Hershey", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cripcommentary.com/frompost.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/09/02/animal-farm/", "title": "Animal Farm"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t19 September 2007", "body": "Well, I\u2019ve spent the past couple days crashed abed. After dragging myself to work today, I\u2019m still not in top form. Basically, my brain-pan is full of snot, so I\u2019m certainly not up to a great deal of psychoeducational analysis about much of anything. But until the green elixir kicks in (so I can get some sleep), I\u2019ll natter away about how I got to be such a geek.The original outlook wasn\u2019t promising. In fact, I was quite the disappointment to my father for not being a chess whiz, and to my mother for getting poor marks in nearly all my subjects. The maths particularly eluded me \u2014 I was 13 before I had a firm grip on my multiplication tables \u2014 which for reasons that still escape me, led people to decide that in secondary school I should take a year of Bookkeeping as preparation for future employment.However, I did better with a variety of hands-on pursuits, such as building model airplanes from balsa and silkspan, collecting rocks and stamps, and spending endless hours assembling buildings and laying out track for my HO-scale train (which I still own). My other major past-time involved reading masses of science fiction. Even in the 70\u2019s, these past-times were still considered the provenance of boys, which meant that I had nothing to discuss with my female peers.Not that I had much to discuss with my male peers, who at that time in history were on the cutting edge of the PC revolution, learning to write BASIC scripts for their \u201cTRaSh-80\u201d computers. That is, when they weren\u2019t chewing on calculus problems, or debating the fine points of D&D strategy. I felt so left out \u2014 I wasn\u2019t just geeky, I was archaicly so, if not downright nerdy. ::sigh::It wasn\u2019t for a lack of trying. At the time, my uncle the electronic engineer worked at Texas Instruments, and in high school I received as a gift one of the early models of pocket calculators. It was the size of a sandwich, but heavier, and had all of four functions. I amused myself by doing things like typing in 0,7734 which upside-down read hELL\u20190. But unlike my uncle the engineer, I was not especially adept at the maths, nor did I do well at my introductory programming class. We typed out our short BASIC programs on punch cards, which were then sent to a nearby university to be batch-run at night. The next day we would get our cards and the green-striped printouts back, and I discovered how annoying my innate ability for typographical errors could be when something would not run because I had omitted a single comma, and would have to re-type a card and have the batch sent out again. The whole experience turned me off computers for several years.Meanwhile, the PC industry kept plowing ahead with innovations. By the late 80\u2019s, I made friends with them when I got my first Compaq Portable II with dual floppy drives and a whopping 256K of RAM. The thing was \u201cportable\u201d only in the broad sense of the word; we called it The Luggable. But I loved it, because with WordStar running on one floppy (and document files saved on the other), it was the \u201cmagic typewriter\u201d I\u2019d dreamed of for years. My antique Remington Rand #5 typewriter was retired to the basement, as I was finally freed from the tyranny of perfectionist typing.And that\u2019s where I stayed in the realm of geekdom for many years, relegated to the wallflower world of the Users.Then I went to graduate school, and found myself needing to acquire a variety of odd skills that went way beyond the realm of my usual haunts of growing vegetables and watching butterflies. In the lab I had to do a variety of things with some electrophysiology equipment, notably setting up a jumbled box of parts and getting it into working order, which involved debugging the equipment for faulty parts. Doing that led me to start visualising the electronic parts in mental flow-charts of systems and signals. Investigating the problem of signal-to-noise ratio, I stumbled across the Shannon-Weaver Transmission Model of Communication, which concepts I increasingly applied to mental flow-charts of systems and signals in human communication. I also found out that my visual memory made me an excellent candidate for learning to identify patterns in wave formations, even when they were distorted along either axis.Something else I got to do was to teach myself to solder. Doing that reminded me of some things from a previous part of my life, and I dug around in our basement for a box of antique watch-repair tools that had belonged to my grandfather, and took back to the lab with me some Swiss forceps as a family heirloom that connected my past to my future. My concept of heritage broadened: \u201cI come from a fine line of geeks.\u201dI found that the clerks down at the local Radio Shack were too young or inexperienced to be familiar with much of anything that predated 1995, and also that by perusing electronics catalogs on the Web I could figure out what I needed, and the various attributes of different parts even before I walked into the store. This increased my self-confidence. I also fell in love the the well-designed efficiency of BNC connectors, and the multimeter and oscilloscope became my friends. I stayed in late one night in the lab as I figured out a technical issue that had eluded me all afternoon. My half-eaten slice of pizza sat cold and forgotten as I rolled up the sleeves of my white oxford shirt to keep the dirt off my cuffs while I tinkered. Soon the reflection of the green waves sliding across the gridded screen of the oscilloscope was shining on my new bifocals, and in a quintessently geeky moment, I felt connected to decades of young electronics techies who had successfully assembled and debugged their own equipment.Being older, I found had other benefits \u2014 when we needed to use older computer equipment, it turned out that I actually new more than the self-important young man my adviser had borrowed from the IT department. He had assured the prof that he could help me install the software drivers for the AD board that converted analog to digital signal. Previously I had carefully opened the cover to the older desktop computer and installed the AD board, but wasn\u2019t familiar with installing the software driver to accompany it. However, it was soon apparent to me that this brash guy was simply too young to know how to do this particular job. He had never before seen a \u201clive\u201d floppy disk, which was apparent when I handed him the disk, and he inserted it into the drive backwards and then couldn\u2019t figure out why it wasn\u2019t working.With a sigh, I reached over, pulled out the floppy disk, turned it around, re-inserted it, and then clicked down the lever that keeps the disk retracted into the drive. (OMFG!) Then he was baffled when the computer booted to the C:\\ prompt. \u201cInstall,\u201d I explained. \u201cNo, no, you don\u2019t click the mouse, you have to type the word \u2018install\u2019. That\u2019s spelled with two L\u2019s.\u201d At that point I had an epiphany: you don\u2019t have to know everything about a system to be competent, you just have to know more  than others. And when you step outside of the world of techies, it\u2019s not difficult to know more than the average user. Amazing.So, yeah. Now at one job I\u2019m somehow the mistress of the spreadsheets and newsletters, in addition to being chief spider wrangler (my, there are a lot of arachnophobes at school), local greenhouse expert, and primary behavioral data taker. I crack geek in-jokes with some of the students (thanks to my children keeping me up-to-date with geek culture trivia), occasionally teach students chess strategy (it\u2019s the only time I ever beat my students), and get to drop oddball comments like, \u201cYou know, if we rigged up the classroom as a giant Faraday cage, we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about anyone using their cell phones \u2026\u201dSo, I\u2019m not a heavy-duty geek. I wouldn\u2019t know a Perl script if it fell on my foot, nor have I ever played a MMPRPG, and I can\u2019t speak a word of Klingon. But that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve created a novel niche for myself as a jack-of-all-trades. I find I work best as a \u201cgeek interface\u201d, providing translation between the students and the subjects they need to learn. I can come up with parallels between most any special interest and the scholastic topic du jour. My examples abound with puns and highly visual analogies that help the material \u201cstick\u201d.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t11 September 2007", "body": "I met with a tutee last week, a fellow who is studying Human Anatomy.  Of all the courses one can take, anatomy is a particular humdinger, if for no other reason than one must memorise such a load of new terms and be able to identify and name parts.  It\u2019s an especially difficult class for students who are slow to memorise things, who have trouble with spelling (so many words are orthographically similar), and/or who have trouble with recall upon demand.He\u2019s an extremely determined student, one who wants to very conscientiously get everything down pat before moving onto the next thing.  Unfortunately, at the standard 1-semester pace of this class, he\u2019s not going to be able to do that, unless he figures out a way of hammering things into his memory at a much faster rate.  Because of his earnest desire to do well, he has been poring himself through his materials, including reading the text and studying the lab models and reviewing the quizzes from the textbook\u2019s Web page, and doing the review worksheets, and making flashcards, and \u2026It\u2019s all very exhaustive, and exhausting. And likewise, very frustrating as his work scores don\u2019t improve.  I had to impress upon him that he cannot afford to concentrate on getting every last factoid from the first unit (histology) down, when they were already starting the second unit (bones).  Some of the information will end up making more sense later on, but as the final exam is not cumulative, he needs to be able to keep up and focus upon the current material. I hate being in this kind of position, as a tutor or as a student. But in many ways, we still have to remain focused on how to best navigate the \u201creal\u201d world, as opposed to the ideal world of study where everyone could proceed at their own pace.Part of his feeling swamped comes from trying to figure out which kinds of study methods will work best for him in this kind of class.  His other classes have been subjects like mathematics and composition, where he learned new skills, but didn\u2019t have masses of memorisation to deal with.  As I pointed out to him, he\u2019s not just learning about human anatomy in this class, he\u2019s also learning about how he learns, and trying to be more savvy about his metacognition.  The other students who don\u2019t struggle as much with the subject may already know some of the material, or may already know how they learn this kind of material.When next we meet, one of the things we\u2019ll go over is how he apportions his study time.  Not the exact length of hours he spends studying, or number of names he should have learned, but rather, the proportions he devotes to the different parts of his lessons.  For many students, this is something they\u2019ve long since figured out, and possibly aren\u2019t even aware they do.  But for the student who feels like they are swamped in studying, it\u2019s important to acquire the needed structure to be efficient with their focus.There are actually three parts to the studying process.The first part of studying is the Preview. For my student who is facing a mound of new terms, and has difficulty with mentally juggling the attention, listening, watching, and note-taking functions all at once, the preview stage is vitally important.  He needs to do the preview before each class (not necessarily right beforehand, but at least between one class and the next).  Preview can include:Examine the syllabus to determine what the instructor will be lecturing on, not only to know what part of the text to review, but also as a heads-up so he knows what the lecture will generally be about.  (This of course assumes that one has the sort of organised prof who has the semester planned out, writes up a syllabus to give to the students, and then sticks to it as best as humanly possible.  Thankfully, nowadays more schools require their profs to have concrete syllabi.)Read over the appropriate section of the text to become somewhat familiar with the concepts and vocabulary that will be presented.  I warned to him that he will naturally not understand everything he reads \u2014 that\u2019s why there is a lecture as well, to explain material as well as to review material.  But if there are specific things he doesn\u2019t understand, or has questions on, he should make (written) notes of those to be sure that they get answered by the end of lecture.  It also helps to look up the meanings of unfamiliar words.In some classes, the textbook is the primary information source, and the lecture summarises the information.  In other classes, the lecture is the primary information source, and the textbook is supplementary.  His class happens to be the latter, but every student needs to figure out which sort they have (by the end of the first week or first few lectures), so they know whether the text or their handouts and notes will be more important as a studying resource.Visual learners (like my student) should also spend particular care to examine the illustrations, including reading the descriptions.  This way there is something already in the memory to \u201chook\u201d the new information onto, especially when listening to a lecture.  Likewise, when the prof throws up an illustration, that bit of familiarity will help link the content of the lecture to the content of the book.The second part is the View.  This is when one is actually IN the lecture and/or the lab, and includes listening and handling things and taking notes, as well as seeing words put on the board.  It\u2019s the second exposure to the material being studied.  At this point, it should start to make sense, and questions should get answered if it doesn\u2019t.  There should be some slight familiarity from having previewed the material, but it\u2019s not likely to have yet been memorised.Because trying to focus, listen, watch and take notes simultaneously is difficult, we looked over the instructor\u2019s handouts from a couple of classes.  This is when the format of the lecture became apparent, and I pointed out that the teacher had a regular sort of pattern for introducing material (the function, what the [bones] were made of, different kinds of tissues, structural parts, general types [of bones], growth and development).  Although not all of the lectures would follow that format, a lot of them would.  Being aware of that pattern would make it easier to both understand what the instructor was talking about at the moment (especially in relation to the rest of the content of that day\u2019s lecture), and would also help cue him in to what would probably come next.  This works in much the same way that reading a description of a movie lets us know what to expect in the way of plot development.The third part (as you may have guessed by now) is the Review. There\u2019s actually two parts to the Review.  The first is the regular review, which is going over (either that night, or at least before the next class) the material that was in the lecture, lab, book, study notes or whatever.  This is when any bits of confusion should be ironed out, and the bulk of the memorising gets done.  This should be the third time that the content has been addressed.In addition to the regular review, which is the daily work, there\u2019s also the periodic review, where one practices memorising things, and going over material from previous days to refresh it.  And lastly, there\u2019s the grand review, which is studying for exams.  Of course, any of these study periods can be broken down into smaller sessions.  Depending upon one\u2019s schedule, they might preview before the class, and review after the class, rather than doing both in the evening before.When done right, this format of studying lets a student go over the material several times before the exam.  It also helps the student identify and address topics of confusion before they are quizzed on such, and before things get accidentally mis-learned.  And importantly, the Preview-View-Review process also keeps the student up to date with the class, so they aren\u2019t stuck trying to figuratively finish their appetizers before the waiter brings by the coffee and dessert.It\u2019s a rather basic system of studying, one that many of us have picked up without a great deal of metcognition.  But for those students who have not yet figured out how to optimise their study time, breaking things down into this sense of overall structure helps them figure out how to spend their time, and what proportions of time they may need to spend on various parts of the study.Now, if we could just move to a different planet that had 30-hour days, we\u2019d be able to get done everything we needed to in a day, even a full night\u2019s sleep!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/09/11/swamped-in-studies/", "title": "Swamped in studies"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t9 September 2007 ", "body": "A few years ago I had the pleasure of providing the annual Inservice training session for a university\u2019s tutoring department.  One of the themes I explored in brief was how tutees, especially those with various learning disabilities, may have processing difficulties.  We have to take information in, make sense of it, retrieve information, and then be able to relay information back.  Various kinds of learning disabilities interfere with steps in this process, and the interference can happen at more than one step, especially when a person has more than one kind of difficulty.  (Learning disabilities and other physiological issues are often co-occurring, technically known by the dreadful-sounding term of \u201ccomorbid\u201d.)The upshot of all this is that any \u201cspeed-bumps\u201d or \u201croad-blocks\u201d in the processing will result in slow processing (it takes longer to do things), or uneven processing (some days it\u2019s more difficult to do things, not always for apparent reasons), or intermittent or chronic inabilities to do things (being able to do things on some days or in some hours, but not others, can be more frustrating than never being able to do them).There are a variety of disabilities out there, but instead of describing how each one can affect a person\u2019s ability to respond in educational efforts, I\u2019m going to describe how processing works in general, and at which steps some disabilities become apparent.Whenever we interact with the world, there is a whole series of steps that has to happen.  Let\u2019s take the subject of, \u201cAnswering a question asked of you\u201d.  Most people assume that this is really simple, and thus, easy.  Hah!1.  Hear the question.  This is sensory processing done by the ears, which can be affected by hearing loss, middle ear infections et cetera.  In the case of visual sensory processing, we have refractive, receptive or muscle disorders that reduce the ability to see things.(Somewhere between steps 1 and 2 is the damn annoyance of tinnitus getting in the way.  The noise doesn\u2019t really exist, but is created in some unclear manner within the sensory and perceptual route.)2.  Understand the words.  This is perceptual processing, or what the brain does with the signals that the sense organs transmit.  We have to:  (A) realise that someone is talking; (B) that they are talking to us; (C) be able to follow the person\u2019s speech within background noise; (D) be able to stay focused on what they\u2019re talking about; (E) interpret the sounds.  This is the part where the (Central) Auditory Processing Disorder messes things up.  Things like AD/HD, Tourette\u2019s or brief absence seizures can also interfere with the focusing part of the process.  Decoding printed words can be impeded by dyslexia, likewise decoding printed numbers and calculations by dyscalculia.3.  Think about what the words mean.  Assigning meaning requires not only understanding the meanings of individual words, but also the words put together into a gestalt, the greater abstract significance.  Sometimes we run into confusion because of non-literal language uses, such as puns, slang, idioms, inferred (unspoken) meanings, and nonverbal communication.  It\u2019s frustrating when people \u201cdon\u2019t mean what they say and don\u2019t say what they mean\u201d!  Also, questions nearly always require the listener to access and construct background information that creates the context for the question.  (Doubtless you\u2019ve had the experience of walking down a hallway and a colleague asked you a question that was unrelated to what you were doing or what was happening immediately around you, but without some kind of \u201cheadline\u201d to alert you to the topic of their question, you either needed a moment to figure out what they were talking about, or you had to ask them.)The words must also be put into the proper sequential order.  English grammar relies upon word sequencing for some kinds of meanings.  Directions or commands require time-sequencing to make sense.  Everything involving numbers requires sequencing (e.g. the place-value that creates the difference between 29 and 92, or the steps in calculations), and sequencing can be another part of dyscalculia.  Dyslexia can also show up at this stage, especially with those common, short words that don\u2019t bring up an associated mental picture (you can picture what \u201cgreen\u201d or a \u201ccat\u201d is, but not a \u201cthe\u201d or an \u201cis\u201d; many of these are on the Dolch list of common \u201csight\u201d words).4. Retrieve information from memory.  Memory that you are using for doing immediate things is known as working memory. Short-term memory is information that you retain for a little while, but isn\u2019t committed to long-term memory. So holding onto part of the sentence you have heard & understood, while puzzling out the part that you didn\u2019t understand, and then making sense of all that together, uses working memory. Being able to remember what people said a little while later is short-term memory. Working and short-term memory issues feature in a great many kinds of learning disabilities.It\u2019s a common issue that the information we need to understand and answer the question is \u201cin there  \u2026 somewhere\u201d, but it\u2019s hard to find or slow to find when someone else (randomly) demands it, rather than the person spontaneously pulling it up for their own lines of thought.   Information on demand by someone else, and information spontaneously accessed by one\u2019s self, use different kinds of retrieval processes. We all hate the \u201cI know it, but I don\u2019t know it\u201d problem because it makes us feel stupid.  Knowledge retrieval can also be difficult if someone knows the material in another language, so has to go through input and finding and output translations.  And sometimes we have to do a similar kind of translation from abstract thinking to visual thinking to expressing thoughts in words, which leads us to:5. Put the answer into words.  Oft times we know what we want to say, but we have to figure out how best to express it.  Maybe we get the answer all planned out, and then realise that we\u2019re struggling to recall a particular word.  Sometimes we\u2019re actively contemplating what the other person does or does not know, so therefore how much background information we need to give them.(Personally, I\u2019m prone to answering questions by giving the background supporting evidence, and then finishing up with the thesis statement.  Apparently the rest of the world just wants the thesis statement, and doesn\u2019t care how I arrived at it.  You know, the whole loquacious & pedantic bit.)6.  Speak the answer, or use another means of manual or texted communication, as the case may be.  I\u2019m a highly verbal person myself, but there have been times when I felt disembodied, like I was waiting for my mouth to speak, as though I was standing at a subway stop waiting for the train to come by.  Sometimes one gets through some of the sentence, but then part of it seems to have fallen out of the working memory buffer.  Sometimes I stutter, or have enunciation problems, but I have learned to just work through those, as I do a lot of public speaking.  Things like Tourette\u2019s, dyspraxia, or speech problems make this more difficult, so even having more-or-less successfully gotten through steps 1 through 5, we\u2019re still trying to get the answer out.These kinds of problems are neurological, and not the result of being \u201clazy, stupid or crazy\u201d. This is why we need to give students a lot more time to answer questions, without interrupting them with further prompts to answer, or adding to their stress levels with impatience or ridicule.  It also helps the interactive question and answer process of teaching and tutoring if we break down the questions into smaller, sequential pieces, and also backtrack and \u201crecap\u201d or summarise what we have gone over to put it into the larger context.But wait, there\u2019s more!A lot of the issues we have in education, at work, and in daily life are also related to the realm of \u201cexecutive function\u201d, which is the whole sticky ball of organisation, planning, self-awareness & self-monitoring, and execution of various efforts.  Organisation problems can be spatial (keeping track of where things are), temporal (keeping track of when things happen, the order in which they happen, AND how much time has passed), and what I think of as \u201chierarchical\u201d (how important various tasks are to do at any one time). Executive function problems are common in autism/Asperger\u2019s, AD/HD, NVLD (Non-Verbal Learning Disorder), and are frequently seen in people with Tourette\u2019s and Bipolar problems.  Depression, PTSD, traumatic brain injury, and a host of illnesses can make mental operations sluggish or skittish as well.   \u201cAin\u2019t we got fun.\u201dSo let\u2019s say you\u2019re attending to some business of your own at work, or are out shopping or in your neighborhood, and  someone comes up to you en passant and asks you a question.  Now, if you also have prosopagnosia (faceblindness), you\u2019re trying to figure out:* who is this person?\n* do I know them?\n* what\u2019s their name?\n* what are they talking about?  (if I could remember who they were, that would help)\n* what do I know about this?\n* what am I supposed to do about this?\n* how do I answer this?Of course, if you\u2019re still stuck on that first step of, \u201cwho is this person?\u201d  then the amount of working memory you have for processing all that other stuff is severely reduced.  Once you get past the identification issue, then there\u2019s the auditory processing issue.  Once you get past that \u2026::blink, blink::  \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dFor more information, this page describes (in a fairly non-technical manner) how the input-integration-memory-output process works, or doesn\u2019t, as the case may be.", "outgoing_links": ["http://literacyconnections.com/Dolch1.html", "http://www.ldaamerica.org/aboutld/teachers/understanding/types.asp"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/09/09/how-hard-can-it-be/", "title": "How hard can it\u00a0be?"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 September 2007", "body": "Dave Hingsburger recently had a very nice column about the pros and cons of labelling. He made some very fine points, including the key idea that, \u201cthe issue is how we value the difference that is labeled.\u201d  This reminded me of something similarly related, which is how we value the accommodations.  With many sorts of disabilities, we have ways of getting around the internal disabling factors, and the environmental handicapping factors.  Some of those ways involve assistive devices (ADs), also known as assistive technology (AT).One of the problems we run into, sometimes unexpectedly so, is that our ADs do not \u201cfix\u201d the problem and make it go away.  This is discouraging for the person who is newly diagnosed or newly treated for an issue, and who hoped that simply by getting some snazzy piece of equipment, everything would \u201cbe back to normal\u201d.  Well, no.  Being disabled is the \u201cnew normal\u201d.  Arguing for, with, and at one\u2019s assorted pieces of equipment is yet another layer added to our lives.And as we quickly discover, the rest of the world is under the horribly mistaken impression that our ADs fix the problem and make it go away.\u201cI think it\u2019s generally not sensible or fair (or nice) to assume that the existence of assistive devices makes everyone alike and that we therefore should expect everyone to \u201cshape up\u201d and meet our expectations of normality.\u201d\n~ jane meyerdingIn truth, ADs are not the total solution to the problem, but rather, are part of the system of coping methods.  For example, hearing aids amplify sound (really good hearing aids only amplify the particular frequencies that are most useful), but they also amplify every other noise of the same frequency range, and don\u2019t clarify what\u2019s being heard.  For someone who\u2019s hard of hearing, the aids are part of their daily strategies, along with lip-reading, captioned video, vibrating alarms, and maybe a spouse or partner with a broad vocabulary of midnight nudges.I can\u2019t tell you how many times my teachers, bosses, or even relations have suggested that I just needed to \u201cget a hearing aid\u201d to fix my auditory processing disorder. Polysyllabic Expletive!  If only it were that simple.   The nice part about having an invisible disability is that people don\u2019t acquire a bunch of stupid attitudes about you, for example, the way they do if you use a mobility aid (you\u2019re ignored, patronised, infantilised, manhandled et cetera).  On the other hand, the bad part about having an invisible disability is that people jump to a bunch of other stupid conclusions about you (that you\u2019re lazy, stupid, rude, snobby et cetera).I\u2019ve mentioned before (\u201cRead my clips\u201d) that being able to acquire a useful AT can be problematic for many people.  We have to find out it exists, find out if it\u2019s actually helpful to us personally, and find out if we can afford to buy or finagle it.  There\u2019s always a learning curve, and it\u2019s the nature of life that \u201cthe only constant is change\u201d, so what we need also evolves over time.  We always hope that this latest thing will not require extreme efforts of adaptation, and will actually solve more problems than it creates.  If we\u2019re truly blessed, it will even solve problems we didn\u2019t realise we had, or that it was originally intended to address.  (I\u2019m a pragmatic optimist.)But whatever happens, we have to remember that our assistive devices and assistive technologies are not really devices to restore functioning, but to adapt functioning. They don\u2019t \u201cmake us normal\u201d.   Instead, they make us able to achieve similar results, albeit by other means.This is an important point:  the whole deal about being disabled (in some fashion or another) is that you can\u2019t do things the same way most everyone else can.  But it\u2019s your means that are disabled, not necessarily your ends.  The rest of the abled world  will naturally be focused upon the means, because it\u2019s obvious that how you do things isn\u2019t the same.  We don\u2019t want to be worried about doing things \u201cthe same way everyone else does\u201d or trying to appear to do things the same way everyone else does.  It\u2019s a given that\u2019s not going to happen.  Spending outrageous amounts of effort trying to pretend and \u201cpass\u201d is really a waste of time.  The process should not be held in higher regard than the results.It\u2019s really the results we\u2019re after.   It\u2019s the results that are what we are all about as humans:  those physiological and psychosocial and self-actualisation needs we have to fulfill.  How we get ourselves fed is less important than having a choice of what we eat, when, and with whom.  How we chat with our friends isn\u2019t important; what matters is that we can find the means to talk, sign, text, sing, or dance away through the hours, because we have friends who appreciate us and what we have to communicate.", "outgoing_links": ["http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2007/09/label-me.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/09/20/but-its-not-the-same/", "title": "But it\u2019s NOT the\u00a0same"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t24 September 2007", "body": "ABFH composed a new blogging meme, which unlike many that are transmitted by assigned infection, is open for anyone to self-select.  I thought her questions to be rather interesting, as the overall topic of \u201chow and why one blogs\u201d is something that I myself have contemplated upon occasion.\n1. Is there a regular time of day when you compose your posts?No, it really depends on what that day\u2019s schedule is like.  On weekdays I usually post late in the evening, and when I\u2019m off work sometimes I post early in the morning.  When I\u2019m travelling I post whenever I can get some freaking internet access!2. Do you prefer to write a certain number of posts per week (or per month)?It varies; I think mathematically I average about three per week.  Many weeks I\u2019ll post almost daily, and then some weeks I\u2019m really busy with jobs or am sick, and hardly post at all.  Once in a while I get very overwhelmed by the absolute stupidity of the world, and cannot muster even the energy to rant, much less compose a thoughtful rebuttal.  Fortunately those days don\u2019t last.\n\n3. Are you more likely to write a post when you\u2019re happy about the topic, or do you mainly blog when you feel like ranting?Neither; I post when some thought grabs my attention.  I usually have half a dozen ideas in my Drafts folder (slush pile), so sometimes one will finally get finished as my thoughts on the topic coalesce.  Most times an idea will just grab me by the lapels and demand to be written.  I have very assertive Muses.The funny thing is that when I started blogging, I wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d be able to sustain it for more than a month; it seemed like I only had a few particular points I wanted to mention.  Some 200 posts later, I find that there\u2019s always something more that I feel needs addressing!4. Do you write from notes or an outline, or are your posts mostly spontaneous?My \u201cslush pile\u201d posts often start off with a few pithy turns of phrase or some random statements that are then enlarged upon, but most posts are from the spontaneous end of the writing spectrum.  I\u2019m not a very linear writer \u2014 my mind jumps all over the place, and nothing\u2019s so brilliant I can\u2019t forget it a minute later, so I\u2019m constantly jumping downpage to type a sentence so I don\u2019t forget what I want to include, and then returning to my previous paragraph, and then stepping back a few paragraphs to check a wording, and sometimes moving sections around \u2026 it\u2019s all very recursive.Most everything I write then goes through three to five rounds of proofreading/editing before I hit the Publish button.  Even then, when it\u2019s finally published, I\u2019ll often see that silly typo a little while later than that I go back and fix.  My biggest typographical error lately has been my fingers \u201cautofilling\u201d and typing the wrong word that had some similar letters; it\u2019s not misspelled, so the spell-check doesn\u2019t catch it, unlike my more common errors of transposed letters.  Overall, my spelling style and vocabulary wanders back between US and UK usages, which reflects both my own research reading background, and my inability to remember which usages are for which places.  In light of the fact that I have readers all over the world anyway, I don\u2019t consider this to be a problem.One of my challenges is to figure out the reading level of my audience.  When I post regularly, I get about 250-400 hits per day.  Obviously not all of those result in someone reading the entire post, but even so, I really have no idea who the bulk of you blog readers are, or what your backgrounds are.  I try to strike a balance between using technical or scholarly language with plain writing that\u2019s not simplistic, and include links or definitions for those terms that are probably obscure to the average reader.  Then again, I\u2019m not afraid to use \u201cbig words\u201d because I assume that none of you are \u201caverage readers\u201d!  (grin)5. Do you try to maintain a central theme for your blog and avoid random topics that don\u2019t fit the theme?No, the theme has pretty much evolved.  I do try to achieve some balance, posting lighter stuff (humourous bits, happy news) after I\u2019ve had several heavy posts of ranting or bad news.  After all, photographs of insects doesn\u2019t really relate to social commentary about the world of Special Education.  On the other hand, there are a lot of things I learned about behaviour and sensory processing with regards to insects that do have parallels in Special Education \u2014 everything in the world is related to everything else at some level!\n\n6. Are there any interesting rituals associated with your blogging?Well, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s really difficult for me to concentrate when anyone else is around, so I blog when I\u2019m alone in my room, cats & tarantula notwithstanding.  I tend to rock when I\u2019m thinking.  I also like to put a piece of jazz or instrumental music on Repeat for background noise to drown out the tinnitus and help me stay focused. Right now I\u2019m listening to \u201cTake Five\u201d by the Dave Brubeck Quartet.Most days when I wake up in the morning I\u2019m really achy, if not a trifle nauseous.  But I\u2019m always curious to see if anyone\u2019s posted a reply to what I blogged about the night before, so that helps me roll out of bed.  Unfortunately, a lot of posts never get any comments, and I\u2019ve yet to figure out why people comment on some posts and not others!  But for those who do, thank you.On a Monday morning, a tired woman in yellow honeybee pyjamas is sitting in her rocker, staring blearily at her computer screen and checking to see if anyone else is out there in the blogosphere. \u201cGood morning, bloggers!\u201d", "outgoing_links": ["http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2007/09/randomness-and-meme.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/09/24/how-and-why/", "title": "How and Why"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t6 September 2007 ", "body": "Once Upon A Time\u2026I had a great counsellor.  That sort that gives you unconditional positive regard, and listens to what you\u2019re actually saying (instead of what they\u2019re expecting), and who also asked especially good questions.  Some of the questions were of the Zen-master category of counselling, the sort that jog you from your everyday running, smacking palm to forehead and saying, \u201cOH!\u201d or else stopped you short because you had been doing something totally irrational and then had it pointed out to you when you were at a point to heed such.  Other questions were more like planting little seeds, things that seemed innocuous at first but that later proved to be much greater things.This is the story of the little seed question.  It was a very dangerous question, not in the hazardous sense, but in the transformational sense.I went in to my counselling session feeling really stressed.  I suppose this is kind of stating the obvious, because no one goes to a counsellor when they\u2019re not stressed to the gills.  But instead of addressing what was going on in various arenas of my life, the usual three-ring circus of school-work-family, he asked about what I did to deal with stress.I didn\u2019t have much of an answer.  Granted, I had managed to avoid various self-destructive activities like drugs, alcohol, eating disorders, cutting and other SIBs*.  And I did have a good diet and tried to get some exercise. I did not, however, find a lot of common social activities to be relaxing (and a university with 20,000 students has no lack of events).  Indeed, I had to make a point of planning a social event once a semester.  I could say that I liked to read extensively about my current topic of interest, and that I found my twice-weekly two-hour commutes to be relaxing \u2026 and then I got stuck.Sadly, over the years I had lost some coping methods, at the expense of gaining other skills. I didn\u2019t even want to admit to myself that I couldn\u2019t recognise my own needs any more, those highly-individualised needs of the sort that Maslow never put on his pyramid.Then he asked the dangerous question, \u201cWhat would it take for you to feel comfortable?\u201dI didn\u2019t know.  I would have to think about that.Which I did, because there wasn\u2019t any point in the whole exercise if I didn\u2019t address important questions. I began by realising that the answer had two parts:  Firstly, one becomes more comfortable by removing discomforts, and secondly, one becomes more comfortable by adding comforts.  Well yeah, that sounds like a \u201cDuh\u201d, but determing the details really required a lot more self-aware analysis than you might expect.What made me uncomfortable?  Over the days I began to compile a list.  It sounded like a list of piddly-ass complaints, because it was full of the sorts of things that I had been repeatedly told that \u201cshould not\u201d bother me.  It was full of the things that weren\u2019t horrible individually, but piled up all day long and created ambient background stress.  There were annoying, itchy clothes tags.  There were all manner of noisy, smelly, visually-overwhelming things. There was the (crowded, noisy, rambunctious, smelly) dining hall and the (crowded, noisy, smelly) public bathroom on my doorm floor that had driven me to take a campus apartment after three semesters.  There was always shoes. There were the noisy flickering lights and dusty fixtures and cramped ugly desks and rickety chairs and endless phone calls (and OMG did someone microwave leftover eel for lunch today) that made it so hard to study in the Graduate Student Suite.**  (And the inevitable oversexed roaches, because the department was in a huge, rambling old building that had needed refurbishing since before the undergrads were even born.) There was the intimately personal annoyance of tinnitus, and also the attention-drawing \u201cover-reactions\u201d of being startled by any number of alarms, clinks, clashes or smashes, due to the hyperacussis.What made me comfortable?  Well, that was a more key question, because there are some things one cannot avoid (although finally realising that if the damn clothes tags bother me, I can cut them out! really helped).  Taking my shoes off made me almost instantly happy.  Removing socks was even better (Free the toes!), but just slipping off my shoes, or unbinding myself from hiking boots, and sitting cross-legged on a padded chair was bliss.   Taking breaks, just getting away from everyone and everything to some small oasis for my lunch hour, proved to be wonderfully therapeutic for de-stressing and recharging my mental batteries for the rest of the day. Music was fabulous, or rather, listening to my own music was fabulous, because it drowned out the tinnitus and other background noises and helped me focus on whatever I needed to do.  Indirect, incandescent lighting  was relaxing.  Even having my own mug and tea-making equipment creating little puddles of bliss in the day (cheap tea from a small Styrofoam cup almost makes things worse).  Really new or LCD computer monitors also made my life much easier, because there wasn\u2019t the flickering to give me headaches. Not such extraordinary things.  But rocking, I found, was soothing \u2014 not the stereotypical back-and-forth rocking, but a slight side-to-side rocking.  Rocking is considered to not be a grown-up thing; it\u2019s the sort of thing you\u2019re trained to not do, much like you\u2019re trained not to sit with your feet on the chair seat.  Neither is staring off into space considered to not be a grown-up thing; but after a while, I collected several shiny blue or green spirals to hang from the ceiling, lovely objects for staring at while thinking about things.Once I began identifying these various important details, the personal accommodations given by me to me, I started making small adjustments in my habits and my surroundings.  I slowly learned to monitor my stress levels better, although I won\u2019t say that I am always good at being aware of them.   I also began to implement little bits of advocacy to get what I needed; for example, if I was the only one in a lab, I turned off the overhead fluorescent lights and turned on an incandescent desk lamp I\u2019d bought.  I learned to ignore the funny looks from strangers about my random motor tics or hyperacussic reactions, and gradually started to shed that \u201ckick me\u201d aura, and practiced being comfortably \u201cout\u201d as a bit of an oddball person, in the positive sense. (We need to both practice self-acceptance and model acceptance, and we need to practice expecting of others that respectfulness of both ourselves and others.)It\u2019s extremely stressful spending all day pretending to be normal. Often we need to give ourselves the personal accommodations that we need to be comfortable in our worlds, and avoid being over-stressed \u2014 regardless of whether or not others think the stresses or accommodations are \u201cimportant\u201d.* SIBs = Self-Injurious Behaviours** suite in sensu stricto \u201ca group of connected rooms\u201d; there was nothing fancy about it", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs", "http://www.uwec.edu/counsel/pubs/selfinj.htm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/a-most-dangerous-question/", "title": "A Most Dangerous\u00a0Question"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t25 September 2007", "body": "When you are looking at a particular problem behaviour in a child (student), the big question is, \u201cIs it really a problem?\u201d  \u201cProblem\u201d does not mean it\u2019s unusual, or that some people are uncomfortable because it\u2019s a \u201cstereotypical autistic thing\u201d.  \u201cProblem\u201d means someone is getting hurt, or in danger, or poses a considerable social issue.   Rocking is not a problem, head-banging is. Lining toys up is not a problem, biting people is.A great many of people\u2019s responses can be categorised as trying to get something or to get away from something. If you\u2019re trying to get rid of a problem behaviour, then you need to figure out what\u2019s going on.  If you can figure out what the stressor is, then you can avoid or reduce it.  If you can figure out what the behaviour provides to the person, then you can figure out a more suitable replacement behavior that will provide a benefit, without the problematic issues also associated with it.Let\u2019s say you have a student (client, child) who is hurting themself.  What is our goal here?  The proximate (immediate) goal is for the child to stop the self-injurious behaviour (SIB).  The ultimate (long-term) goal is for the child to find a better way of fulfilling whatever need they have that is causing the behaviour. Of course, we need to identify what it is that the child is trying to get or to avoid by doing the SIB.  Obviously the child needs better coping skills.  But as part of that skills teaching, we must also figure out what it is that the child is reacting to, and what need the SIB fulfills, no matter how badly that need is addressed.  In other words, we have to figure out the function of that behaviour.This is important for several reasons.  The major reason is that unless we can figure out why the problem exists, we don\u2019t have a reasonable hope of truly solving it. Sometimes one dangerous behaviour gets eliminated, only to be replaced by a different, but equally dangerous behaviour.  Another reason is that these harmful responses communicate to us that there is something seriously wrong going on in the child\u2019s life, possibly (if not probably) several somethings.  It\u2019s imperative that we figure out what those are, so we can address them.  Although SIBs are indeed very important behavioural concerns, they can be symptoms of other problems, not the main problems themselves.We also need to remember that SIBs, like other big problems sometimes seen in students with autism or other developmental disabilities, are not really \u201ccaused\u201d by autism or bipolar disorder or mental retardation (cognitive disabilities) et cetera. Very few autistic children have SIBs, and not all children who injury themselves are autistic. Of course, it\u2019s also important to rule out reactions to organic problems such as ear infections, seizures, or whatnot.The reason we do all this is because it is bad to hurt yourself.We don\u2019t want our children hurt.  We don\u2019t want them hurting themselves, or other people.  We don\u2019t want them to believe that hurting themselves (or others) is a good way of dealing with stresses.  We want them to be able to learn to identify when they are stressed, and to learn different, effective, safe ways of dealing with those stresses.Given all that,  I truly cannot find any rational justification for the use of painful aversives as a means of training individuals to not harm themselves, or anyone else.  If hurting yourself is bad, and hurting others is bad, how is it then okay to use intensely painful aversives on someone?  Repeatedly, hundreds of times, under inescapable circumstances, for weeks and months on end?Certainly, zapping someone with unavoidable, painful electrical stings on bare skin will stop them in their tracks.  It stops the self-injury by that default.  Punishment will stop people from doing something, at least while the threat of punishment still exists.But it doesn\u2019t help us figure out why the person was hurting themself.   It doesn\u2019t teach them how to identify when they are stressed, and to learn different, effective, safe ways of dealing with those stresses. There are students who have been incarcerated at the Judge Rotenberg Center for years past their legal majority.  That system does not provide them much in the way of tools to live successfully outside of the institutional environment.  All the students are given their educational content by way of sitting through computerized programs, and regardless of their problems, are taken off all psychiatric medications. They live at the center full time, and about half of them spend their waking hours wearing battery backpacks and electrodes of the GED device, so they may be shocked at a moment\u2019s notice, for any immediate or past infringement of the rules.  One hates to even contemplate how this kind of approach further traumatises a child who suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder even before they got there.  So far, six children have died while attending this institution.Some supporters of the JRC will assert that using  the GED is the only way to stop these disturbed children from hurting themselves, as the methods at their previous placements didn\u2019t work. But this is a false dilemma \u2014 it\u2019s not a question of \u201cpainful electric shocks or nothing\u201d.    And while it\u2019s true that a few students are over-medicated, and that some people do react badly to some medications, this is not the same thing as saying that no one should ever use psychiatric medications.If hurting yourself is bad, and hurting others is bad, how is it then okay to use intensely painful aversives on someone?  We don\u2019t even use things like this in prisons.  Why is it deemed \u201cokay\u201d by school districts and courts for children with learning disabilities and emotional problems to be subjected to this kind of treatment?People who injure themselves have a very painful set of problems.  But we as a society have an even greater problem.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t28 September 2007", "body": "\u201cPower surges\u201d is the common joke phrase referring to having menopausal hot flashes.Oh, yes.  Because what\u2019s life without something new to deal with?  And naturally, it\u2019s something inter-twined with everything else.  Generally when women experience menopause, it\u2019s because their hormones are going from the usual monthly oscillation to a damped oscillation, where the ups and downs get smaller and smaller.  Mine aren\u2019t \u2014 this is the thrill of quitting my HRT (hormone replacement therapy) that I\u2019d been on after surgery five years ago.  In a mere day\u2019s time, I went from a low dose HRT to nothing.  Klud. First I had what my OB/GYN described as an ovarian cyst the size of an orange, which cyst+ovary she somehow managed to remove from a mere 1\u2033 (2.5 cm) incision. (I suppose that pulling out large objects from narrow passages is the specialty of OB/GYNs.)  Having been relieved of that painful annoyance, things went well for about a year, and then I started having the periods from hell again.  They turned into the periods from hell with interperiods that were nearly as bad \u2014 now I had endometriosis.That was bad enough, but the worse part wasn\u2019t the surgical solution \u2014 it was the fact that I was in my second semester of a difficult graduate program.  And having problems with my Advisor, because under the close academic scrutiny, and with my accompanying chronic and worsening medical problem,  my undiagnosed learning difficulties were getting more and more problematic.  I\u2019d spent years figuring out how to compensate (sometimes brilliantly) for the ADHD and APD and whatnot, but those (often unconscious) coping strategies were growing less effective with the increasing stress and pain and nausea.I needed that surgery.  But it required a three to six-week post-op recovery period.   And that semester I was taking four graduate-level classes along with working 20 hours a week in the lab (research graduate students normally take two classes per semester).  My OB/GYN shook her head at me, and as a mercy, gave me prescriptions to go on birth control pills for three months solid, taking just the active pills so I would at least be spared the worst of those menstrual periods.The surgery went well; it was a laproscopic-vaginal sort, meaning three little incisions in my abdomen to remove my uterus and remaining ovary.  I had no more plans for having any more children, and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to miss having my period!  Really, the loss of those organs didn\u2019t bother me at all; my self-image is not tied up in being a \u201cbreeder\u201d. The children still make fun of how loopy I was from being doped up on morphine post-op.  No matter, I was only on it for a couple of days.  But the second day I had a preview of things to come with my first surgically-induced hot flashes.  OMG.  It was like an instant fever!  Or stepping out of an air-conditioned vehicle to the blast furnace of Hays, Kansas in August.Not to fear, she put me on HRT.  I developed hypertension problems, so my GP put me on medication for that.  Then I found out I was having side effects to those meds for my side-effects!  Polysyllabic expletive!   Meanwhile, despite getting all As and Bs in my classes, I was in dire straits academically.  I made an appointment with the uni\u2019s counselling department.  I was stressed to the gills, and also wanted to figure out why everything was so darn difficult for me in ways that it wasn\u2019t for others.  I had begun to read about AD/HD and was recognising way too many familiar issues \u2026Meanwhile, the doc tweaked my HRT again, and the third time was the charm.  Until a week ago.  I\u2019d had the familiar ADD glitch and forgotten to get my \u2018script refilled for the little patches, and by the time I remembered on Sunday (the day I actually needed it), I couldn\u2019t get them because I was out of refills on the prescription and the doctor\u2019s office was closed.Hot flashes suck.  It\u2019s not just the annoyance and discomfort of the \u201cinstant fever\u201d that comes and goes (dressing in layers is imperative).  It\u2019s the fact that you wake up several times a night to throw off the covers.  And then wake a while later to grope for the blankets because you\u2019re cold.   Waking up repeatedly during the night is lousy for good sleep.  Worse, I rely on the comforting pressure of blankets and pillows to help me relax and get to sleep.  That\u2019s hard to do when the heavy bedding suddenly becomes suffocating. Oh, and did I mention that we also had a humdinger of a window-rattling thunderstorm that first night?  And once that cold front left, we\u2019ve been back to the hot, humid summer weather than just goes on and on in this part of the world, leaving the garden parched and me staring longingly at my tweeds and sweaters.  (The guys are also lounging around dispiritedly like wet noodles \u2014 none of us like hot, sunny weather.  Boy has taken to hugging his pumpkin as though it\u2019s an autumn-weather talisman.  \u201cFix it,\u201d he jokes, imploring me to make the weather better, like the cats that expect me to magically make stormy weather go away when they want to go outside.)Monday I was at my GP\u2019s for what was becoming a chronic hypertension issue and dizzy spells.  For most of my adult life I\u2019ve had great blood pressure, the exceptions being when I\u2019m in pain or am having drug reactions.  I usually have just one or two cups of caffeine a day, and don\u2019t consume a lot of salt.  Under normal circumstances, I can even consciously reduce my blood pressure with a few minutes of quiet time.Damn; the reason I\u2019m on a prescription-level analgesic for my arthritis is because the over-the-counter stuff doesn\u2019t help.  But apparently what I\u2019ve been taking lately can also cause hypertension.  So can the HRT.   So now we\u2019re trying a lower (over the counter) dose of the analgesic, and since I\u2019ve been on HRT for five years, it\u2019s time to be getting off it anyway, so go ahead and don\u2019t get that refill.  Sorry, he can\u2019t reduce the HRT dosage instead; I\u2019m already on the lowest dose.Meanwhile, the over-the-counter pain meds don\u2019t really work \u2014 that\u2019s why I went to the rheumatologist for evaluation and prescription meds.  Plus, I\u2019m having those \u201cpower surges\u201d along with the inevitable \u201cpower outtages\u201d (exhaustion) by mid-afternoon for lack of a good night\u2019s sleep all week long. So the GP and I will see if this approach has any benefits, and re-evaluate in a week.  There are several more different things we can try.You know how when you have the flu, and you\u2019re hot and cold and hot and cold, and your everything hurts, and you\u2019re really tired, and kinda nauseous, so you stay home and sleep all day?  It\u2019s like that.  Except I\u2019m \u201cnot really sick\u201d (at least, not with anything contagious), so I drag in to work anyway.Crap.  Sucks to be me some days.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/09/28/power-surges-and-outtages/", "title": "Power surges and\u00a0outtages"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 November 2007", "body": "Bug Girl is citing a new report  (pdf download link), \u201cA National Analysis of Minorities in Science and Engineering Faculties at Research Universities\u201d, in which 100 departments representing 15 disciplines of engineering and science (including social science) were surveyed.  As we might expect, the results suck.  Actually, the results suck even worse than the authors (Dr. Donna Nelson, supervising Christopher N. Brammer and Heather Rhoads)  probably realise.   But before I get ahead of myself, let me share some of what they had to say.The U.S. population is increasing in Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, known collectively as underrepresented minorities (URMs).  Also, the women\u2019s share of the general U.S. work force continues to increase.  Together, URMs and women constitute almost two-thirds of the U.S. population; as their representations increase in the work force, underutilizing their talent and potential in science and engineering is not only impractical, but also detrimental to the nation\u2019s future success.There are several factors to look at when examining such statistics.  These include the percentage of the minority in the overall national population, who complete an undergraduate degree, who complete a graduate degree, who apply for faculty positions, and who are hired as faculty.  The authors do a nice job of going through these steps in their paper. Let\u2019s take this step-wise. (Note:  For easier reading, I removed the citation numbers that were in the original text, as indicated by ellipses within or between sentences.)The percentage of the minority in the overall national population.  Although the representation of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans in the 2006 U.S. population was estimated \u2026 to be 12.8%, 14.8%, and 1.1%, respectively, their representation at almost each point in academia is lower.  The percentage of the minority who complete a graduate degree.Between the years 1986-1995 and 1996-2005, the percentage of Ph.D. recipients who are URMs increased by about 2.5%, a growth rate below that of females (5.9%).  This increase in representation among Ph.D. recipients is much less than the 7% increase in URM representation in the U.S. population from 1980-2000 (18.8 % to 25.9%). \u2026  Most of this 7% increase can be attributed to a rise in the Hispanic population (from 6.4% to 12.6%).The percentage of the minority who complete an undergraduate degree;On average, URM representation in Ph.D. attainment drops from that in B.S. attainment by a factor of 2 to 3.The percentage of the minority who apply for faculty positions;Comparing representations of URMs, shows a disparity between their representations among 1996 \u2013 2005 Ph.D. recipients (the hiring pool) versus FY2007 assistant professors (faculty most recently hired) at the top 100 departments of most disciplines (Table 4). The percentage of the minority who are hired as faculty.As seen in Table 1, the few minority faculty members present in academia are usually concentrated in the lower ranks, chiefly as assistant professors.  For example, in sociology all URMs combined represent 19.2% of assistant professors (newest hires), 11.1% of associate professors, and 10.8% of \u201cfull\u201d professors in FY2007.  In only 3 of the 15 disciplines surveyed in FY2007 are the majority of URM faculty at the rank of associate professor.  In no discipline surveyed was the highest percentage of URMs at the rank of \u201cfull\u201d professor. The opposite is true for White males.Unfortunately, in the past twenty years the number of graduate degrees in the biological/medical sciences has doubled, but the number of faculty positions is roughly the same.  (There are plenty of recent PhD graduates in these sciences who end up as post-doc researchers for some years before getting hired as professors, or eventually move out of academia into industry for better wages et cetera.)Okay, so we know that college degrees and the number of professors among ethnic minorities lags behind population averages.  Alas, not shocking news.  This doesn\u2019t bode well for overall employment levels, and also means a lack of role models for college students, as the authors point out:If minority professors are not hired, treated fairly, and retained, minority students perceive that they will experience the same. This will not encourage them to persist in that discipline.But here\u2019s the kicker:  what kind of person is considered to be of a \u201cminority\u201d?  We know that today\u2019s students are more diverse than they used to.  In fact, the fresh-out-of-high-school student is no longer the main sort of person filling all those lecture hall seats.  Over 73% are \u201cNon-Traditional\u201d students  (over 25 years old, and/or married, and/or with children). Still, aside from ethnic background and age, we\u2019re still missing a large segment of the population from studies. What is the largest minority in the US?It\u2019s not a racial group. The authors are only considering racial or ethnic groups as \u201cminorities\u201d.  Hmn \u2026 when I searched my state\u2019s universities\u2019 Web sites for \u201cminority\u201d I got links for \u201cmulticultural\u201d, meaning \u201cAfrican-American, Native American,          Hispanic and Asian\u201d.    Searching for \u201cdiversity\u201d yielded more information about minorities, and clicking on enough links would lead me to a smattering of other links for religious studies & organisations, disabled student access office & organisation, and if I dug far enough, links for the local LGBT organisation.Certainly students with disabilities who take longer to complete degrees, and students who experience great difficulties in higher education and are not diagnosed with special education needs until they are adults, are also in the Non-Traditional category.Despite Tony Attwood\u2019s half-serious joke about the number of people with Asperger\u2019s in engineering departments, the number of people with various disabilities are still highly under-represented in higher education.  Per a 2002 Census Bureau report, 18% of the US population has a disability. Of all Americans in the 25-64 year age range, 43% were college graduates, but only 22% of those degreed adults had severe disabilities and 33% had non-severe disabilities.  However, the numbers for current disabled students is much lower, comprising only 11% of the undergraduate student body.The points that the report by Nelson, Brammer & Rhoads makes about transitions from secondary school to college, and from undergraduate to graduate school, and to employment as professors, and then having diversity in the faculty to encourage further minority graduates, are very important points.  I included them here because they are important, and because they also apply equally well to people with various disabilities.Reports like this one are necessary, not only for the data results tracking trends, but also for the analyses that describe issues.  But when they focus only upon racial background and sex, they not only miss identifying the largest yet most under-represented minority population, they also perpetuate the cloak of invisibility.", "outgoing_links": ["http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/11/02/minority-and-female-faculty-mia/", "http://cheminfo.chem.ou.edu/faculty/djn/diversity/Faculty_Tables_FY07/07Report.pdf", "http://opa.faseb.org/pages/PolicyIssues/training_datappt.htm", "http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2002/05/05312002.html", "http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2002/05/05312002.html", "http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/010102.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/11/03/still-invisible/", "title": "Still Invisible"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t5 November 2007", "body": "So last night the aspie kid, dad and I were sitting around the kitchen table, playing card games.  We made a dent in some of the leftover Halloween candy, consumed a couple pots of tea, and generally had fun.  Later on that night I was thinking over the evening, and I realised that there were some marked differences compared to similar evenings of my own youth.For one thing, no one was complaining because I jiggled my leg much of the time, or kept popping up to do things.  Nor was there a television show running in the background, as hard-of-hearing dad isn\u2019t fond of extraneous noise.  Compared to card game evenings with my mom, sister and grandma, there was certainly a lot less chit-chat about  celebrities and suchlike.Instead, the teen\u2019s conversation was in large percentage comprised of random movie and program quotes.  The rest of the vocal output was set to \u201cShuffle\u201d mode, with an intermittent selection of sound clips by humming or scatting bits from show themes, classical, jazz, and rock tunes.  Sometimes I riffed off the music clips with one of my own, and a few times we delightfully segued to the same sound clip.When we tired of Uno, we settled on Rummy.  I hadn\u2019t played in a long time, and it took a couple of games to get the strategy down.  About that time, the overall card-playing grew more intense as the teen also became more focused on what cards were being drawn and discarded.  Several times the kid made killing plays by \u201cdumpster diving\u201d and picked up several cards from the discard pile, in order to access a pair of matching numbers that had been added over the turns.\u201cAre you \u2018counting the cards\u2019?\u201d asked dad, meaning memorising everything that had been played by whom.Aspie kid nodded, laying down a couple of sets in front of him, and then playing matching cards off of some of our sets, noting with glee, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious.  I love it!\u201d\u201cGet good at that, you can go to Vegas,\u201d dad joked.\u201cYeah, but would have to put up with all the overwhelming sensory input from the lights and noise,\u201d I added, with a slight shudder at the idea.Mentioning lights reminded dad about some strings of discounted blue holiday lights (fairy lights) he\u2019d picked up at the store, and he went over and tried to string them across the mantle.\u201cOooh, shiny!\u201d I exclaimed in delight.Dad\u2019s efforts at running the wires around random objects on the mantlepiece were wobbly, so I retrieved my hammer and some dyed paneling nails, tapping in a few more camouflaged points across the woodwork, and re-stringing the lights across the length of two walls.  We all admired the airport-runway effect of the lines of blue lights, and decided that with a couple more strings, we could have the entire greatroom outlined. I think we\u2019ll leave them up year-round.Maybe this isn\u2019t how the \u201caverage\u201d 16-year old spends Saturday nights, but we had fun.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/11/05/a-tunes/", "title": "a-Tunes"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t9 November 2007", "body": "So here I am, still trying to find a way to make the job scene work.Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really like my college student tutoring, and special education paraprofessional, and noncredit instructor positions.  It\u2019s just that I\u2019d rather have one job that paid decently, rather than three jobs cobbled together into something that leaves me overworked but seriously underpaid.  (\u201cunderpaid\u201d = $11/hr for someone with a MSc)Lots of schools need teachers. No matter what employment resource I search, there are lots of positions for secondary science and special education teachers.  School districts in every state need them, not just in the US but also in the UK.  But to teach I need certification, and for certification I need a college degree in teaching.  Having dug through the Web sites of well over a dozen universities, I can find lots of programs for current (licensed) teachers to get MEd degrees in special education.  What I\u2019m finding very little of are resources for degreed people to get initial teaching licensure.  At the risk of sounding whiny, I don\u2019t want to have to get a second Bachelors (in secondary science education) before getting a second Masters  (in adaptive special education).  No, I\u2019m not confused about that process; that\u2019s what the head of the SpEd program of the state\u2019s major teacher\u2019s college said I would have to do.  That\u2019s also what similar department heads at other universities said I would have to do.  Two more degrees.Lots of people want to be teachers. I applied for a transition-to-teaching program in a nearby urban county, and was one of over 200 applicants for a mere 25 positions. There are also a couple of universities that offer programs for people to get restricted teaching licenses, for those degreed-yet-uncertified people who are offered positions by districts that cannot find certified people to fill the positions.  Such districts are usually way-the-hell-out-and-gone in the hinterlands of the rural corners of the state.  I don\u2019t have any problem with teaching in such districts, but I\u2019m not wholly independent to just up and move \u2014 we have a house in need of repairs in an area with a poor seller\u2019s market, and I\u2019ve a high school junior with special education needs who is struggling, and also a husband who would need to find new employment.  In other words, the usual messy details of life keep me from being free to simply jump ship.  (And of course, two main impediments to the whole house fix-it-up issue are my rather unsurprising lack of both time and money.)In any regard, all these initial certification programs require two years of classes.  The classes and training I\u2019ve already had in college teaching and exceptional students and Asperger\u2019s et cetera don\u2019t even show much promise of being transferable; every school wants their \u201cnine pounds of flesh\u201d at the tuition till. (Well, here in the States; apparently I could get the secondary education degree at Uni Birmingham UK in just 36 weeks. But again there\u2019s the whole moving scenario, plus the horrible $2 : \u00a31 rate, plus visa issues.  Or I could take an online distance education MEd in autism or EBD students from that school, but those won\u2019t get me a teaching job here.)  Then it would take me a third year to get the second SpEd certification.  Somehow, with one student already at college, and those fabulous low-paying jobs, I don\u2019t have a lot of money for another three years of college for myself.I\u2019m not quibbling about the need for qualified professionals in the world of education; of course we need people who know both the subject material and the process of education.  It\u2019s just that there\u2019s such a need for teachers, and such a large number of people who want to work in the field, but there seem to be so many things in the state\u2019s Department of Education\u2019s system that are blocking the transition process*.  ::sigh::* Don\u2019t get me started on the whole \u201cIntelligent Design\u201d and state science standards rant \u2026 it only increases the urge to emigrate.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/argh/", "title": "Argh"},

Most of the online personality-type tests are an absolute waste of time (I\u2019d much rather work out a Sudoku), but once in a great while one will catch my attention long enough for me to actually complete it, such as the nerd test.  Okay, so at a 93% I\u2019m not as nerdy as Bug Girl, who earned a \u201cNerd God\u201d score of 99! On the other hand, last time I took the AQ Test (Autism Quotient), I scored a 45, which is pretty dang high \u2026 especially for a female.And for a third item, my Myers-Briggs result is the rare \u201cINTJ\u201d (Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging), also known as \u201cthe scientist\u201d.   This is my favourite quote from the description:Perhaps the most fundamental problem, however, is that INTJs really want people to make sense.\n~ Marina Margaret HeissYeah.  I\u2019m still working on that making sense-of-people business.  Judging by the numbers of different kinds of tests out there for personalities and cognitive skills, so\u2019s everyone else.  Of course, any test we come up with is going to be a highly artificial construct, rather than something that truly describes what another person is really like.That\u2019s because all tests are based upon schematic models, and all models, whether they are from statistics, ecology, digital graphics, meteorology or any other field, are in many ways nothing more than carefully constructed lies.  Models only set up values for a limited number of variables in a set.  When we run a model simulation, we can throw in different values to see what the results are, but those results are in no way guaranteed to be \u201creal\u201d.  Because all models are artificial, the validity of the results are limited to whatever factors we think to put in them.  You cannot use a model to figure out what kinds of unknown factors you need to have; you can merely get a very different result than the reality, and then sit back and say, \u201cGee, what-all did we leave out?\u201d  Likewise, tests do not define people, but rather describe a particular facet, and how one person compares to others.This is not to say that tests and models are useless.  They give us transferable schema; little world-view models that we can share with one another and pass along to describe and more-or-less measure things.  Being able to measure, describe and share information is important to communication and to the ongoing development of culture.But no matter what sort of tests, measurements and models we use to describe special learning needs or autism or disability or imagination or intelligence or any other constructs, we need to remember that they can be excellent tools, and also that they are inherently limited.  We want to avoid \u201cmaya\u201d, or foolishly believing that our mental maps are the same as the territory or world that they model.Enough of all that high-brow analysis \u2014 what\u2019d you get?", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numb3rs", "http://www.nerdtests.com/nq_ref.html", "http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/10/13/im-sure-this-is-a-suprise-to-no-one/", "http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/11/07/con5truct5/", "title": "Model5"},

Not only does this provide us with a new resource for stories (the joy and annoyance of families is the oft-repeated stories), but also someone else to talk with about science and science fiction and gaming and politics, or watch episodes of CSI.Having a guest means that the all my cooking seems even more worthwhile, and the food gets eaten up more effectively.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 November 2007", "body": "I once saw a bumper sticker that claimed lotteries were \u201ca tax on the innumerate\u201d, meaning that most of the people who gamble on such do so because they don\u2019t really understand the mathematics of basic probability (chance).  It does seem to be alarmingly true that a great number of people don\u2019t have a good understanding of odds.  Sure, some people simply gamble for the gaming aspect, but casinos aren\u2019t getting rich off folks like my grandma who got together with friends at each other\u2019s homes once a month to chat and play penny-ante poker \u2014 they\u2019re in business to make money off those who keep thinking that they\u2019ve figured out some kind of \u201csystem\u201d or that they\u2019ve some kind of special \u201cluck\u201d or who are addicted to gambling.There are some really odd ways the human brain works against reality, especially when it comes to understanding probabilities. The brain likes to find patterns, even when they aren\u2019t there.  People think that if there\u2019s a pattern even if it\u2019s only there for a short period of time, that things are not really random. Actually, \u201crandom\u201d events do include patterns \u2014 it\u2019s just that the patterns don\u2019t repeat.  (One of the ways we can tell that someone is creating false data is the lack of these pseudo-patterns \u2014 the data is too evenly random, which is an unlikely event.)   When people see patterns that don\u2019t really exist as true patterns, they think that they have found some kind of underlying truth or system, and assume that will enable them to win long-term.  Unfortunately, that almost never happens.People also engage in \u201cmagical thinking\u201d, such as when they believe that the dice \u201cremembers\u201d and therefore assume that it will either roll the same way again, or that a certain number combination \u201chas to\u201d happen.  Sorry, it doesn\u2019t.  When you roll a die again, the odds of a certain side coming up are still 1/6 (on a 6-sided die).  Odds are also multiplicative; the odds of getting two 5\u2019s is 1/6 * 1/6 or 1/36.  In our schools, probability is a textbook chapter that happens during pre-algebra mathematics, after the students have learned how to do calculations with fractions.  Unfortunately, we invariably have some students who although they can perform the calculations correctly, still refuse to believe in the true randomness of the universe.There are other mathematical concepts that some people struggle with, such as negative integers.  Apparently some people continue to struggle with these concepts through adulthood, as indicated by a recent story from the UK about lottery scratch cards:Tina Farrell, from Levenshulme, called Camelot after failing to win with several cards.\nThe 23-year-old, who said she had left school without a maths GCSE, said: \u201cOn one of my cards it said I had to find temperatures lower than -8. The numbers I uncovered were -6 and -7 so I thought I had won, and so did the woman in the shop. But when she scanned the card the machine said I hadn\u2019t.\n\u201cI phoned Camelot and they fobbed me off with some story that -6 is higher \u2013 not lower \u2013 than -8 but I\u2019m not having it.\u201dLike Mark C.C., I find the line \u201cbut I\u2019m not having it\u201d really tickles me \u2014 as thought mere obstinacy can change the whole of mathematics! To be sure, to some people it\u2019s not intuitive that -6 is lower, smaller number that is further from zero than is -5.  Perhaps the wording of the lottery cards was part of the difficulty; the frustrated lottery player also explained,\u201cI think Camelot are giving people the wrong impression \u2013 the card doesn\u2019t say to look for a colder or warmer temperature, it says to look for a higher or lower number. Six is a lower number than 8. Imagine how many people have been misled.\u201dWhen I have worked with students on this topic, we have used two different visual examples to help clarify things.  One of those is using distance above or below sea level, and the other \u2014 perhaps surprisingly, in light of this news piece \u2014 is using the thermometer.  Both the distance and temperature examples make use of vertical number lines, which seem to help disengage the usual secondary-school student\u2019s distaste for ordinary horizontal number lines that are associated with little kids\u2019 maths.  It\u2019s also no surprise that -3 is 3 below 0, or that -7 is two degrees lower than -5, or that if you are 5 feet above sea level and the bottom of the ocean dockside is 12 feet below sea level, that your anchor or fishing line would need to go 17 feet down to touch bottom.Another thing that most students don\u2019t see the utility of is \u201cabsolute value\u201d; the absolute value of +10 is 10 and so is the absolute value of -10.  What\u2019s the point? ranted one student.  What indeed!  Absolute value is simply the distance from zero in any direction, which makes more sense when graphing and looking at X, Y and Z co\u00f6rdinates, as opposed to two directions on a number line.Closely related to these are the difficulties people have with time zones.  Greenwich is the 0 point of our circular number line, and the date line is where the two ends of the time zones meet.  (Personally, I\u2019ve always found these sorts of calculations to be much easier using the 24-hour military or train clock.)  If you go west, the time gets earlier (subtract the number of time zones) and if you go east, the time gets later (add the number of time zones).  If it\u2019s 9:09 PM or 21:09 in New York City (Eastern US time zone), then it\u2019s 2:09 AM in London (five hours later), and 7:09 PM or 19:09 in Denver (Mountain US time zone, two hours earlier).  So how do time zones relate to absolute value?  It\u2019s always five hours later in London than in New York, and it\u2019s always two hours earlier in Denver than in New York.  It doesn\u2019t matter what time of day is on the clock, whether it\u2019s morning, afternoon or evening.And no, despite the joke, crossing the International Date Line doesn\u2019t affect when your time-release medication is going to wear off.  The stuff lasts four or twelve (or whatever) elapsed, real-time hours since you took it.  When I was given my hormone-replacement therapy medication (post-op from a hysterectomy), I was to put on a fresh patch twice a week.  \u201cOh,\u201d I said, after thinking for a few seconds, \u201cthat would mean Wednesday evening and Sunday morning.\u201d  My doctor beamed at me in delight \u2014 I had correctly halved the seven-day week!What\u2019s the use of learning maths?

(The amount of time required to make them, and the insistence of so many people that \u201cflash cards are a good study method\u201d made me loathe to toss them back then.)\nI sorted through no less than three different binders of old business cards, many of which were to now-defunct businesses, to people whom I no longer remember, to people who no longer work at those businesses, and to businesses that have moved.\nI added to the designated Used Book Store box several volumes of antiquated horticulture books, and it will also get unused cookery books in a couple of days.\nI still need to move my binders of \u201ctear-sheets\u201d, the original copies of several hundred articles from my freelance writing days (exciting topics like real estate & automotive news ::yawn:: as well as horticultural advice).It wasn\u2019t all about trashing \u2014 I also found  a couple of long-lost insect pins (bee and butterfly broaches, but no roach broaches), several very nice professional reviews (now neatly stowed together in a folder for easy referencing), and some Lire-Schillings-Pence that have been out of circulation for several years.  After consolidating supplies I realised that I have hoarded enough re-usable padded mailers and manila envelopes to set up a small shipping company, and I also collected together a bunch of references I\u2019ll need for a new class I\u2019m going to teach next semester.  Having freed space in the file cabinet (Nature abhors a vacuum, yadda-yadda) I moved a bunch of educational references from binders to labelled file folders, where it\u2019s now easier to find what I\u2019m looking for.I also discovered that after teaching continuing education for years, I\u2019ve not had a raise since 1995 :: grumble :: (I don\u2019t think it\u2019s me \u2014 my reviews are great; it\u2019s just the general economics of higher education).There are still big jobs ahead of me, such as painting the walls of the room being gradually emptied, then moving bookcases in and subsequently moving and sorting a couple dozen boxes of books to set the place up as a home library (don\u2019t be shocked when I say that one of our offspring is an English major).  But doing that should occupy no more than three pleasant (if necessarily protracted) days.The biggest job ahead of me is the pictures.  OMG do I have photos!  I have no less than two xerographic paper (photocopier / printer paper) cartons full of loose 35 mm plant and insect slides that I need to sort out and file away (by category, then alphabetic by genus and species, naturally).  I already have nearly a dozen binders of sorted slides to add these to.  Thankfully purging all that paper freed up more binders.  I will also be tossing the less-than-stellar slides, although I suspect that won\u2019t make a giant dint in the supply.  Last winter I spent free hours and hours scanning the slides I needed for my teaching PowerPoints, to the point where I have so many that I must back up the folder onto a DVD (and that\u2019s at mere 400 kb size jpg files).Last year\u2019s seed catalogs are easy to pitch, which is a good thing, because hubby just brought me my first seed catalog of the season!    (Ah seed catalogs \u2014 what one wit referred to as \u201cgarden p*rn\u201d.)   But right now I\u2019m dithering on the several years\u2019 supply of garden magazines.  I think I\u2019ll ask my gardening partner-in-grime and an art teacher if either wants them, and if not, then I must fling them into the dumpster the morning of trash pickup, and dare not look back.Forward; with a nod to the necessary Primary Source Documentation of my life, I must continue to Look Forward. Otherwise I risk putting the floor joists to peril \u2026P.S. I\u2019m sure a great many of you can relate to this (I couldn\u2019t have said it better myself):  the Procrastination Flow Chart.* No, I don\u2019t have an OCD diagnosis, despite jibes from my co-workers.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t24 November 2007 ", "body": "I went to the pharmacy to get some regular prescriptions refilled.  Hubby has a new employer, which means we\u2019re under a new insurance plan, which means sharing the newest insurance information with every one of our regular doctors and with the pharmacists.  Oh the joys of paperwork \u2013 not.  This time instead of a co-pay for prescriptions we have a (really, really big) deductible to meet before the insurance pays for things. I can sure vouch that the co-pay system with the previous insurer was a lot less stressful on my blood pressure.  OMG the sticker shock!My $9 blood pressure medication was no big deal.  Getting just four migraine pills for $89 was alarming, especially as the kid takes two at a time, but the pharmacist explained that this insurance company only lets them fill four pills at a time.  A month\u2019s supply of ADHD meds was $109. (Yes, I\u2019ve tried going without, and were I coping with just ADHD things wouldn\u2019t be as bad, but you don\u2019t want to hear about all the forgotten appointments and scorched pans et cetera; meds are just a part of my coping strategies.)  Dang, that was a big check for all that.Then a couple days later I went back to pick up some meds for hubby.  I\u2019ll refrain from details except to mention that when the pharmacist began to ring up his meds, she paused to ask \u201cDo you still wan to fill these \u2018scripts for the asthma meds \u2014 as the pills are $101, and the inhaler is $250?\u201dI was stunned, and stammered, \u201cY-y-y-yes, they\u2019re his asthma m-m-meds \u2026\u201d  As in, of course the guy needs them so he can BREATHE okay!  And I wrote a check for $486.  OMG \u2014 this is not helping my blood pressure.  Polysyllabic expletive!The hell of it is, we\u2019re lucky \u2014 we have medical insurance.  We can pay for our necessary medications (by getting them filled at approved pharmacies), and when we need to we can go see a GP or specialist (ditto from the insurance company\u2019s approved list of \u201cservice providers\u201d).For those of you from abroad, the medical insurance situation in the US truly is a horrifying and baffling mess. It\u2019s not about \u201cmanaged health care\u201d but rather \u201cmanaged health care COSTS\u201d. Each insurance company views their subscribers as accounts receivable, and subscribers who draw more resources than they pay in, or who could potentially could do so, are considered to be liabilities to be avoided.  \u201cPre-existing conditions\u201d are important because they can prevent a person from being accepted by a new insurance carrier.   Yes, that\u2019s correct \u2014 that means that sometimes people are denied medical insurance because (gasp!) they need medical insurance because they have health problems.  (Hence one reason why people are hoping that GINA, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, will get passed.)But we\u2019re still thankful \u2014 if not downright lucky \u2014 that we have health insurance.  Like many people, we have stared down that darker road, and scrambled to avoid it.  The week after I got pregnant with our first child, hubby was one of many to lose his job in a company downsizing. He was the only one of the two of us who subscribed to a medical insurance plan; because I had a minimum-wage job, we had previously deemed that there was no point in reducing my income by subscribing to a second policy.  Per the usual arrangement, employees paid something like half the monthly costs at his place of business.Getting insurance coverage was the issue \u2014 he had that \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d of asthma, for which he must take daily medications and which before the advent of better meds, landed him in emergency care now and then. (And of course, there are minor things like hearing aids and batteries so he can hear, and eyeglasses so we both can see. I don\u2019t think our insurance covered those much, if at all.) Fortunately my maternal \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d had not yet been documented by a doctor, so officially it did not yet exist.I was still employed, so we wouldn\u2019t have qualified for state assistance.  The good news was that we were able to have medical insurance (to pay for his medications and my maternal care and future pediatric care) by continuing to pay for the plan wholly on our own (meaning both the employee\u2019s and employer\u2019s costs), under a COBRA arrangement, which fortunately had come into existence just a year before.  Twenty years ago that was some $500 per month \u2014 half our annual income of $12,000! We literally had to sell our house to continue medical coverage. (Given that we\u2019d only had the mortgage a few years, we had little equity, but we were lucky to have even that.)  The prenatal care, labor & delivery and neonatal pediatric doctor care ran close to $2,000, and my obstetrician had to argue with the insurance company to let me stay a second day after delivery, which was just as well because Baby needed a little time under the Bili Lights.  Nowadays uneventful prenatal plus L&D runs about five times that much.Like millions of others, several times in the past 25 years hubby has been unemployed due to company downsizing layoffs.  Each time we go through the same ordeal of figuring out where our health insurance coverage will come from.You might wonder, Doesn\u2019t the US have some kind of health care plan for its citizens?  Well, there\u2019s Medicare, which serves people over 65 years of age, and the disabled.  Unfortunately, Medicare coverage is limited in what it will cover, and there are still premiums, deductables and co-pays that must be paid out-of-pocket.  There are also the various Medicaid programs that are run by each individual state (with some federal assistance) for very impoverished children, parents, seniors and disabled people.  Each state has its own elegibility rules and types of coverage.  Some people can get both Medicare and Medicaid, but the laws governing what is or is not covered by which program are labyrinthine.  There are an alarming number of low-income people who make \u201ctoo much money\u201d to be covered by their state\u2019s Medicare programs, yet are not able to afford insurance or who are denied coverage by various insurance companies.The Institute of Medicine (part of the National Academy of Sciences) reports that:Lack of health insurance causes roughly 18,000 unnecessary deaths every year in the United States.  Although America leads the world in spending on health care, it is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not ensure that all citizens have coverage.Die-hard patriots will strenuously assert that the US is the \u201cgreatest nation to live in\u201d, but the World Health Organization would beg to differ:The U. S. health system spends a higher portion of its gross domestic product than any other country but ranks 37 out of 191 countries according to its performance, the report finds. The United Kingdom, which spends just six percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on health services, ranks 18th.England\u2019s National Health Service was established when the NHS Act was passed in 1946, coming into effect a couple years later.  Over here, the United States National Health Insurance Act was introduced to Congress in \u2026 2006.  It died.  Although a \u201cfree and appropriate public education\u201d is considered to be necessary for every American school child, once the subject turns to free and appropriate medical care, suddenly people start screaming about \u201ccreeping socialism\u201d.Not surprisingly, ensuring medical coverage does something positive for the overall health of a country\u2019s citizens, be they in France, Canada, or England.  As Michael Moore quoted, a JAMA study found:\u201cThe US population in late middle age is less healthy than the equivalent British population for diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, lung disease, and cancer.\u201d\n\u201cLevel differences between countries are sufficiently large that individuals in the top of the education and income strata in the United States have comparable rates of diabetes and heart disease as those in the bottom of the income and education strata in England.\u201d\nBanks, Marmot et al., \u201cDisease and Disadvantage in the United States and in England,\u201d  \t\t\t\t\tJournal of the American Medical Association, 2006; 295:2037-2045Of course, no plan is perfect, and each country\u2019s health care system has its unique problems.  The British Medical Association describes the \u00a36.85 cost of non-exempt medications as a hardship,\u201cThere are many people with chronic conditions who are not exempt and those on low incomes find it very difficult to pay.\u201dI don\u2019t doubt the difficulties faced by people on limited incomes.  But even so, that  \u00a36.85 for a prescription sounds a whole lot better than $250 \u2026 especially as the new year looms and we have to start on a whole new deductible all over again.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t25 November 2007", "body": "I had hoped to get some garden clean-up done this weekend, but it snowed a bit:Given the winter weather, you might wonder how I could be doing another insect story, but right now I\u2019m hosting an extra house guest.  The beetle first showed up wandering the hallway at school, near the back doorway.  Carabids are generally hunters, and many of them are beneficial to us because they eat pest insects.  Chances are you\u2019ve seen the ordinary sort of brown-legged, large black ground beetle running across the sidewalk in search of prey, or maybe hanging around your porch light at night.Carabids can be distinguished by a couple of characteristics:  firstly, the pronotum (the dorsal plate of the prothorax, meaning the section on the back of the beetle that\u2019s between the head and body) is wider than the head but narrower than the rest of the body, and secondly, on the third (hind) legs the trocanter makes a rather distinctive lobe between the femur and coxa (diagram).  Like many sorts of beetles, the elytra are striated, which is a fancy way of saying that the wing-covers are grooved.There\u2019s certainly no lack of beetles in the world; with about 40% of the species, Coleoptera is the largest of the insect orders.  But once you get to know my guest, you won\u2019t forget it \u2014 this is one smashingly gorgeous hexapod!The Caterpillar Hunter (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Calosoma scrutator) also has another common name, the much more exciting Fiery Searcher.Description:   a nearly 3 cm (1.25\u2033) long beetle, with shiny dark blue legs, black antennae, a metallic navy pronotum rimmed in orange, and grooved metallic green elytra rimmed in copper-red.  The beetle is photographed on graph paper, with an off-white caterpillar clenched in it\u2019s pincers. (I put the graph paper in its cage just for better photography, because despite its flashy coloring, the predator is not very noticeable against dark soil.)At school, I carefully scooped up the beetle and popped it into a cage for the students to view safely, because those mandibles can give a nasty bite.  I also bought some \u201cwax worms\u201d (a type of moth caterpillar) at the pet store to feed it, but since the beetle is mostly nocturnal, it proved to be a rather boring classroom pet as it spent most of the days snoozing in a crevice between a small rock and the soil substrate in the cage.  (Well, I assumed it was asleep but it\u2019s hard to tell with animals that lack eyelids; it was alive but not moving.)Ground beetles are so named because that\u2019s where they live; they like the cool damp spots, and hang out underneath rocks and bark and other debr\u00eds.  Females lay individual eggs in the soil, where the larvae will return to pupate.  But being caterpillar hunters, they are also found climbing trees in search of gypsy moth or tent caterpillars, especially during the spring.After a couple of uneventful (read, \u201cboring\u201d) weeks, I took it home.   Adults can live two or three years; I\u2019ve no idea how old this one is, but it might be here some time. Today I waggled a waxworm right in front of its jaws, which prompted a quick response.  My eldest described it as a \u201cdedicated feeder\u201d, as the beetle spent quite a while steadily consuming the caterpillar that was nearly as long as it was.  It was, I noted, also a fastidious eater, as it only ate the insides of the moth larva, finally abandoning the rumpled exoskeleton, much in the way that we leave shrimp shells on our plates.  It then wandered over to the side of the cage by the desk lamp, and sat in the warmth to better digest its dinner.Like the rest of the Thanksgiving diners, my house guest is currently snoozing off its repast.", "outgoing_links": ["http://entomology.unl.edu/images/beneficials/beetles/grndbtls1.jpg", "http://www.envirosafepc.com/ground_beetle.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/11/25/an-unusual-house-guest/", "title": "An unusual house\u00a0guest"},

But outside of the normative social realm, disability is really about how a person does things differently.Within the cultural status quo, the onus of being \u201cacceptable\u201d for consideration to being included by others, is placed upon the person in question, rather than by those who are creating the standards and are choosing to accept or not. Frequently, inclusion must be \u201cearned\u201d by first mastering skills that enable the person to do things normally. Unfortunately,  those skills are often more about enabling the person to pass for normal, than they are about enabling the person to achieve their own needs. For example, when the disabled person is deemed unfit to socialize because others find them \u201ctoo weird\u201d in their mannerisms or communication, this situation actually demonstrates that it is the others have the greater difficulty in socializing.  The disabled person carries the entire burden of being flexible, rather than both parties being flexible to engage in reciprocal socializing.As a disabled person, one must pretend to be normal to avoid discomforting others and thus be acceptable.  The noticeably disabled are kept at arm\u2019s length because they are visible reminders of others fears of frailty, lack of competency, and loss of status.  The invisibly disabled are included until they are outed, and then face the others\u2019 sense of having been deceived. \u201cNormal\u201d is the status quo for not only being average and common, but also being okay and acceptable.Disability is seen as synonymous with incompetence, rather than as a situation where one solves life problems by using different means.  But disability is not about what you can\u2019t do \u2013 it\u2019s about how one does things differently. Using different and adaptive strategies to achieve has somehow been perverted from ability to disability.  It\u2019s disgraceful instead of clever to figure out how to type conversations, or to handle utensils with a foot.  The disabled have to be flexible, but the others\u2019 lack of willingness to be flexible is projected and reflected upon the disabled as a fault.Inclusion in the community is viewed as a privilege rather than as a right.  When people \u201clet\u201d someone be included as a favour, this is not inclusion, it\u2019s marginalisation.  It\u2019s merely visiting the community, instead of living there and being a part of it.  Their continued presence depends upon conditional acceptance, which can be denied at any time, demoting the disabled person once again.Inclusion means being a part of the group, and being given such supports as are needed as a natural matter of course.  When we have to advocate to get \u201cspecial\u201d education and \u201cspecial\u201d transit and \u201cspecial\u201d work accommodations, everyone feels bent out of shape; the nondisabled feel put-upon and slighted, and the disabled feel that they are being singled out for having to make a lot of extra effort to barely achieve their rights and the things they need for ordinary existence.  Inclusion does not mean having to do everything the same way that everyone else does.Sometimes people are taught that they must learn to do everything the same way that everyone else does so they will be competent, and can feel good about their accomplishments.  But no one wants to work three times as hard and take twice as long to do something not quite as well as others, when there is an easier way to achieve the same end with satisfactory results. Putting all that effort at trying to \u201cpass for normal\u201d is an exhausting way to live. A person\u2019s self-worth is not going to improve from by achieving competency in tasks that aren\u2019t important to them, or by achieving tasks that are accomplished with all that vain struggle.Moreover, the standards we have set are arbitrary \u2014 the significance of a task varies from person to person.  One doesn\u2019t have to tie shoelaces, walk on two feet or be consistently toilet-trained to be a happy adult who is part of their community.  We cannot say that to have worth (and therefore be deserving of inclusion) that a person must be able to do tasks X, Y and Z. Personhood is not requisite upon abilities or upon \u201cproductivity\u201d of some work-related function. Rather, people have worth because they are people.When we realize that we cannot live our lives in the perpetual terror of worrying about what others will think, or trying to be what everyone else expects we \u201cmust\u201d be, we are freed. We are freed because we understand that we cannot be such, that we are not just unable but also unwilling to comply. We cannot be defined as less than full people because we do not achieve things by the same means. We are freed because we understand that we cannot be complicit to our own marginalisation.Disability can be liberating not only to those so affected, but also to the nondisabled. As those on the outside stretch the envelope of inclusion, those inside can expand their understandings of inclusion, self-identity and group identity. We can be made more aware of how our sense of identity, inclusion and community have been shaped by the implicit and explicit mores that created and perpetuated such limits. We can also become more aware of the paradoxes that handicap our interactions with each other, and prevent us from social maturation.\u201cDisability is not a \u2018brave struggle\u2019 or \u2018courage in the face of adversity\u2019 \u2026disability is an art. It\u2019s an ingenious way to live.\u201d\n~Neil Marcus", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/11/26/liberation-by-disability-the-paradox-of-competency-and-inclusion/", "title": "Liberation by Disability:  the paradox of Competency and\u00a0Inclusion"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t28 November 2007", "body": "David recently posted the following conundrum in an essay: How do you best convey experiences of living with a disability that are so alien to so many people? Where do you start? How do you convey challenges that people have never even considered?This insightful \u2014 and sometimes \u201cincite-ful\u201d post, because it made me thoroughly annoyed on people\u2019s behalf \u2014 reminded me of a handout I\u2019d found while cleaning out old files. One of many available to university tutors, it was yet another authorless 12-point gem.  (If someone does know the source, kindly let me know!)The page refers to the assumptions we mentally trip over when working with people from other national, religious or ethnic cultures.  I rather doubt that the author(s) considered how broad the cultural spectrum can be.  One doesn\u2019t readily think of the various Deaf cultures, but of course, there they are.  I\u2019m almost certain that they were not thinking of disabled people.  Good heavens, even people studying various aspects of disability politics and history can\u2019t agree on whether there is a \u201cdisability culture\u201d or what it\u2019s comprised of.  Given the vast differences, definitions quickly break down into things like \u201cautistic subculture\u201d and debates thereof.But nonetheless, this is still a spiffy list, so I\u2019m sharing it with you all to mull over and run off with for your own purposes.  This is the delight of blogging:  cross-pollinating one\u2019s brain with all sorts of novel combinations of ideas!Cross-Cultural Relationships\n1. What seems to be logical, sensible, important, and reasonable to a person in one culture may seem stupid, irrational, and unimportant to an outsider.\n2. Feelings of apprehension, loneliness, and/or lack of confidence are common when visiting another culture.\n3. When people talk about other cultures, they tend to describe the differences and not the similarities.\n4. Differences between cultures generally are seen as threatening and described in negative terms.\n5. Personal observations and reports of other cultures should be regarded with a great deal of skepticism.\n6. One should make up one\u2019s own mind about another culture and not rely on the reports and experiences of others.\n7. It requires experience as well as study to understand the many subtleties of another culture.\n8. Understanding another culture is a continues and not a discrete process.\n9. Stereotyping probably is inevitable in the absence of frequent contact or study.\n10. The feeling which people have for their own language is not often evidenct until they encounter another language.\n11.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t30 November 2007", "body": "I\u2019m going to send in a couple of job applications for biology teaching positions at community colleges.  With some 200 credit hours of college education, I\u2019ve been exposed to enough teachers to know that I teach better than some of them.  I\u2019ve had a course in college teaching, over a decade of teaching continuing education (designing my own courses, content, handouts & my own photography), and have been tutoring biology for several years.But of course I\u2019ve not actually applied for such a job before.  So here I am re-doing my teaching philosophy, checking over my resume, chewing over application letter drafts and whatnot.Like everyone, I\u2019m really nervous about the prospect of interviews.  Unlike a lot of people, I have particular difficulties with interviews, such as the prosopagnosia.  This means not recognising people from one day to the next, at least not until I\u2019ve been around them a while.  I hate it when people drag you around a building and introduce you to a gazillion people.  I can barely mentally file away some vague identification characteristics for one interviewer, and even then I never know which details will prove to be the useful ones for recognising them in the future.  Yes, I know \u2026 I spend an hour talking with someone, and then (aside from the name on the business card) I truly can\u2019t remember who the hell they were the next day.  It\u2019s awful.During the actual interview process, I\u2019m running mental circles around the auditory processing difficulties, fidgety-scatterbrained ADHD issues, unconsciously suppressing little motor tics (I shouldn\u2019t have to theoretically, but it\u2019s ingrained habit under such situations), concentrating on trying to make \u201cenough\u201d eye contact (whatever the hell that is), concentrating on speaking clearly and avoiding stuttering, ignoring the tinnitus and joint aches (and hoping against migraine). And being nervous is bad enough without those damn menopausal hot flashes!Of course all that detracts from the amount of energy available for composing brilliant answers.  So my usual interview plan is to anticipate interview questions and then prepare and practice answers. I spend days ruminating over and practicing my short \u201cscripts\u201d while in the car.  Fortunately, I can never remember my answers verbatim, so they don\u2019t come off as sounding \u201ccanned\u201d.Unfortunately, for all I have a large vocabulary and am a well-practiced writer, I\u2019m less able to produce clear, concise answers to unexpected questions.  It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t think of what to say, but rather that all the details of things come to mind at once, and I can\u2019t prioritise and sequence them easily, nor compose paragraphs and then remember them all the way through.So \u2026 anyone out there have specific tips for teaching interviews?  (I\u2019m good on basic interview stuff like professional wardrobe.)  But this is a new kind of interview situation, and I don\u2019t know what sorts of questions are likely to be asked, nor what sorts of unspoken conventions are typical for such a process, or what committees look for.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/11/30/welcome-to-the-first-ring-of-hell/", "title": "Welcome to the first ring of\u00a0Hell"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t6 June 2007 ", "body": "I got a shiny award; I\u2019m so tickled.*thinking blogger AWARDI\u2019ve been meme-tagged! Twice, no less. I shoulda\u2019 said something after the first time, but I got busy with the end of the school spring term (and a few blogposts that grabbed me by the collar and demanded to be written), and then I got tagged the second time and that got delayed because of the beginning of the school summer term (ditto more demanding blogposts \u2014 my Muses are very assertive). Mea culpa.The Thinking Blogger Award is a blogging meme meant to aid in the dissemination of thoughtful blogging (as opposed to the more mundane chit-chat kind of blogging, e.g. \u201cToday I found a cute frock on sale\u201d). Unlike some memes, this one is highly codified in that it has concrete rules, and requires ongoing documentation, which is guaranteed to make historians and literary pundits absolutely delighted. The rules read as follows:\nIf, and only if, you get tagged, write a post with links to 5 blogs that make you think,\nLink to this post so that people can easily find the exact origin of the meme,\nOptional: Proudly display the \u2018Thinking Blogger Award\u2019 with a link to the post that you wrote.\nThe first award was nominated by Sally at Sally\u2019s Life. Sally is a very eclectic blogger in the UK; she blogs on \u201cLife in the countryside, joys, fears, battles, music, literature, art, venues, society, dis-ablism.\u201d Her personal stories in \u201cJust for the Record \u2013 my first 1st May BADD post\u201d (BADD = Blogging Against Disablism Day) were very illuminating, in the sort of bang-head-here way. Sally deserves a set of Wacky Whackers for her forays against the bureaucrazy.The second award was nominated by Bev at Asperger Square 8, who is a very artistic blogger in the US; she blogs \u201cTalk about squares, Asperger syndrome and the number 8\u201d. I get a real kick out of her satirical packages and such, like Chit Chat and \u201cTransport Obsession\u201c, and give her graphics full marks at 8 out of 8.As a primary purpose of the meme is to share links to other good blogs with one\u2019s readers, it runs the risk of getting a trifle inbred, and start sounding like a mutual-admiration society. Therefore I sought to broaden the range of my links from the predecessors. I would like to say that collectively, these people would make a helluva Think Tank, especially if powered by good drink and generous supplies of vegetarian food and chocolate.:: drumroll ::I would like to give the Thinking Blogger Award to the following people. These are in rough alphabetical order (gee I hope none of these are redundancies):Bug Girl, blogger of the eponymous Bug Girl\u2019s Blog. A girl after my own heart, she blogs on insects, gardening, feminism, skepticism and other fun topics, with an elegant and enlightening blend of scientific knowledge and tongue-in-cheek humor. She loves to stomp on pseudoscience bunk, but never cute little membracids (treehoppers). What\u2019s not to like?! I can only hope that the students students at her American uni appreciate her as much as I do.Dave Hingsburger, blogger of Chewing the Fat, \u201cesse quam videri\u201c. Dave manages to post daily, which amazes me in both his constancy and his high level of thoughtfulness. The guy keeps his Canadian passport ever at hand because he travels all the time, but the reason he can tell so many stories is not just because he gets around, but because Dave observes stuff. His post on \u201cSimple Solutions\u201d provided a five-star analysis of what makes for an effective behaviour improvement plan, \u201cDuring the move this fellows family and support workers sat down to talk. To do an annual plan. They decided to rid themselves of the \u2018he will go to the library\u2019 type of goals. After much puzzling they came up with a goal. Simply stated they hoped it would radically change what needed to be radically changed. He will be happy and live harmoniously with himself.\u201dJacq, blogger of ADHD & Me Blog. Don\u2019t fall over in shock, but Jacq is a graduate student, and does something work-wise in the realm of education in Canada. I enjoy reading her posts for her interpretations and pointed comments of her experiences in the r\u00f4les of student, teacher, and parent. Her recent post, \u201cDisability as Diversity in Education\u201d stands out as an exception to her usual terse posts, it being a full scholarly article (it makes my usual posts seem short in comparison, becaused hers is highly referenced).Blue/ Kay Olson, blogger of The Gimp Parade. Yet another disabled feminist who describes herself as \u201covereducated, underemployed\u201d, she keeps a thoughtful and literate blog that\u2019s a combined news service and erudite cultural commentary. She draws from many sources, and refuses to be limited by her US origin. (Then again, she refuses to be limited by a lot of things.) Oh, and she has a wicked sense of humor, too; check out her link for Things that crack me up (swallow beverage first). Her blog\u2019s descriptor is a quote: \u201cNot only do physically disabled people have experiences which are not available to the able-bodied, they are in a better position to transcend cultural mythologies about the body, because they cannot do things the able-bodied feel they must do in order to be happy, \u2018normal,\u2019 and sane\u2026.If disabled people were truly heard, an explosion of knowledge of the human body and psyche would take place.\u201d \u2014 Susan Wendell, author of The Rejected Body: Feminist Philosophical Reflections on DisabilityMs PhD, blogger of YoungFemaleScientist, where \u201cNothing is sacred.\u201d A biomedical postdoc working in a lab somewhere in the US, she naturally does a lot of ranting about the insanities peculiar to such cultural environments. I would award her some Wacky Whackers too, but as she does kickboxing and taiji, there would likely be too many casualties. Her post on \u201cIs this a female thing?\u201d was horrifyingly familiar from my graduate research assistant and clueless-Aspie perspectives, especially as she asks, \u201cAll of this makes me feel like I have no aptitude for the funding game whatsoever. It seems that every time I approach the grant issue, I find out a whole slew of unwritten rules, all of which, once revealed, make me feel stupid and none of which make me feel empowered and informed. How on earth was I supposed to know any of this?? Do they give out a handbook in the men\u2019s bathroom? Somehow I doubt it.\u201dI hope you all enjoy these blogs as much as I have, especially those with which you were previously not familiar. Conceptual cross-pollination is a fabulous thing, especially when we can learn about ideas and subjects we\u2019d never heard of or thought to explore before. Gaining new fields of thought and perspectives enriches us all.Even when we don\u2019t agree with people\u2019s interpretations of events or concepts, we often find that we are better able to be aware of our own beliefs, and better able to examine, judge, and explain them. Sometimes this means we end up changing our minds, or refining our ideas. Sometimes it just means that we\u2019ve thought in new ways. As I like to say, you can always tell you\u2019ve learned new things or taken thoughts into new directions when your brain feels as stretched out of shape as socks you\u2019ve worn for two days.And that, O Best Beloved, is what thoughtful blogging is about.* I\u2019m trying to avoid saying, \u201cI feel so shiny\u201d, so as not to be confused with the \u201cshiny Aspie\u201d, that autistic person who is a socially-acceptable and successful geek and allowed to participate in Normal society because they don\u2019t trigger too many weirdness-alarms or get too uppity. (Sometimes the term \u201cshiny Aspie\u201d is used in the derogatory \u201cUncle Tom\u201d sense.)", "outgoing_links": ["https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/image03.png", "http://www.thethinkingblog.com/2007/02/thinking-blogger-awards_11.html", "http://lifeintheshire.blogspot.com/2007/05/thunked.html", "http://lifeintheshire.blogspot.com/2007/05/just-for-record-my-first-1st-may-badd.html", "http://www.zenwarriorarmory.com/04_FunStuff.htm", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/think-think-think.html", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/05/hello-again-cocktail-party-version.html", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/06/transportation-issues.html", "http://membracid.wordpress.com/", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2007/01/simple-solutions.html", "http://adhdnme.blogspot.com/", "http://adhdnme.blogspot.com/2007/05/disability-as-diversity-in-education.html", "http://thegimpparade.blogspot.com/", "http://thegimpparade.blogspot.com/search/label/things%20that%20crack%20me%20up", "http://youngfemalescientist.blogspot.com/", "http://youngfemalescientist.blogspot.com/2007/04/is-this-female-thing.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_tom"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/ooh-shiny/", "title": "\u201cOoh, shiny!\u201d"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t2 June 2007 ", "body": "They lied.One sentence; two words.  Together, two very powerful words.As the beginning, those two words beg more questions than they answer.  Who lied?  What about?  To whom?  When, where, and why?In my head, those two words are dark, hard and cold.  They stand as a stark, heavy monolith deeply incised with a single thought, an ideogram chiselled into dark igneous stone describing the tyranny of verbal abuse.  It stands as a marker of the border between myself and others.\u201cYou think you\u2019re so smart; how come you can\u2019t do the simplest little thing?\u201d\n\u201cStop squirming; it can\u2019t be uncomfortable.  Everybody else wears them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should you need help?  No one else needs help.  Quit being a whiny brat.\u201d\n\u201cEarth to Andrea \u2026 Hey, space cadet!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, hand your paper over; let\u2019s see how many mistakes you made this time.\u201d\n\u201cIf you just stood up straight, you might be kind of pretty \u2014 oh, now quit sticking your chest out like it\u2019s something special!\u201d\n\u201cHa-ha, look whose turn it is!  Easy \u2018out\u2019, easy \u2018out\u2019!  We win!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?  You know who that is \u2014 she\u2019s our next-door neighbor; you\u2019ve known her for years.  Don\u2019t you pay attention to anything?\u201d\n\u201cHey, Stupid!  Ha-ha, made you look!\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you always needing new shoes!  Can\u2019t you just wear them without getting them full of holes? And look at your glasses \u2014 how did you get them bent out of shape?  I swear, you do this just to make my life more difficult.  What-the-hell did I do to deserve this, huh?\u201d\n\u201cWhat you lookin\u2019 at \u2014 you some kind of freakin\u2019 fairy?\u201d\n\u201cMy god, can\u2019t you even walk across the room without tripping over your own feet?\u201d\n\u201cYou know the day after you\u2019ve finished school, you\u2019d better find a job to support yourself.  If anyone will even take you \u2014 you don\u2019t know the first thing about work!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a fucking idiot!\u201dThere\u2019s more of course.  Years\u2019 worth.\u201cWho the hell are you to complain?  You\u2019re no one special.\u201d\n\u201cDamnit Andrea, you know what your problem is? You don\u2019t have any self-confidence! That\u2019s just so pathetic!\u201dOh, just shut up already.What\u2019s even more alarming is that after a lifetime of feeling alone (and clumsy, and stupid, and ugly, and unwanted, and generally picked-upon, and expected to achieve but refused the tools for doing so, and simultaneously dunned for having problems but also not having those problems acknowledged to receive any kind of accommodation for them), one finds a small horde of others who have borne much the same.  In a small, twisted way it\u2019s a bit of a relief, because one realises it\u2019s not just me.  It\u2019s not because I was the sole \u201cretard\u201d or bad apple in the whole educational or neighborhood social system, and thus \u201cdeserved\u201d to be treated that way, by some horrifying and insidiously pervasive system.  On the other hand, one really, really wouldn\u2019t wish such things on anyone else.In his blog, Chewing the Fat, Dave Hingsburger posts about \u201cEnough\u201d, where he wonders how much  acclaim or positive feedback will be enough to  refute the lifetime of insults.The answer is None.  Not because the accolades he receives aren\u2019t well-deserved, but because it\u2019s not the right question.It will never be \u201cenough\u201d for as long as you are seeking affirmation from others to create your own self-worth.  This thought process is like a rickety shanty protecting one against harsh weather, where a single negative response will nullify all the previous positive ones and tear down the meagre defense and knock you flat.You will truly know that you are Okay, not just a worthy and successful human being, but also one equally worthy of expecting respect, when the response comes from within yourself, from finding your own bedrock that weathers the storms.Now, we rely upon getting feedback from others because that serves as a system of checks and balances about our (self-)perceptions.  Feedback keeps us from getting too cocky or depressed or just totally losing a grip on whatever this thing is that we call \u201creality\u201d.  But even then we have to judge the quality of that feedback.  And this, this ability to evaluate the integrity of others\u2019 responses, is what we naturally lacked in our youth.  After all, what did we know?  One should not denigrate a child for their natural ignorance; it\u2019s a child\u2019s job to play, learn and grow.  But people should help and guide children to do and achieve those things.  There are good distinctions between being selfish and being self-centered, between being vain and being proud, and between being stupid and being na\u00efve.One way of going about that is to evaluate the various negative and positive lines you\u2019ve heard over your life, from both intellectual and emotional perspectives.  From what kinds of bases did those negatives arise?  Were they realistic or compassionate? I doubt so.  What about the positive messages? Did they arise from your actual achievements, and your innate good qualities?We must also get beyond the point of going around hurt and angry, with a giant chip on the shoulder because the world is full of mean, hurtful bastards.  The fire of anger can be cleansing, but it can also eat up one\u2019s heart.  This is also a part of growing up, just as was overcoming the na\u00efvet\u00e9.  We must go from being against something (and someone) to being for things.  Just being against something is a weakness, because it requires us to have the \u201cagainst\u201d remain in some form in order to have self-identity.   It also threatens to swallow us into a different kind of hell that\u2019s just as bad as the one we left; we end up becoming much like that we despised.Being for something is much more adaptable, and adaptive.  It creates a healthy niche socially, and heals our hearts.  If you search for mean, hurtful bastards, you will never lack for finding them.  And if you seek generous, helpful people, you will find them in good supply, too.  It may seem more difficult to find them on the radar at first, because after a lifetime of abuse your search images for bastards are more highly developed than those for the Menschen, the good people.  Having been through such pain, we can figure out not only what not to do, but also what to do, and what people really need.  This is creating the value in experience.It\u2019s not easy.  Every living person is a work-in-progress.  Perhaps our self-images depend partly on whether we view humans as being intrinsically evil and needing redemption against original and ongoing sins, or whether we view humans as being intrinsically good and needing bolstering against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or lastly, whether we view humans as being neither inherently good nor evil, simply as people struggling to meet their needs, from basic physical needs through self-actualisation needs.  I take the third view, not wanting to be hemmed into a world-view that limits everything to such binary classifications, being either good or bad, either for or against.  The real world is far too complex for such simplistic schemas.I am.One sentence; two words.  Together, two very powerful words.I\u2019m generally okay, and am sometimes not-okay.  I excel at some things, and do poorly at others.  I may in some ways be two or three deviations from the statistical mean, and that\u2019s okay too, for how else would others know they are average? Besides, it truly takes all kinds to make a world.I want to make the kind of world where we help each other, each working at what we do best.  To that end, we now focus on acknowledging and sharing our strengths.", "outgoing_links": ["http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2007/06/enough.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/06/02/the-words/", "title": "The Words"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t7 June 2007 ", "body": "I don\u2019t belong here. Maybe I should have applied at a different department; Professor N was just being nice to write me a letter of recommendation. I don\u2019t even know what those rec letters said; what if they were just so much \u201csocial noise\u201d and I\u2019m not really cut out for graduate school?I am not getting these party jokes at all. Are they inside jokes? Are they related to people\u2019s research? Is it a department joke? Just smile and move along\u2026I\u2019ll never be able to cope with all this stuff. Omigod, they\u2019ve added so much stuff to animal biology since I studied it years ago. I can\u2019t believe I just got a B grade in biochemistry without knowing all these details.How come everyone else seems to know what\u2019s going on? Did I miss something on Orientation Day? Just act sharp and keep your mouth shut; hopefully somebody will mention something.There\u2019s too many people here to remember! But they all know each other. Just smile and ask \u201cHow\u2019s it going\u201d; maybe some clue will be mentioned.My advisor says I ask too many questions. I thought he was there to advise me?Oh no! How will I make it through four semesters of statistics? I\u2019ve always been terrible at the maths. That A in Calculus wasn\u2019t normal for me; we just had a really good teacher. I can\u2019t hardly do these life table calculations without getting numbers turned around!I feel like such a fake. I was just lucky. That was just an isolated event \u2014 it won\u2019t happen again.\u201cYou have no idea what a poor opinion I have of myself, and how little I deserve it.\u201d\n~Reg SmytheIt\u2019s not just me. This is what we call \u201cImposter Syndrome\u201d. Often mentioned in the context of gifted individuals, and high-achieving women, it\u2019s also seen in quite a different population.People with disabilities sometimes feel this way. Because of the inconsistency and unpredictability of success, we\u2019re never quite sure if we\u2019ll be able to \u201cpull it off\u201d again. It\u2019s not just about, \u201cWill I be able to walk across this room without stumbling or crashing into something\u201d or \u201cCan I make it through this exam without my brain freezing up or the lighting driving me nutz\u201d. Every major event and accomplishment in life, in school and in personal social life and getting a job and doing a job and professional groups and volunteer work, feels like that.\u201cWhen they\u2019re around the regular kids, they are never fast enough or smart enough or acceptable enough. This is an exhausting way to live.\u201d\n~Mary Sharp, MDWe also feel that way because of the often wildly varying strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s hard for others to understand just why a person can seem intelligent, and be able to do some things so well (even very complex things), and yet fail to be able to do the \u201csimplest\u201d things that \u201ceveryone can do\u201d. Or, not be able to do them consistently. You just can\u2019t feel confident when you never know when your brain and/or your body is going to unexpectedly fail you. Especially if you\u2019ve not had difficulties diagnosed, and don\u2019t know why those glitches happen.Or, learning and development is asynchronous, so even though the same things are accomplished, they are not done in the same time frame or manner as other people, so you still feel like a failure in comparison to your peers at the time. Your mental accounting fails to get updated with the new data, and you haven\u2019t forgotten their snide remarks and your foundering trials.Sometimes, our strengths aren\u2019t always the academic sort, so they\u2019re not necessarily recognised. \u201cI\u2019m really good at seeing the underlying patterns in things, and making connections between wildly disparate things.\u201d  So what?  We need someone with a background in PCR. \u201cI can manipulate three-dimensional objects in my head, and pack more stuff into a space than anyone else!\u201d What\u2019s the use of that? We need you to learn SAS program coding.\u201cFurther, the importance of a particular strength or weakness depends upon what is being asked of the learner. This is why, for example, a youngster with perfect pitch who has difficulty recognizing letters is seen as disabled, but a child who is tone deaf but can read words easily is not.\u201d\n~David H. Rose & Anne MeyerSometimes we\u2019re so focused on accuracy, on pursuing \u201creal\u201d information, that we over-emphasize truthfulness, even in social settings where complete honesty or extra information is not wanted. Or we become too devoted to accuracy as perfectionism, striving obsessively to be as accurate, precise, complete, and detailed as possible in an effort to ward off failure.So here we are, too often overeducated, yet underemployed. No matter how varied a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gets piled up, no matter what a variety or number of classes we pull through, it never seems to be enough. We own our failures large and setbacks small, but feel like the natural successes and triumphs borne of struggle were due to random, external events.What a mess!It takes a lot of untangling, of separating fears from events. Just because you feel like you\u2019re stupid, doesn\u2019t mean you are. Just because some people are better than you at some things does not mean that everyone is better than you at everything.  Indeed, we have to forgive ourselves for simply being human.  Forgive ourselves for not \u201cmeasuring up\u201d, by realising that the necessary qualities of humans are different from those in board lumber.  Instead of dwelling upon and getting stuck upon problems, setbacks and \u201cfailures\u201d, we need to remember that those are opportunities for learning what to do differently.  Sometimes these are opportunities for changing the world, because when people cannot succeed in human-made situations and environments, it\u2019s not the fault of the person, but the way it was set up!   Not only that, but we must learn to expect common respect, and to ask for help from others as equals (not as beggers).  We also give help by sharing our strengths with others, and by working with people.  We must remember that life is not a race from one destination point to another, but rather that life is the journey.\u201cThe sad thing about the rat race is that even if you win the race, you\u2019re still a rat!\u201d\n\u2014Lily ThomlinBut even after all this, some days it\u2019s just damn exhausting to be smart and yet unable to solve problems.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/06/07/fraud/", "title": "Fraud"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 June 2007", "body": "While reading Ginger\u2019s rundown of the Autism Speaks annual IRS (US federal tax) Form 990, it occurred to me that this organisation conducts its financial operations in many of the same ways as do some of the less-savoury megachurches.  (I\u2019m not against religion in general or any particular religion, but recognise that churches are run by humans with typically human failings, and that big-scale churches and big egos can result in big-scale failings.) That probably seems like a really odd analogy, but there are a number of parallels, all of which are disquieting.  (As another parallel, in the US both churches and nonprofit organisations are exempt from paying federal income taxes.)Here\u2019s the pathological model of the megachurch fundraising style:\nVividly describe hell and damnation, identify the devil, and play upon fears to draw in funds;\nUse fundraising monies to create larger, more dramatic and more widespread efforts to fundraise / proselytise;\nSwamp out, or take over efforts by smaller [competing] organisations  / congregations and brand your own as The Source for true information;\nUse monies to create larger real-property resources ostensibly for promoting the cause, but mostly to be used by the oligarchy;\nCreate large-scale projects that require vast amounts of funding;\nMake the members of the oligarchy the reviewers and the main distributors / recipients of the funding;\nUse that funding generated for administrative purposes, including overseeing those projects, and of course to support greater fundraising efforts;\nCultivate charismatic figureheads, being sure that information about the noble cause is interpreted through them (rather than through other sources that may not support the canon, including the ostensible recipients of the fundraising);\nIgnore, dismiss or denigrate sources of information that disagree with yours \u2014 you have the Truth and others cannot promise cure and salvation \u2014 if people heed the others they will be turned away from the Truth and will be led into the aforementioned horrors;\nKeep gospel focused upon individual salvation / feel-good efforts rather than working for social justice.\nAutism Speaks is an organisation meant to benefit people-with-autism, but is not run by autistics (which is as nonsensical as the NAACP not having any African-American people on their board).  Co-founder Bob Wright says, \u201cWe are committed to giving a voice to those who don\u2019t have one.\u201d  This gives me the impression that they don\u2019t plan to have any leadership by autistics, either.   They\u2019ll just tell everyone what they think autistic people would want to have said. So much for \u201cNothing About Us Without Us\u201d social transformation.The organisation does a LOT of fundraising and awareness projects.  They created the heavily-biased \u201cAutism Every Day\u201d video (a propaganda piece designed to make parenting children look as horrifying as possible, including the scene of a mother describing wanting to kill her autistic child), plus other media efforts on various television programs designed to \u201craise awareness\u201d about the purported \u201cepidemic\u201d and demonstrate how terrible it is to have a child \u201cafflicted\u201d with autism.Autism Speaks has become a very large organisation; they merged with (swallowed up) Autism Coalition for Research and Education (ACRE), National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR), and Cure Autism Now (CAN), and has chapters in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.  The purposes (as described by their Web site) are mainly centered around fundraising:\nfundraising for research into causes and cures for autism;\nconnect parents to researchers who, well, need research subjects;\npushing for legislation to support research into causes and cures for autism;\nawareness in the public about the epidemic of autism that is devastating families (to create a larger fundraising base);\nwalks, golf events, galas, concerts, promotional events at various retail chains et cetera for fundraising.\nThis brings me back to the finances, as described on Ginger\u2019s blog.  The millions of dollars funnelling into and through just a few people is staggering. So is the Form 990, which runs 73 pages including supplementary statements and schedules. Unfortunately, I have a hard time reading and making sense of masses of numbers.  I also have a  much different kind of hard time digesting the wisdom of a charitable organisation that brings in over $ 21 million of donations \u2014 and then doesn\u2019t spend it toward providing concrete assistance to the people to whom it purports to serve.As a genetic condition, autism is not a disease caused by a pathogen or by environmental toxins (at the risk of being repetitious, it is not for example caused by mercury poisoning from Thimerisal in vaccines \u2014 Thimerisal was never in the MMR shot, and has been absent from other vaccines for several years now, but that has not changed the number of new diagnoses).  There are an unfortunate number of expensive, dubious or dangerous \u201ccures\u201d and treatments out there, some of which have killed autistic children.Describing autistics as people stricken with horrifying conditions, and setting them up as the subjects of potentially dangerous medical research does nothing towards those ends.  People don\u2019t need to be \u201ccured\u201d of autism any more than they need to be \u201ccured\u201d of homosexuality.  What autistics do need are appropriate educational and occupational services, social support services for adults and for families (including respite care, because parenting children with major educational or social difficulties is very stressful and time-consuming), and the real social justice efforts of working against discrimination.Oh, and something else autistics need is a voice in the running of agencies that benefit autistics.  But that\u2019s not what this agency is about \u2014 it\u2019s not called \u201cAutistics Speak\u201d.", "outgoing_links": ["http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2007/06/i-take-back-every-nice-thing-i-have.html", "http://www.naacp.org/about/", "http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/wp/?p=396"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/06/10/greed-speaks-fundraising-for-nonprofits-megachurch-style/", "title": "Greed Speaks:  Fundraising for Nonprofits, Megachurch-Style"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 June 2007", "body": "The other week after my blogging about dyspraxia and such, hubby found an article in wired blogs (\u201cHacking My Child\u2019s Brain\u201d) and a recent article in the New York Times, \u201cThe Disorder Is Sensory; the Diagnosis, Elusive\u201d.  Although sensory integration remains a vaguely-defined albeit real disorder, treatments are highly varied and disputed.  Some treatment approaches lack rigorous testing for efficacy, creating difficulties for insurance coverage.One approach mentioned in the former article is from the Sensory Learning Center in Boulder, Colorado (US), and is described as suitable for a long list of issues: autism, Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, acquired brain injury, developmental delays, birth trauma, behaviour problems, ADHD, and for \u201clearning enhancement\u201d.  Their Web site is rife with testimonials from clients and practitioners.Well, testimonials don\u2019t sway me, I want evidenced-based medicine/ practice. Curiously, a search of PubMed doesn\u2019t bring up anything under the founder\u2019s name, Mary Bolles.  Even looking up the method name doesn\u2019t bring up any  research.  Looking at the company\u2019s information page about Bolles reveals that she has a BA, which would explain why her name is missing from the standard medical research database  \u2014 she\u2019s apparently not done postgraduate research work.   For someone who\u2019s an expert in a field that she has created nearly by herself, there\u2019s an amazing dearth of evidence to the fact.  In science, the goal is to share research results and thus increase the understanding of processes within a given field.  (Hence the incredible number of science research journals out there.)The biography also notes that Bolles is an associate member of the \u201cCollege of Syntonic Optometry\u201d, which if one looks through that Web site, shows that their research apparently runs into the realm of the silly, with patients\u2019 perceptions of specific colors of light as indicating problems with different body organs, and likewise exposure to different colors of light are treatments for various health issues.  Which brings us back to the SLC, where their method is not described specifically.  But there is an article (\u201cMind-boggling Therapy\u201d from the Flint Journal, 21 June 2004) that describes the process:This table slowly moves in a gentle, rotating motion, sometimes from left to right and other times from \u201chead to toe.\u201d At the same time, headphones placed over the child\u2019s ears play music, but with the input going in the right ear twice that of the left. According to some theory, this \u201cright ear dominance\u201d stimulates the left side of the brain, where the language and communication centers are located.  The only thing the child sees during this process is a circle of light shining directly overhead, with the color of the light changing over the course of the sessions.(Whee!  Maybe I just need to find a playground with an old-fashioned merry-go-round and play with my equilateral prism \u2026 )Now, it\u2019s not news that multisensory learning (seeing, hearing, doing) works better for most people; that\u2019s why including visuals and labs with lecturing helps students understand and learn things better.  Nor is it a secret that people differ in their abilities to learn from different modalities.  This is especially true for people with sensory-related disabilities, where the sensory inputs and/or the perceptual processing does not work optimally.  But a few sessions with a light and sound augmented tilt-a-wheel is probably not going to reconfigure someone\u2019s sensory processing.  The program\u2019s description page even says that, \u201cThe Sensory Learning Program is not a treatment. It is not a curative.\u201d$3,000 is a lot of money to drop on a non-treatment non-cure that is unproven.  And when people start talking about \u201csubtle\u201d improvements seen, this suggests a number of (unconscious) cognitive biases, such as selective perception, investment bias (post-purchase rationalisation \u2014 we value something more when we\u2019ve spent a lot of money on it), and/or placebo effect.  And sometimes there\u2019s just plain ol\u2019 maturation.  It\u2019s easy to forget that many children (especially those with developmental disabilities) don\u2019t mature evenly, and will often achieve things later, and will improve and make gains in abilities in spurts.  In other words, children naturally show what the SLC refers to as \u201cchanges in cumulative skills  \t\t\t\t\t\tunfolding over the following weeks or months\u201d.  People want to see their children improve, so they associate positive changes with any previous treatment, or treatments, as some people will employ several at once in desperate efforts for something to cure the problem.When I find Web pages where treatments are full of testimonials based upon subjective evidence, and the treatment is hawked as having the ability to fix any number of problems, and the company is selling program franchise (to almost any sort of professional or interested business person, regardless of training), and the founder is a pioneer in some unheard-of field without credits in refereed research journals, well, I get suspicious.I\u2019m not saying that all therapies are bogus.  For example, studies have shown that phototherapy is helpful with Seasonal Affective Disorder. And it may be that some aspects of this therapy are useful for some things.  But who\u2019s to know?   How can we sort out bogus therapies, even those that are derived from earnest efforts?  After all, good intentions plus no results still equals no real results.  We need objective measures, and double-blind testing to sift out the unconscious biases (that\u2019s one reason why we invented statistics).I would like for there to be some good treatments to resolve various issues. But wanting doesn\u2019t make it so, and it\u2019s unhelpful to conflate proven therapies with nonsense.  What we as therapists, parents, and clients really need are for different approaches to be objectively evaluated and tested, and for good research to determine more concrete \u00e6tiologies of different issues so better therapies can be developed.Otherwise people are just spinning rainbow-colored promises and making money off of desperation.", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.wired.com/biotech/2007/02/hacking_my_chil.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/health/psychology/05sens.html", "http://www.bridges4kids.org/articles/6-04/FlintJournal6-21-04.html", "http://www.funtasticllc.com/home.htm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/rainbow-cracking/", "title": "Rainbow Cracking"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t8 June 2007 ", "body": "Description: The Closed Captioning symbol, a black frame in a horizontal rectangle, with a white television screen shape inside, displaying a pair of letter Cs.This icon is used in North America to denote television programming that carried the accessory closed captioning signal. (I like to give artists credit, so I\u2019ll mention that it was designed by Jack Foley, a graphics designer for that closed captioning pioneer, public television station WGBH of Boston, Massachusetts.) I\u2019m pleased to see this icon on video boxes or in a television guide by a show listing, because it means the program is captioned, i.e. subtitled. Captions aren\u2019t exactly the same as subtitles, although the two terms are often used interchangeably. Captions also describe other important auditory information, such as the type of background mood music, that a phone is ringing, there\u2019s a knock on the door, or putting a musical quarter-note symbol by the words to denote that someone is singing, rather than speaking. The captions provide necessary clues to understanding the activity onscreen.So \u2026 who cares?Well, I do. Oddly, because I\u2019m not the target audience for captioned television \u2014 the deaf and hard-of-hearing are. But why would someone with perfect hearing want to be bothered with what are effectively subtitles that are in the same language as the spoken words?Well, television isn\u2019t really about pictures. Sure, there are nature shows that are heavily visual. There are even scenes in shows like NUMB3RS or CSI that make extensive use of visual analogies to help describe mathematical or forensic concepts, but those concepts are also being described verbally. And most television shows, even with the car chases and special effects, are still essentially stage productions. It\u2019s fairly easy to follow a telly program just by listening to it, as a kind of radio glorified with moving pictures for enhancement. This isn\u2019t surprising since that\u2019s from where television broadcasting originated.There\u2019s the notion that TV is a visual medium. Try watching TV sometime with the sound off. . . . I promise you, you will soon learn that it\u2019s not very visual. It\u2019s really a sound-based medium with pretty pictures to make it more effective. Without the pictures it can succeed. Without the sound it can\u2019t. \u2014I. King Jordan (first Deaf president of Gallaudet University)Back in the early 1980s, if you wanted to watch captioned television (and back then, there were not a lot of captioned shows), you had to have an additional piece of electronics that would decode the accessory signal added to those shows. So as a couple of newlyweds we went to Sears and splurged on a $300 decoder set, and hooked it to the television, where it became conjoined to the vicious spaghetti of cabling from the video-cassette recorder and cable-television switchbox. We were thrilled!Its not that hubby hadn\u2019t more-or-less watched television earlier in his life, but with his considerable hearing loss, catching the dialog was damnably hard. Not only did he miss things, but following shows took a lot of work, so watching anything more mentally challenging than say, a football game or a beauty contest, was tiring. As a couple of people who each struggled with sound-effects muddled dialog in movies, we also became fans of old silent films that were played once a month at a local community center. (This is a bit ironic, because it was the advent of the \u201ctalkies\u201d that caused movie theatres to lose their Deaf patrons.)What hooked me on the captions back in the early 80\u2019s was David Attenborough\u2019s natural history series, Life on Earth. The captions didn\u2019t just help clarify all those species names he tossed out right and left. They also made me realise just how much I was actually missing when the uncaptioned shows were on \u2014 I had to strain to understand, and still didn\u2019t catch all the dialog.I\u2019m not the only one. People tend to assume that captions are just for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. In reality, the audience is much larger. Captions are also extremely useful to people who are learning another language, and children who are learning to read. This is because they tie together the spoken and printed words, thus clarifying both forms, while using an interesting learning stimulus that can\u2019t be matched by the average teacher lecturing in front of a board. (English, with its agonizingly convoluted spelling, is one of the five most difficult languages in the world to learn.) As noted in the Wikipedia article about Closed captioning,In the United States, the National Captioning Institute noted that \u2018English-as-a-second-language\u2019 (ESL) learners were the largest group buying decoders in the late 1980s and early 1990s before built-in decoders became a standard feature of U.S. television sets. This suggested that the largest audience of closed captioning comprised people whose native language was not English. In the United Kingdom, of 7.5 million people using TV subtitles (closed captioning), 6 million have no hearing disability.Captions are also very useful to people like myself who have Auditory Processing Disorder; I have especial trouble following and understanding a speaker when there are other conversations going on or there is much background noise. Actually, many people have some degree of trouble in noisy situations, so we\u2019re starting to see televisions with the captions turned on in busy terminals, railstations, restaurants, pubs, and other rambunctious public areas. It only makes sense \u2014 not only can viewers follow the shows better, but the set does not have to be turned up loud for them to do so, and that helps reduce the overall noise (hopefully to safer levels).It\u2019s much easier nowadays for anyone to watch captioned shows. Not only are a majority of the programs so encoded, but one doesn\u2019t need to buy extra equipment. Thanks to the 1990 Television Decoder Circuitry Act, every television sold in the US after July 1993 (well, those sets with screens larger than 13 inches), will have the decoder built right in. Our $300 box is now reduced to something like a $5 chip. So if you\u2019re out and about and they aren\u2019t displaying captions, bug the management to simply turn them on!*I didn\u2019t realise just how much I had become \u201chooked\u201d on accessible television programming until one day when I was on a study tour in the Netherlands. My tour roomie was one of those people who loves to have the telly on all the time (thankfully we weren\u2019t in the hotel room much). Although most of the shows were of Dutch origin, some were from the UK. An announcer was nattering on, and when I missed something he\u2019d said, I naturally looked up to read the caption. Being used to having such, I just assumed there would be captions. As we were now in the 21st century, there were indeed captions. But Oh duh they were in Dutch! Those weren\u2019t captions so much as they were subtitles. Even so, I still found them useful, Dank U wel.Given my druthers, I will always rather watch a subtitled movie over a dubbed movie. Dubbed movies don\u2019t just look silly because the mouth action never really matches the sound overlay. For people who lipread, the dubbing is absolutely useless. For cinema mavens, the voices of the dubbing actors never really match those of the original actors, and sometimes the translations are poor.Funny, I\u2019m not the only one who watches English-language DVDs with the English subtitles turned on. So do our children, even when neither of their parents are around. Some of our daughter\u2019s friends speak English as a second language, and they find the captions helpful. Both kids also like foreign films (especially anime and wuxi\u00e1 martial arts films), and likewise those are much better shown in the original languages. Because our children have grown up watching everything captioned, they don\u2019t find reading subtitles to be the least bit awkward. I like to believe that they have also helped them become better readers.* Per the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, captions are included as a type of auxiliary aid to help ensure that disabled people can use the services of businesses and public accommodations. So, bug them!2012 UPDATE:I have been delighted to notice that more and more public places, such as restaurants, bars, airport terminals, some hospital waiting rooms or even above the patient chairs in my dentists\u2019 office, have been turning the television volume down or even off, and turning the captions on!This lets people talk to each other more easily, be able to catch pages and announcements, and reduces the overall noise level, while still allowing people to follow what is being said in the programs! (Tho\u2019 this seems to be more often true for news programs than for daytime personality-chit-chat shows or sports.)Huzzah!", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/", "http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Earth_%28documentary%29", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/06/08/is-it-cc/", "title": "Is it CC?"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 June 2007 ", "body": "Here\u2019s a hot topic constantly resurfacing in the news, especially with the Omnibus currently proceeding at the US Court of Federal Claims, to wit:   Is autism caused by vaccines? I won\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m going to capture everything in this controversy; there are too many players in the drama.  (Autism Diva is keeping track of the daily news on the hearing.)  However, this does make for an excellent case study in the scientific method.  We get to look at concepts like incidence & prevalence, correlation vs causality, testimonials vs evidence-based medicine, and some general concepts in epidemiology. Could we possibly have any more fun?! (tongue-in-cheek joke)When you read about autism, something noted most everywhere is the increasing numbers of children diagnosed.  Surely, people say, there has to be something causing that to happen!The whole vaccines-causes-autism story starts back in 1998,when there was a research study in England by Dr Andrew Wakefield\u2019s research group, touting a possible link between the MMR and autism.  Additionally, in 2003 Dr Mark Geier and his son David came up with idea that no, it was the Thimerosal (a mercury compound used as a bactericide) in the vaccines that causes autism, which theory was later highly sensationalized as evidence for a big government conspiracy in David Kirby\u2019s book, Evidence of Harm, and has been touted on various Web sites. There is also a small but vociferous number of parents who insist that their child was not afflicted with autism until vaccinated.INCIDENCE & PREVALENCEEpidemiology can be really tricky.  We have to distinguish between the incidence of new cases, and the prevalence or overall number of cases in the population, and we also have to look at how things are diagnosed and recorded. For example, if you examine old historical records for tuberculosis, you won\u2019t find much because it used to be called \u201cconsumption\u201d, \u201cscrofula\u201d, \u201cwhite plague\u201d or several other things.  It\u2019s not that tuberculosis didn\u2019t exist, but that it was identified differently, and people didn\u2019t keep the same kinds of records at different times and places.Likewise, the definitions of autism have changed and been expanded over the years to include a much broader spectrum of identifiers and labels (including Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, which was added to the ICD10 in 1992, and the DSM-IV in 1994).   Children that used to be diagnosed with conditions such as mental retardation or childhood schizophrenia would now be diagnosed as autistic. The diagnostic rates (which are not necessarily the prevalence rates) likewise increased from the earliest estimates for narrowly-defined autism at 5/10,000 to current estimates for broadly-defined autism at 1/166.  (As Lorna Wing and David Potter point out, \u201c\u2026it is very difficult to make comparisons among studies done by different workers, at different times, in different places, using different definitions, and different methods of case finding and examination.\u201d)It is true that we are seeing more children (including autistic children) needing special education services. Because of changes in legal requirements for public schools (in the UK, the Disability Discrimination Act of 1995; in the US, the section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, and the IDEA), schools now have to accept all children, regardless of disability, and to provide services for them.  Formerly many children with disabilities were kept at home, were placed in institutions, or were unidentified and simply struggled through school. (Just ask adults with AD/HD how much fun school was.)    School staff, parents and doctors are also more familiar with various disabilities that can affect learning (it\u2019s hard to pick up a parenting magazine without running into articles on this or that), and consequently children are more likely to be assessed.So now there are more children getting diagnoses, and also more students finally getting services because those services now exist.  Sometimes the diagnosis a child receives depends partly on which sorts of services will likely be more useful for them, especially if a child has several conditions.  It\u2019s also interesting to note that over time, in some districts there appears to be some diagnostic substitution, where increase in autistic students roughly compares to the decrease in students diagnosed with other learning disabilities. It\u2019s also one of those facts of bureaucracy that people don\u2019t often keep records unless they have to, so a lack of historical records doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a lack of prevalence \u2014 just a lack of records.  (This is what we mean by \u201cabsence of evidence doesn\u2019t mean evidence of absence\u201d.The Wakefield study was alarming, and made a big news-splash, which in turn helped paved the way for the hysteria created by the Geiers\u2019 paper. One of the key features to the scientific method is repeated tests of hypotheses, so further studies looking a the Thimerosal connection were done in Sweden, Denmark, England, Canada and the United States. None of those supported the mercury-autism hypothesis. In fact, since 1993, vaccines in Sweden and Denmark have not contained Thimerosal, but those countries continue to have new cases of autism being diagnosed. Likewise, to help reduce overall exposure to mercury from various sources, all pediatric vaccines have been free of Thimerosal since 2001, but this has not decreased the incidence of new autism diagnoses in the US either. A very recent US study also shows no connection between autism and RhIg (which also used to contain Thimerosal) and is given to mothers with Rh- blood type during their third trimester of pregnancy. Over in the US, in 2000, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) at the National Academy of Sciences, by request from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), both examined the evidence for the MMR as a cause of autism, and dismissed the claims. They also noted that the timing of vaccinations, including the MMR, did not have any effect on the age of diagnosis. In Japan, the MMR was dropped in 1993 in favor of individual measles, mumps and rubella vaccines, and there has not been a decrease in the rate of autism following that change.CORRELATION VS CAUSALITYQuestion:  does washing your car make it rain?  It\u2019s a funny joke because it\u2019s absurd. But although one event might happen after another event, but that doesn\u2019t mean the first caused the second. But it\u2019s easy to understand how parents could believe that vaccinations caused their child to be autistic, as vaccinations are major and memorable series of events in a child\u2019s life, and occur during the same time period as when many children are diagnosed with autism.  However, correlation does not equal causality, post hoc ergo propter hoc. Vaccinations do not cause autism any more than does toilet-training, another major and memorable series of events in a toddler\u2019s life. Current research indicates that various autism spectrum disorders are likely polygenic, which means caused by combinations of several genes.  Various presentations of autism tend to run in families, and it affects more boys than girls.Some parents who still struggle to come to terms with their child\u2019s disability will seek a source of blame for causing the problem, and a cure. But what about those children who are purported to have been cured by, for example, chelation treatments? Chelation is used to remove toxic levels of heavy metals from the body. But an examination of the symptoms of mercury poisoning and those of autism show they have little in common. Although chelation therefore is not approved by the FDA as a treatment for autism, in 2005, a 5-year old autistic boy died of a heart attack resulting from chelation treatment.  The chelator used drew too much calcium from his blood, causing cardiac arrest.TESTIMONIALS VS EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINEThere are a wide variety of unproven therapies out there that will supposedly cure any number of things, and those Web sites will have lots of testimonials.  But of course, the plural of testimonial is not data. Human beings are prone to a number of (unconscious) cognitive biases, such as selective perception, investment bias (also post-purchase rationalization \u2014 we value something more when we\u2019ve spent a lot of money on it), and/or the placebo effect.  Sometimes the improvements seen in children being given treatment are simply maturation.  Children with developmental disabilities by definition don\u2019t develop \u201con schedule\u201d,  but over time they will still continue to mature, improve and make gains in abilities, albeit sometimes unevenly or in spurts. People want to see their children improve, so they associate the positive changes seen with any previous treatment, or treatments, as some people will employ several at once in desperate efforts for something to cure the problem. To get around these bias problems in scientific research, we use control groups, double-blind studies, and statistics.In addition to potentially dangerous and potentially lethal \u201ccures\u201d, we still have the ever-present issue of dangerous and potentially lethal diseases.  Just a couple decades after large-scale immunisations were put into place, it\u2019s easy to forget just how dangerous these highly-infectious diseases were.  In decades previous, children used to die at much greater rates; diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis (\u201cwhooping cough\u201d), polio, smallpox, measles (rubeola), mumps, rubella (\u201cGerman measles\u201d) and chicken pox would run through families, neighborhoods and cities, and one child of every ten would not even live long enough for their first birthday party.  For those who lived, these diseases could lead to other issues, such as meningitis, deafness, blindness, sterility, and mobility impairment.  (No, chicken pox is not nearly as serious as many of the other diseases, but a flare-up of shingles is hardly a walk in the park.) After the vaccine scare, immunisation rates in the UK dropped from 92% to 78.9%, and in 2006 a child in Britain died from measles for the first time in 14 years. In some areas of the UK, only one in nine children were getting the MMR.  Of all the infectious diseases that can be prevented by vaccine, measles was and still is the most deadly, and is the cause of half of the one million deaths that could be prevented.A vaccine is only effective in 85-95% of the immunized population (and a few people with compromised immune systems cannot take vaccines), so we rely upon \u201cherd immunity\u201d to help protect those vulnerable people by keeping the level of pathogen down to a very low level.  According to the World Health Organization, it takes a 95% vaccination rate for herd immunity to prevail and prevent significant outbreaks, such as the mumps outbreak in the American Midwest last year.  There were over 1,000 people infected, the largest in over 20 years. The outbreak was likely caused by a visitor from the UK, where the same virus genotype (G) has caused over 70,000 cases of mumps between 2004 and 2006.  In the 1990\u2019s, vaccination shortages in the former Soviet Union resulted in over 200,000 cases of diphtheria, leading to the deaths of 5,000 people.Parents should be reassured that their children are much safer by being immunized, because diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella are not a thing of the past.  These diseases can be very debilitating and life-threatening.  They should be reassured that there is not good evidence showing any causal link between vaccines and autism.", "outgoing_links": ["http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/", "http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=364&a=2618", "http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=40949", "http://www.immunizationinfo.org/immunization_science_detail.cfv?id=6", "http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070516071735.htm", "http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/autism/mmr/sub3.cfm", "http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7076", "http://www.nimh.nih.gov/press/largest-ever-search-for-autism-genes-reveals-new-clues.cfm", "http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002476.htm", "http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/autism.cfm", "http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2005/092005/09252005/131521", "http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/newspapers/sunday_times/britain/article1265373.ece", "http://www.news-medical.net/?id=26212", "http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/measles/en/", "http://www.nationalacademies.org/headlines/20060428.html", "http://www.health.state.ri.us/disease/communicable/mumps-han.php", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/06/22/epidemics-of-bad-science-vs-epidemics-and-bad-science/", "title": "Epidemics of Bad Science vs Epidemics and Bad\u00a0Science"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t23 June 2007 ", "body": "When people ask, \u201cWhich is better?\u201d for most anything, my response is, \u201cBetter for what?\u201dThe same is true for any kind of debate about different teaching approaches, whether the subject is language, mathematics, or how we design classroom environments.Take for example the whole debate about phonics versus whole-word approaches to reading.  Each method is useful in different ways, and to different people.  Phonics does give you tools to decode a great many words.  But because English is not a strictly phonetic language, phonics can break down in the pronunciation ability, and especially in the spelling ability.  One can usually come up a number of phonetically rational ways to spell a word, but only one or two will be correct (e.g. the British kerb and the American curb).  So, let\u2019s spell a word (I bet you can come up with even more ways than I\u2019ve listed here!):word\nwordh\nwerd\nwerdh\nwherd\nwherred\nwird\nwirdh\nwhird\nwhirred\nwurd\nwurdh\nwhurd\nwuerd\nwurred(Damn, now I have imaginary helicopters flying in my head.)Not all people can use phonics effectively; their brains do not process the information the same way.  In such cases the whole-word approach or a combination of whole-word and phonics can be better.  Personally, I have to learn how to spell French words simply as whole words, including diacritical marks.  For me, French words have certain shapes, which can describe pronunciation, but I can\u2019t go from sounding out to spelling.  (I still cannot fathom why it takes three vowels \u201ce-a-u\u201d to make the long O sound.  I swear the French stole some of their vowel supply from the Welsh, who were then forced to draft W into service as a vowel.)Too often we get caught in false dichotomies, thinking that if one thing is good, the other is bad, and if one is right, then the other is wrong.  In real life, we end up using different tools for different jobs, and sometimes combinations of tools.In education we also run into the whole problem of pedagogical fads, where we think that because a particular approach is new and has shown to be effective in some ways, that it is better than other approaches, and should be instituted by substituting it for other approaches.  There may be any number of reasons why the New Method doesn\u2019t work well, including teachers who are not adequately trained to use it, general resistance to change, students who have trouble transitioning from one teaching method to another, parents who don\u2019t understand how the new method is supposed to work and thus cannot adequately help their children with homework, and of course, the whole issue of teaching methods that are neither adequate nor well-matched to the learning needs of all the students to whom they are being applied.For example, we saw these kinds of issues under the \u201copen classroom\u201d and \u201cnew math\u201d initiatives.When poorly implemented, the open classroom was not the hoped-for freer, student-directed learning environment, but merely a school without walls between classes, as though they were held in an airport terminal.  This created noisy and chaotic environments that were hell for the easily-distracted students, ditto the students with hearing or listening difficulties who couldn\u2019t track and understand one speaker out of many voices.  I furthermore had trouble because I couldn\u2019t keep track of what my class and I were supposed to be doing because I couldn\u2019t identify the students who were supposed to be in my \u201cpod\u201d (teaching group \u2013 our classrooms were an open plan of several pods surrounding a central library hub).I started off mathematics under the New Math, where the focus was more upon understanding and applying concepts, rather than upon rote learning of exact processes. I also had a couple of teachers who understood mathematics AND the New Math teaching process. Life was great. (I still think in sets.)Then we had one of those reversals in teaching approaches, and I next found myself in classrooms with math-phobic teachers who taught the subject by drills and memorising mechanical processes, and there I floundered in the maths until college. I was absolutely shocked the day I heard my college algebra teacher announce, \u201cThere are several ways you can solve this; pick whichever one works best for you.\u201d Not only did I finally have a teacher who liked the subject and could explain it in different ways (so it made sense), but she also gave us the \u201cradical\u201d idea that mathematics was a tool that we could use in ways that made sense to each of us.Once something makes sense to you, you not only own it for using it, but you can also figure out how to apply it to novel situations.Applying math to novel situations is where the memorise-this-process approach falls apart, and likewise with story problems. Most math students are terrified of story problems, because they have to be able to understand both the \u201cstory\u201d and understand the various mathematical tools they have learned, determine what they are solving for and which methods to use, and be able to figure out how to construct equations (or inequalities) to solve the questions.  If you are used to being told which formula or process to use and then being given a set of problems that all use that process, then you are less familiar with decoding and evaluating situations.Shockingly, real life doesn\u2019t hand you a volume of problems all lined up, with answers to the odd-numbered problems in the back of the book. And that\u2019s where the rote-process approach to teaching math fails.  Aside from rote functions like bookkeeping, real life is almost nothing but story problems.Despite that, there are some uses for simply memorizing steps.  Most people find it easier to memorise the \u00b0C : \u00b0F conversion formulae than to re-create them every time by comparing the ratios of two or more pairs of known equivalent amounts (e.g. the freezing and boiling points of water).  After decades of struggle, I have resigned myself to the fact that although I can memorise equivalencies involving monomials (e.g. 1 mole = 6.022 x 10^23 molecules), I can\u2019t keep straight in my head the more complex formulae that involve fractions or ratios.  So when I lacking a reference source, I end up reconstruction the formula needed each time.  But there are a great many people who would find that process to be much more difficult than simply memorising an equation or rote process!  On the other hand, I have the mathematical tools to reconstruct or even create de novo other formulae and conversion factors as I need them.But regardless of whether a person is designing a classroom environment or selecting a pedagogical approach, the real answer to the question, \u201cWhich is better?\u201d should be, \u201cWhatever works best for the student.\u201d This is not the same thing as, \u201cWhat we think the student \u2018ought\u2019 to use.\u201d", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_classroom", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Math"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/06/23/which-is-better/", "title": "Which Is Better?"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t24 June 2007 ", "body": "Life, they say, is a crap shoot; you never know what you\u2019re going to get, and eventually you\u2019ll lose and your life will be over.  A little grim sounding, but not necessarily fatalistic, not like the whole concept of predestination.  I\u2019ll take free will any day.  But that\u2019s free will guided by inner moral responsibility, not by fear of hellfire and damnation. Though not explicit, there\u2019s still that undercurrent of hellfire and damnation in the various flavours of xenophobia being flung about.  (\u201cXenophobia\u201d means fear of the Other, not fear of Xena, Warrior Princess.)Sometimes it\u2019s the covert version that seeps through schools in a fog of viscous cliques targeting whatever groups are considered to be outsiders, such as gays or geeks. What most people didn\u2019t seem to realise or acknowledge was that you didn\u2019t actually have to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered to be slammed as a \u201cfag\u201d, \u201chomo\u201d or \u201cfairy\u201d.  Anyone could be a target for verbal and/or physical violence just because someone else was uncomfortable around them, for whatever reason.  It wasn\u2019t, and never is, an issue about \u201casking for it\u201d because of who you are or what you did.  A few times the roll of my cosmic dice meant having to lose a turn, or go back a few spaces.  I fared far better as a target of bullying than did Matthew Shepherd.  It was fortunate the roll of the dice was with me, because my family and the school administration all dismissed my protests.  Sexism and homophobia were so endemic as to be nearly invisible, and therefore my protests were unfounded and unimportant.Sometimes the xenophobia is much more overt, like when I went to get the morning newspaper and found a recruitment flier from the Ku Klux Klan tossed on my driveway, and my neighbors\u2019 driveways.  What had caused them to distribute on our block was a mystery, but this event made me realise that such things were not \u201clong ago and far away\u201d but rather much closer to my part of the space-time continuum.  Chilling as it was, they were just icky pieces of paper, which presence led to much noisy indignation by citizens writing in the local newspaper.  When I rolled my dice that time, I merely had to pull a card from the Chance deck.Less overt, but equally disturbing was the semester where I took a horticulture class from an adjunct teacher who made answering a test question correctly require repeating some of his anti-evolution propaganda.  That didn\u2019t go over well, either.  I would like to say that I was particularly noisy on this issue with the department head, but at the time I was still laboring under a lot of that learned helplessness with authority.  Fortunately, a few others in the class didn\u2019t suffer that problem, and were able to advocate effectively.More recently we took a group of students on a museum trip, and passed by the Westboro Baptist Church gang who were staging yet another protest.  Phelps\u2019 followers are plenty damn overt, but they\u2019re such an obnoxious fringe group that they don\u2019t garner much solidarity from the public at large. Our dice roll led our tokens past, and we didn\u2019t have to stop and roll again to calculate hit points.In such cases, fear, hate and loathing are the things being sold.  However, few groups are really that upfront about what they are selling.  There\u2019s plenty of noise to be heard about the \u201cwages of sin\u201d but little about the \u201cprofits of hate\u201d.  (Ah, a roll of the cosmic dice says that we get to take our game token past the Tired Joke square where we would have nattered about profits & prophets, and we\u2019ll land on the next square, where instead we lose a turn from having to define our terms.)Both the words \u201cecology\u201d and \u201ceconomy\u201d come from the Greek Oikos, meaning \u201chouse\u201d. In general definition, ecology refers to the relationships of organisms and their environments, and economy refers to the management of money and other resources. (Curiously, you\u2019ll hear more about the economies of natural systems in ecology than you will hear about the ecologies of natural systems in economics. We might say that ecologists are more likely to look for numbers in their bugs than economists are to look for bugs in their numbers. Apparently I\u2019m getting a little bleed-over from the Tired Joke square; humor is one of the ways that people cope with fear and stress.)  Part of the economy of human ecosystems is the trade we do in forming relationships by in-grouping and out-grouping, and how we create business opportunities by buying and selling ideas and identities.  You bet we buy and sell ideas and identities \u2014 that\u2019s what the fields of advertising and public relations are all about.All of these events from my personal history revolved around selling something to others.  A hate group is formed by someone who finds others with similar sentiments, and as a group, they reinforce each other\u2019s opinions and self-worth.  But being a closed system, they can run out of energy, so the group then has to recruit others.  Recruitment at the next larger scale means having to define who they are, and not just by who or what they are against.  They must distinguish themselves with a distinct group identity, adding on cultural facets such as creating a semi-mythological history, an in-group jargon, special symbols, and rituals.  Much of this is done by elaborating upon who they hate, and why they hate them, and importantly, why the out-group is \u201cdeserving\u201d of hatred.  Once again, because the group is a closed system, they can start to run out of energy, so they must keep themselves going by taking things to the next step and acting out against their targets, first verbally, and then some hate groups will cross the line into acting out physically against the target\u2019s possessions, and finally attacking people.There\u2019s a thin line between hating what the outgroup represents or what the outgroup has, and hating people simply because they are designated as the outgroup.Just having a hate group isn\u2019t always socially profitable.  To gain power to bolster their self-worth as a group and as individuals, they have to increase the group size.  But as long as the group is perceived as being on the fringe, their market share is limited.  The hate-group will be self-limiting as long as they go around frothing at the mouth and yelling, \u201cBecause you know, They are amoral and unless stopped by decent folk, They will take your jobs and steal your wimmenfolk and convert your chilluns and be a drain on taxpayers. And of course, end civilisation as we know it!\u201dInstead, the hate group must create a more mainstream image.  They must appeal to fear in small, palatable, almost sensible doses, accentuating the overlaps of the hate group\u2019s position with more common political or social leanings, and avoiding mention of its extremes.  Dosage is important \u2014 the poison is always in the dosage, and some poisons are cumulative.Taking a cue from the fields of advertising and public relations, they sell not just fear, but also add in dollops of scientific veneer or pseudo-intellectualism to make the message seem more reasonable or have \u201ctruthiness\u201d.  In other words, to become mainstream they must appear to be less rabid and more professional.  Perhaps they\u2019ll even repackage the message to be perceived as performing some kind of social service, educational benefit, employment or economic safeguard.Be wary.  Because a great many people believe that xenophobia is so worth fighting for.  But don\u2019t be afraid \u2014 in reality, there are NO outgroups.  We are all human beings, endless variations upon a genetic theme.\u201cIn the end,\nwe will conserve only what we love,\nwe will love only what we understand,\nand we will only understand what we are taught.\u201d\n~Baba Dioum", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Shepherd", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westboro_Baptist_Church", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_group", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truthiness"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/odds-are/", "title": "Odds Are \u2026"},

While at an Italian restaurant, hubby suddenly piped up with one of his classic silly-old-hard-of-hearing-Dad malapropisms, \u201cMom is \u2019emancipated\u2019, don\u2019t you think?\u201d  Of course, he meant \u2019emaciated\u2019. I became ten pounds underweight before a chance comment from a nurse a my uni\u2019s clinic led me to figure out what was disagreeing with my gut.A gluten-free diet of course requires a steep learning curve when shopping, but was less traumatic for me than for many people, simply because I\u2019ve never been a big bread eater.  At my apartment, loaves would linger until they got moldy, so eventually I resorted to buying packages of Dutch rusks for those rare occasions when I wanted something \u201con toast\u201d.  I tossed the rusks, and cleaned out the pantry  where I stayed weekdays on campus. It was a bit like cleaning for Passover, except it wasn\u2019t spring, and I\u2019m not Jewish.After being on a gluten-free diet for two months, I went to discuss the improvement with my GP.  He drew blood, and the test came up negative for c\u0153liac.  Maybe it was just  some kind of GI infection, I thought, and slid back into a normal diet with my family.  And of course, got the typical problems, where wheat did the Macarena through my kishkas.  A colonoscopy also yielded negative results.  So technically, I\u2019m not considered c\u0153liac.  I simply get the upset bowels and weight loss associated with gluten-intolerance.\u00a0 (By the way, you can ignore the pseudo-science nonsense about wheat gluten \u2014 it does not really \u201cturn into opiates in the brain\u201d, nor does it cause ADHD, AS, APD et cetera.\u00a0 Some people have gluten intolerance or coeliac in addition to ADHD, AS, TS or whatever, but there\u2019s no causality. Wheat does unhappy things in my gut too, but when I stick to a GF diet, the only thing that improves is my gut. I\u2019m still the happy ticcy, APD, ADHD aspie person I\u2019ve always been \u2026 )Back to the vacation, hubby and the kid left two days before I did, as he had out-of-town work he could do for a day.  I took advantage of being alone to paint walls and to can up some jellies and garlic-dill pickles (everyone wants to eat the pickles, but no one wants to be around for the inception of pickles).  On the ever-hopeful theory that maybe I\u2019d just had problems in the past due to my gut biota being out of whack, I feasted on wheat for a day, consuming no less than four slices of bread, a couple of small cake rolls, and some crackers.  Ooh, no good. At least no one else had to be around.So, I avoid wheat, rye and barley.  Doing so makes my innerds much happier.  But it makes dining out a real challenge.  Unlike a true c\u0153liac, I don\u2019t worry about contamination by trace quantities of wheat, but it\u2019s still really hard to find foods that don\u2019t disagree with me.  I have to pack gluten-free energy bars for emergency rations.The good news is that gluten-free (GF) items are becoming much more common in markets.  I\u2019ve been able to order a GF meal on plane flights (trust me, that\u2019s not a luxury or merely \u201cbeing picky\u201d when I\u2019m cramped in that flying can for eight hours). I even found a restaurant in my metro area that has GF pizza!  Because specialty foods are expensive, I bake my own goodies. But the biggest problem is that most restaurateurs have never heard of such.  It\u2019s just one more thing that makes life a level more difficult.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/07/an-ingrained-problem/", "title": "An Ingrained Problem"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t2 August 2007", "body": "\u201cYou know when you have a few good days and you begin to wonder whether the bad days could have possibly been as bad you imagined they were and then you have a few bad days and wonder how on Earth you ever were able to do the things you did on the good days? No? Well, I do.\u201d  ~ The GoldfishIt\u2019s a pain.  No, it\u2019s many pains.I\u2019m getting over a migraine, which makes me just generally tired and gives me brief flashes of visual auras, pain twinges, inconsistent light sensitivity, and word retrieval problems when speaking.  This rather much overshadows the arthritis business. I\u2019m also trying to get a bunch of errands done and phone calls made prior to packing for a trip, which unto themselves are stressful activities.  I also forgot to take my ADHD med this morning, so I\u2019ve been in a what-was-I-going-to-do? fog all day long as well, above and beyond everything else.  \u201cAin\u2019t we got fun.\u201dBut after I tracked down two cats and took them to the vet (putting the suddenly-hexadecimal cat into the carrier is always entertaining \u2014 picture here ), I went for my semi-annual tooth cleaning.  I have no idea if I\u2019ve had this particular dental hygienist before, having no memory at all for faces not seen daily, but she was nice enough to shut the window blinds for me on account of my migraine \u201changover\u201d.  I was also due for some dental x-rays (roentgenograms), so the she draped me with the lead apron.  Although having the bite-wings stuck inside my mouth is less than fun, I always enjoy the comforting pressure of the lead apron.In fact, years ago when I realised that a lead apron was such a fabulous deep pressure aide, I got one from a retired dentist.  When I stagger to bed with an incipient migraine, I compose myself in the dark room and drape it across my thorax.  I\u2019ve also used it on nights when I just can\u2019t seem to settle down because I feel twitchy on the outside. The lead drape is one of several small comforts that I have found useful. Everyone deals with stress in their life, both the eustresses (the good sorts that help \u201cpush\u201d us in beneficial ways) and the distresses (the bad sort, which need no further introduction).  But we all differ in the things we are stressed by, and how those stresses affect us.   My distress-reduction is accomplished by several means.\nFirstly, I try to outright reduce stresses; there are some things I outright avoid if I have the choice.\nSecondly, I control stressors by choosing which I will have to deal with and when.\nThirdly, I increase my tolerance for some stressors by limiting exposures to them and by reducing the numbers of others I\u2019m dealing with at the moment.\nLastly, I plan in some \u201cdown time\u201d between stresses, so I can recharge. Down time isn\u2019t a luxury, it\u2019s a necessity.  The more stress I am under, the more down time I need.\nIf we\u2019re lucky, we get to make these choices.  Unfortunately, not everything is choose-able, and when choosing some good things we have to take the bad things that accompany them.When I am considering the kinds of stressors that will affect my body at the physical level, there are several factors that I have to evaluate, especially with regards to arthritis:\nHow repetitious is this particular gesture?\nDoes doing this put me in an awkward posture?  (remembering of course that \u201cawkward\u201d for me may or may not be awkward for someone else, due to my hypermobility)\nDoes doing this put undo stress on my joints, muscles, nerve points and such? (remembering of course that \u201cundo stress\u201d will aggravate osteoarthritis pain)\nDoes this put me into a lot of bright sunlight that can easily burn me or make me too hot?\nDoes using this tool produce a lot of vibration or a lot of high-pitch noise?\nDoes doing this involve more than one stressor, because they are multiplicative, rather than additive.\nThese things allow me to change the way I interact with my environment in several ways:  I can change my posture, I can change the method I use for performing the operation, and I can change the tools I use to perform the operation.Frequently doing physical labour is about balancing the need for weight-bearing exercise that helps maintain bone density to help prevent osteoporosis, against the need to reduce mechanical stress on joints that worsens my osteoarthritis.  So I have a series of techniques I use. I switch off sides frequently, using both right and left hands/arms for tasks. For longer projects, I stretch out first. I take frequent breaks \u2014 one of the benefits to ADHD is that I can\u2019t stay seated for long, so I am less apt to stress myself from immobility. I keep changing my posture, and the part of the activity I am working on to reduce the amount of repetitive stress. For example, using the (battery-run, electric) string trimmer around the yard causes a lot of vibration stress.  So I will reduce the amount of damage per time period and do the front yard one day, and the back yard the second day.  This is not even an activity that takes very long! But even so, my fingers feel numb and tingly, and my hands shake more than they usually do.Sometimes the \u201csmallest\u201d changes make big differences.  The other week my daughter asked if we had a spare can-opener she could take back with her to her apartment.  I was only too glad to give her our old can opener, because it has a small handle, and she has dainty, small hands.  In contrast, both my son and I have large hands (mine are so large I must buy men\u2019s gloves), so I had recently purchased a new can opener with much larger grips and turn knob.  All of us were much happier because we now have tools that are better adapted to the people using them.Pain is supposed to be a warning sign.But pain is no longer an intermittent warning sign; it\u2019s an unwelcome and constant companion, not unlike my tinnitus. My tinnitus is a noise that seems to live just outside my left ear, something that varies from a 14-17 kHz whine to a loud fuzzy static. Although I can re-frame my relationship with my tinnitus (as I\u2019ve had to, lest the constant noise drive me nutz), this does not diminish the fact that it interferes with my ability to understand what people are saying.Likewise, pain is an unwelcome and constant companion, whether it\u2019s my osteoarthritis or a migraine episode that varies in both intensity and \u201cflavour\u201d but still remains parked like lead poured onto my brain for three days running. It\u2019s not a question of \u201cif\u201d I am in pain, but rather, \u201chow much\u201d pain. Granted, there are occasional times when the pain goes away, but if I forget what I am about, then I do something rash and over-extend myself, and the pain returns at worse-than-maintenance level. I don\u2019t \u201cget rid of\u201d pain or \u201cget over\u201d pain, I manage pain. That\u2019s why I take pain meds twice a day. That\u2019s why I wear a biteguard at night to relieve TMJ stress. That\u2019s why I cannot do as much heavy physical work per day as I used to. I have to manage the pain-inducing stresses.Because pain has changed from that intermittent warning sign to something more like a way of life, I find that sometimes I have trouble identifying pain.  It\u2019s turned into background noise that isn\u2019t noticed.  I have become habituated to certain pains, and tune them out.  Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 the pain still hurts. I am at some level still aware that it is there, but am also unaware of just how much it is affecting me.I contemplated this issue during a more lucid period of the migraine.  Very, very slowly, the thoughts oozed out, like beads of dew forming on a spiderweb line.\nSomething hurts.\nSomething else hurts, specifically.\nMy arm hurts.  Yes, that\u2019s my arm hurting.\nWow, that\u2019s obnoxious.  Yes, that is definitely my arm.\nI wish it would stop hurting.\nCan I do something about that?\nI bet moving my arm would make it stop hurting.\n(\u2026 several minutes pass \u2026)\nMy arm hurts.  (realising that all over again.)\nI\u2019m going to move my arm.\n(\u2026 several minutes pass \u2026)\nOh, yeah, I was going to move my arm.\nHow do I move my arm?\nWhere\u2019s my arm? (my body has become an uncharted terra incognita of pain)\nOh, yeah.  (moves arm)\nWow, that feels so much better.  (just my arm \u2014 not my head)\nFor a normal person, they would have noticed an \u201cow!\u201d and then moved their arm.  Doing that would not have required all that conscious analysis.I move my arm over and drape it across a spare pillow, the cotton case feeling lusciously smooth and cool.  My bed has a surfeit of pillows, for not only do I like to read in bed, but I am a scrawny, achy person.  Years ago when I was pregnant for the first time, I read in a book that it would make my hips more comfortable if I put a spare pillow between my knees and ankles.  OMG, instant bliss!  So for over twenty years I\u2019ve had a \u201cknee pillow\u201d providing relief from stressed joints.  A few years ago I also discovered that it helps to have another pillow for my head.  Not under my head, but just behind the one my head lays upon.  This second head pillow gets wedged between the headboard and my hair, providing what is probably best described as \u201csuperior cranial pressure\u201d.I find deep pressure to be good not only for helping me get to sleep, and dealing with migraines, but also it aids my proprioception, or knowing where my body is in space.  Therefore I try to wear some snug clothing during the day.  Rocking is also soothing with its repetitive vestibular input.  My desk chair is a rocker, which not only lets me rock or sit cross-legged (it\u2019s a BIG rocker), but also automatically adjusts to where-ever my center of gravity is.  This way the chair works with me, rather than against me.The hard part is trying to describe pain to my doctors.  If I, as a patient, minimise the problem, then they don\u2019t believe me or understand the severity of the issues.  But if I, as a patient, complain overmuch, then I run the risk of being discounted as a hysterical female or of being attention-seeking.  (Well yes, I am seeking attention, but not in the pathological sense.)  Additionally, I have the problem of trying to describe pain.  Recently medics have taken the route of asking patients to rate their pain \u201con a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the greatest\u201d.  I have this neatly charted out: 7 is a sprained ankle or bladder infection (I can still work); 8 is a bad ear infection or 2nd-degree burn (I work at reduced capacity); 9 is kidney stones (I can do very little); and 10 is back-labour (obstetrical sort, which is immobilizing).  Migraines rank anywhere from 7 to 10.  The scale makes sense to me, but I have found that pain tolerance is a highly personal thing \u2014 my \u201c7\u201d seems to be someone else\u2019s \u201c9\u201d.Furthermore, there are perhaps more names for the different hues, tints and shades of green than there are for the different kinds of pain, and the associated sensory and mechanical side-effects of pain. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a Pantone chart to objectively describe such experiences in ways that our physicians and others can understand.  The limited vocabulary of pain only comes in primary colours, and I\u2019m trying to explain that today it\u2019s not just white and red, but also ochre and periwinkle.  \u201cYellow\u201d is too bright and clean to describe the muddy brownish qualities of chalky ochre, and \u201ccyan\u201d is too bright and too printing-press basic to describe the dull neither-sky-blue-nor-lavender qualities of evasive periwinkle.  Let\u2019s not even bring up white, and the fallacy of \u201cwhite is white is white\u201d.  Until you go shopping for paint, you don\u2019t realise that there\u2019s a dizzying array of flat, semi-gloss, high-gloss, eggshell, faintly yellow-cream, faintly grey-white, faintly blue-white, chalky white, beige-white, warm white, cool white \u2026Worse than trying to discuss pain with medical personnel is trying to discuss pain with anyone else.  Isolated, incidental pain seems to be okay; you get a broken leg, and everyone is full of sympathy.  But no one wants to deal with chronic pain.  You can\u2019t fix it, and society abhors something that isn\u2019t fixable.  (Please don\u2019t declare A War On Pain \u2014 that just sounds so wrong.)  Mention you have something wrong, and everyone wants to give you their hollow empathy (\u201cOh, I had a really bad headache once.\u201d) Or they want to tell you the cure that you, in your foolishness, somehow missed (\u201cIt\u2019s red wine that causes migraines, the sulfites or something.  You just need to avoid red wine.\u201d)  I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a glass of red wine.  I save a glass of wine or beer for nights when I don\u2019t feel achy, so I don\u2019t stress out my liver detoxifying both alcohol and pain-reliever.It\u2019s as though the normals are saying, \u201cWould you please not mention or be obvious about your pain and/or disability, so I can ignore that it exists, and therefore not have to make any accommodations? It\u2019s much easier if we can pretend that we\u2019re all the same. That way I don\u2019t have to deal with my discomfort and unsureness of being around people with pain or with disablities.\u201dI seek my Small Comforts to deal with my pain, but others look for small comforts as excuses so they can ignore others\u2019 pain.", "outgoing_links": ["http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2007/06/three-cubed-meme.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/02/small-comforts/", "title": "Small Comforts"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t5 August 2007 ", "body": "For all of the philosophic ruminating about words and language and the uses of signifiers, there is yet a power to creating words, to naming things.  Once we create a word, we now have yet another handy mental place-maker for retrieving that information.  Once we create a word, we can share it with other people, thus giving ourselves a tool for introducing ideas and discussing them.  Naming is a kind of power, for it can help create something de novo, and \u201cgive flesh\u201d to nascent ideas.When we find or create and use words, we can spread these new ideas and discuss them.  Just as disciplines need their specialised jargon, and new disciplines need new specialised jargon, other fields of human endeavour need their jargon.  Although the jargon of a group can be used badly to outgroup, it can also be used constructively to serve as a tool for unifying dissimilar people and sharing ideas, and it can also \u201clegitimise\u201d groups by giving them something of a more \u201creal\u201d or \u201csolid\u201d presence.Sometimes I make up words because they don\u2019t exist, but I still need them.  Frequently I borrow somewhat obscure words from various disciplines.  And sometimes people borrow words from other languages. One of my favourite word-nerd books is, They have a word for it: a lighthearted lexicon of untranslatable words & phrases by Howard Rheingold.As we endeavour to create new paradigms in the world, we need extra tools and new tools in our toolboxes.  So here\u2019s my first installment for you (I\u2019ll add some words of my own eventually-soon). Here\u2019s a list of words you didn\u2019t even know you needed, many with my own (necessarily briefer) definitions, and my own pronunciations:Animateur ah-nee-mah-TOOR (French) n. Someone who can take complicated ideas and processes and explain them to the general public.  Animateurs are superb teachers of theoretical or technical subjects, those who produce instructions rather than documentation; the world of technical writing has far too few animateurs!Bettschwere BET-schvair-eh (German) n. When you are too profoundly, guiltlessly lazy and \u201cbed-heavy\u201d to do anything as physically and mentally demanding as getting out of bed (not to be confused with being mentally wrung out or suffering from bone-tired exhaustion).  Sunday mornings are just built for this.  Also a chronic condition of teenagers.Bricoleur bree-coh-LURH (French) n. Someone who builds or designs things just by messing around rather than formally designing an explicit plan first. Bricolage is the process of tinkering around intuitively.Contestaire kohn-tess-TAIR (French, from the 1968 revolution) n. The person who challenges an established order, not to be confused with one merely being a rebel or troublemaker or violent provocateur.  Rheingold says, \u201cA contestaire is not the same as a rebel, for rebels often become the establishment when their revolutions succeed.  A contestaire would continue to ask troublesome questions after the revolution.\u201dl\u2019Esprit de l\u2019escalier ehs-PREE duh les-kal-YAY (French) n.  Literally the \u201cspirit of the staircase\u201d, referring to when you think of that great retort or reply \u2014 after it\u2019s way too late and the moment has passed.Fisselig FVIS-se-lich (German) adj. Flustered to the point of incompetance due to too much supervision.  A lot of people feel fisselig when being taught to drive. Maya MAH-yah (Sanskrit) n. Rheingold defines it well: \u201cThe mistaken belief that a symbol is the same as the reality it represents.\u201d  Foolishly believing that your mental map is the same as the territory or world that it models.Nadi NAH-dee (Balinese) v. Rheingold again: \u201cTo temporarily inhabit another dimension. \u2026 If you know a thinker or an artist or an \u2018absentminded professor\u2019 who seems to be \u2018in another world\u2019 part of the time, don\u2019t insult or disturb the entranced one: He or she may simply be in nadi.\u201d  I\u2019m in nadi a lot; my mom used to complain that I was \u201calways off in my own little world\u201d.  (How would I be in someone else\u2019s little world?) Ohrwurm OAR-vurm (German) n. Literally an earwig insect, refers figuratively to that song that gets stuck in your head, or a musical meme infecting a population that becomes a pop hit.   I use the term \u201corhwurm obsession\u201d to refer to that tune I put on repeat in my music player to fill my mental background and help me concentrate.  Ohrwurm obsessions can last for days or weeks and then suddenly the song is tiresome and I must find a new one, and feel adrift until I have found one that fits. Papierkrieg pah-PEER-kreeg (German) n. The annoyingly complicated bureaucratic paperwork required for making a complaint/ return/ insurance claim/ protesting a ticket/ petitioning for services, et cetera ad nauseam.  Rheingold eloquently explains, \u201cPapierkrieg is more deliberate than red tape.  Bureaucracies produce red tape the way sawmills produce sawdust or cattle produce manure, as a natural and unwitting byproduct that has to be disposed of or waded through. Papierkrieg is a consciously created obstacle.\u201dSchlimmbesserung shlimm-BESS-air-ung (German) n. When \u201cnew and improved\u201d isn\u2019t: another one of those so-called \u201cimprovements\u201d that really just make life more difficult and complicated; the bane of latent luddites everywhere.Tartle TAR-tl (Scottish) v. To hesitate or be slow when recognising a person or thing. Those of us who are faceblind tartle a LOT.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.co.uk/They-Have-Word-Lighthearted-Untranslatable/dp/1889330469/ref=sr_1_1/203-3253630-3127123?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186348049&sr=8-1"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/05/new-tools-you-didnt-even-know-you-needed/", "title": "New tools you didn\u2019t even know you\u00a0needed!"},

Hah!)\u201cGod, people can be dumbasses,\u201d agrees Badgerbag, who goes on to describe her \u201cfrustration with \u2018fussy\u2019 accessibility provisions at BlogHer in Chicago.\u201d  (Badgerbag says she is \u201cmessy, surly, and full of books\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m sure we have plenty of things in common here.)Even once you get where you\u2019re going, the whole horrific setup can be enough to trigger meltdowns, which Astrid describes in \u201cVacation and Disability: My Challenges\u201d.  I would think that dealing with the  Russian Police might be traumatic for everyone! (Obviously the Powers That Be forgot to tell Astrid that she\u2019s only allowed one disability. =joke=)Bev explains, \u201cVacations can be hard. Have you ever gotten to your destination only to find that you\u2019ve left that very important toy or comfort object back at home? Sleeping in a strange bed, keeping odd hours, encountering God knows what kinds of foods\u2013traveling can be a real nightmare for some autistic people.\u201d\u201cCrisis!\u201d exclaims MOM-NOS in agreement, \u201cA boy\u2019s favorite toy lost in the lake, with a thunderstorm threatening. But a thoughtful lifeguard and a lucky mom combine forces to save the day!\u201d *whew* \u201cA real life saver\u201d, indeed.Bev goes on to explain that she came up with a different rescue tactic, complete with her signature postcards, tees and such.  Brilliant!  Lorraine Hershon might want to check out the gravel postcard, as she endeavours to Keep Buggerin On, but finds that the nice little cottage is accessible, sure \u2026 after 150 yards of GRAVEL. \u201cGravel, I love it! Who the heck plans this stuff?!\u201d  And then she went on \u201cA Trip to Blanchland\u201d and guess what?  That\u2019s right, she found a Richard!Ruth Harrigan (Wheelie Catholic) certainly agrees with Bev\u2019s sentiment, \u201cVacation \u2014 you don\u2019t have to leave home to have one.\u201d Indeed, she found a variety of unknown attractions in her home town, and didn\u2019t even have to cope with airlines, railways, hotels or other nuisances.  She got to sleep in her own bed! Smart gal.\u201cI like vacations!\u201d exclaims David cheerfully. \u201cSometimes the everyday \u201cstuff\u201d of living with cerebral palsy can drive me crazy. It\u2019s nice to get away, relax, explore new places, and hang out with my family.\u201d He goes on to explain that bike trails built upon old railways are excellent because they are so very flat.Then Penny Richards points out that much of the trail around \u201cAustin\u2019s Lady Bird Lake\u201d is chair-accessible.  It\u2019s an interesting story about how ecological restoration also leads to civil rights improvements.  I nod enthusiastically, as wildflowers are also good for the butterflies and other beneficial insects, too.Meanwhile, our latest visitor to the snack buffet comes by and stakes claim on a cushy chaise longue, noting, \u201cHey! I\u2019m unable to work because of Chronic Pain. Fun! To those who are ignorant of our plight, it\u2019s like I am on a chronic holiday. \u2018Gee, I wish I wasn\u2019t able to work like you!\u2019 \u201d  So naturally Donimo takes the piss outta all those do-gooders who think they know The Cure for what ails ya; \u201cIt\u2019s just a few simple steps\u201d, don\u2019t you know.By default, Zephyr (AKA Arthritic Young Thing) is \u201cOn Holiday \u2026 And Wishing I Weren\u2019t\u201d, and only too glad to join the social group, as being stuck home alone is driving her nutz, \u201cI guess what I\u2019m really whining about is the lack of company. Being alone all day for up to 12-hour stretches is really isolating and dull.\u201d  (Hmn, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s one of the autistic bloggers.)All this news is a bit of a bummer, so this is my cue to pull out some cartons of Wonder Bubbles.  \u201cOkay, who wants a green bottle?  Blue one?  Pink one?  Yellow bottle o\u2019 bubbles?  Let me know if you\u2019re missing a wand\u2026\u201d  Personally, I\u2019m a big believer in Bubble Therapy to lift sagging spirits.  Soon the patio and butterfly garden are adrift with streams of iridescent globes drifting aloft.Linda and her partner Elizabeth decide that they really needed a break from things, and Linda thought that \u201cThe \u2018almost accessible\u2019 vacation\u201d would be adequate, with just a little extra planning and oxygen.  Linda reports on the unanticipated problems, including her own.   (Linda is guest-blogging on Elizabeth\u2019s blog, Screw Bronze!)Thankfully, there\u2019s good news on the access front, as the Rolling Rains Report tests the waters of Universal Design being applied to sailing, and finds them most excellent, with \u201cAccessible Sailing & Good Design in Boston are Good for Tourism\u201d.  Hooray, someone in the tourism industry \u201cgets it\u201d!Of course, I\u2019m over 1200 kilometers from the ocean, so instead am looking closely while Katja of brokenclay tackles rustic \u201caccommodations\u201d and trails in the wilds of Colorado in Camping Trip, Part 1.  We eagerly await the next installment of this serial, with marshmallows ready for the roasting!Meanwhile, intrepid Englishwoman Jean Fraser is pushing her own envelope as she undertakes \u201cThe Journey\u201d in the UK, from Whitstable to Hastings.  You can read about her bicycling and artistic efforts in her blog, Drawing Breath. (I want to know how she keeps her derri\u00e8re from going numb!)On the other wheel, just arrived back to recently-flooded parts of the UK, Wheelchair Dancer updates us with \u201cThe trip SO far\u201d, including reviews of the airline (a refreshing thumbs-up) and the limo driver who was \u201cbatshit AWOL\u201d, which isn\u2019t promising. Seventeenth-century building codes don\u2019t quite work for her or her tall companion, Wizard, and then Wizard wonders how they\u2019re washing the dishes at the Balti take-away, and \u2026Speaking of airlines, Peter Tan suggests flying Air Asia if you want better accessibility (here\u2019s to hoping that this airline doesn\u2019t mangle chairs down in the cargo hold, but they look quite promising). He has lots of photos, too.  What\u2019s a trip without photos, after all?Candy Harrington chimes in with quite the horror story about booking a chair-accessible cabin on a cruise ship \u2014 only to discover to their astonished horror that yes, the cabin is accessible \u2026 (that seemed like good news at the time).\u201cLook out!  Tiger Swallowtail coming through!\u201d \u201cSorry, easily distractible!  Now, where were we?\u201dOh, yeah. There\u2019s a bunch of thankfulness going on at another corner of the patio, where Leticia with Cause of Our Joy briefly describes the regular adventure that is Our Special Children in Church.  Barbara\u2019s Tchatzkahs follows a not-too-dissimilar spiritual path as she quotes an article by Judith Fein, \u201cChronic Pain? List These D\u2019s On Your Refrigerator\u201d. (Note: blog has a flickering animation in the sidebar.)  Jody DeVere describes both her son\u2019s change of spirit, and how her family\u2019s life has changed to before and after the accident that disabled him in \u201cMy Son Gets a Second Life\u201d.And in the end, Kara Sheridan wonders if it\u2019s possible to go \u201cOn holiday from all things disabled\u201d, just for a little while. \u201cNo matter HOW positively you view any aspect or piece of your world, ALL this focus on one area can be *overwhelming* and tiresome. Adam keeps me grounded with his reminders not to become an \u201cextremist\u201d but sometimes I long for a real break from it all\u2026not forever, just a nice holiday.\u201d\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m on holiday,\u201d says Miss Crip Chick, who then describes all the attendant side-issues of organising activist conferences. \u201cEven though these conferences take A LOT of energy (imagine having to always defend your every belief), fellow activists and I treat them like vacations because it\u2019s when we get to see each other. How messed up is that??? I think community is a big part of the \u201cvacation\u201d concept because the main point of vacations and holidays is to give you energy.\u201dIndeed.Woah, \u201ctime funs when you\u2019re having flies\u201d \u2014 the fireflies are out!  How\u2019d it get so late?  Say, thank you so much everyone, for taking time to come by, and share all your stories.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t11 August 2007", "body": "\u201cHey, this is the first vacation you haven\u2019t gotten sick,\u201d declared hubby cheerfully.  I wanted to protest that I don\u2019t always get sick, meaning coming down with something prolonged and viral, but then I realised that he meant that I wasn\u2019t out a day or two feeling crappy from something or another. Indeed, aside from accidentally eating some fudge made with wheat flour (whoda thunk?!), I have been in good shape.  A lot of that comes from more careful diet, and the rest from knowing how to pace myself.David is in charge of the next Disability Blog Carnival, and he came up with the theme of \u201cTop 10 Lists\u201d.  After having read everyone\u2019s vacation experiences here in the previous post, it occurred to me that a lot of us are quite conflicted about taking trips.  Too often they seem more trouble than they\u2019re worth. Okay, when people dread doing something that\u2019s supposed to be fun, you know that things are really Screwed Up.  Something has gone terribly wrong.  We need to take our assumptions and dump them, like icemelt from the picnic cooler.You are hereby relieved of having to follow \u201cscripts\u201d about what people are \u201csupposed\u201d to do regarding vacation activities. Real life is not a sitcom or a Hallmark greeting card.  A vacation is meant for fun, relaxation, and a break from the daily grind.  There\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d way to have a vacation, because people have different interests and needs.  So here\u2019s my Top 10 List for how to actually enjoy a vacation:1.    You don\u2019t have to do things all together, all the time.  When visiting friends or relations, it may be easier on everyone to make it a day-trip rather than imposing by staying with them and then having to play Host and Guest.  In fact, don\u2019t feel that you have to go with anyone at all \u2013 it\u2019s okay to spend money on yourself (that\u2019s being self-centered, not selfish).2.    Schedule in lots of down time. Vacations are for relaxing. Sometimes you need recovery time from traveling and/or adventuring.3.    Avoid crowds, if they\u2019re stressful. You don\u2019t have to stay in large hotels, drive on highways, or visit famous sights.  Consider staying in a small town and making a day-trip to the Big City to see a sight and eat someplace special, and then flee back to your refuge to recharge.  It\u2019s a lot less hassle to have a \u201cbase camp\u201d and only do the luggage hauling a couple of times, rather than every few days.4.    Pack stress-reduction gear. Things like your favourite pillow, headphones and music, fidget-widgets, sunglasses et cetera are good sensory interventions to reduce stress and bolster comfort.5.    Pack a hamper of favorite foods. That way you\u2019ll be prepared when there\u2019s \u201cnothing good to eat\u201d at restaurants, and/or when you aren\u2019t up to venturing out.  Consider bringing a place-setting, including your favourite mug, bowl, plate, and utensils (knife-fork-spoon, chopsticks, paring knife, bottle opener, corkscrew, whatever).  That way you won\u2019t be forced to deal with Styrofoam, fragile sporks, plastic mugs or anything else annoys the hell outta you.  (Don\u2019t forget a zipper baggie with a small bottle of dish soap/washing-up liquid and a sponge.)6.    Pack diversions and/or enticements. Solitary diversions are things such as reading material, or puzzle books for when you dine alone or simply want to be someplace public, but don\u2019t want to attract the attentions of strangers who might want to chat you up.  Enticements are low-risk social activities to engage strangers.  (I\u2019m sure the more extroverted readers can suggest what those might be\u2026)7.    Balance the new and the true. Offset the novelties with the comforting favourites.  Too much novelty is stressful. Charming B&Bs are fun, but it\u2019s good to know that the dull but reliably accessible chain hotel is waiting for you that first night you\u2019re there.8.    Build in buffers. Aim for a deadline-free day before leaving, without employment or appointments.  This is likely damn near impossible, but the fewer things left for the day before, the less stress you\u2019ll accumulate before you even leave.  Because major altitude changes or jetlag really affect me, I don\u2019t plan on doing anything that needs major physical or mental effort the first day of my arrival. Just the packing and getting there is plenty of work.9.    Keep a packing list in your suitcase.  I invariably forget something when I\u2019m packing, frequently one or more of the same somethings I forget each time.  So I started keeping a packing list in my suitcase, that logical and inescapable safe place.  It\u2019s miserable being far from home and realizing you have cold toes but not your fluffly slippers.  (I also find I forget fewer things if I pack all the ingredients for an outfit, socks-underwear-slacks-belt-shirt-jacket/sweater, rather than random collections of slacks, shirts and so on.)10. Go do what YOU enjoy, not necessarily traditional holiday activities.   I\u2019ve been known to take photographs of bridges, pavement, and odd architectural bits around London more so than famous sights like Parliament.  (If I really need a shot of Parliament lit up at night, I can find one online.)  But I have a shot of the electric pavement section with the glowing blue and green lights in it!  And the Yellow Brick Road I found in Delft!  And the push-plate for a shop door in Dillon, Colorado, that was a boot sole!Well, that\u2019s my list.  On this trip we learned something important:  make sure that the place we\u2019re staying has internet access.  (We couldn\u2019t believe it \u2014 a budget-rate Hotel 8 has wi-fi, but the condo didn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019ve been composing posts from sojourns to a caf\u00e9.)  Aspie kid and I were beside ourselves from withdrawal from our fave relaxation activities.", "outgoing_links": ["http://growingupwithadisability.blogspot.com/"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/11/10-things-to-do-differently-when-on-holiday-redefining-vacationing/", "title": "10 things to do ^DIFFERENTLY when on holiday: Redefining\u00a0vacationing"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t16 August 2007", "body": "No cheese with this whine, please; I\u2019m out of crackers. It\u2019s HOT \u2014 we went from 24\u00b0C/75\u00b0F weather in the mountains to 40\u00b0C/104\u00b0F weather back home. It\u2019s humid, too. Weeds grew outrageously in my absence, but I\u2019ve no energy for tackling them when I get home from work. Nor do I have any energy to cook dinner, and no one has any ideas on what they want to eat, either. I need to buy groceries, but don\u2019t know what to get beyond the inevitable milk & toilet paper. The heat saps our appetites. The heat has melted all of my blogging ideas from my brain, and staring at the snippits in my drafts folder doesn\u2019t jog anything.Boy starts classes tomorrow, and at my school, the students return. I have no idea why it is that we start school every year in this weather, except that once-upon-a-time it was related to the harvest schedule. Now it\u2019s just related to bureaucratic inertia. I\u2019m exhausted, because school is starting and we\u2019ve been attending inservice meetings all day long. Several times I\u2019ve nearly leapt from my chair in startled hyperacussis over-reaction because they have also been testing the fire alarms. The alarms also have strobe-like flashers that make me feel nauseus. I also have to schedule an appointment with my GP because I\u2019m having intermittent dizzy moments, which may or may not be related to my tinnitus. (The good news is that my arthritis meds seem to have damped down the migraine issues.)In other parts of my life, this is also the time of year for the Big Bad Bugs. Well, large insects, but that lacks the fun of playing with a little alliteration.First up is the inevitable Bush Cicada (Homoptera: Cicadidae Tibicen dorsata), commonly referred to as a \u201clocust\u201d. Zwee-zwee-zwee they scream, the males\u2019 evening serenades to sex and summer. If you want to hear what cicadas sound like, then turn up your speakers and click on the audio files (given in both Mackintosh AIFF and Windows WAV formats) at the University of Michigan\u2019s cicada page. They don\u2019t have the T. dorsata song on there, but the last one near the bottom of the page, the T. pruinosa, is fairly similar. Yeah, they\u2019re loud \u2014 the males vibrate abdominal membranes called tymbals. Thankfully ours are not as loud as Australian cicadas. (My tinnitus is like having private reception to a cicada-radio channel; \u201cAll cicadas, all the time!\u201d)Females lay eggs in tree twigs, whereupon the nymphs drop down to the ground, dig in, and then suck sap off the tree\u2019s roots for two or three years. Then the nymphs crawl out of the ground onto tree trunks, where they molt and crawl out of their old exoskeletons, leaving the split shells stuck to the bark. These husks are a favourite of small boys who like to gross out small girls by sticking them on their clothes or hair. Well, except for those odd girls who find insects fascinating! I took this picture in the morning when it was still napping; I think it was asleep \u2014 hard to tell when the critter has no eyelids. How big? These common cidadas grow about 2.25 inches/ 55 mm.(Description: a great big hunchbacked insect perched on a tomato leaf, with two pairs of long clear wings, six brown legs, bulging pale eyes, and orange, black, white and brown markings geometrically patterned around the body.)Well, cicadas are harmless, albeit noisy \u2014 especially if you trying to pick one up and it buzzes at you in agitation. The cicada killer (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae Sphecius speciosus, a redundant-sounding name if there ever was one) is another giant insect, a wasp that preys upon the annual abundance of super-sized sap-suckers. Although they look scary, you\u2019re in no danger. (The males don\u2019t even have stingers.)\n(Description: a large wasp perched on the end of a zinnia leaf, with a black abdomen splotched with yellow, a red and gold thorax (chest), two pairs of amber coloured wings, 6 gold legs, red eyes, and black atennae.)These wasps dig tunnels in the ground, catch cicadas, stun them, then take them home and lay eggs on the comatose critters. Charming, eh what? Of course, a lot of interesting insect behaviour revolves around sex, and the males will form groups called \u201cleks\u201d where they hang around an area together in hopes of attracting the attentions of virgin females, like groups of guys hanging out at street corners or store fronts, calling out, \u201cHey ba-by!\u201d There were a bunch of them swooping around a giant patch of zinnias, near some nice soft soil that was perfect for digging tunnels, as evidenced by numbers of tunnels. How big? Just about the same size as the bush cicada, if not a smidge bigger. It\u2019s a real chore to drag dinner home when it\u2019s as big as you are!(Description: a Cicada Killer in the grass, perched atop an upside-down cicada.)Sex determination in these insects is interesting; if the mother fertilises the egg, it will be a female, and if not, then the offspring will be a male. Because female offspring are larger, they get provisioned with two cicadas; their smaller brothers only need one. Each of the offspring gets its own burrow, as these are not eusocial insects like honeybees.\nWell, I\u2019m going to bed. The cicadas have finally Shut! Up! for the night, and now the crickets and fireflies are on stage. Cricket song is a nice thing to listen to, as long as one isn\u2019t sounding off right near your head \u2026\u00a0", "outgoing_links": ["http://insects.ummz.lsa.umich.edu/fauna/Michigan_Cicadas/Michigan/Index.html", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/hymenoptera_crabonidae_sphecius_speciosus-cicada-killer.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/hymenoptera_crabonidae_sphecius_speciosus-cicada-killer.jpg"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/16/things-that-bug-me/", "title": "Things that bug\u00a0me"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t17 August 2007 ", "body": "Well, it\u2019s horribly hot outside, which means that the classrooms are either quite stuffy and humid-sticky, or due to HVAC design errors, uncomfortably cold for 95% of the personnel using them.  The faculty, staff and students are all yawning from screwed-up sleep schedules, and from being bombarded with mind-numbing amounts of new information, masses of new people to become acquainted with, and multiple changes in their schedules.  In other words, it\u2019s once again the first days of school.Once we get past the obligatory, \u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna learn, and here\u2019s the class rules\u201d lecture, we get to finally sink into the actual teaching-learning part of the class. Alas, there is a definite sinking feeling in the classrooms, as for the first few periods of the day many of the students are still half-asleep (a few gave up and have totally succumbed), are often suffering from low blood-sugar levels because they skipped breakfast, and/or just generally cannot rouse enthusiasm for studying biology, algebra, government or whatever subject was given to them for 7:40 a.m.   (Omigod, these are teenagers \u2014 if pedagogy actually followed research-based practice, none of them would have class until 10 a.m. when they would physiologically be ready to be awake.  But of course, that would \u2013godforbid\u2013 mess up the sports practices.)So the teachers are desperately trying to keep their charges engaged by encouraging dialog. You say, \u201cLet me know if you have any questions.\u201d  Judging by the general lack of responses regarding the lecture topic, the blank stares, and the mass confusion when given labwork and projects, the students should be asking questions.  Or, should be asking more appropriate questions.But actually, this issue is not the proximate question of, \u201cHow do you get the students to ask questions?\u201d  Rather, we must first ask the ultimate question of, \u201cWhy do you want students to ask questions?\u201dProbably you want to be sure that the students are:\n1.    Awake;\n2.    Paying attention to the topic;\n3.    Mentally engaged with the subject.And really, those are fair concerns.  Otherwise, what the hell are you and the students all doing there, besides using up O2 molecules?   Let\u2019s face it, there are more ambient places to forage for food, get sleep, or assess potential mates.There are other reasons for wanting the students to ask questions.  You want to ensure that the process of attending to the teaching is an active and self-correcting process.  When it comes to teaching-learning, it takes two to tango.Part of that active and self-correcting process requires that the student be good self-advocates, that they will \u201ccheck in\u201d with the instructor to make sure they are comprehending the material.  Unfortunately, by the time students get to high school or college, they have spent years in the world of schools designed to turn out consistent robots, where individual thinking was discouraged in favor of getting the \u201cright\u201d answer, and where their creative energies were distracted by the inconsequential bread-and-circuses of commercialized fads, and the group-think of team identities.There are those students who don\u2019t participate in such (either because they can\u2019t or they won\u2019t), and are outcasts in their nonconformity. These are the geeks, nerds and fools, with intelligences ranging all over the place.  In their earnest zeal, they are likely your best question-asking students, yet paradoxically, they are also those who generally have the worst abilities to be self-advocates because both the system and the student body have dumped on them for years.When you start asking \u2013 nay, demanding \u2013 that the students become more active, you are stepping outside of the r\u00f4les everyone has assumed.  This is uncomfortable because of the potential for embarrassment.  The students all crave positive attention from their peers, but not at the price of (gasp!) standing out.  Or worse, of looking like an idiot.  All through school the students have been assessed in a hundred ways and found wanting.  They are tested not to check their progress and give them feedback, but rather the test scores compare them to perfect ideals and to each other.  The goal has been shifted from personal mastery to competition.  The emphasis has shifted from learning as an ongoing process, to learning as the constant pursuit of achieving one bitter carrot just so they can go after yet another.Asking questions exposes a person; it lays them open to appearing deficient in the eyes of the teacher, or inferior to their peers.  To get past that, the students have to feel safe.  Asking questions should yield something positive, something worth striving for, but not in a way that is too risky.There are several ways to increase question-asking by students.  There is no one sure-fire guaranteed method, because as every instructor has observed, classes are highly variable sets comprised of greater or fewer inspired students.  Too many factors come into play, from which semester the class falls, the size of the class, the temperaments of the individuals, the time of day, and so on.Create expectation.  I tell my students that it is their JOB to ask me questions; that is why they are here, and why they paid for the class.  They should get their money\u2019s worth.  This plays on the student\u2019s sense of entitlement; they want to get something out of their time with you.  It also works because it helps re-define their r\u00f4le in the classroom \u2013 the students are not there to obey the teacher, but rather the teacher is there to serve the students.  (Shocking idea, ain\u2019t it?)Create opportunity.  You\u2019ve heard it before, but it\u2019s worth repeating: stop periodically and ask for questions.  I have to consciously remind myself to do this, because once I get going on a pedantic roll, it\u2019s all too easy to keep on going.  Don\u2019t ask \u201cif\u201d anyone has questions.  Stop what you are doing \u2013 put down the pointer, the chalk or marker, sit down on the table or whatever, and put the lecturing on [Pause] and ask, \u201cWhat questions do you have so far?\u201d  Then wait \u2026 and wait \u2026 and wait\u2026 (this is the hardest part for me; I don\u2019t count to ten, I count to twenty-five).  You have to wait, because the students have to review what you\u2019ve talked about already, probably leafing through the handouts and notes, or mentally re-winding their memory pictures, and contemplate what it was you were talking about, and relate it to what they already know, and feel along to discern just where it was the comprehension process went klunk-klunk-thud, and pull out the vocabulary to express that cognitive disconnect, and then be able to put that into a verbal question.  All that takes time.Create humbleness.  Once again, I am re-defining the traditional teaching paradigm (I\u2019m a sneaky radical that way), by emphasizing my own humanity and fallability.  When I write stuff on the board, especially anything number-related, I tell them to keep an eye on me and to tell me if I make a transposition or write the wrong thing down.  Now, students (especially teenagers) love to catch the authorities making mistakes.  They will watch you like a hawk!  Ask them to find errors in textbooks, or false premises in ads, magazine or newspaper articles, or anything related to the subject that just looks fishy, and to bring them in for the class to analyse in collective discussion.  This takes the subject out of the classroom and into their own lives and back again.  This also helps them develop their own critical thinking skills, but only if you explain the difference between skepticism and cynicism.  Any young fool can be cynical and put on worldly airs, but it takes someone with knowledge of both the subject and of logic fallacies to be skeptical.Create openings.  Students are often not used to thinking in class, not necessarily because they can\u2019t think, but because it\u2019s been bludgeoned out of them in the cause of making \u201cwell-disciplined\u201d students, educational cannon-fodder, as it were.  You get them to start thinking by asking them questions, but not binary right-or-wrong questions.  Ask them open-ended questions where you don\u2019t provide a choice of answers.  Ask them divergent questions that have several potential answers (after all, real life is messy this way, and there are no answers in the back of the book).  No one wants to get pounced-upon; let the students volunteer to answer, lest they be caught unexpectedly like deer in the headlights.  But use peer pressure to your advantage, and expect them to follow through; let the pauses extend while you wait for an answer. (You\u2019re stubborn, aren\u2019t you? Use that stubbornness!)  If necessary, let them brain-storm in small groups for a couple of minutes; this is especially helpful for those first-hour classes where everyone is still in their pyjamas, mentally if not literally.  (Sometimes I miss the days when people used to dress up to attend college classes.)Create glad chaos.  More radical stuff; move the chairs out of rows or take the students outside, something to break free of the soldierly paradigm.  The first week of class, ask them to share stories about previous experiences in classes they loved and classes they hated, and describe why they loved and hated those classes.  Let them become alive, and individual, and aware of education as a process, and self-aware with regards to their own learning.  Then once you have shaken things up; keep them shaken up!  The dread inertia will evilly try to settle over everyone again from one class day to the next.  Make them keep re-arranging where they sit, and by whom they sit.  This forces new perspectives on everyone, from the classmates they confer with to how they see you.  (Of course, this has to be balanced with accessibility issues; the student who gets distracted easily or who cannot see the board well should not get shoved to the back of the classroom.)Create feedback.  Observe the students, and watch for those cues of confusion.  Share with them respect for their learning process and acknowledge their confusion and ask to help untangle it.   Often there are a few students who are inclined to do most of the question-asking, and the challenge is to honor their enthusiasm and balance that with heeding the uncertainty of the other students.  Ask for comments and questions from those who haven\u2019t spoken up yet that day.The secret to getting students to ask questions is to give them back the freedom that has been stolen from them, and to honor their hurt from that loss.  You have to be able to not only identify what they have lost, but also to offer them something positive to put into its place, a new sense of what learning can be.  You have to give them the tools to build that new kind of learning to take with them.  Students sometimes have to be trained in study skills, but fortunately everyone has the innate ability to learn.  The biggest trick is uncovering where it was that they had safely stowed away that ability to learn.It\u2019s great theory.  Often it works, too.  Some days I still have the urge to brew a pot of strong coffee \u2026\u201cThe art of raising challenging questions [in teaching science] is easily as important as the art of giving clear answers.\u201d And I would have to add, \u2018The art of cultivating such questions, of keeping good questions alive, is as important as either of those.\u2019  Good questions are the ones that pose dilemmas, subvert obvious or canonical \u2018truths,\u2019 force incongruities on our attention.\u201d\n~Jerome Bruner", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/17/asking-questions/", "title": "Asking questions"},

Both the shape and dimensions are just right to hold in my large hands.  Lovely to hold when eating, and even warming my hands.It\u2019s the very quintessence of \u201cbowl\u201d.Any kind of food looks more attractive contrasting against the black glaze. It\u2019s big enough to hold an adequate amount of food for one meal. Because of its appropriately semi-spherical shape and ceramic composition, it keeps the food warm while I\u2019m eating it.  The sides are steep enough to collect tidy lumps of rice with my chopsticks.  The curvature of the bottom perfectly matches that of my Lexan tablespoon. (Like lacquered wood, this high-density plastic don\u2019t annoy my teeth the way metal flatware does).It\u2019s a pleasure to eat from.  I look forward to using it every day at lunch time.Any meal is automatically better with my bowl, be it curry, chile, or cold cereal.  I care for it and guard its well-being, as my first one got chipped on the rim from careless handling through the dishwasher.  I don\u2019t leave the bowl knocking around the countertop at work, where it can risk being damaged, broken, or permanently \u201cborrowed\u201d.Doubtless this seems over-meticulous to some people; to them it\u2019s \u201cjust a bowl\u201d.  For those inclined to labelling, it borders on OCD or being anal-retentive. That\u2019s only because most people aren\u2019t so particular about their lunch containers. Some people are equally particular about their vehicles, keeping them clean, frequently washed and serviced.  But of course, pristine automobiles are more valuable, and thus more highly valued, than are single bowls.  Nevermind that my bowl gives me functional use and \u00e6sthetic value every day.  This is because well-designed, simple objects are usually given less status in this country than are objects that are new, flashy, high-tech, or over-powered.Given the opportunity, I take my bowl with me when travelling.  Most people have mental lists of what they would pack in advent of emergencies, such as forced emigration from flooding.  In addition to the standard \u201cchange of clothes, medications, documents, pets\u201d I also have \u201claptop, bowl, pillow\u201d.  When the world around you is in chaos, you want some touch-stones of stability, those little daily comforts that form a linking thread of familiarity and reliability.Because of these reasons, my bowl has a personal history with me.  It\u2019s been around places, a service piece of solidarity that supports me no matter what else is going on in my life.  The exceptional design is not just user-friendly \u2014 the object has turned into a friend.  I have not named it, and don\u2019t entertain conversations with it the way a child does with a favorite stuffed animal, but I would be aggrieved in much the same way were something to happen to it.My bowl is not perfect.  Although it embodies those Greek ideals of functional form and simple beauty, it is still an earthly object.  It is fragile, and thus impermanent.  There is a small pimple of glaze that mars the smoothness.  With ongoing use it slowly acquires the patina of age, the wear on the glaze at the bottom of the inside, and on the foot.  It only seems solid and unchanging, but in actuality it too is in a constant state of becoming. These imperfections are part of why I cherish it; they make it unique and individual and personal, much like the worn nose on a cherished teddy bear.  In this regard, it also embodies the Japanese ideals of wabi-sabi.Sometimes I contemplate these qualities as I am eating lunch, in nadi as I am focused upon the food I am eating and the dish I am using.  I love it.  It\u2019s a great bowl.(Hat-tip to Bev, who reminded me about this subject I\u2019d been meaning to address.)", "outgoing_links": ["http://nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm", "http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2007/08/thing-about-things.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/19/adore-a-bowl/", "title": "Adore-a-bowl"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t21 August 2007", "body": " \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with my son.  You don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like.  He CAN\u2019T LEARN.  He\u2019s been in school for FIVE YEARS and has learned NOTHING!  I\u2019ve been to all these meetings.  It took him MONTHS of therapy to teach him how to sit down!  He\u2019ll NEVER be able to talk. He\u2019s severe.\u201dThis is a made-up letter.  It\u2019s a highly shortened version of letters I\u2019ve seen a number of parents post on various discussion boards.  It\u2019s alarming on several fronts:  the parent is stressed beyond their limits, and is of the belief that their son has not learned anything and cannot learn anything, and not surprisingly, has all but given up on the school he\u2019s been attending, and also that because the child cannot [reliably] speak at this age that they will never speak or never be able to communicate by other means.  The parent is certain that the child is DOOMED and will never mature into a capable, happy adult.  (The grammatical and attributive errors of \u201che\u2019s severe\u201d also make my brain hurt, but that\u2019s another issue.)Judging by the complaints of parents who blog about their frustrations with schools or with their children, there is no lack of bad pedagogical examples.You try something.  It doesn\u2019t work.  You tweak it, and persist at employing Instructional Method X for a semester.  For an entire year.  New IEP, with a few tweaks, new room, different teacher.  Still pretty much a variation upon Method X for another semester and another year, because X is the method that the teachers learned when they went to teaching college, and the tweaks were what the SpEd specialist learned from when they went to teaching college, picked up at a seminar, and heard from another SpEd specialist that worked on another kid who was also diagnosed with \u201cA\u201d.  By all accounts, it should work.Let\u2019s work on that some more.We\u2019ll start off with the basic premise, \u201cmy son has been in school for five years and learned nothing\u201d. There are a variety of reasons for this resulting perception:\nThe child has not been taught in ways that work with their learning modality.\nThe child has not been given adequate instruction in the curriculum.\nThe child has not been assessed in ways that can adequately measure their learning, which is closely tied to:\nThe child does not understand what others want them to communicate about their knowledge.\n1.  The child has not been taught in ways that work with their learning modality.Let me ask you: if you go to the fridge looking for a snack and find that there\u2019s no apple pie left and return to what you were doing,\n\u2014 and you go to the fridge looking for a snack and find that there\u2019s no apple pie left and return to what you were doing,\n\u2014 and you go to the fridge looking for a snack and find that there\u2019s no apple pie left and return to what you were doing,\n\u2014 and you go to the fridge looking for a snack and find that there\u2019s no apple pie left and return to what you were doing, what does that mean?Maybe you\u2019re so distracted by what you\u2019re doing you\u2019re not really paying attention to what was in the fridge; I\u2019ve been known to do that \u2026  But seriously, would it be rational to expect to find apple pie the umpteenth time?  Of course not.  If you do \u201cB\u201d repeatedly and keep getting \u201cC\u201d, then it\u2019s not sensible to keep doing \u201cB\u201d if \u201cW\u201d is your goal.And yet when children don\u2019t appear to be learning by the methods we use, what do we do?  We spend inordinate amounts of time teaching them how to learn the \u201cappropriate\u201d way by remedial learning.  We\u2019re trying to teach them how to learn the right way. This is foolish; it\u2019s not that people can\u2019t learn.  It\u2019s that not everyone learns the same way.  This isn\u2019t news.  But setting up \u201cspecial education\u201d as a way of trying to pare off all the square blocks so they better fit into the round learning holes like all the other \u201cnormal\u201d blocks only speaks to the shortsightedness of teaching approaches.A different tack: instead of focusing on things going wrong, start listing when things go right. Try and figure out why/how things go right/well so you can do more of that. In other words, lead with strengths instead of always trying to remediate the weaknesses.  It also really, really helps to tie the curriculum to the child\u2019s special interests.  Which leads us to:2. The child has not been given adequate instruction in the curriculum. It\u2019s really scary when we allow students to go through years of schooling without giving them the actual content they\u2019re supposed to be there to learn.  I\u2019m not talking about the few students who don\u2019t have the abstract abilities to master algebra \u2014 not everyone needs algebra.  I\u2019m talking about students whose IEPs focused upon learning how to pretend to be normal, or watered-down curriculum.It\u2019s a shocking truth, but there are some students out there who find the easy things to be difficult, and the difficult things to be easy.  Some kids will be better off learning how to keyboard and rely upon spell-check, instead of learning how to print neatly and master all the minutiae of phonics prepatory to using reading primers.  Neither printing nor phonics are bad things, but they are merely tools toward the end-goal of print & screen communication; they are not lasting end goals unto themselves.  Getting \u201cstuck\u201d on these as IEP goals can make a student pretty sick of school, especially if they\u2019d rather be learning about Venetian glasswork or cartography.3. The child has not been assessed in ways that can adequately measure their learning.You have to decide what kind of learning you are trying to assess before you decide upon an evaluation method.  One also needs to select an evaluation method that will produce valid results.  That is, you wouldn\u2019t give a blind student a #2 pencil and Scantron (bubble-page) to fill in for a multiple-choice test, and you wouldn\u2019t give a student with test-anxiety a 100-question test to complete in 45 minutes.  Hopefully those are obvious as hell.  But really, everyone learns.  So what we have are a gap between what we want to know about what the child is learning (which may or may not have anything to do with the curriculum), and what the child is demonstrating.Probably the child has learned quite a bit of stuff, but is not able to demonstrate that the learning has occurred, in a way that the school staff and parents are able to perceive. By analogy, the student is sending ham radio signals, but the others can\u2019t get them on their televisions, so therefore they say the child either is not learning, or cannot communicate. One really cannot always assign mental processes to the results they see. (I cannot tell you how many times people have come off with some entirely off-the-wall assumption about me from what they observed.)4. The child does not understand what others want them to communicate about their knowledge.The child may not always realise that what the adults are trying to do is to test the child\u2019s acquisition of knowledge, and therefore, that they need to communicate their learning to the adults, and that they need to communicate it in a way that the adults are able to perceive!Hey, that\u2019s a lot of social psychology & semiotics for a young child to understand, and heaven knows, autistics are usually slower to acquire that social understanding.  I remember being tested for Kindergarten, and having great difficulty understanding not the questions I was being asked, but rather why adults were asking me such questions.  They were asking me things that adults should know the answers to, and the fact that they were asking me, a mere child, was so confounding that I couldn\u2019t hardly answer anything, even though I knew everything they were testing me on.  (Full story here, \u201cThe words got in the way\u201d.)The whole \u201clearning\u201d thing is seen as not happening because people have a different \u201csearch image\u201d for responses than those that are given! In my case, my response was either \u201cmissing\u201d (unseen) or \u201cwrong\u201d because it was different. It is as though they are expecting me to say, \u201cMerci beaucoup\u201d and instead I answer in Dutch, \u201cDank U well,\u201d or use American Sign Language, /thank-you/. (And then they called me \u201cunresponsive\u201d and \u201cclueless\u201d!)So in summary, when you are thinking that the child \u201ccan\u2019t learn anything\u201d because they cannot prove that learning \u2014 think again.What happens many, many times with autistics is that the others are on a different wavelength. They can\u2019t tell what\u2019s in other people\u2019s heads. That famous autistic lack of \u201ctheory of mind\u201d (which isn\u2019t really an utter lack thereof; young autistic children are merely slower to acquire some kinds of understandings), actually works both ways. The neurotypical parents cannot understand that the autistic is thinking or what they are thinking, because they cannot pick up on the different social cues. It\u2019s not necessarily that the child isn\u2019t thinking or isn\u2019t learning.When we expect all learning to occur in specific circumstances and by specific kind of pedagogical approaches, and when we assume that our \u201ctests\u201d are the only or best ways of assessing understanding or skill mastery, and when we expect communication to automatically be of the verbal sort, we run into problems.  And then people start drawing terrible conclusions about what they think is going on.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/21/learning-nothing/", "title": "Learning Nothing"},

You cannot make a case for discrimination unless you can prove that you are a member of a group that has been discriminated against.   Now please explain to the court how being homosexual substantially limits one or more major life activities.\u201dThis is satire, of the dark sort.  I have never really filed a court complaint.  My actual time in a court process is limited to paying a minor speeding ticket (lesson learned: cruise control is a good thing).I have been at that ugly social place (repeatedly so) where complaining about homophobic remarks simply sets one up for further sexual harassment, because everyone assumes that complaining about such means that you are gay, and that because you\u2019re gay you \u201cdeserve\u201d whatever abuse happens.The point to this bit of theatre of the absurd is that a person need not be a particular sort of person to have been harassed or discriminated against. You don\u2019t have to be gay, lesbian, bisexual et cetera to have been the target of homophobia.Lots of people like to pretend this isn\u2019t true. Bad Things only happens to those vague strangers, the Other Kinds, and of course they just get what\u2019s coming to them because they \u201casked for it\u201d by being queer.  You know, just like women who were raped were just asking for it because they were dressed too provocatively, or because they were invading male territories at workplaces and so on.  Or because a woman wasn\u2019t dressed feminine enough, she must be a dyke and therefore she was just asking for homophobic violence and/or rape \u2026 UGH. (agitated flapping moment here)But in another cruel twist of fate (this is off-stage, as real life is often far crueler and stranger than theatre), one does have to be disabled before they can be discriminated against as a disabled person.  Well, at least as far as the U.S. courts are concerned.Not only that, but you had to be really disabled.  Not just disabled, but Disabled-with-a-capital-D.  If you have something that\u2019s well-controlled by medication like epilepsy or migraines, or if you have something that makes like difficult (like dyslexia or autism) but you more-or-less kinda scrape by, or if you have something like a prosthetic arm or some other visible physical disability that you\u2019ve learned to work around, those don\u2019t count.You\u2019re not Disabled unless it\u2019s a serious, everyday problem.  Nevermind that millions of people out there learn how to adjust, cope, and otherwise deal with the things they need to do in life*.  When the original ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990) was drafted, Congress used the definition of disability that reflected severe, uncompensated, unaccommodated impairment, \u201ca physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity\u201d. So therefore, if you\u2019re not really Disabled, then you\u2019re not really being discriminated against in job applications, or employee reviews, or by your coworkers, or at school, or when you\u2019re trying to get an apartment or a house, or buy a car, or just go get some damn groceries or eat at the freaking local pizza parlour.  Because shockingly, given the opportunity, disabled people go out and do ordinary things like get jobs to earn incomes to pay the rent and buy groceries and dinner.This presents some \u201cCatch-22\u201d issues, because if your disability \u201csubstantially limits a major life activity\u201d then that major life activity might be working, which raises some concerns about whether a company is discriminating against you if they choose to not hire or promote you because of your disability. You could be  considered \u201ctoo disabled\u201d to do the job, but \u201cnot disabled enough\u201d (dare I say, \u201ctoo high-functioning\u201d?) to qualify under the ADA.  Of course, in the rational world, disabled people apply for jobs that they can do, given sensible accommodations. (Gimme a \u201cDuh!\u201d)So do \u201cnormal\u201d people.  Normal people apply for jobs that they can do, given sensible accommodations. Only their accommodations are also \u201cnormal\u201d, so they aren\u2019t seen as being such.  Because you know, normal people need to see what they\u2019re doing, so they need to have lighting made available to them everywhere.  And normal people need caffeinated beverages to help them compensate for their hypoactivity, so they\u2019re supplied with coffee and tea and colas at work. And normal people are extroverts who need structured social activities to fill their free time, because they don\u2019t become self-absorbed in their special interests. You get the point.So despite the original intentions of the ADA, one of the things that ended up happening as things wound through the court systems, was that first people had to \u201cprove\u201d they were sufficiently disabled to be covered, as well as proving that they had been discriminated against.  Meanwhile, the ADA office became immediately backlogged with situations to deal with, a lot of nonsense about \u201chorribly costly accommodations\u201d was flung about in the press and in courtrooms, and a distressing number of businesses went about business-as-inaccessibly-normal until they were forced to do otherwise.  In review, the problematic areas turned into spectacular examples of bureaucracy over common sense and compassion.  Plus, it\u2019s the people who have disabilities, those differences in mind and/or body that need to be accommodated, who are left having to prove that they need accommodation and that they were discriminated against.  Which all creates just so much more extra work in lives that are frequently full of more difficult or roundabout tasks already.What a mess.So, 17 years later, we now have rumbling through the House and Senate, the ADA Restoration Act of 2007.  In surprisingly clear language, some of the reasons for the bill are described as:\u2026\n(5) the broad conception of the definition had been underscored by the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in its decision in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 284 (1987), that the section 504 definition `acknowledged that society\u2019s accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as handicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment\u2019; (6) in adopting the section 504 concept of disability in the ADA, Congress understood that adverse action based on a person\u2019s physical or mental impairment is often unrelated to the limitations caused by the impairment itself; (7) instead of following congressional expectations that disability would be interpreted broadly in the ADA, the Supreme Court has ruled, in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 197 (2002), that the elements of the definition \u2018need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled,\u2019 and, consistent with that view, has narrowed the application of the definition in various ways; and\n\u2026The definition of disability also gets changed:   (A) IN GENERAL- The term \u2018disability\u2019 means, with respect to an individual\u2013\n(i) a physical or mental impairment;\n(ii) a record of a physical or mental impairment; or\n(iii) being regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.\n(B) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION-\n(i) The determination of whether an individual has a physical or mental impairment shall be made without considering the impact of any mitigating measures the individual may or may not be using or whether or not any manifestations of an impairment are episodic, in remission, or latent.\n(ii) The term \u2018mitigating measures\u2019 means any treatment, medication, device, or other measure used to eliminate, mitigate, or compensate for the effect of an impairment, and includes prescription and other medications, personal aids and devices (including assistive technology devices and services), reasonable accommodations, or auxiliary aids and services.\n(iii) Actions taken by a covered entity with respect to an individual because of that individual\u2019s use of a mitigating measure or because of a side effect or other consequence of the use of such a measure shall be considered actions taken on the basis of a disability under this Act.\u2019.Note that a person won\u2019t have to prove that the impairment is severe.  It\u2019s still a disability even if you can compensate for it most of the time.  (Because as we all know \u2014 the reason why we have to compensate for things because they would be or are disabling in some way or another.) Nor does a person actually have be necessarily disabled, just \u201cregarded\u201d as such.  Because let\u2019s face it; discrimination is neither rational nor sensible \u2014 people are discriminated against for totally spurious reasons.  (\u201cI\u2019m not hiring him \u2014 he just looks like some kind of re-tard weirdo.\u201d)We might call this Act \u201cmitigating measures\u201d for the severe impairments in justice left unaddressed by the ADA. Let\u2019s hope it works.(Hat-tip to andreashettle at ReunifyGally for alerting me to this topic!)* This is why disability \u201csimulations\u201d are lousy teaching tools \u2014 the people who actually have these impairments generally know how to deal with them, unlike the people stumbling around blindfolded or whatever, who only learn to experience temporary disability as freakish, and are both relieved and full of pity when the exercise is over.", "outgoing_links": ["http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.3195:", "http://reunifygally.wordpress.com/2007/08/21/blogging-on-the-ada-restoration-act-of-2007/"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/23/mitigating-measures/", "title": "Mitigating measures"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t25 August 2007", "body": "This sucks.  It\u2019s one of those problems that has gone from intermittent to nearly-constant. There\u2019s really nothing to be done about it.  I ask my doctor every few years, just in case.  But no, there is no cure.  There\u2019s not even much to do about tinnitus.  When at home or in the car, I mask it by playing music.  At school, our students are generally noisy enough to drown it out.My tinnitus is usually a high-pitched squeal, about 14-17 kHz, like a mosquito that whines for long periods, seemingly next to my left ear. The whine gets louder or softer, but rarely goes away. When it does, it returns with a sudden *pop*, as though someone turned on a radio. Once in a great while it\u2019s stereophonic buzzing static in both ears, or even a fluttering sensation like a butterfly stuck on my left ear, but those are pretty rare. I know that I\u2019m not just hearing actual machinery because I\u2019ve heard it when standing surrounded by hectares of prairie, without a single operating machine in sight or earshot.The good news is that I have no reduction in my general hearing. The problem did make itself known after I\u2019d been working in noisy labs for several months.  Well, I thought they were noisy labs.  One had 15 computer CPUs set atop the tables, the poster-size printer, and the ranks of fluorescent lights.  The other where I spent even more time had a wind tunnel, HID (High-Intensity Discharge) & fluorescent lights, three computers, steam-heat radiators, and a couple of incubators.The others working in the latter lab didn\u2019t think it was loud, but after a couple years of sharing the space I learned that none of the three could hear all of the high frequencies that I could; one guy outright said he had some hearing loss at high tones.  The others asserted they could hear fine because they had passed hearing exams.  However, the average hearing exam only tests in the 250 \u2013 8,000 Hz (8 kHz) range, which are of interest to audiologists because those are the tones for human speech.  Because human hearing should go up to 20 kHz, a person can pass a hearing exam and yet still not have full range of hearing.  Even so, one has to be around noises that are 80 dB or louder to sustain hearing damage, the labs weren\u2019t that noisy, and I don\u2019t have hearing loss.My world just sounds like I\u2019m always around noisy machinery of some sort, as though my head\u2019s parked next to an aging hard drive.   (Insert polysyllabic expletive of choice here.)The down side is that sometimes the extra \u201cbackground noise\u201d aggravates my comprehension of what people are saying, in addition to the auditory processing issues.  I wear a bite-block at night, which is great for preventing TMJ headaches, but sadly does nothing one way or t\u2019other about the tinnitus.  Because of the migraines and such, my head\u2019s been CT-scanned and MRI\u2019d a couple of times, and the radiologists say it looks normal.  (Presumably on the gross physical level, howsoever my brain actually operates.)  No one really knows what causes the problem.Tinnitus is hard to describe to people who are not familiar with the condition.  \u201cI hear things that aren\u2019t there,\u201d only earns one suspicious sideways glances.  The other week I finally came up with an analogy that adequately described the obnoxious qualities, if not the actual tone:\u201cIt\u2019s like having private reception to the cicada-radio channel:\n All cicadas, all the time!\u201dMostly what one can do about tinnitus is to simply accept that it\u2019s there, that it\u2019s probably gonna stay being there.  In addition to masking the imaginary noise with more pleasant, real noise, the best one can do is to re-frame one\u2019s attitude. I mean, you gotta find a way of becoming habituated and dealing with it. Otherwise it\u2019s annoying as hell, and could drive you nutz or make you depressed.I\u2019ve a mythical beastie\nWhat lives by my ear,\nA cicada-mosquito.\nYou can\u2019t hear it, so have no fear.\nBut the hell of tinnitus is,\nI just can\u2019t get rid\nOf this noisy chimera,\nSo I\u2019ve named my companion, Syd.(Tinnitus not only isn\u2019t glamorous, it also makes for mediocre poetry.)", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/25/syd/", "title": "Syd"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t24 August 2007 ", "body": "In your place of business, educational institution, or public service area, you will have to make certain accommodations for the \u201cnormal\u201d (\u201cTemporarily Able-Bodied\u201d) patrons.  (Please note that within Normal culture, it is considered appropriate to refer to them as \u201cnormal people\u201d rather than as \u201cpeople with normality\u201d.) Normal people will usually succeed in schooling, and will apply for jobs that they can do, presuming that they are given accommodations. These needs are diverse, and such accommodations include, but are not limited to, the following items:Normal people don\u2019t go around in wheelchairs, so they need to have chairs made available for them everywhere.*Normal people need to see what they\u2019re doing, so they need to have lighting made available to them everywhere.  This includes locations with very limited routes and signage, such as stairwells. It also includes bedrooms, even though most of the time spent there is when the person is asleep.Normal people need caffeine to help them compensate for their hypoactivity, so they should be supplied with coffee, tea, cola or other culturally-equivalent beverages at work. Likewise, normal people have a low need or tolerance level for fidgeting or pacing.  This is typical, and although some interest in doing such may be observed, their ability to sustain such for extended lengths of time is impaired.Normal people associate loud noise with having fun, and will desire background music in a variety of places, such as waiting rooms, social areas, work stations, and eating areas, even though the background music interferes with verbal forms of communication.  Most normal people do not sign, so their speaking volume will also increase the ambient noise levels.  Although mainstreaming of normal people is considered to be good educational practice, their noise levels can aggravate those with hyperacussis or migraines, so your normal students may need special resource rooms where they can participate in adaptive mealtime programmes.Normal people are likely to engage in such stereotypies as long bouts of eye contact, and chit-chatting about famous people or nothing much in particular. Their communication gestures are often not true signs or signifiers, but rather false tics that are socially learned responses, and are considered by some researchers to be a form of \u201csocial stimming\u201d. These activities are harmless, although they may need to be reminded not to disturb others, especially in work environments.Secondary and tertiary normal students have unusual deficits of ability to monologue about topics in extended detail, and will need supplementary tutoring and practice to reach adequate achievement levels.Normal people are extroverts who need structured social activities to fill their free time, because they don\u2019t become self-absorbed in their special interests.  They will also associate \u201cbeing alone\u201d with \u201cbeing lonely\u201d, and given a living or working space with six rooms, all six normal people will frequently be found clustered together in the same room.Normal people have a readily-recognised phenotype, and are remarkably consistent in their features and physical makeup (e.g. overall bilateral symmetry, regular walking gait).  Due to their pronounced socialisation needs, they will exhibit strong tendencies for  \u201cfollowing fads\u201d and \u201cteam identification\u201d, and will often be seen wearing clothing of great uniformity.  Despite this, they frequently have savant skills for facial recognition (\u201chyperprosopony\u201d), and will be able to identify and name literally hundreds of their peers.Note that this special population not only has special needs that must be accommodated, but they are also a vociferous and sometimes petulant lot if those special needs are not met. Your legal adviser or Human Resources co\u00f6rdinator can consult with you about compliance issues and the ADA, DDA, or other local laws concerning accessibility and discrimination.(This is a spin-off from another post, \u201cMitigating measures\u201d.)\n* I owe a big Thanks to Amanda for inspiration with her great post, \u201cThe staggering costs of the chair- and dark-impaired.\u201d~#~For more fun, check out this video, \u201cGoodbye to the Normals\u201d.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t30 August 2007", "body": "Earlier this week I had to sit still in one place and pay attention for a longer period of time than I\u2019ve had to do in ages.  Man, I\u2019d forgotten how utterly difficult that is to do!  I had to not just sit, but \u201csit appropriately\u201d on a hard wooden pew, and stay seated for three hours solid, and also pay attention to what a bunch of people were saying. I was part of a panel of jurors that had been randomly selected to go through voir dire for jury selection. Of the 24 people who showed up, 8 were finally selected to be the jury.  However, all of the extra panel members (including myself) had to pay attention to all the voir dire questions to have our own answers ready in case any of us were to replace a dropped juror.Sitting there all that time made me aware of how frequently I had little shoulder or head tics.  And how much I wished I had a \u201cfidget widget\u201d to have something to do with my hands.  And how much I jiggled my foot, and repositioned myself. And how much I wanted to sit there and rock from side to side, but feel inhibited to do so in public (even though I probably do rock a bit when I\u2019m not aware).There were some expected bad parts and unexpected good parts to the experience. The bad part was that I had allowed myself an extra half hour to find my way around an unfamiliar part of town, which was direly important as there was the inevitable \u201cnot realising that was my highway exit / street turnoff until I\u2019d just passed it\u201d issues (did that about thrice), which was of course complicated by the inevitable road-construction detours and one-way streets and detours through one-way streets, and roads that abruptly angled to go across the river to the wrong city instead of continuing one block more to where I needed to be. All the meanwhile, I was able to see the building where I needed to end up, but not being able to get there!  And then after finding the federal court house, I had to find the parking lot allowed for jurors.One good part of all that circuitiousness was getting to see some really cool bridges that I want to photograph, especially as my peradventures took me through industrial side streets and underpasses that gave me glimpses to sections of bridges and highway infrastructure that the average highway traveller doesn\u2019t get to see.  (No, I wasn\u2019t lost \u2014 I knew where I was, I was just having trouble getting from here to there.) The other good part was that through the introductory session for the jury panel, we got to see a general video about what it was like to serve on a jury, and the video was closed-captioned!  Also, I noted that the jurors that are selected sit on chairs (rather than pews), so if someone used a wheelchair, they could sit with the other jurors.But like any other kind of process involving governmental agencies, there was the required hurry-up-and-wait time.  So I contemplated the whole issue of Paying Attention, including how we AD/HD people manage to pay attention, and how it often doesn\u2019t seem to others that we are.  The latter isn\u2019t such a big deal when you\u2019re sitting in a courtroom and aren\u2019t the focus of the court\u2019s attentions, but somehow it ends up becoming a big deal when you\u2019re a student in a classroom.Firstly, sometimes the way that AD/HD people take in information (and tuck it away in memory) is different from what other people are expecting.  We look like we\u2019re not paying attention because we\u2019re doodling or coloring or staring out the window.  But rather, what seems to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d is rather a means of focusing the attention.For example, a person\u2019s doodling, which are visual & kinesthetic activities, keep those channels safely \u201coccupied\u201d, thus allowing the auditory attention to be better focused to the lecture.Another example is listening to music (perhaps set to repeat) while doing reading or studying \u2014 the musics serves as a background input to remove auditory distractions; it sort of \u201cspackles in\u201d irregular sound inputs so the visual read/write inputs can be better focused.Kinesthetic learners are famous for being perceived as \u201cnot paying attention\u201d because the kid is bouncing a ball or fidgeting with a toy or rocking or pacing or any number of things. They appear totally distracted and uninvolved with the subject of instruction, when actually the activity level is required for the material to get filed away. It\u2019s just that the activity does not seem to be directed toward or related to the lesson being taught.Secondly, how one person (the teacher, aide, parent, social worker etc) perceives another person\u2019s ability to \u201cpay attention\u201d depends greatly upon how the first person defines \u201cpay attention\u201d. If for instance, \u201cpay attention\u201d is defined as \u201cmake eye contact\u201d or \u201crespond verbally with phrases about the subject of teaching\u201d or \u201crespond with activity responses about the subject of teaching\u201d (and these are all very common indicators of \u201cpaying attention\u201d), and the second person does not do these particular things, then the second person is perceived as \u201cnot paying attention\u201d.Actually, the person may indeed be \u201cpaying attention\u201d. We have all experienced adults chatting with each other about grown-up stuff, and children playing elsewhere, and the adults think the children are not paying attention at all, but in fact the children are (despite appearing totally absorbed in their play), and then the adults are shocked at some point to find out that the children had indeed heard the discussion and even understood great amounts of it and can recall it much later on.Today a student waved a hand at me (in jest) during lunch, as I was \u201cstaring off into space\u201d.  Actually I wasn\u2019t, I was watching what people were doing, both directly in front of me and peripherally, but my watching wasn\u2019t animated in the way people expect.  I wasn\u2019t perceived as \u201cpaying attention\u201d even though I was.  My foci were on listening and watching, and that\u2019s where my energy was concentrated.Meanwhile, I need to find something to occupy my hands with during long attentive sitting sessions, like meetings.  Maybe I\u2019ll try again to learn to knit, or will pull out some old quilt-piecing projects \u2026", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/08/30/attendance-required/", "title": "Attendance Required"},

In a similar way, cartoons condense a slice of life into just a few panels.  All of these cartoons are about navigating our way through the day.I meant to do another episode much sooner (back in June) but then Stuff Happened. The summer was full of tutoring chemistry, and microbiology.  We squeezed in some vacation, and then just hours after our return, wham! school started up again.\u00a0 Here are\u00a0 four fun cartoons:Peanuts is by the late Charles Schultz(Description:  In the first panel, Charlie Brown is seated on a cushion in front of the television.  His sister Sally is standing next to him, arms spread wide as she says, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be watching TV!  You should be reading \u2018Gulliver\u2019s Travels\u2019. In the second panel, Charlie Brown is sprawled on the cushion, head in hands and he replies glumly, \u201cEven my little sister bugs me\u201d. In the third panel, he\u2019s walking away from he and explains, \u201cSchool-time doesn\u2019t \u2018roll around\u2019\u2026\u201d  In the last panel we see him standing alone as he adds, \u201cIt leaps right out at you!\u201d) XKCD is the wicked-good \u201cwebcomic of romance, sarcasm, math and language\u201d by Randall Munroe(Description: In the first panel, two androgynous stick-figures are walking down a hallway evenly patterned in light and dark floor tiles. The first figure asks the second, \u201cWhy are you walking funny?\u201d  The second figure has a giant thought bubble that is the second panel, where [he] imagines standing with a pointer aimed on a large chart with a checkered graphic labelled, \u201cfloor\u201d, and tells the first figure, \u201cWell, my instinct is to step only on black tiles, but they\u2019re too far apart.  So I\u2019m letting myself walk on the tiles directly in line with the black ones, but that means that when we walk diagonally, I have to step in a pattern where \u2026\u201d But in the last panel, the second figure simply answers the first, \u201cI\u2019m not walking funny.\u201d)This one made me think of Bev over at Asperger Square 8, and her fascination for floor tiles. Not that I don\u2019t do these mental games with floor tiles as well \u2026 I think this one is actually a v.5.0 of the children\u2019s game, \u201cThe Floor Is Lava\u201d (which amazingly, nearly every child re-invents).  Light and dark checky floor tiles give me the impulse to walk in Knight-move steps down the hall.  Method to the madness, as ever.Red & Rover is by Brian Basset (Description: A boy is on a swing, nearly upside-down, and he says to his dog, \u201cWhen the world seems all topsy-turvy \u2026\u201d Second panel the boy is seating still on the swing, adding, \u201c\u2026 I come to the playground.\u201d In the third panel, the boy is straddling the swing seat on his stomach and twisting up the chains, explaining, \u201cThe playground is my special place.\u201d In the last panel, the boy has let go of the ground, and is spinning on the swing as the chains untwist, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s where I go to unwind.\u201d)The swings on the playground got me through my first five years of school.  Not only was the repetitive motion soothing, but also it was perfectly acceptable to not be playing with anyone else.  It\u2019s a real shame they don\u2019t have swings in secondary school!  As an adult, it\u2019s very difficult to find swings that will accommodate longer legs.  We did find one swingset in a Boulder, Colorado city park that had a very high crossbar and higher-hung seats.  Utter joy!And of course, one of my all-time favourite comic strips,Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson(Description:  A grubby little boy, Calvin, is standing in front of a full bubble bath, stripped down to his briefs.  He\u2019s pointing out his feet to his tiger, Hobbes, saying, \u201cWow, look at the grass stains on my skin.\u201d  In the second panel, Calvin stands there with his arms confidently crossed, and asserts to Hobbes, \u201cI say, if your knees aren\u2019t green by the end of the day, you ought to seriously re-examine your life.\u201dThat may be one of the reasons why I like to garden and to nature photography.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t31 August 2007", "body": "\u201cThe smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum \u2013 even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there\u2019s free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.\u201d\n~Noam ChomskyEvery now and then I run into a word that sounds like a good thing.  \u201cTolerance\u201d is one such word, which I\u2019ve blogged on before. Surprisingly, consensus can be another.  Mind you, it\u2019s not always, just sometimes. Groups of people try to reach consensus so they can agree upon a plan for accomplishing something without anyone being left out of important decision-making, or without missing good ideas to be gleaned from a variety of viewpoints.But \u201cconsensus-building\u201d exercises can sometimes have the terrible effect of watering everything down to the lowest common denominator, and eliminating novel ideas in favor of mediocrity. Other times they just result in the dread \u2018paralysis by analysis\u2019.   In worst-case scenarios, they can \u201crailroad\u201d decisions through an unsuspecting group, leaving individuals feeling slightly queasy and dissatisfied at the results, but not understanding why that would be because they seemed to have reached that consensus from a lot of thoughtful group effort.I\u2019ve sat through a lot of meetings in my life.  Usually they begin with lots of carbohydrates & caffeine, useful additions to the social grooming-behaviour necessary to boost bonhomie and settle the humans down to co\u00f6perative activity. After the pleasantries, we start off with a positive programme goal, the sort of thing that everybody can agree upon. That\u2019s cool.  We now begin with shared vision and collective purpose.Then at one meeting I felt like everything went sideways and inside-out, a sort of seminar-vertigo.  Worse, no one else seemed to be experiencing it. They were all still busily passing bagels and filling coffee cups, sorting out their notepads and handouts, and wrapping up reminders and chit-chat with each other, with nominal attention given to the unfolding of the broadly-stated agenda. Something made my brain itch, but looking around at others, I didn\u2019t see any signs of confusion.  Quite possibly I was missing some nonverbal cues, or maybe I was just having auditory processing blips, owing to all the background noises of the hubbub.Then the facilitator introduced to the conversation the model solution they were pushing for our programme\u2019s problem.  Only instead of bringing up discussion about whether or not this could be an appropriate solution, or when it might be an appropriate solution, or how it might be tweaked or integrated with other appropriate solutions, it was simply introduced fait accompli  as The Solution.Just when I was trying to formulate some enquiry about whether or not I had missed something, everyone dived into exploring the topic, and I mentally lurched forwards as I tried to follow the rapid explanations of how the solution worked, and what things it addressed. Of course, there were differences of opinion, and the facilitator encouraged people to express potential difficulties, and explore ways that they could use the solution would deal with those. People\u2019s brains were buzzing with wonderful blends of practicality and imagination, with compassion and a tinge of that gallows-humour that enables staff to deal with ongoing stresses. But even those discussions still defaulted to remaining within the parameters of the designated solution.It wasn\u2019t until later when I could dissect the events, that I realised where my mental speed-bumps lay.  In order to give the attendees the impression that we\u2019d had some thoughtful input and democratic say in the decision making, we were asked to come up with reasons for how and why the new method would be the right way of solving the problem. This was, I realised later, quite clever.  By having the attendees come up with the rationales for why the solution should be adopted, the facilitator didn\u2019t have to sell the idea \u2014 we had sold it to ourselves and to each other.  (This consensus-building scenario is not the same thing as the Delphi Technique, which is yet another way of achieving predetermined results through manipulative crowd control.)Another reason that I found the situation uncomfortable was how much of it relied upon people \u201cfeeling good\u201d about the idea, rather than assessing it critically for goodness of fit.  Part of how the idea had been introduced involved describing how we were trying to help our struggling students (clients).  It was meant to introduce examples to illustrate the idea, but it also served to spread ego-boo across the crowd, as thick as the cream cheese that was getting spread across the bagels.The problem with tying together the professional good will of the staff members with that ego-stroking was that it effectively squashed dissent about the idea itself. Differing opinions would be dismissed because they didn\u2019t promote \u201cconsensus\u201d and \u201cunity\u201d.  Blatantly expressing doubts about the idea based upon one\u2019s own knowledge and positive self-image would threaten to stir up the self-effacing cooing of the group.  And of course, one can\u2019t reason people out of a position that they did not arrive at from reasoning \u2014 we had not chosen the idea by weighing its uses objectively, but by being told that we were good-hearted people with the Right Stuff to help others.Another issue we ran into with that particular meeting was that it was highly focused upon making decisions, and helping others make appropriate decisions*. But \u201cmaking decisions\u201d is not necessarily the same thing as \u201cproblem solving\u201d.  Problem solving requires analysis, and figuring out what\u2019s going on, and what needs changing. Good problem solving has a lot of proactivity, whereas poor decision making has a lot of reactivity. Too often people focus on surface issues, rather than on the underlying problems; such as focusing on the deciding how they are going to react to behavioural effects, rather than figuring out how to identify and resolve the behavioural causes.The meeting had also entirely skipped the whole analysis of what the real problem might be, which isn\u2019t always the same thing as the effects of the problem that are immediately visible. Another big chunk that was missing was how to include our clients/students into the analysis and solution-creating process. One should always elicit  people\u2019s preferences and help them explore various options, so that everyone can have the highest practical level of independence within the support situations we use to work together.I use the word \u201csupport\u201d in several ways.  Usually one associates support with what staff does for or with clients (or students).  But support is also what staff does with each other, and what managers do for staff. (I also have this crazy idea that managers are there to help co\u00f6rdinate things between different departments so the staff can do their jobs.  This has caused some underlying friction between me and managers who feel that the staff are there to serve the manager\u2019s needs.)Support is also (surprisingly) what clients do for staff, because without them, the staff would have no reason to even be there doing these things!  Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 clients are not there for the convenience of the staff; the staff are there to serve the clients. To support their staff, the clients need to be empowered to make decisions about how they can best be aided, so the staff can focus on actually doing useful work, rather than bureaucratic busy-work that nobody wants and nobody needs. (Everybody wants to feel that their work is useful!  We get really grumpy and asocial when we feel like our jobs don\u2019t mean anything.)Support and independence are obverse and reverse of the same coin; you can\u2019t have one without the other. It\u2019s not an all-or-nothing affair, as some other people would describe, where either one is either \u201ccompletely\u201d independent, or else has all their decisions made for them. Every person needs various levels of support, and we all need respect for our preferences and individual needs.  Empowerment is not doing things for people, but about giving or teaching people the things they need so they can choose for themselves and help themselves.As I said, groups of people try to reach consensus so they can agree upon a plan for accomplishing something without anyone being left out of important decision-making, or without missing good ideas to be gleaned from a variety of viewpoints.  Although we usually have some goals in mind before we start discussions, that doesn\u2019t mean that we cannot refine or change those goals, and it certainly doesn\u2019t mean that trying to reach a consensus is nothing more than having people rubber-stamp previously decided ideas.* Unfortunately, many people labour earnestly under the mis-impression that one merely needs to point out the error of someone\u2019s thinking, and that the sheer obviousness and merit of the \u201ccorrect\u201d information will persuade people to change their minds and also their approaches.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t12 May 2007 ", "body": "Some of our students with behavioural issues are masters of agitating peers, being defiant, and avoiding work.  They have a wide and well-practiced arsenal of tactics for weaseling out of responsibility:   the Nomothetic Fallacy, denial, distraction, \u201cforgetting\u201d, dismissal of the importance of what they did, wanting a \u201cfresh start\u201d, trivializing events or redefining the significance of their actions, hollow apologies, feigning victimhood, or personal attacks.Three different events (all with the same student) provide a number of examples.  What\u2019s notable here are several things.  Firstly, the amount of denial-of-responsibility going on.  Secondly, the argumentative quality and argumentative quantity (a form of work-avoidance).   Lastly, the frequency of switching from one tactic to the next as I (or another staff member) ignore the baits and keep the conversation focused on what really happened and his responsibility.I follow up on a student in his next classroom, in pursuit of a calculator. For some reason, he\u2019d spent the last quarter-hour playing with the calculator, to the exclusion of doing actual assignment work.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have it; I left it in the room,\u201d he asserts.\nI press on, \u201cI didn\u2019t see the calculator there.  Where did you put it?\u201d\nMore denial, as he answers, \u201cOn my desk, with the math book.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to put your materials away when you\u2019re done with them.  The calculator is not in the tray or on your desk.  You need to give it back.\u201d\nA teacher joins me, \u201cWell where did you put it, then?  Is it in your pockets?\u201d\nAfter a few more rounds of this, the student checks his pockets and (amazingly!) pulls out the calculator.  Oh my, he forgot he put it in his pocket!  No wait, he didn\u2019t mean to put it in his pocket \u2013 rather, he was just borrowing it!  Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s just a cheap calculator anyway.  Blah, blah, blah.  He shifts effortlessly from denial to excuses to trivialization.\n\u201cOh well,\u201d he asserts, \u201cyou have it back now, so we can just forget about all this,\u201d (the \u201cfresh start\u201d tactic).\nNo, we can\u2019t.  It\u2019s still stealing and lying, and he is still responsible for his actions.\u201cI\u2019m sorry the ball hit you.\u201d\nDespite the words, this isn\u2019t really a true apology; it\u2019s just pro forma.  The student is apologising on behalf of the ball. But the ball did not rise of its own accord and hit me; rather, he hit me with the ball. There\u2019s even an undercurrent that the actual target of the ball may have been someone else.  Here the student is denying responsibility by claiming the event was unintentional. In truth, the student threw the ball in an entirely wrong direction, towards the people who were clustered together by a wall, instead of toward the rest of the otherwise-empty gymnasium.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gym class; everyone gets hit by balls,\u201d he protests, trying to redefine what issue is.\n\u201cNo, you had been told twice before to throw or kick the ball in another direction away from people.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s just my defiance,\u201d the student explains cheerful tone of voice, with a grin that is really more of a baring-of-teeth grimace.  The happy tone and \u201csmile\u201d belie the emotion; this cheerless grin involves the mouth but not the eyes, and the message behind the words is about denial rather than sharing peaceful or positive things.  This form of denial mingles with the Nomothetic Fallacy, where a person believes that naming the problem is equivalent to solving it.  Merely being aware of and naming the problem doesn\u2019t solve any of the causative factors.\nI sigh.  \u201cNaming the problem doesn\u2019t absolve you of responsibility.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018absolve\u2019?\u201d he asks.\nMy bad; I tend to assume that high school students have high-school level vocabulary.  \u201cIt means that you\u2019re still responsible for what you did.\u201d\n\u201cHow come you use so many big words no one\u2019s heard of?\u201d  He doesn\u2019t really care; he\u2019s just trying to sidetrack me with questions.\n\u201cNo, the issue here is about what you did.\u201d\u201cYou give me no joy,\u201d comes his complaint, as I bring him his unfinished third-hour assignment to complete during eighth hour.  This earns nothing more than a raised eyebrow from me.  After all, fun is something you make, not something that happens to you.\nI stick with the facts of the situation, \u201cYou\u2019re graded on how much work you complete, not how much time you sit in the classroom, or how long it takes you.\u201d\nNow he\u2019s trying the victim gambit, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you guys give me so much work.  This is too confusing.  No one ever explains it.\u201d\n\u201cTwo different staff members explained how to do this.  You have done four problems already, and you did them correctly.  The others are done the same way.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this; I\u2019m too tired.  Besides, you brought the wrong calculator \u2013 you know I like the blue one.\u201d\nI\u2019m not even going there; the calculator he\u2019s holding has equally large buttons.  \u201cYou need to open up your textbook and get started.\u201d\nHe switches tactics, criticising my qualifications with contradictory statements, \u201cIf you have college degrees, then how come you\u2019re just a para?  You can\u2019t even teach me how to do this stuff.\u201d\n\u201cThe student is responsible for their part of the learning.  If you don\u2019t have this down yet, then you need more practice.\u201dThese are the sorts of students that I find the most fatiguing to deal with.  After three semesters I have become much more adept at spotting these tactics and dealing with them.  Fortunately the students switch rooms every 45 minutes, which helps the staff from getting excessively worn down by any one student.When you\u2019re faced with such situations, here are some measures you can take:\nDon\u2019t get distracted by arguments about what the rules are, who sets them, the importance of rules, or anyone\u2019s qualifications to enforce the rules.  Keep focused on what actually happened.\nDon\u2019t argue about anyone\u2019s \u201cintentions\u201d \u2013 intentions are covert (unseen).  Focus on what the individual did, and what they are responsible for.\nDon\u2019t get distracted with someone else\u2019s deeds, motivations or punishments.  Stick to the facts:  what this person said and did, and what the results were of those actions.\nDon\u2019t debate past events or possible events; stick to what the person needs to do now.  This last part, \u201cstick to what the person needs to do now\u201d is important, especially for those who avoid work by endlessly debating about definitions and loopholes and perceived injustices and what other people ought to do.\nThis cartoon is \u201cPearls Before Swine\u201d, (C) 2007 by Stephen Pastis, United Features Syndicate:(Description:  a three-panel cartoon with Pig and Rat standing by kitchen counters.In the first panel, Pig points to shards of a broken cup that are laying on the floor, and asks Rat, \u201cHey, Rat \u2026 did you break my coffee mug?\u201d and Rat (who is holding his own mug) replies, \u201cNo \u2026 I just bumped it with my elbow.\u201d  In the second panel is a close-up drawing of Rat, who is pointing to the countertop, and explains, \u201cWhile the force of my elbow did indeed move it from its position of rest and toward the edge of the counter, it was gravity that took over at that point and sucked it toward the surface of the earth.\u201d  In the last panel, Pig responds, \u201cSorry for blaming you.\u201d Rat turns to leave the scene (and the cup shards still laying on the floor), answering, \u201cNo problemo.\u201d)", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/05/12/denial-blah-blah-blah-denial/", "title": "Denial blah-blah-blah Denial"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 May 2007", "body": "The first time I tried to advocate for myself, it did not go as I\u2019d hoped.  I won\u2019t say that it was a complete failure, because the good news was that I still observed some important things.  The bad news was that gaining that data made me feel like I had even more problems than before I\u2019d started.And so it goes.  Or, went.Here\u2019s what happened.  I\u2019m nine, maybe just turned ten years old, and I\u2019m in my fourth year of primary school.  This would in a few months prove to be the beginning of a long scholastic slide downhill grade-wise, due to the fact that remembering to take home the homework, do the homework, and return the homework would prove to be a skill that was seemingly beyond my capabilities (for reasons no one could fathom; it was assumed that I was just being lazy or stupid, if not both). But that\u2019s later, because at the time of our story, I was still a bright girl with a large vocabulary and an avid interest in any subject but spelling.  So far so good.My teacher, a Miss VanHouse, had something known as the SRA reading lab to use instead of the usual primary readers.  This was a large box full of cards, organised into a multitude of different reading level categories, with each category assigned to a different colour.  The student would read the story on the card (fiction or nonfiction, usually several paragraphs long), and then answer the multiple-choice questions printed on the card along with the story.  After successfully completing a certain number of cards, the student then advanced to the next reading level.  Much as I loved learning new facts, the questions were beyond inane.I didn\u2019t mind doing the assignments.  My beef was that the teacher had put me into the middle reading level, when I could quite easily read at the top reading level.  Even providing her evidence of this by completing a couple of the top reading level cards to 100% accuracy didn\u2019t change my assignment.  I was still doomed to spend weeks and months slogging through card after card, answering all those multiple-choice questions, and doing work that was way below my ability.  I understood enough about teaching to know that students learn things by having work that\u2019s just a bit difficult, not by doing lots of work that\u2019s way too easy.  That rankled me.  She was the teacher; she should know that, too.  And she should have been willing to change my assignment given proof of my abilities.  Well, that\u2019s what I thought.Years later it occurred to me that she may have put me in the middle because she didn\u2019t know what else to do with me.  She couldn\u2019t have shown \u201cfavourtism\u201d by letting a student not work on the same assignment as the others.  I might have been a good reader, but I couldn\u2019t possibly be one of those special smart children.  Obviously I wasn\u2019t a profoundly gifted child, because [1] no one had identified me as such (everyone knows that genius children are good at everything) [2] I didn\u2019t have my multiplication tables memorised (ditto) [3] I was prone to interrupting with questions (everyone knows that genius children have perfect manners) and [4] I wouldn\u2019t have kept forgetting my assignments (ditto).   Well, I\u2019m not a genius.  Just a bright kid with specific difficulties.One of those specific difficulties was the whole advocacy issue.  The big hurdle in learning to advocate for myself was the utter lack of training in how to do so.  I was in fact, frequently discouraged from doing so.  It was drilled into me (by family, friends, teachers, and a great many Important People) that:\nsaying that I was good at doing something was considered being vain and boastful, and saying that I was bad at something was considered being honest  (these first two rules applied mainly to girls, at least in the part of the space-time continuum for my childhood)\nasking for things I needed was being needy\nasking for things that other people didn\u2019t get was being greedy\ndoing things for one\u2019s self was being selfish (as opposed to self-centered)\nThe message was that I should be grateful with what I had and accept that everyone else knew better than I did what I needed and wanted in life.  (Should you feel ill, O Gentle Reader, your air sickness bag is located in the pocket of the seat in front of you.)What I learned from my first foray into self-advocacy was that:\npeople are just not as rational as we would like them to be\npresenting people with \u201cfacts\u201d isn\u2019t enough to change their minds\npeople will judge you on a variety of factors, some of which are outright spurious and others of which aren\u2019t correct\nthere are frequently a number of factors preventing a person from making progress, and many of them are invisible\nthe world is full of foolish people\nmaking the foolish people angry doesn\u2019t get you anywhere\nbanging your head on the school desk doesn\u2019t stop the knots of frustration, and in fact damages your credibility.\nThe most difficult parts of self-advocacy are not, as many people suppose, the initial part of overcoming one\u2019s inertia, and fear of venturing into the unknown.  Any thoroughly-annoyed person can usually make that first step.  Rather, the difficult parts are discovering what sorts of hidden (bureaucratic) hurdles are in your way, what sorts of prejudices people have, and how to deal with people\u2019s emotional blocks to rational discussion.\u201cI can\u2019t stand this proliferation of paper work.  It\u2019s useless to fight the forms, you\u2019ve got to kill the people producing them.\u201d\n~Vladimir Kabaidze, General director of the Ivanovo Machine Building Works, Moscow, to the Communist Party Congress, 1985", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRA_reading_labs"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/05/03/first-foray/", "title": "First Foray"},

It got postponed after finishing audio-recording the last chapter of a textbook this morning before going to jobs #1 and #2, and after getting groceries, and after making dinner, and after unloading moving boxes, and after more-or-less-sitting and watching an episode of House with the family.  I\u2019m so lazy.)(photo description:  close-up shot of a fluffy, golden honeybee sitting calmly on a person\u2019s hand)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The honeybees are in danger.I don\u2019t care; I hate bugs!Too few people with disabilities complete their education or are fully employed.That\u2019s not my problem; I don\u2019t know any of Those People.Curiously, these two things are more related than you might imagine, at least on the social level.Honeybee populations are in serious decline.   Our very necessary livestock is in mortal peril.  The problem has been named \u201cColony Collapse Disorder\u201d but as you might expect from such a vague name, the actual \u00e6tiology is unknown.  Unlike other common health problems that can beset a hive, CCD results in an alarming absence of adults.   The adults, the workers that go out collecting nectar and pollen (and incidentally pollinating millions of hectares of flowers), are simply nowhere to be found.  In the hives there are capped brood developing, plenty of honey, very young adult workers (teenage girls in charge of nursery care, figuratively speaking)  and oddly, the queen can be found rambling around outside of the hive.  Even stranger, moths and other bees will not invade an afflicted hive to steal the wax or honey.A variety of anthropogenic environmental causes are suspected, which means that we may be inadvertently killing our own livestock.  Worse, killing them means risking killing other livelihoods.  Although many people \u201chate\u201d bees, our food supply is inextricably linked to the honeybees\u2019 work; they not only pollinate tree fruits, berries, squashes and melons, but also the alfalfa that is used by cattle.  Small and humble, fuzzy golden honeybees are vital to the food economies of most countries.But because of the fear, hatred and loathing of insects there are many people who would spray pesticides around their entire yards in the futile attempt to \u201ckill all the bugs\u201d.  In truth, only 1% of the million-plus species of insects are pests.  The rest are benign or beneficial.Such reactions of fear, hate and loathing are not directed solely at insects.  Humans react to other members of their species in much the same manner.  Throughout history, the disabled have been likewise mistreated, used as scapegoats, killed or sterilized in social programs, abused and/or murdered by family members or caretakers.It\u2019s easy to assert that such goings-on are from long ago or far away.   Unfortunately, this is not so.  When mistreatment is seen as normal or necessary and rational, the wrongness is not easily apparent, nor are the range or magnitude of the effects.  It seems perfectly reasonable to use insecticides at a large-scale rate to kill bugs, especially if you believe that all bugs are nasty, and all bees and wasps are \u201cout to get you\u201d and sting you.  It seems perfectly reasonable to assume that deformed or nonverbal or unsocial children can\u2019t be educated, and certainly won\u2019t become happy, adult members of society, much less with friends, families or jobs.  It seems perfectly reasonable to assume that hideously damaged accident victims or veterans can\u2019t become healed as fully-realised people if their wounds cannot be cured sufficiently to make them indistinguishable from their nondisabled peers.I do a lot of gardening.  I work around insects a lot, even when I wasn\u2019t doing research.  I\u2019ve been stung by a bee all of twice in my life:  once when I sat on one, and once when I stepped on one.  We both regretted it; both bees died.  That honeybee I photographed sitting on my hand did not sting me.  She wandered around, maybe licked up a little salt from my sweat, and then left to continue her Very Important Work of fetching pollen and nectar.Our ignorance doesn\u2019t just hurt ourselves from being a little less aware of things. Ignorance is an insidious evil, the sort that pretends to be not so bad, but in truth rots things out from the center. It\u2019s easy to pretend that you \u201cdon\u2019t know any of Those People\u201d because then the problem doesn\u2019t touch you personally. But it\u2019s just pretence. You would have to be a recluse to not know anyone with a disability.  More likely you aren\u2019t aware of the disabilities that people around you have, because so many are invisible.  Despite the blue parking signs, most disabilities do not involve wheelchairs.People with disabilities comprise 19% of the human population. That\u2019s a larger percentage than any ethnic group in the United Kingdom, or in Canada, or in the United States.  Other minority groups that experience such high levels of undereducation and underemployment are up in arms to rectify this. But people with disabilities are such a highly diverse group that efforts have been much slower to develop on the social action fronts, and efforts have also been traditionally very fragmented to within specific disability groups.  Given the stigma against disability, it\u2019s also been a category that people do not identify with.Being social animals, we must rely upon one another. And because the lives of humans and honeybees and all other organisms are woven most inextricably together, hurting one part of the ecosystem or hurting one part of social system creates long-term problems that are often not immediately apparent.  Discounting the social and educational needs of millions of people threatens our human colony in vast numbers of ways.  The problem is not that disabled people exist, but how disabled people are living.Or, not.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 May 2007 ", "body": "\u201cGreat truths are sometimes so enveloping and exist in such plain view as to be invisible.\u201d  ~Edward O. WilsonI went to study Entomology, and four years later found that I had discovered far more about my own species than I had about insects and other arthropods.  What I learned about humans was enlightening, and often very disquieting.  Frequently, if you can\u2019t see something, it\u2019s because it seems normal and appropriate.  Alienating and Othering so permeates the many facets of culture as to be invisible.Take for example writings about people, either individuals or groups.  These can be works of fiction, clinical accounts, self-help or parenting or therapy books, historical or sociological analyses, in fact, any sort of book whatsoever that refers to people with differences.  (I was going to say \u201cdifferences from the norm\u201d but we also find this in books about women, and surely half the population has to be considered a \u201cnorm\u201d from a sociological if not a statistical perspective.)Frequently such accounts use the omniscient writing perspective, which makes it very easy to do a heavy amount of Othering.  Even when the author is involved with the people described in the writing (be they fictional or real), the author is still not connected to them on an equal basis. It\u2019s a privileged point of view, where the author\u2019s reality is the only correct or possible one.  The author gets to define who and what the people are, the limits of their being, and how human they are.  This is allowed in fiction.  But when it happens in what are ostensibly works of non-fiction, the writer is assuming that his or her personal reality defines the greater world.Sometimes the writing is clinical and sympathetic in the pitying sense, but is not empathetic from being a part of those described. This leads to disassociation, where those who are different are part of the not-normal-Them, rather than the normal-Us.  This is in contrast to the us-like-this and us-like-that where all are on the same level of acceptance.  Much of this disassociation stems from pathologising; in some manner or another, everything the Other does is twisted and turned into an example of why they are Other, rather simply something they do as a human being.  There\u2019s a self-serving, circular logic to the whole definition:  these people are Other because they are deficient physically and/or mentally, and because they are deficient, they must be the Other.Sometimes the writing is condescending, where it interprets what the people have to say (once again, only the author\u2019s reality counts) rather than listening to what the people have to say.  It acts as a filter that must color everything through the author\u2019s own sensitivities, rather than letting others speak for themselves.Differences are exoticised, and are made lurid, or seen as extreme due to focusing upon them to the exclusion of other normal things, rather than seen as being everyday events and feelings. Any kind of life or condition in life could be described in a way and be viewable as grotesque and horrible.  For example, read a book on the life cycles of eusocial insects (bees, wasps, ants or termites), and witness how utterly alienating, horrifying and sensationalistic the writing turns, even when glossed in scientific terminology.  Nevermind that insects share genes with humans, and are simply going about addressing the problems of their daily lives:  getting food, farming, performing fix-it jobs around the home, taking care of the kids, sharing news of the world outside the apartment, and keeping neighbors from stealing things.  To nearly all authors, they are far too alien to be understood in any but the most detached way.  We might understand what they do, and generally why they do things, but they are far too different from us to possibly be able to relate to in a meaningful manner.  The same is sadly true for people writing about other people.  The author\u2019s lack of understanding, and the mental discomfort from such leads to disassociative writing.On the human end, even when dressed in pretty 21st-century euphemisms rather than 19th-century slurs, being in the freak show is still \u2026 being in the freak show.Part of what makes all this lurid is not just the disconnected, condescending attitude that makes one feel slimy for having merely read the material, but the whole deeply underlying sense of insecurity and fear that permeates the writing, and is part of the cause for all this disassociation.  Many readers feel icky or uncomfortable, anywhere from having an uncomfortable taste in the brain to being downright nauseated after reading this stuff, and then transfer their discomfort to the subjects of the writing (\u201cThe weirdos! It\u2019s the weirdos that made them feel that way!\u201d), rather than realizing that it is the disassociation created by the author, or their own internal discomforts derived from lack of understanding and thus the fear of the different and unknown.Icky writing separates people and actually creates further barriers:  these Others are so far from being human that we cannot really understand them, and don\u2019t want to even try because being able to put one\u2019s self into such a different frame of mind might very well cause us to \u201cgo native\u201d and endanger our status as Real People.  Anthropologists will point out that many self-identifying names for groups translate to something like The People, as in \u201cWe are People, and the others aren\u2019t Us (possibly aren\u2019t People as well)\u201d.Those of us who find ourselves on the \u201cwrong side of the tracks\u201d, in the realm of the Others, feel this revolting sense when reading such things because of the cognitive dissonance created.  We find ourselves initially \u201cwith\u201d the author, because that\u2019s what reading is about:  being temporarily in the mind of the author.  Then we find ourselves \u201cwith\u201d the subject(s) of their writing, but unlike the author, can identify with the subjects:  we are them and they are us.  It makes the brain hurty trying to be in the Us/Human and Not-Us/Not-Human realms simultaneously.  That\u2019s because we know that the Not-Us/Not-Human group really is, and that they really should be in the Us/Human group.  Furthermore, there shouldn\u2019t even be an un-human group, and such divisiveness is inhumane.In contrast, good writing connects people and allows them to realize their commonalities, and better understand their differences.But that kind of writing can be really hard to find.  Even in books with otherwise good points to be made, this paradigm is so pervasive (maybe it\u2019s a cultural PSD:  Pervasive Sociodevelopmental Disorder) that the authors, publishers and readership can\u2019t see it.Read a book description on the jacket or in a review, and see if the reviewer doesn\u2019t assume that the readership us part of the Us rather than the Other.  This is a symptom of being objectified, as in \u201cThey don\u2019t \u2026\u201d  What, they don\u2019t read?  They don\u2019t have feelings?  They wouldn\u2019t feel insulted at all these assumptions?  And most importantly, They aren\u2019t really Us?  The subject been marginalized.It\u2019s all the more disconcerting when the people who have been so Othered cannot find any other ways of relating to or describing their own experiences except within the confines of this tainted discourse, and pathologise their own lives in their writings.  Oft times they can\u2019t even see this effect to recognize how much it colors their own efforts, because they are so steeped in it.  Thus we can end up as what Jim Sinclair refers to as the \u201cself-narrating zoo exhibit\u201d: a de-personalised object that is obliged to talk about themselves without personal boundaries and without being an equal in the conversation.  Perhaps some of this comes from not having found any other way of authenticating one\u2019s personal experience, and that describing it must be done through this filter to \u201cprove\u201d to others that it is indeed, real.  This is a very sorry state of affairs where one is not of the Us, and furthermore, feels that they have to prove that they are even of the Other just in order to be someone at all.  The cruel twist is that following this very rationale is what prevents one from claiming their own identity and having to settle for a less-than-full personhood.The dissociation makes it hard to recognize when similarities happen.  When I was learning calculus and kept hearing how hard the concepts were, but yet found the concepts to be very simple, I kept thinking that I must either be missing something or was not understanding something, because I wasn\u2019t reacting to the subject like others were.  In the same light, when reading about the \u201cweird\u201d or \u201cbizarre\u201d things that autistics do \u201cfor no reason\u201d (read: cannot be understood), at first I couldn\u2019t recognize myself in that same light.  It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t do some of those same things (or used to do as a child), but that I couldn\u2019t see myself as being like the people who weren\u2019t understanding why someone would do those things.  Once again, I felt like I was not understanding something, and therefore wasn\u2019t \u201cwith\u201d the subject due to that sense of remove.That level of remove made those aspects stranger than they really were, because they were not understandable at the Insider\u2019s perspective of the Outsider.  The Other (by definition) does different things and for different reasons than we do.  Therefore, if the Other does something, and we also do something, it must be for different reasons.  Once we remove that artificial boundary of Otherness, we can then see that in fact, we all do these things, for much the same reasons, even if we don\u2019t all do these things in exactly the same ways, or as much of the time as one another.  (Everybody stims, but some of us do it more often, and flicking one\u2019s fingers is simply a less-common way of stimming than is fiddling around with one\u2019s jewelry.)This \u201cPervasive Sociodevelopmental Disorder\u201d (and I\u2019m speaking tongue-in-cheek here; we don\u2019t need a fancy DSM-like name for something that is so unfortunately so old and basic to the human condition) is an invisible disability within society.It\u2019s invisible because not only can people not see it when it\u2019s happening, but also because it\u2019s such a novel, alien concept that frequently it\u2019s hard to protest against because people don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re upset about, so first you have to be able to point it out and define it and convince them that it\u2019s even there before you can protest it and seek to change it.It\u2019s disabling because it prevents people from working together effectively.  Any protests against the state of affairs are easily dismissed because (once again), the Others are so because of their deficiencies, and because they have deficiencies, they must be Othered.  You can\u2019t take people seriously because they\u2019re crazy, which is why they are in treatment in some manner or another.  Likewise, you can\u2019t take adults seriously if they disagree because after all, they are children and their parents must know what\u2019s best for them.  If you do make a sensible point, then you can\u2019t really be one of the Others because they couldn\u2019t make sensible points.  If you\u2019re not one of them, you can\u2019t really speak for/about them, now can you?And yet \u2013I do.", "outgoing_links": ["http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/History_of_ANI.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/05/13/what-i-learned-from-the-bugs-alienation-and-othering/", "title": "What I Learned From the Bugs:  Alienation and\u00a0Othering"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t15 May 2007", "body": "A registry is a listing organizing information.  People create registries of all sorts of things, from animal pedigrees to copyrights and domain names.  We register for happy things, like our gift preferences with shops when getting married, or anticipating the birth or adoption of a child.Medically, people register to receive organ donations. Companies may register recipients of prostheses in case there needs to be follow-up care.  To prevent or manage epidemics, registries of affected individuals may be kept to monitor disease containment, treatments, and mortality.People also register pets to help ensure their return.  We also register things, generally for licensing and taxation purposes, as some of these can be dangerous items:Automobiles\nMotorcycles / Motorbikes\nAircraft\nBoats\nGuns\nTelevisions (dangerous item:  yes or no?)Many landmark events in our lives require moving datasets from one office to another.  College students make a number of trips to their uni\u2019s registrar to manage the appropriate transcript transfers.  College students with disabilities may choose to register with the uni\u2019s access office if they are to receive accommodations.  (Naturally, doing this requires even more paperwork.)  Part of getting one\u2019s diploma means that you are now a Papierkrieg veteran (German:  \u201cpaper war\u201d i.e. bureaucracy).Once graduated, people in some licensed occupations may be registered to help ensure that agencies can successfully maintain optimum staffing, and people will be able to secure jobs as needed.To receive various legally sanctioned benefits, people also register major personal events with various local or national government agencies, to acquire the necessary Very Important Pieces of Paper \u2014 after all, nothing officially exists without documentation!  All but the last two of these are events that people are generally glad to mark in their lives, aside from the bureaucratic hassles associated with such:Birth (someone else\u2019s)\nMarriage / Civil Union\nDivorce / Annullment\nTravel passport\nWork visa\nBusiness partnership\nMilitary service\nDeath (someone else\u2019s)Speaking of death, on the darker end of things, groups of humans have been registered for others to monitor who these people were, and where they were.  The rationales for these kinds of registration were that the categories of people were a concern to the authorities because of who or what they were.  They didn\u2019t have to be proven dangerous, they just might be because they were different.  In such cases, registration was not optional; if one didn\u2019t register themselves, they would be registered by any other authoritative body who knew their identity.  Even suspected persons had to be investigated to assess if they were a burden to the public safety.So what makes a category of humans?  That\u2019s really not a simple quantitative question.  It\u2019s interesting to note that for over half a century, evolutionary biologists have not classified human \u201craces\u201d as being genetically-discernable categories.  Certainly there\u2019s not sufficient difference if humans are described by qualities such as national background or religion \u2013 these are just social constructs.  Qualities such as skin tone or sexual orientation have been used to categorise people, but these labels are not as black or white (sorry) as some would have them.Or, blue.  People\u2019s skin color ranges from various qualities of pink or brown, but you know, someone who\u2019s blue is very different. Art imitated life in the X-Men comics, where mutants like Nightcrawler were also specially censused under the Mutant Registration Act.  Here the dialog about the balance of personal liberties against concerns for \u201cpublic safety\u201d was played out.  Naturally, this plotline by Chris Claremont echoed several historical events of World War II, namely the registration (and subsequent incarceration in concentration camps) of several groups of people, including Japanese-Americans and Japanese-Canadians in their respective countries, plus Jews, Romani, homosexuals and others in Nazi-controlled Europe.But you know, that\u2019s fiction.  And, ancient history.  (That\u2019s \u201cancient\u201d per school-child standards.)  This however is current events per school child standards; in the US state of Delaware, where \u201cIt\u2019s good being first\u201d according to state motto, all autistics (under the age of 18) are required to be registered.4109 Autism Surveillance and Registration Program1.0 Purpose\n1.1 Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder whose prevalence appears to be increasing in Delaware and across the United States. An Autism Surveillance and Registration, or an Autism Registry, will enable the Department of Health & Social Services (DHSS), Division of Public Health (DPH) to collect basic descriptive information on the individuals with autism, to track changes in prevalence over time, to inform the planning of service delivery to children with autism and their families, and to facilitate autism research.To facilitate research we need to know the identity of every single autistic child in the state of Delaware?1.2 The purpose of the Autism Registry is to provide an accurate and continuing source of data concerning autism to provide information to Public Health officials to help to ultimately decrease the autism morbidity burden associated with the disorder. The Autism Registry will gather data to assist with: prevalence estimation, cluster investigation, risk factor identification, and outcome assessment.Holy cows, this is not a contagious condition. We might say, \u201cOh well, these children often need services,\u201d but you know what?  I don\u2019t find registries for people with Down\u2019s Syndrome, even though physiological anomalies sometimes accompany DS, and people with DS often have specific educational needs.  Nor do I find registries for Deaf people, or people with Tourette\u2019s.  Then again, one doesn\u2019t read catastrophic articles about \u201cepidemics\u201d of such.3.1 The registry shall collect information on any child under the age eighteen (18) who is a resident of the state of Delaware, or whose parent is a resident of Delaware, and who is diagnosed at any time prior to age eighteen (18) as having confirmed autism. For the purposes related to the registry the Department shall have access to any medical record of the child with confirmed autism.Any medical record?3.5 The following persons and organizations are required to report occurrences of autism within 30 days of diagnosis to the Division of Public Health.\n3.5.1 Any physician, surgeon, dentist, podiatrist, or other health care practitioner who diagnoses a child with autism under age 18 who is not known to be previously reported. Other health care practitioners will include but not be limited to: psychiatrists, clinical and school psychologists, speech and language pathologists, licensed clinical social workers, and nurses including school nurses;\n3.5.2 The designated representative of any clinical laboratory conducting assessment, evaluation or research that performs any test which identifies a child or children under age 18 with confirmed autism not known to be previously reported; and\n3.5.3 The designated representative of any hospital that diagnoses a child or children under age 18 with confirmed autism.(Well, that\u2019s pretty much reportage by anyone. Because of course, dentists are highly qualified to make such a diagnosis \u2013 not.)Okay, maybe that\u2019s just tickling my paranoia bone too much.  Funny thing is, one doesn\u2019t hear much about this.  The event came and went quietly onto the books.  Most people were silent; hey, who cares about mass registration?

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 May 2007 ", "body": "While at work last month, I thought for a second that I was having double vision.Then I realised that the silhouettes were not identical, and that the background was not duplicated.  So, no double vision.  Our school custodian did appear to have a Doppelg\u00e4nger.  I was seeing two slightly overweight, middle-aged white men, both of whom had the same short haircut, chin-beard & mustache.  I think they both wear glasses, too.  They\u2019re about the same height, and neither has a very distinctive stride or voice.  And of course, they both wear the same school custodian uniform.Oy vey; I\u2019ve worked there for over a year and never realised that we had two male custodians!  This is one of those crushing faceblind moments, when I\u2019ve been going along pretty well for a several weeks, identifying the people whom I need to, and feeling pretty competent.  (Of course, I\u2019ve no idea how many people that I didn\u2019t realise that I needed to identify, but that weren\u2019t critical.)And then I have one of these schema-shaking moments.  My entire understanding of my corner of the universe and my relationship to it has just been turned upside-down and jumbled.  This is unnerving enough on its own, and most people can imagine such an experience at some level, as mistaken identity has formed the backbone to a number of dramatic or comedic plot lines.  I\u2019m also suffering from the not-unexpected social terror of wondering, \u201cDid I address person #2 by person #1\u2019s name at some time, or get confused when making some request or arrangement with either one of them?\u201d   Because hey, despite their low status in the official staff hierarchy, custodians are actually Very Important People in a school, right up there with the office secretary*.What most people cannot relate to is that just because I am now aware that there are two similar-looking people, that I won\u2019t be able to tell them apart in the future, either reliably or at all!  Now what I have to do is to find out their respective names, and figure out how to distinguish between the two of them.  This won\u2019t be easy, because I don\u2019t see either one on a regular basis.You might think that having these two guys in uniforms would be helpful, because it automatically denotes them as being the Custodians, as opposed to the Chef\u2019s program instructors, or Small Engine Repair program instructors, or any number of other school staff members.   But in reality I hate uniforms, because they remove an entire data layer from my identification sets.   Left to their own devices, individual people usually wear particular styles of clothing.   Uniforms make people, well, way too uniform!   In the movie Men in Black, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith (Agents K and J, respectively) are both wearing identical black suits and dark sunglasses and both have dark hair, but at least they have rather different skin color.  At work, our SRO (School Resource Officer) wears a uniform, but he\u2019s the only police officer around.  Because of that, I\u2019ve been able to get Officer H \u201cpatterned\u201d for his gait, voice and such, so I could distinguish him from the other officer that came one day to give a presentation to the students.   I would however, be very hard-pressed to pick out Officer H\u2019s face from either a group photo or a room full of his peers, all in their uniforms and short haircuts.In contrast, I love ID badges, leastwise, if people wear them where they are actually legible.  Of course, most people wear their ID badges dangling on lanyards or clipped to the bottom of a jacket or a waistband, so the cards are invariably backwards or bouncing around so much there\u2019s no hope of reading the relatively small type with their name.  Their official name that is \u2014 lots of people are addressed by a nickname or a familiar short version of their legal name.Voices are a big deal in my identification sets.  Oft times I think I am identifying an actor, when really I\u2019m just recognising their voice.  (Some actors are otherwise distinctive, like Arnold Schwarzenneger with his square jaw, but even his voice \u2026 !)  I hear Harrison Ford\u2019s voice, then I see a man with a scar on his chin, and I know that\u2019s Harrison Ford.  Harrison Ford as Han Solo in the Star Wars movies, or as Indiana Jones is easy to keep track of, because he rarely wears anything but the one distinctive costume.  Harrison Ford as Dr Richard Kimble in The Fugitive is much more difficult to keep track of, especially as he goes into hiding and shaves off his beard.  Of course, the experienced faceblind movie-watcher relies on the camera following the protagonists, so we know that if the camera is closely tailing some middle-aged guy, chances are it\u2019s Ford, and we can be sure of that when he speaks up.  The camera also spends time following Tommy Lee Jones in his role as Marshal Gerard (who in turn is following Dr Kimble), but Jones has the dark hair, which is a saving grace, because both Ford and Jones are white males with \u201ccraggy\u201d faces.Back to sorting out the white males at work.  Although there\u2019s a poster in the school office with names and photographs of people who work there, I am terrible at making the connections between a still shot of a person and the real, live person. Obviously, people have the habit of changing hairstyles and colors. Less obviously, I identify people by their voice, gait, particular mannerism, or overall body silhouette, and those don\u2019t exist in still photography, especially with the kinds of pix most people take that are modelled after sculpture busts. Silly normal people take pictures of other people\u2019s faces!  Oh woe is me.There are also a couple of young paras (teaching paraprofessionals) with whom I work on a daily basis that are difficult for me to tell apart. Para C has a tattoo on her neck, but it\u2019s often hidden by her hair, and Para L has slightly more pronounced cheekbones. Otherwise they\u2019re in the same age range, roughly the same height and build, and have similar hair. They\u2019re both of the habit of dying their hair with accents and such, which requires me to make frequent mental updates once I\u2019ve finally re-determined who\u2019s who.If Paras C and L are near each other, I can compare them and figure them out after some eight or ten seconds of cogitation. Ten seconds sounds like nothing, but it\u2019s actually a very long time in the social world, especially in light of the fact that everyone else does this in less than a second. Everyone else also does this nifty trick unconsciously; meanwhile, I am there with my cognitive efforts focused on this task, which means that I\u2019m not paying much attention to anything else going on, such as the understanding the verbal conversation, or trying to figure out the nonverbal interactions going on, sticking the useful facts from the conversation into memory, or monitoring what the students are doing. Because it takes so long for me to distinguish the two, oft times I\u2019ll be trying to recount an incident with one of our students, and can only remember that one of those two staff members was present, but not which one it was.As the custodians, paras, and officers illustrate, I tend to organise my mental people-ID files into categories.  Naturally, some of those data sets are organised by place \u2014 I expect to see particular people in specific places, so that considerably reduces the number of options that I must sort through.It\u2019s not that everyone looks identical, but rather that people exist in different \u201ctypes\u201d of indistinguishable individuals.  Even within particular locations there are categories of similar people that all fit a particular profile or type.   These \u201ctypes\u201d aren\u2019t just by age and gender; their build and hairstyle and other accessory features tend to be profoundly similar, at least to me.  Our school custodians could be out of uniform and still look \u201cjust like\u201d hundreds of other middle-aged males in the metropolitan area.  When I was young,  Art Linkletter, Richard Nixon, David Brinkley and Ed Sullivan were all Old-men-in-suits seen on television (if those were Brooks Brothers suits, then they\u2019d be the human subspecies Senatorius brooksii or some such), and all were indistinguishable from each other, at least until they spoke.There are a wide variety of types.  Toddlers comprise just a few subtypes, which may be why doting parents are so insistent on putting them into cute little outfits to make them look \u201cspecial\u201d.  An amazing number of teenage girls fall into just a few types, such as those who play softball and invariably wear their hair in ponytails.  They really do all look the same to me, which isn\u2019t something I can really say to a proud parent who\u2019s pointing out her daughter on the field, or his daughter in a team photograph.  All but two girls in that photograph seemed to fit Doting Papa\u2019s description of, \u201cOh, she\u2019s the one with the brown ponytail, and her mother\u2019s smile.\u201d  The rest could easily have been clones, which unsettling sensation was not helped by the fact that they were all wearing the same uniform.There are many, many types, and those types change over space and time.  If you look through  photos in school yearbooks from decades past, you can easily see the repetitions of types that were reinforced by clothing and hair styles of the day.  Now take that sense of typecasting and apply it to modern times and places.  It probably won\u2019t happen quite the same for you \u2014 today is \u201cmodern\u201d, and you know your extended family, neighbors, work associates, and can recognise local shopkeepers and other business employees as being people whom you\u2019ve seen a number of times before.When people travel to markedly different geographic locations, one of the unnerving forms of disorientation is that you\u2019ve not yet mentally mapped the swarms of people into different types, and figured out how to distinguish between individuals.  Doubtless you do this (quite unconsciously) in the short period of time from when you\u2019ve disembarked from the jetway, gone through customs, retrieved your luggage, and commuted to your hotel room.  As for me, I\u2019m still struggling to typecast people a week later.And apparently, to distinguish between two people of the same type over a year later.  ::sigh::* When I was in graduate school, one of the students was impressed that I had a keyring with a dozen different keys on it, \u201cWow, you must be important!\u201d   \u201cNot really,\u201d I replied, \u201cI can only get into specific rooms.  The custodian is a Very Important Person, because she gets the key that opens all the doors.\u201d  I was always sure to let the custodian know that she was welcome to a piece of the latest baked goodie I\u2019d brought in, and she in turn was always helpful for letting me in my rooms when I\u2019d forgotten my keyring, or other small favours.", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/", "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512939/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brinkley", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sullivan"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/05/20/typecasting/", "title": "Typecasting"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t5 July 2007", "body": "\u201cOh, that happens to everyone,\u201d she replied, totally fluffing off my explanations of why it was hard for me to follow just one speaker in a room full of talking people, and to understand what was being said.\u201cThat happens to me sometimes, and I don\u2019t have a problem with it,\u201d he replied, and turned back to reading his journal.  My explanation had been summarily dismissed as nothing more than an excuse, and my presence was likewise dismissed.There are a number of ways that a majority can oppress a minority, beyond the more overt outright exploitation (uneven benefits from the result of work done by some) or violence (previously discussed with regards to hate groups, here).  There are the more covert means by exclusion or marginalisation (previously discussed regarding \u201cothering\u201d here), abusing privilege (previously discussed here), and cultural dominance (sometimes referred to as a cultural imperialism) where the \u201cother\u201d serves as the negative example.  Part of being the majority or the minority comes from how each are identified, what methods are used to create and re-affirm those identities, and how the groups react to each other in more highly stereotypical or exaggerated ways to create that schismogenesis.In the cases described here, the marginalisation occurs by denial and dismissal.  The disability can\u2019t really exist because it\u2019s not obvious; it\u2019s an invisible disability.  It\u2019s also not so extreme that ordinary (\u201cnormal) people can\u2019t relate to it.We try to present and explain difficulties because want people to be able to relate to ourselves and our problems, and to gain some sense of common ground and empathy.  But sometimes this backfires because their denial and dismissal turns the issues into not-real problems.   Instead of reasons, somehow all we have are excuses.Not only that, but we\u2019ve lost social standing.  We\u2019re been shoved to the fringe, no longer equals but minors who are merely tolerated, feeling like children appealling to parents, students appealling to principals, workers appealling to bosses.  We feel demoted, as though we\u2019re trying to \u201cprove\u201d something to regain status.Somehow the other person has turned themselves into the exemplar, and the measure against which everyone else is judged.  If they don\u2019t have a problem with it, then no one else should either.Sure, everyone experiences problems.  But for those with Auditory Processing Disorder, or faceblindness, or any number of issues,  it\u2019s a matter of frequency, intensity and duration.  Processing or performance speed-bumps happen repeatedly throughout the day.  They can cause considerable issues in work, in school, socially, and at home.  Generally the disability has always been a problem, even if the cause was not formally identified for years.  The problems created by invisible disabilities are not isolated incidents, but repetitive issues that dramatically affect how one approaches endeavours in life.Denial and dismissal are frequent strategies used (often unconsciously) by others to not have to deal with invisible disabilities. What the hell for?  What purpose does this serve, aside from perhaps bolstering someone\u2019s ego by letting them feel \u201csuperior\u201d in some way?Well, if one can pretend that others don\u2019t really have disabilities or that such aren\u2019t even real, then one doesn\u2019t have to do anything to accommodate the other person\u2019s needs.  There\u2019s no effort necessary to be made, there are no changes have to be made, and any problems that the disabled person has are strictly their fault.Neat and tidy little package, innit?::sigh::Advocacy is not a single event.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t27 May 2007 ", "body": "Here\u2019s one of those quandaries:  Which is worse, accidenting one\u2019s self frequently, or not responding well to an\u00e6sthetic?It\u2019s not that I react badly to local/topical an\u00e6sthetic, just that I don\u2019t react to it much at all.  But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.  Which is not unusual because I\u2019m often unsure of where I am in space.Being chronically unco\u00f6rdinated is technically known as \u201cdyspraxia\u201d. Lacking official diagnosis of such, I just say that I\u2019m clumsy because my proprioception is crap.  \u201cProprioception\u201d is one of those many-ways-useful words I learned in entomology studies; it refers to unconsciously knowing where a body is in space by the relationships of the various body parts.  Unlike other kinds of sensing that rely upon external inputs (the familiar five you learnt in primary school of sight, hearing, smelling, tasting and touch*), proprioception is an internal sense derived from the bones, ligaments, muscles and tendons, as processed by the cerebellum.Proprioception, along with equilibrioception (balance) aids in kinesthesia, or movement sensing.  Good kinesthesia allows for good hand and eye co\u00f6rdination, and the ability to build \u201cmuscle memory\u201d or kinesthetic memory, where you know how to do something automatically from much practice, such as dialling phone numbers or riding a bike.They say that you never forget how to ride a bike.  Which (barring medical disasters) is true, although sometimes it takes a person a few dozen meters to get back into the bicycling groove.  Despite repeated sessions with my dad, I didn\u2019t learn to ride a bicycle until I was nine years old.  To this day, I\u2019m still a wobbly rider, because my sense of balance is poor, and because I don\u2019t peddle smoothly.Likewise, I didn\u2019t learn to tie my shoes until I was eight years of age.  I still abhor tie shoes, as my laces frequently come undone during the day.  I went through driver\u2019s education twice for road skills, as learning to man\u0153uver the vehicle through space proved tricky, and I had to be familiar doing that for a year before I could add in learning to operate stick shift (manual transmission).  Curiously, I prefer driving stick because it gives me something more to do with my hands, thus helping keep me focused on the process (I think that\u2019s an ADHD thing).  Nonetheless, because I have trouble coordinating hands and feet simultaneously, I do the clutch pedal and stick shift sequentially rather than simultaneously.Sequential-over-simultaneous is true for many things that require both hand and foot action.  Despite the old joke, I can \u201cwalk and chew gum at the same time\u201d, because chewing isn\u2019t tied to laterality (left/right) or hand/feet issues.  (Not that I\u2019m a gum-chewer anyway.) But my family has learned that because driving takes so much active concentration, my conversational skills diminish while driving \u2013 if I have to pay attention to the conversation, I\u2019m likely to end up on \u201cautopilot\u201d and take us to the grocery, or otherwise end up on the wrong street: \u201cMom, those are grain silos; we\u2019re going to the hospital.\u201dPart of laterality is trouble keeping left and right straight, although I don\u2019t get port/starboard confused (perhaps those words are stored in a different part of my brain).  I\u2019m neither fully right- nor left-handed; I\u2019m lefty taught right-handed penmanship, and do many things with either hand, tho\u2019 none well.  There are days when I can write fairly nicely, assuming I\u2019m not in a hurry and that I\u2019m not trying to constantly shift my depth perception between a blackboard/ whiteboard/ projection screen and my paper.In addition to getting hands and feet co\u00f6rdinated, there\u2019s also the hands and eyes co\u00f6rdination issue.  I have trouble finding things in space 12-24\u201d from face, and tracking things against the sky or ceiling makes ball games really difficult (even before I got bifocals).  Because I\u2019ve always been terrible at ball games, I was always last chosen for team, and the opposing team would chant \u201cEasy \u2018Out\u2019!\u201d when it was my turn up to bat or kick the ball because I would miss or foul or if I managed to hit the ball then I was awkward making that transition to running to first base. I bat badly left-handed, but horribly right-handed.  Gym class sucked.I even been known to \u201cfall off the floor\u201d (fall over while seated on the ground) when stretching.   You\u2019d think that being very limber would be useful in dance or gymnastics, but those require (you guessed it!) co\u00f6rdination.  Being doublejointed (can do way too many things on the Beighton Scale) also plays into the arthralgia (joint pain) possibly from osteoarthritis that makes me stiff.  Despite the chronic pain, \u201cbeing stiff\u201d for me sometimes means that I go from being hypermobile to reduced mobility into the \u201cnormal\u201d range.The upshot of all this is that sometimes I walk or move oddly.  So when I stumbled down a city sidewalk and my daughter\u2019s beau asked me, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I replied, \u201cYes,\u201d which sounded odd, and I added, \u201cI just have crappy proprioception, arthralgia, and motor tics.\u201d  Somehow that did not make for a clearer or more reassuring answer, but I managed to avoid crashing into the door frames or shop tables, so it was okay.I do run into a lot of stuff.  I walk into door jambs, trip over \u201cnothing\u201d, things tumble from my hand, I spill my purse, get luggage caught in doorways and turnstiles, and loose groceries. Wire-frame glasses have proven to be the better choice over plastic, because they bend instead of breaking when I walk into something (like a support pole in a greenhouse).  Likewise we keep burn cream in refrigerator (where it\u2019s nice and cool) rather than the bathroom medicine chest because I get burned in the kitchen, not the bathroom.  Bathtime means playing \u201cWhat\u2019s my bruise?\u201d  Only twice can I recall that I have not had bruises somewhere on me.  (Do I bruise easily?  How would I know?)  Living such a life also means picking up random skills such as window glazing, because I\u2019ve accidentally broken several windows.Another kind of perception is nociception, sensing pain externally on the skin or internally.  Once thought to simply be a kind of strong pressure input of tactition (touch sensing), pain is now considered to be a sensory mode of its own, albeit more subjective than some others.  It\u2019s a good thing I have a high pain tolerance, as dental or other local anaesthesia doesn\u2019t give much relief and it always wears off much faster than the dentist thinks it ought to.  The fact that I have motor tics and will randomly twitch throughout the dentistry process makes it difficult for him to discern my discomfort level, at least until I start making the traditional exclamations of \u201cAugch!\u201d and chair-arm clutching gestures, at which point the an\u00e6sthetic has long worn off, and my pain tolerance level is beginning to max out.Dentistry is also impacted by TMJ, Temporo-Mandibular Joint disorder, where my jaw will make clicking sounds if I eat something very chewy.  I wear a bite block at night to prevent waking up with cracking headaches. Having crumbling molar fillings replaced with crowns required using a rubber block to prop open my jaw, lest I end up with excessive post-op swelling and pain.  I have a very nice dentist; he also gives me sunglasses to block out the work light, headphones to listen to music, and a little nitrous oxide.  We also did the four crowns over two visits, which made it easier on all of us.Some things can temporarily reduce proprioceptive ability, such as when I\u2019m very tired, rather ill (the Mono + Lyme episode was notoriously bad), or having migraines.  (Migraines have a disturbing way of dramatically increasing or decreasing sensory inputs.)  \u201cPhantom leg syndrome\u201d (which I don\u2019t have, still having all my limbs) is an example of false proprioceptive processing, and I\u2019ve often wondered if arthropods who have lost limbs or portions thereof suffer from this.  Given that it\u2019s subjective, we\u2019d have a hard time asking them (this gives me a mental image of a seven-legged spider on a psychotherapist\u2019s couch).  Another phantom sensory issue is tinnitus, which I have had in increasing measures for some years.Real sensory input can also affect proprioception, and overall sensory integration, such as novel or high-intensity sensory inputs.  This means that really loud or bright environments make it difficult to sort things out, especially new places that are loud and/or bright, such as airports, railstations, shopping malls, amusement parks.  Although hyposensitive to some of my inner sensory inputs, there\u2019s a contrasting hypersensitivity to some external sensory inputs, with hyperacussis that causes a pronounced reaction to sudden, loud or sharp noises.  I get the feeling that with these hypo- and hypersensitivities, my sensory equiliser is permanently out of whack.Knowing what the issues stem from helps.  I can now compensate for poor proprioception by wearing snug clothing that will give me more sensory input, so I can better know where I am in space.  Oft times I slide one foot over top step to find where the stairs begin.   Good architectural design calls for high-constrast colours on the edges of stairs, but that assumes good depth perception and good motor control on the part of the user.Proprioception, laterality and sequencing issues also means difficulties in learning new tasks \u2013 even though I can do any of the steps sufficiently well, albeit much more slowly in an overcompensative effort to avoid spilling, breaking, mis-keying et cetera, it\u2019s difficult to get everything done in a smooth, correct sequence.  My former graduate school advisor could never understand why it was so hard for me to learn to glue 1 centimeter-long 18-micrometer-diameter wire electrodes to 1 millimeter-long insects.  Eventually I learned that I had to develop a method that worked for me, rather than trying to emulate a method that worked for others.  The end result was the same, but a person doesn\u2019t have to do things the same way to succeed, and realising that (even in my forties) has been a big boon to me.* In addition to vision (seeing), audition (hearing), olfaction (smelling), gustation (tasting), and tactition, we also have proprioception, nociception (pain), equilibrioception (balance), and thermoception (heat sensing).  Various animals have additional senses: bees can see polarized and ultraviolet light (but not red), bees and birds have magnetoception, sharks and rays have electroception, and cetaceans and bats have echolocation.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.dyspraxiafoundation.org.uk/services/dys_dyspraxia.php", "http://www.hypermobility.org/beighton.php", "http://www.emedicinehealth.com/temporomandibular_joint_tmj_syndrome/article_em.htm", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb", "http://www.ata.org/about_tinnitus/consumer/faq.html", "http://www.entnet.org/healthinfo/hearing/Hyperacusis.cfm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/05/27/oops-ouch/", "title": "Oops.

(I\u2019m so relieved \u2014 the first cucumbers aborted for lack of sufficient pollination.)  But don\u2019t worry, you get helpful hints.The first insect up is the familiar honeybee.  Of course, you may not be all that familiar with what honeybees look like close up, because you\u2019re (A) unduly terrified of them and/or (B)  haven\u2019t seen many lately due to losses from mites and Colony Collapse Disorder.  So here\u2019s a refresher.  Kindly note that in addition to being gold and black and flying around going \u201cbuzzz\u201d, a real honeybee is (1) furry (insect hairs are called setae); (2) has two pairs of wings; (3) has plain antennae, not feathery ones or tiny ones that are nothing more than bristles; (4) has a little tongue, not a long proboscis like a butterfly.Aren\u2019t they just so cute?Other kinds of bees and wasps may or may not be furry or gold and black, but their bodies are visibly divided into the head, thorax and abdominal regions (you know, \u201cwasp-waisted\u201d).  Aside from the coloration or varying amounts of fluffiness, they still look like other bees and wasps, not like beetles, flies, moths or other insects.This shiny green motorcycle-with-wings is a sweat bee (Hymenoptera: Halictidae Augochlora sp.)This large shiny almost blue critter is the great black wasp (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae Sphex pennsylvanicus).  Both of these are nectaring on the oregano flowers.  I end up having far more oregano in my landscaping than I\u2019ll ever use in the kitchen, just because the insects love it so.Smashingly gorgeous, aren\u2019t they?!Ready for the quiz?

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t9 July 2007", "body": "\u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d asks hubby.I sigh. It\u2019s summer, ergo obnoxiously hot and humid and buggy, so activities involving the outdoors would result in a lot of sticky sweating and itching from mosquito and chigger bites. (A chigger, in case you don\u2019t have them in your part of the planet, is a minuscule mite whose feeding leaves ferociously itchy welts. I am apparently an absolute chigger magnet.) \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I reply, thinking aloud, \u201cI\u2019m not really in the mood for coffee or ice cream. Actually, what sounds good is going down to the pub for a pint of ale.\u201dWe stop to recall local establishments that fit the bill of \u201cpub\u201d, and remember one not more than a couple kilometers from home. Stepping out the front door, we were immediately \u201csmacked upside the head\u201d by the tropical effect, not unlike entering the Palm House at Kew Gardens. This cuts short his reverie about great pub-finding walks about Edinburgh and Ambleside, and his enthusiasm for an evening stroll wilts quicker than his linen shirt. Rather, he has the urge to hibernate until 1st October, when the weather ought to break. So we take the less-than-green option to drive through the eight-lane interchanges and tarmac oceans of parking lots.Being an American bar & grill, this one is kitted out with baseball ephemera, flatscreen televisions broadcasting Nascar races, splashy neon adverts for the likes of Budweiser and Coors, and tonight, there are two tables of poker games in progress. The rattling of plastic poker chips soon proves to be constant, suggesting several players with nervous stims.Not being a fan of refrigerated watery lagers, I order a Guinness. Hubby refrains from strong drink, and gets an iced cola. Apparently these glasses were in a chiller, as they frosted up by the time they reached our table. The barkeep was in a hurry to draw the ale tap, and there\u2019s hardly a head on my Guinness. I set it back down to rest a minute, with a little moue of annoyance. Normally hubby would be a gentleman and offer me a ship of his drink to quench my thirst, but we\u2019ve been married nearly 26 years, and he knows I don\u2019t like ice in my drinks (not even water) and I especially don\u2019t like cola. I\u2019m not keen on hamburgers, either, even when I did eat beef. Although an American by birth, I am hardly \u201cindistinguishable from my peers\u201d.We reminisce about previous travels, discuss possible travels, and reflect upon how much more everyone in the family enjoyed staying in the same place for at least a week, where we got to settle in a wee bit, and know the local shops and whatnot.I compare what I\u2019ve learned recently about a MEd programme at Uni Birmingham, and one at the local uni. I\u2019m flabbergasted to have found that the overseas tuition (even with the current crappy exchange rate) is better than the in-state tuition. But the situation is complexified because I\u2019m also floundering in unknowns about post-graduate employment opportunities between the two. Given the option, I would just as easily take a job there as here.  Andy why not?  By definition, all of my ancestors were people who decided to up and move to a distant country.  Some people say that there\u2019s a sort of genetic positive assortment for restlessness among Americans.Meanwhile, the waitress comes by to interrupt our nattering by offering another soda refill, which he deflects in preference to paying. I pull out my purse to add to his money pile, removing a paperclip and a one-pound coin from the loose change. (I\u2019d found the pound when cleaning out my briefcase, and being me, never remember that I need to transfer it back to my moneybelt until I\u2019m again paying for something with my American coins. At which point I say, \u201cOh yeah, I gotta put this away,\u201d and then promptly forget about it again.)Hubby makes a wry smile, his eyes crinkling fondly as he says, \u201cYou know how transgendered people feel they were born in the wrong body. You were born in the wrong country. Trans-something-ed.\u201dI stared off into space, accessing word roots. \u201cTranspatriated,\u201d I replied.Today, the American travel writer, expat, and the new president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, Bill Bryson, has an article in the Guardian.  He says,I know of no landscape anywhere that is more universally appreciated, more visited and walked across and gazed upon, more artfully worked, more lovely to behold, more comfortable to be in, than the countryside of England. The landscape almost everywhere is eminently accessible. People feel a closeness to it, an affinity, that I don\u2019t think they experience elsewhere. If you suggested to people in Iowa, where I come from, that you spend a day walking across farmland, they would think you were mad.Perhaps you\u2019ve never been to Iowa, and know not whereof he speaks.  Iowa has a lot of corn, corn, corn, soybeans, and corn.  (corn = maize)   And he\u2019s right.  You would have to be nuts \u2014 downright barmy \u2014 to stroll through millions of humid hectares of corn-corn-corn-soybeans-and-corn.  Of course there are beautiful places in the United States, \u201cpurple mountains majesty\u201d and all that.  But it lacks that accessible comfort, and I find a lack of affinity for the  mind-numbing Generica of American cities.All this talk of travel is making me fair homesick. Well, not \u201chomesick\u201d as I\u2019ve never been to many of the places that Bryson was describing, but I\u2019ve yet to find a word that describes the silent keening of the heart, and the \u201clonging to be back home to a place where one\u2019s never lived\u201d.  I\u2019m not sure that xenophilia, love of the foreign or strange, has quite right connotations \u2014 although fond of travelling, I\u2019m not infatuated with an alien life form.I\u2019m  definitely \u201chere-sick\u201d as in, \u201csick and tired of being here where I\u2019ve been the past 45 years\u201d.", "outgoing_links": ["http://environment.guardian.co.uk/conservation/story/0,,2121832,00.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/09/transpatriated/", "title": "Transpatriated"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t14 July 2007", "body": "This is one of those days when it feels like you\u2019ve slid into some cheesy sci-fi flick on the late, late movie channel.  I\u2019m waiting for GINA to happen. For some people, \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d.  It\u2019s easier to be somewhat fatalistic and decide that one\u2019s fate is in divine hands. Que ser\u00e1 ser\u00e1. (Whatever will be, will be.)  However, many people would like to have some idea of what\u2019s lurking around the corner, even if it\u2019s only the possibility.The possibility of what?  And why are people waiting for GINA?GINA is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.  It is designed to prevent people from being discriminated against due to their genetic composition.  Some people avoid getting tested because they are worried that they won\u2019t be able to get insurance if they have been documented as having a \u201cpre-existing condition\u201d or are in an increased risk category.  Others worry that having documented genetic anomalies would prevent them from being hired, or be used as excuses for discrimination by employers.Some commerce industry groups fear that passing the legislation will result in frivolous lawsuits, or create an undo burden of paperwork. It\u2019s argued that genetic tests are new things, and it\u2019s not necessary to create legislation until we have a need for it (the \u201csolution in search of a problem\u201d argument).New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter gives these examples:Many examples of genetic discrimination already exist. A few years ago a woman in North Carolina was fired after a genetic test had revealed her risk for a lung disorder. Let me give you some more examples of genetic discrimination going on across the country:\n*In the 1970s, many African-Americans were denied jobs and insurance based on their carrier status for sickle cell anemia, despite the fact that a carrier lacked the two copies of a mutation necessary to get sick.\n*In 1998, Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in Berkeley was found to have been performing tests for syphilis, pregnancy, and sickle cell on employees without their knowledge or consent for years.\n*In 2000, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad performed genetic tests on employees without their knowledge or consent.In her re-introduction of the Bill, she noted,Fears about privacy do not just resonate with the public. Health care professionals are also hesitant to make their genetic information available. In one survey of genetic counselors, 108 out of 159 indicated that they would not submit charges for a genetic test to their insurance companies primarily because of the fear of discrimination. Twenty-five percent responded that they would use an alias to obtain a genetic test so as to reduce the risk of discrimination and maximize confidentiality. And, 60 percent indicated they would not share the information with a colleague, because of the need for privacy and fear of job discrimination.The thing is, a person cannot help their genes.  People should not be discriminated against for something they have absolutely no control over. Meanwhile, genetic testing is becoming more common as medical research gets better at pinning down the particulars of causal factors. Parents (and their attending p\u00e6diatricians) want to know if they carry an allele for a heritable condition that their newborn child should be tested for, without facing hassles, higher premiums, or potential denial of medical insurance coverage.  Nor should anyone have to worry about whether or not being in genetic studies will boomerang and the results later come back to haunt them.  What\u2019s the point of having completed the Human Genome Project if people are not able to benefit from the research?Genetics isn\u2019t an absolute.  There are many more diseases like heart disease or diabetes which are multifactorial and can be caused by interactions between genetics and environment (lifestyle). What if you have a history of breast cancer in your family and want to find out if you carry a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes that would predispose you?  Medical insurance companies, like other kinds of insurance companies run on expectancies and risk factors.  Having any multifactorial disease genes puts you at increased risk, and thus make you more of a potential liability as far as \u201cmanaging costs\u201d goes (\u201cmanaged health care\u201d is all about managing costs).  Then again, we can just as easily argue that knowledge is power, and that knowing one\u2019s increased risks can help us make better choices and plans about how we live our lives.In theory, the Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA, roughly analogous to the Disability Discrimination Act in the UK) gives some protection, but it\u2019s not been legally tested for such, and as we all know, just because something makes sense doesn\u2019t make it true.  Legal protections in the US are a motley hodgepodge of state and federal laws, further complicated by lack of a comprehensive and consistent social health system that results from the numbers of health insurance companies, state health care assistance, and the federal health care assistance policies (Medicare and Medicaid which in large part are limited for citizen use as nearly a last-resort resource or use by retirees, the disabled etc). There are also individual state laws regarding genetic discrimination in the workplace or by insurance companies.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prevents genetic discrimination for people covered on group insurance plans, but not those on individual insurance plans. (Are you confused yet?  I had to go and look up a bunch of details \u2013 even people who work in doctors\u2019 offices processing health insurance claims spend an inordinate amount of time looking things up.)This is a \u201cHouse Bill\u201d; it has thus far been passed (420 to 3) by the House of Representatives in April of this year, and must next be passed by the Senate, and also signed by the president. But what\u2019s mindboggling is that this isn\u2019t the first time such a bill has been brought to consideration.  Various forms were introduced in 1995, 1996, 2003 and 2005, and were not passed.Life is full of contradictions.  On one hand, we have the State of Delaware requiring that an entire group of people (autistics under legal majority) must be registered, despite the fact that autism is neither contagious nor even a disease, and likely polygenic in origin. And with the recent Patriot Act, various civil rights issues in the US have been diminished in favour of \u201cnational security\u201d. On the other hand, we have GINA.Meanwhile, I\u2019m waiting.\u201cMorality cannot be legislated, but behavior can be regulated. Judicial decrees may not change the heart, but they can restrict the heartless.\u201d\n~ Martin Luther King Jr", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Information_Nondiscrimination_Act", "http://www.geneforum.org/node/534", "http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/1/30/113528/619", "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/R?r110:FLD001:E00121", "http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-493"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/14/waiting-for-gina/", "title": "Waiting For GINA"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t14 July 2007 ", "body": "Hubby & I were taking a walk down the neighborhood park pathway.  After several \u201chundred-year-advent floods\u201d that happened within the same decade, the diverse planning committees finally realised that the streamway areas will flood and that it\u2019s easier to work with nature, therefore, they shouldn\u2019t allow building permits in these zones.  Instead, they created public use areas that can more-or-less withstand periodic flooding, turning them into neighborhood parks with extensive pathways connecting them like green arteries snaking across the county.  The pathway is tarmacked, following the winding curves of the steam, and nicely shaded.  Bicyclists, rollerbladers, pedestrians, children seeking adventure, and dog-walkers all use these trails.Shade also means increased cover, so what one gains in relief from sun exposure one loses in breezes to cool the skin and disperse personal clouds of gnats.  I keep forgetting how this obnoxious part of summer affects me personally. Unless most people, I don\u2019t quite have that marching gait where I swing my arms when walking, but am more inclined to hold my free hand(s) near my chest.  This means that the insides of my elbows get obnoxiously sweaty and uncomfortably sticky because the tee shirt sleeves don\u2019t reach that far (perhaps I need to apply a couple extra dabs of antiperspirant).  On the other hand, it\u2019s easier to reach over and gently nab my husband\u2019s elbow and pull him close to me, which I do a number of times.The first time, he protests, \u201cI\u2019m on the right side of the middle!\u201d  Indeed, he is more capable of walking in a straight line than I am.  Every now and then I trip over my feet, running into curbs or wobbling onto turf. \u201cOn your left!\u201d announces an approaching bicyclist behind us.  I nab hubby\u2019s elbow and nod, which reason becomes apparent to him as the cyclist zips past us.  Just as hubby cannot usually hear the approaching zzzZZZZ of bike tires, he also usually doesn\u2019t hear or sometimes doesn\u2019t understand the verbal warnings.\u201cI\u2019m captioning your environment,\u201d I explain to him. Sometimes on our walks I will add comments about flocks of small birds twittering, describe my surprise at hearing an approaching military helicopter before it\u2019s in visual range, mention the hum of contented bees working a patch of wildflowers, or note the tinny music of the unseen ice cream truck that causes a sudden diversion in the flocking of children on the playground.  At home I will announce, \u201cDoorbell!  Telephone! Cat wants in!\u201d even when people can hear such themselves, just out of habit.  It probably annoys people at times, but annoying each other is one of the things at which all family members excel, due to over-familiarity.The bicyclist zips out of sight around the next bend.  \u201cJust like you caption my social environment,\u201d I add, thinking aloud.  Like most people, he can not only recognise people and recall their names, but also keep track of the minutiae of the significant factors of their personal and professional lives, and how those things are important to them.  He unconsciously and automatically creates and accesses an entire databank of social information.  Of course, his personal databank is slightly reduced by his hearing loss \u2014 he misses the easyness of chit-chat and over-hearing bits, and avoids socialising in noisy places.  In those regards, I catch more of my verbal environment, auditory processing issues notwithstanding.  But despite his hearing loss, he notices, perceives, and interprets those verbal and nonverbal social interactions that I either miss or don\u2019t fully appreciate.The primary problem of being faceblind is not only do I not recognise people \u2014 rather, I have to consciously identify them \u2014 but that my abilities to do so fade over time, so people whom I used to be able to figure out will become strangers again for lack of regular contact.  The secondary, and somewhat insidious part of being faceblind is that it plays hell with \u201cnetworking\u201d.   I never know as many of my coworkers or peers when I am around them, and cannot keep track of them later on as useful contacts.When I interview for jobs, talk to people at conferences, or attend meetings it is profoundly difficult for me to remember with whom I spoke, even though I write down names and titles.  I\u2019ve tried taking down covert notes, like \u201cMr M: mustache, co\u00f6rdinates program, office 2nd floor\u201d.  But then later on I find that knowing Mr M has a mustache isn\u2019t useful, because later on I will be around two more mustached guys of the same \u201ctype\u201d who are all in the same environment, and that I never talk with Mr M in his office on the 2nd floor.  I will later come to know Mr M by the particular shape of his balding pate and the way he wears his mobile phone on his belt, but when I am taking those notes, those are not the features that are first noticeable.There\u2019s also a Ms B at the meeting, but I won\u2019t know until a month later that she was the one whom I really needed to \u201cmap\u201d out as a contact. Yet another month more after that realisation, I will finally ascertain that she was one of the people with whom I chatted at that initial meeting. Making that important connection required a lot of careful analysis, drawing connections and ruling out confounds between dissimilar data sets, as though I am playing a particularly difficult level of Sudoku involving personnel instead of numbers.  In a Sudoku game, there\u2019s always a ninth that has just a couple of numbers provided, so it\u2019s the square with the numbers that are filled in last, through pains-taking analyses of extensive subsets of if-then algorithms.As my social networks are likewise built upon masses of indirect evidence, my social cues are also constructed in such a manner, like the astronomical databases of distant bodies where planets and moons are initially inferred by faint orbital wobbles and confirmed by parallax. I miss some of the  conversational cues, such as being prone to taking things literally, and from that split-second I require to determine that someone was \u201cjust funning\u201d instead of being serious, I am then half a step off-beat with the conversational dance.  I suspect there are other things going on, those nonverbal communiqu\u00e9s of posture, glance, expression and gesture, that run like personal underwater currents that flow between pairs of people, even when they are otherwise engaged in socialising in groups. These are the clues to mental states and relationships that I miss unless I am actively observing and analysing their conversational triangulations and trilateration.And yet, it\u2019s not that I cannot learn to identify people, or that I cannot follow conversations, or that I cannot recall my own knowledge and express it coherently to others, or that I cannot catch a lot of the nonverbal dialog happening in groups.  It\u2019s that I cannot do all these things simultaneously \u2014 it takes up too much processing power running all of these functions on the conscious level.It makes my own participation so much easier if my hubby can mention to me who people are and how I would know them, and update me as to what is going on in their lives that will likely be relevant to current events. Later on, he gives me some summaries about what he saw happening, and how he perceived others\u2019 current states.  Interestingly, we sometimes differ upon the interpretations, as my observations are less coloured by what I expect to see.  This is because I have fewer predetermined \u201cstories\u201d about what is going on.  So often in social environments people are prejudiced; they hear what they want to hear,  they see what they expect to see, and they default to the current set of cultural signifieds about what things are \u201csupposed to mean\u201d and what is \u201creally going on\u201d.  Lacking some of that acculturation, my observations can sometimes be deficient, but sometimes they are more objective.Like receivers set to different wavelength ranges, we provide each other with slightly different and often complementary composites, which are then reduced to informative bytes of environmental and social captioning.  It\u2019s an unexpected and uncommon benefit to a relationship between two people with differing disabilities.  One of our strengths as a couple is that we are so different from each other.  It\u2019s not that one of us must \u201cmake up for\u201d the deficiencies of the other \u2014 that would put us into artificial dichotomies of able and disabled, forever relying upon the other in our respective r\u00f4les of an incomplete person needing the other to complete them.  Rather, it\u2019s that each of us could manage alone as competent individuals, but that together we enrich the other\u2019s experiences of the world.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/14/social-captioning/", "title": "Social Captioning"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t11 July 2007", "body": "I heard a phrase the other month that summed up a lot of my operating abilities.  I was listening to the Skeptic\u2019s Guide to the Universe podcast #93, (from May 3rd, 2007).   About 40 minutes into the show they had an interview with Bug Girl concerning Colony Collapse Disorder. One of the hosts (I believe it was Dr Steven Novella) summarized bee navigation abilities by stating, \u201cThey\u2019re very precise, but they\u2019re easily confused.\u201dYeah, I get confused.  The world is a confusing place, and bad design just makes it so much worse.  I may at times be very precise in how I approach the things I need to do, but that doesn\u2019t always help.It\u2019s not just me.  Everyone has processing blips; some of us just have them a lot more often than others. But in any regard, this is why our tools, the machinery and electronics of our lives, needs to be better designed. Poor design just makes so much stress damn unnecessary!  Crappy design takes a lot of things out of the realm of accessibility \u2014 people simply cannot use things, people cannot get to places, people cannot do the things they need to do.When human beings cannot operate well (or at all) in human environments, it is not the fault of the people, it\u2019s bad design.  And bad design is just so damn unnecessary.Possibly one of the most fabulous qualities of computers is not just that they can do so many different functions, that they can be configured to enable us in so many different ways, that they can aid in communication, but because there is the sweet, sweet Undo function. We can undo and reverse many actions, whereas in the rest of life few things are undo-able. Undo. Rewind, edit, delete.Good user interface design has several necessary qualities; it must be obvious, intuitive, accessible, responsive, and most of all \u2014 forgiving!It\u2019s easy to come up with bad examples.  Everyone can complain about the VCR or DVR they never did completely figure out, because each set had different controls and were programmed in different ways.  Even if you figured out one set, you ended up with a new one later on, or found yourself staring at one at a hotel, school or work that you had to start poking at to determine how to run it.  But here are different kinds of examples.THINGS I HATE:Toilet stall doors that open into the stall.  Honestly, who installs them this way?   There\u2019s no bloody clearance space.  The average toilet stall is a very small space to begin with. I have trouble man\u0153uvering into one with my briefcase, and I\u2019m a notably scrawny person. I don\u2019t want to bend over the toilet just to reach behind me and shut the door, or have to sidle around the door. What if I were larger, meaning merely average-sized? What if I had a briefcase or other luggage on wheels?  The \u201chandicap\u201d stall has a door that opens outwards, so why not the others?  And would it be so freaking expensive to install a hook inside the stall for purses or coats? If you don\u2019t want to risk having the hook hear the top inside of the door (where presumably a thief could reach over and snatch the bag, leaving the owner stranded with knickers around their knees), then put it on the wall.  By the way, get rid of those horribly fiddly stall-door latches that are a depressed dial which must be rotated.Speaking of doors, there are those double sets of doors in building  vestibules that have two sets of push-buttons to open the doors via power mechanism. Think about this \u2014 why would anyone want to simply hang around the vestibule between the doors? When you\u2019re waiting for a friend or a ride to show up, you wait fully inside the building because otherwise you would be in the way of everyone passing through. To use the power door function, one almost always has to break out of the direct pathway, push the button, then go back into the entering pathway to go through the doors. Upon entering the wee vestibule, one must again break from the direct pathway to push the second button for the second set of doors.  There should be one button outdoors and one indoors, but not another one in the middle.  I don\u2019t use power doors very often, mostly just when I\u2019m schlepping an absurd amount of gear. But if it is really awkward for me to use when I am on foot, how much more profoundly awkward is it for someone using a mobility aid?The touch-pad controls of my microwave are not very forgiving. The idea of a touch-pad is good as far as cleaning goes \u2013 it is a smooth surface, so there is much less bacteria-infested ooze encrusted on there. On the other hand, the buttons are not very accessible in that it is difficult to see which function each button has, and the tactile/auditory feedback is muddled, so I am not always sure if I have entered my commands correctly.  I don\u2019t know how someone with a vision impairment would even begin to navigate these touch-pad controls. (I assume that one buys textured stickers or some such to mark the important spots, like the Add-Minute and Start buttons.) In some ways, I miss the old style microwaves that had a dial one turned for the length of cooking time.  I would simply turn the dial a certain amount of rotation and punch the start button, and then when the food looked appropriately melted or smelled sufficiently warmed up, I would return the dial to the zero position to stop the cooking process.The blender is another source of contention.  I actually have one that works well, unlike this poor fellow. But the seat for where the pitcher anchors during operation is a terrible design.  It\u2019s always getting gunked up and is a pain to clean. Ditto the buttons.  Why DO they have to put so many buttons on, anyway? We could get by with slow, medium and fast, or just a variable-speed knob that is also the start/stop button.I\u2019m personally picky about devices being easy to clean.  I really, really, dislike grooved or deeply textured surfaces (e.g., faux alligator or cowhide, or edging ridges around control and display panels).  Interior corners are also bad, because they are damn near impossible to dust or wipe off, especially if something splatters on them.   I own a number of small kitchen appliances, and not a one of them was designed with cleaning in mind.  Some are easier to clean than others, but not a one was actually designed to make it easy to get clean and keep clean.Last week I saw an advert in a fancy-schmancy design magazine for a chandelier and nearly swooned.  Not for the shape of the chandelier, but rather because they advertise it as a a chandelier where you can put the parts into the dishwasher to clean them!  OMFG!  What a concept!Just why are controls designed so badly in general? Take buttons.  Junk clots up around buttons, even when the appliance isn\u2019t in the kitchen.   When the function is printed on the button, it eventually wears off, much in the way the alphanumeric characters wear off of keyboards.  Ideally, the function of the button should be obvious from its design (shape, color, form, placement on the mechanism).  Iconic descriptions are best, because they remove language barriers.  This is especially helpful when selling items internationally, because only the voltage adaptation & plug shapes need to be changed.  It also makes the device easier to use for people who have difficulties with reading, or are to some measure illiterate.Therefore, the controls must correspond to the cultural references we\u2019ve established for them, so the users don\u2019t have to engage in a new learning curve with each new piece of equipment.  The \u201caffordances\u201d or design of the object should tell us how we\u2019re supposed to use it.  A \u201cpull\u201d should be a handle you wrap a hand (or couple fingers) around, a \u201cpush\u201d should be a flat plate for the palm, a \u201ctuning dial\u201d should be a ridged knob, a \u201cmake something more or less\u201d should be a slider knob, an \u201cunlatch door\u201d should be a lever, and so on.That means that ideally, no function should require more than one control (button, lever, knob or dial) to make it happen!  There\u2019s nothing intuitive about pushing combinations or sequences of buttons.  Figuring those out requires that learning curve, and not everyone can do multiple buttons.Although making all the buttons identical colours, shapes and sizes makes equipment cheaper to build (there are fewer kinds of parts to order from the supplier), the is also makes recognition much more challenging on the user\u2019s end.  Rows of shiny identical buttons might make something look \u201chigh tech\u201d (whatever the hell that means \u2014 it\u2019s a fleeting cultural construct), but they don\u2019t make things easier to actually use.We want controls that are large enough for the dyspraxic or arthritic to use, and also contrasting enough between background: foreground colors for the visually-impaired user.  (Remember that slider knob?  Color the bar it\u2019s attached to, so there\u2019s a \u201cthermometer bar\u201d that let\u2019s us know at a glance how loud the volume is set before we turn the music on.) We want controls that can\u2019t be accidentally changed, such as when sleepily smacking at an alarm clock.  We want controls that can be used ambidextrously.THINGS I LOVE:The microwave beep that goes off a minute after cooking to remind me that my coffee\u2019s done being re-warmed or that I was heating up some lunch. Yes, I have an ADHD brain and can forget about food in less than 60 seconds. Honestly. But you know what? I\u2019m not the only one! Because Samsung built a microwave with that particular function because someone realised that their consumers needed it.My electric kettle with an automatic shut-off once the water\u2019s done boiling. So it doesn\u2019t boil dry and wreck the kettle, threaten to burn down the house, or simply use excessive amounts of electricity. Is it just me, or is this kind of function a \u201cDuh!\u201d ?The magnetic power cord coupling on my MacBook \u2013 if you trip over the power line draped between the laptop and the wall outlet, it doesn\u2019t drag the laptop off the table to go crashing to the floor.  (Did I mention I\u2019m clumsy?)The fuel reminder beep on my VW Beetle. When the fuel gets really low, it beeps at me to let me know, just in case I\u2019ve not glanced at the fuel gauge recently. Even better, it beeps at me again when I re-start the engine later on, to remind me that I still need to refuel it!To borrow a line from television advertisers, \u201cOperators are standing by.\u201d  Only in this case, we are all the operators \u2014 we\u2019re the ones operating the machinery of our lives.  And we are standing by, waiting desperately, noisily, impatiently, for tools we can use!\nThe reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.

I look \u201cnormal\u201d.  I earned university degrees, hold jobs, have a family, converse like an intelligent person \u2026 and then I\u2019m standing there dumbly like a deer in the headlights, or am staggering down the hallway flapping a hand, or am seated away from others and rocking in agitation.  I\u2019ve turned into a \u201cnot-normal\u201d person, and transgressed that invisible boundary marking staff from students / clients, or have shifted from upstanding citizen to crazy-looking person on the street.Amanda wrote a pithy blogpost on 6th May, 2006, making the excellent point that what constitutes a sensory overload threshold for one (autistic) person may be quite different for another.  This is relevant to all sorts of types of inner and outer functioning; as she points out,This isn\u2019t meant to be one of those vacuous statements about looking at how fortunate you are in comparison to someone else. It\u2019s more the opposite. I can see a potential for auties to say, \u201cWell I never had that, so losing it isn\u2019t a big deal, I live without it all the time.\u201d And I keep thinking \u201cNo, this is one of those things that really is relative to how someone is doing normally. For some people, losing the ability to talk signals a big crash, for other people it is commonplace. The fact that it\u2019s commonplace for some of us does not negate the fact that it signals a big crash for others.\u201dWhat many people don\u2019t seem to understand is why some kinds of environments are overwhelming.Even when the explanations are couched in terms that \u201canyone\u201d (meaning most neurotypical people) can relate to, and prompt the inevitable they-almost-get-it responses like, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve had days when I couldn\u2019t stand to be at Chuck E. Cheese for another hour,\u201d  (that place being one of those horribly noisy, busy party establishments full of children\u2019s carnival games and mediocre pizza).  What is then puzzling to others seems to be the inconsistency of responses in the stressed person (autistic or otherwise).  That is, the next time around one gets the annoyed comment of, \u201cWell, you handled this just fine last time, so I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re wanting to leave right after we just got here!\u201dNevermind that \u201cjust fine\u201d last time meant becoming withdrawn and less sociable, rather than spending unusually long amounts of time cloistered in a bathroom stall, or staring blankly at the floor, or having to outright make a U-turn and depart.  People\u2019s responses to stress differ from one person to the next.  A person may strike out, flee, or become withdrawn.  Parents of toddlers are familiar with this, and will watch their tots so they know when it\u2019s time to take a break.  Of course, everyone expects that an adult should be able to deal with everyday life.  Most people can in their everyday situations \u2013 it\u2019s when life surpasses the invisible and seemingly inexplicable thresholds that coping abilities are exceeded.What many people don\u2019t seem to understand is why some kinds of environments are overwhelming for some people.Frankly, not everyone has the same thresholds for the same things.  It\u2019s egocentric to judge everyone else by one\u2019s own ability to tolerate things, and yet millions of people do it,  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me, so I don\u2019t know why she has to be so \u2018special\u2019.\u201dWhat most people don\u2019t realise is that we don\u2019t all experience the same world.  The external, physical world for everyone is the same, but our sensory perceptions and perceptual processing are all individual. A moment\u2019s thought will generate the realisation that a terribly bright, sunny day isn\u2019t going to bother a blind person the same way as most people, but it is less obvious that such a day will still be excruciating for people with some kinds of vision impairments, or even for others who are simply more sensitive to ultraviolet rays.  Or for example, one of my professors could not understand why I found a lab environment \u201cso noisy\u201d.  It wasn\u2019t until a couple of years later that we realised that for all he had sufficiently good hearing, he could not hear all the high-frequency noises that I could \u2013 my subjective sensory world or \u201cUmwelt\u201d was different to his.  Nonetheless, because he did not find it noisy, by his definition it \u201cwasn\u2019t noisy\u201d, and therefore he felt that it wasn\u2019t sensible for me to complain that all the laboratory machinery gave me headaches.What many people don\u2019t seem to understand is why some kinds of environments are overwhelming at some times but not others.Our thresholds are variable by our entry level status before those inputs. In other words, how well one copes depends upon how the day has gone beforehand.   This important point about these differences between baseline and reaction levels is like saying that ice cream melts quicker on a hot day than on a cold day.  (As friends in Finland say, Siis niinku, Dah!)   Like many important points, it\u2019s obvious in retrospect. It\u2019s not just the (1) novelty and (2) complexity of the sensory inputs, or the (3) frequency, (4) intensity and (5) duration of the experience, but also (6) how much energy one has stockpiled or already spent during the day before even reaching that situation.Baseline stress loads matter and thresholds matter. In her fascinating and surprisingly humorous book about intractable pain that has lasted for over a decade, All In My Head: an epic quest to cure an unrelenting, totally unreasonable, and only slightly enlightening headache Paula Kamen describes her approach for budgeting energy as having a limited number of \u201cdaily marbles\u201d to spend.   Christine Miserandino has a similar analogy for dealing with lupus (and similar debilitating conditions) in her Spoon Theory.  So, if a person gets to lunch time and has already spent most of their daily \u201cmarbles\u201d or \u201cspoons\u201d, an experience is going to be much more overwhelming than it would be otherwise.In the same regard, everyone has different tolerances for different kinds of inputs, and those tolerances will differ by these same six variables.  Day-care workers handle screaming children for hours.  Professional proofreaders deal with blinding amounts of text.  Bartenders specialise in chit-chat as well as mixology.  To do these jobs well, each worker needs a high tolerance for specific kinds of input.  On any given day, any one of them will deal with their related stresses better or worse, depending upon other internal and external circumstances.  It would also not be surprising to find one professional telling another, \u201cI could never do your job \u2013 I just couldn\u2019t deal [with it]!\u201dGiven that individuals are unique, it helps to remember that it\u2019s neither necessary nor beneficial to hold everyone to some imaginary and unrealistic ideal of what everyone \u201cshould\u201d be able to tolerate in daily life.  Over the years my husband has come to understand that my pain and gore thresholds are way higher than his, but that my social chit-chat threshold is way lower.Now, I need to go remove several hundred weeds.  I used to do that, then all the mowing and flower dead-heading, followed by housekeeping and cooking dinner.  Nowadays I know that although I could do that if I had to, it would leave me wracked with joint aches that night and the next day.  I have learned to mete out my challenges simply as a matter of common sense \u2014 \u201cI could do all these things, but I choose not to because it would invoke too much stress.\u201d  Avoiding meltdowns or physical self-abuse by over-work are perfectly sensible goals!PART THE SECOND:  LIFE IN SURROUND-SOUND \u2014 AND WHAT THE REAL PROBLEM ISAlso known as, \u201cWhat in the world is so bloody over-whelming, anyway?\u201dNatural environments, even visually complex ones like forests or prairies are okay \u2014 they have an order to them. There is a limited number of visual textures, of weather-plant-animal sounds, of weather-plant-animal-mineral smells. More importantly, it is easy to distinguish the relative importance of sights, sounds and smells \u2014 I know to which I need to pay attention. The inputs rarely change drastically from day to day, aside from a sudden snowfall or prairie burn (which actually decomplexify the inputs).It\u2019s the artificial environments that I have trouble with. Cluttered rooms, chaotic places like shopping malls, or new places I have not been to (be they offices, transit stations, or stores) are problematic. I can tell things apart and more or less navigate okay, but I have trouble sorting everything \u2014 I notice some details all out of proportion to others, such as the minute details of chair upholstery weave instead of important signs on doors.Some details I cannot \u201csee\u201d at first, until I have had time to sort everything. A store that has been drastically re-arranged means I will spend three times as long trying to find the toilet paper. I may end up wandering around so long tracking down the toilet paper, I forget what else it was I was looking for.  Today I took my daughter grocery shopping at a market where we had never shopped.  Because she was the one concentrating on what items needed to be purchased, I could focus my attentions upon navigating through the store aisles and around the other shoppers, and finding the necessary items.  Seriously, finding those items was no small challenge, as neither of us were familiar with the particulars of the layout, nor understood how that store\u2019s stock manager had chosen to organise some of the products (we never did find the frozen chicken).If you have ever travelled in a foreign country where none of the grocery packages or labels were your familiar brands, where they did not come in the same kind of packaging, and where they were not printed in your own language, you have some sense of the queasy, almost cross-eyed bewilderment I feel.I\u2019m that person who exits the jetway and stands dumbly in the middle of the airport hallway for a couple of minutes as I visually sort and mentally map my surroundings. It\u2019s a bit like putting a photo wheel into a View-Master stereo-opticon crooked, or having your glasses frames horribly bent, and your two (binocular) views are not in perfect registration: the focus and perspective are all skewed. Once I have sorted things out in my head, this is like adjusting the picture wheel, and pop! everything is finally in focus.In a familiar environment, you have learned which inputs are important, and which can be ignored.  In the unfamiliar environments (railstation, shopping mall, new school, strange city) you are bombarded by many new inputs.  But even in the familiar environment, sometimes the sensory input is too high, and this is a stressor.In addition to the environmental stress, there is also the interpersonal and intrapersonal stresses because others do not think this \u201cshould\u201d be a problem, and therefore do not take your problem seriously.Let\u2019s walk around school, and a city block to discover what things are in a typical environment \u2026SOUNDS\n rooftop antennas shrieking in the wind\n snapping flags and clanking flag cables\n shrill cacophony of playground swings resonating down the pipes\n thrumming power lines\n buzzing fluorescent lights\n humming CRTs\n whining disk drives\n huffing printers\n snickering electrical switchboxes\n ticking or pulsed fizzing of clocks\n strident jangling of class bells echoing down tiled hallways\n steam heat hissing and thumping and clanking\n air conditioners with shrill fans and grating motors and drip\u2019drip\u2019dripping pans\n thumping compressors\n throbbing condensers\n cavernous reverberation and intense whirring of elevators\n water pipes gurgling and clattering\n whining roar of hand dryers\n squeaking sneakers and clattering heels and clomping boots and slapping flip-flops (sandals)\n swishy corduroy and nylon pants\n squishy gum chewing and snapping and candy rattling between teeth\n scritchy chalk and squeaking markers and grating pencils\n din of multiple conversations and yelling and piercing shrieks\n tinny radios\n blaring televisions\n raucous cell phones\n sibilant headphones\n slamming or squeaking doors\n rattling door windows\n leaky window jambs that moan in the wind\n sputtering coffeemakers\n beeping microwaves with aging discordant mechanisms\n vehicle engines and gears and brakes\n horn honking and wailing sirens\n screaming jets and sputtering turboprops and chuddering helicopters\n squawking and whistling and chirping birds\n chattering squirrels and the scrabbling of their claws up and down the tree bark\n strangled murmuring of pigeons\n buzzing and skittering and droning insects;\nSMELLS\n deep tang of hot wet asphalt\n acrid ammonia of anaerobic rotting vegetation stuck up in gutters\n rank heavy sweetness of pesticides and herbicides\n competing old fry fat and char of multiple fast food sources\n flat bitterness of over-simmered coffee and penetrating singe of microwave popcorn\n comforting crispness of fresh newsprint\n stale sour body odors compounded with the intrusive artificiality of perfumes, aftershave, scented deodorant, cloying fabric softener, and hairspray\n chewing gum and mints and candies\n nauseating sting of cigarettes\n playful funk of dogs\n bouyant mellowness of floor wax\n abrasively floral room \u201cdeodoriser\u201d\n caustic bathroom sanitizers\n various toileting odors including the muddy smell of used tampons & maxipads, and the sharp sour odor of someone with intestinal upset, and/or ketosis odor of someone on a high-protein diet\n institutional handwashing soap and brown paper towels\n trenchant skunkiness of locker rooms\n mustiness of wet leather shoes\n sneezy chalkdust\n dizzying whiteboard marker\n hot photocopier toner\n coziness of singed dust in the heating system\n pungent chewiness of hot roofing tar\n itchy green juiciness of freshly mown grass and turf weeds\n suffocating car and diesel exhaust\n heady fascination of spilled gasoline (petrol)\n miasma of combusted engine oil\n foul stickiness of garbage bins;\n(I might add that when I am in educational environments, I do not wear any scented body products, to avoid bothering people who may have olfactory sensitivities.)SIGHTS\n people, cars, trucks, bicycles, motorcycles\n buildings, windows, doors, railings, gutters\n shop signs flags, awnings, shutters, balconies, window air conditioning units\n caf\u00e9 tables and chairs, railings, gates, doormats\n trash, graffiti\n streetlights, fire hydrants\n bicycle racks, mailboxes, newspaper bins, trash cans (rubbish bins)\n utility posts, traffic signals, traffic signs, street signs\n storm grates, puddles, sewer access covers, curbs (kerbs)\n floors-stairs-lights-elevators (lifts)-escalators\n exit signs, building/room numbers\n landscaping plants, directional signs, advertising signs and so on (there is a LOT of signage in the world!)\nAt worst, there is no filtering, no prioritizing, no discrimination.  Everything is experienced all at once, even those details that most people are not even aware of or cannot perceive.  Each item has to be identified and sorted.  So what results is that either I am standing there blinking, overwhelmed and processing all the stimuli to make sense of it.  If the inputs are too much or my tolerances are too low, then I am trying to block out some of the stimuli by staring at the ground, and trying to re-regulate my internal stress by rocking.These \u201cstereotypies\u201d of rocking or bit of hand-flapping are both signs of stress and ways of reducing stress.  I really don\u2019t believe that trying to make people look \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cindistinguishable from their peers\u201d by suppressing or forcefully training out such coping mechanisms is a good thing.  The social stigmatising and the training methods can be additional stresses, and removing a stress-release mechanism from someone\u2019s toolbox of life skills is simply going to result in their finding a different behavior to serve the same function.  Although some other behaviors may be \u201cmore acceptable\u201d (who gets to decide these things, anyway?), there are plenty of maladaptive behaviors out there that we want to avoid, e.g. chemical dependency, self-injury, overt or passive aggression, et cetera.The real \u201cproblem\u201d with stereotypies is that not that people do them, but that others have hang-ups about actions that harm no-one.  (In analogy, the problem with racism is not that someone has phenotypic characteristics to their \u201crace\u201d, but that others are bigoted.) It is disrespectful and demonstrates a distinct lack of empathy to hold everyone to these artificial and unrealistic ideals of what everyone \u201cshould\u201d be able to tolerate in daily life. Furthermore, it is stupid to deprive a person of their coping methods, and then complain because the person isn\u2019t coping and has a melt-down or shut-down!", "outgoing_links": ["http://ballastexistenz.autistics.org/?p=92", "http://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Head-Unrelenting-Unreasonable-Enlightening/dp/0738209031/ref=sr_1_8/026-3313208-0383608?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1184539371&sr=8-8", "http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/2004/11/the_spoon_theory.php", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View-Master"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/16/bridge-load-limit/", "title": "Bridge Load Limit"},

I\u2019m not going to do any extra tagging, tho\u2019.Odd things I like:1. Spiders; I have a pet tarantula.  Watch this space for Garden Buzzing about spiders (I\u2019ll put a link here for the pictures that will be on another page, so arachnophobes won\u2019t have to see them.)2. Bees.  (duh)  Bees are fabulous, little golden-fuzzy honey machines, or metallic green wonders, or fat teddybear-ish bumbles, and essential to  our food web.3. Snakes.  Alas, the cute one I was ogling at the pet shop got sold.4. Heights.  My son and I stood on the edge of the Grand Canyon and said, \u201cWay cool!\u201d  Ditto the top of St Paul\u2019s cathedral in London.  I was really bummed the London Eye was closed the afternoon I went for a ride.5. Public speaking.  Surprisingly so, given that making eye contact with audience members is challenging, ditto restraining stutters and watching my articulation.  But as you might expect from such a loquacious blogger, I like sharing my thoughts.6.  Brussels sprouts.  Why does everyone malign the cute little mini-cabbages?  They\u2019re really quite nice when not boiled to death, but just steamed with a little butter and caraway seeds.7. Liquorice, especially allsorts. Usually I stick with the liquorice Altoids because eating much liquorice gives me a tummy-ache (it\u2019s prolly the wheat flour).8. Coconut.  As a public service, I remove the coconut pieces from boxes of mixed chocolates.  Unless, of course, my son has snagged them first.Well, I think that list probably puts me at 1.2% of the population \u2026 oh, well.

The only hitch is that you have to remember to buy a couple things and keep them in the pantry for the next time you have one of Those Days.4 tablespoons olive oil (50 mL)\n1 pound chicken breast filets \u2014 still-frozen is fine (1/2 kg)\n2 lemons, washed and sliced thinly & seeded (no need to peel)\n1 large jar or 2 small jars of marinated artichoke hearts, sliced (keep brine)\ncapers\noregano or marjoramSpread olive oil to cover the bottom of a pan and lay the chicken strips in a single layer.  Scatter the lemons and artichoke hearts on top, sprinkle generously with capers and oregano, and pour on the brine.  Put the lid on the pan, and cook over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.  Serve with rice or egg noodles.  (At our house, the rice cooker lives on the counter.)CARIBBEAN CURRYThis one is for all of my vegetarian friends. It\u2019s not as quick, but is tasty any time of year, and produces fabulous \u201clunch-overs\u201d.2 tablespoons oil  (30 mL)\n1 onion, finely chopped\n3 garlic cloves, minced\nequal amount of minced fresh gingerroot\n1 cup diced seeded tomatoes (250 mL)\n1 can lowfat coconut milk (about 200 mL)\n1/2 teaspoon salt (2 grams)\n2 teaspoons curry powder * (10 grams)\n1 teaspoon ground cumin (5 grams)\n1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom (2 grams)\n3\u201d cinnamon stick (8 cm)\n1 large sweetpotato, peeled and diced (drained if canned)\n1 can black-eyed peas, drained\n1 small eggplant, cubed\n1 sweet ripe pepper, diced\n2 handfuls fresh baby spinach leaves\npineapple chunks, optional\ncooked brown riceSaut\u00e9 onion for 5 minutes until tender, then add the garlic and ginger and cook for 2 minutes.  Add the curry powder, cumin, cardamom and cinnamon stick, cook stirring constantly for 30 seconds.  Stir in tomato, coconut milk and salt and stir to combine.  Add sweetpotato, peas, eggplant and sweet pepper, and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Add spinach leaves the last two minutes of cooking. Remove cinnamon stick before serving with brown rice.* GARAM MASALA  (CURRY SPICE MIX)2 teaspoons ground cardamom (10 grams)\n1 teaspoon ground cayenne chile (5 grams)\n1 tablespoon ground cinnamon (15 grams)\n2 teaspoons ground cloves (10 grams)\n1 teaspoon ground cumin (5 grams)\n1 teaspoon ground nutmeg (5 grams)\n1 tablespoon ground turmeric (15 grams)DIMENSION \u2018X\u2019 COOKIESGotta have some chocolate in here! Instead of vanilla cookies with chocolate bits, these are my special chocolate cookies with vanilla bits \u2014 the cookies from another dimension! If you don\u2019t have vanilla chips, then substitute pea-size chunks of white chocolate.3/4 cup brown sugar (150 grams)\n1/2 cup sugar (115 grams)\n1 cup butter (2 sticks) softened (225 grams)\n1 teaspoon almond extract  (5 mLs)\n1 egg\n2 cups flour (200 grams)\n1/4 cup baking cocoa (30 grams)\n1 teaspoon baking soda / sodium bicarbonate (5 grams)\n1/2 teaspoon salt (2 grams)\n1 cup vanilla  chips (180 grams)\n1/2 cup salty Spanish peanuts (60 grams)Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F / 190\u00b0C.  Cream together the butter and sugars.  Mix together the dry ingredients, and add this, along with the remaining ingredients to the creamed mixture.  Drop by tablespoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet, bake for about 10 minutes. Let cool for a minute before removing to wire cooling rack.CRICKET CRUNCH Where else would you find such an appetizing recipe for insects? We served these at a department Open House, and yes, ordinary people ate them. Insects are a good source of low-fat protein.2 tablespoons oil  (30 mL)\nAbout 3 dozen large crickets (available at pet shops)\nTwo large handfuls of small snack-size pretzels\nOne large handful of salted Spanish peanuts\nOne large handful of seedless raisins (sultanas)\n1/2 teaspoon salt (2 grams)\n1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne chile (2 grams)\n1/4 teaspoon turmeric (1 gram)Set the package of crickets in freezer for half an hour to kill them.  Mix the seasonings together. Heat oil in wok or large pan and saut\u00e9 the crickets, sprinkling evenly with seasonings.  Add the other ingredients and toss for a couple of minutes to throughly mix before removing to a serving bowl.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 July 2007", "body": "SHOPPING.  UGH.  I hate shopping \u2014 once I find something that is comfy and fits, I stick with it. But you know, after a while the fave broken-in garments turn into broken-out garments, and it\u2019s time to replace them.  Plus, our 26th anniversary is coming around the corner, so I thought I\u2019d see if there were any cute negligees.I park my car and stride into the mall with that hyperalert  / in a hurry walk, down to the same store where I have always bought bras. Omigawd, what am I thinking? It is Saturday in Suburbia and every freaking teenager, parent and small child, and ambling senior citizen is filling the hallways \u2026 I cannot even walk in a straight line! A cluster of tall guys strut down the hallway to imaginary rap music, holding up their over-large hip-hop pants. A giggle of black head-scarves suddenly breaks into a swarm of individual girls chattering at each other.  A flotilla of perfumed saris wafts by.  The mall is full of people-objects to avoid, too many smells, too much noise, too many things to visually sort out \u2026 and too big; it is a two-story American indoor shopping mall with no less than five major department stores.Woah \u2014 where is the shop?  It used to be here, on this corner.  How can I totally lose an entire shop?Blinking, I look around, and realise that they have totally redecorated & re-landscaped the entire mall (which shows you how often I go there!). Ye gods and little fishes.  I rather much doubt that Victoria\u2019s Secret has gone out of business; I bet the shop has moved. Yours Truly is now making little whimpers of annoyance. Why do they have to move shops?  Backtrack halfway down the hallway again to find a mall map near some entrance doors.  Apparently VS is now on another floor.Go back down the hallway, again. Fight escalator mob. Cross to other side of atrium and circumnavigate the long way around the central plaza to avoid walking past the odoriferous bath soap shop that gives me asthmatic coughing fits. Step into VS. They are having a sale (aren\u2019t they always?).   One guy in dreadlocks stands around patiently, reading something on his PDA.  Two more guys are cruising the bubble bath displays together, one of them angling his cane deftly around the ziggurats of shiny merchandise.  I am doing less well, tripping over table drapes that seem to reach out and snag my sneakers. The store is of course, swimming in PINK.  I hate pink.  The store used to be decorated in lots of high-contrast stripes and perfumed florals that made me dizzy \u2014 but no more!  Now it\u2019s full of mirrors facing other mirrors, and numerous giant pictures of faces; frankly, I\u2019m not sure this is an improvement.  At any rate, they have completely re-arranged all the merchandise from the last time I was here, so I have no idea where the \u201cbra department\u201d is, or if indeed the bras are sequestered in a particular zone at all.I look around for the sales tables \u2026 wade through the crowd of shoppers, and tables of  lacy bits and racks of racy bits to reach it.  Begin sorting through the merchandise \u2014 wrong kind, too much ruffles \u2014 wrong kind, too many fussy ribbon-bows \u2014 wrong kind, too\u2013omigod that\u2019s UGLY \u2014 wrong kind, no straps \u2014 wrong kind, how on earth do you wash something with a big rhinestone thingum sewn to it?  \u2014 where are the bras I usually buy?A sales girl accosts me. I am getting overwhelmed and beginning to sway, and stare at the dressing room key bungeed to her wrist, telling her my usual size, and the style I used to wear. Apparently they No Longer Carry the one style that was comfortable and fit Just Right. (Why??) She leads me to the back to help fit me. I rarely do this, but know that this is one of those rare times when I need a sales clerk \u2014 she knows the merchandise, and will run out and bring different samples for me to try on, so I don\u2019t have to keep redressing and undressing.She brings to my dressing room a black lacquer tray of samples, a quintet of colorful bras neatly lined up like so many bonbons.  Finally alone, I strip off my Monarch butterfly tee shirt, admire my shoulder musculature, notice that chigger bites take forever to fade away, and realise that my current bra is really tatty, fluffy with snagged elastic threads.  I always end up postponing this chore for too long.  ::sigh::I try on the first round of bras. They don\u2019t fit. She next brings me wee hangers clipped with frou-frou brassieres. Too much itchy lace and tags, but I try them on anyway. She says she has never heard of anyone finding the lace or tags to be painfully itchy. (\u2013HUH?)Now the sales clerk is telling me something more, but I\u2019m having trouble understanding what she\u2019s saying over the techno-pop music in the background.  She has an accent but somehow appears to be badly dubbed, and I\u2019m having trouble lipreading her.  I\u2019m also very distracted by the electric blue lines above her eyes, like eyeliner that floated northward into the eyeshadow zone.  These distractors are playing hell with my ability to describe what I\u2019m needing.She brings me more samples. Did you know they make bras nowadays that can stand up all by themselves? They are made of something like wetsuit neoprene.  Bizarre. The other models have too much padding. \u201cOh, those are not padded, those are \u2018lightly lined\u2019,\u201d she explains. What the heyll \u2026 my poor breasts lay puddled in the bottoms of these foam cups and ooze out the sides.  (I suddenly wish that I was a mastectomee and could buy my boobs off the shelf, perfectly formed.)  The bra is simultaneously Too Big and Too Small because my breasts are not foam-cup shaped \u2014 this you call \u201cnot padded\u201d? Do I even want to know what is considered \u201cpadded\u201d? Probably not.She brings me yet more samples.  \u201cThis one is most popular style,\u201d she offers.  I don\u2019t care about what is \u201cpopular\u201d; I\u2019m not fitting everyone else\u2019s chest, I\u2019m fitting my own. It\u2019s a puzzlement as to why bras are so hard to fit.  Or maybe it\u2019s a testament to the variability of breasts.  I stand there topless in the dressing room wondering why lactation glands are not retractable when not in use.  When I was pregnant and nursing, I resembled the Venus of Willendorf and wore highly engineered B\u00fcstenhalter to support my gazongas.  In later years when I was underweight, dainty little brassieres kept my titties tidy. Now I\u2019m back to an average size, and damnit, it\u2019s still hard to find something that fits right. So why am I buying a bra? I have a few jog bras that I wear every day. But they are cut high, and you cannot wear a white jog bra with a Little Black Dress or any number of other garments\u2026::sigh:: Finally we find an \u201cunlined\u201d bra that fits me suitably well, and there are no underwires to poke me or pinch glands. I am going to spend more than I think is sensible because I can NOT stand the idea of going to a department store and starting this horrible process All Over Again, possibly without the assistance of a sales clerk. Oy.An hour has gone by, and so far I have acquired a whopping two brassieres.  Do I want some matching bottoms?  What size do I even wear, Small or Medium?  Having gone through too many costume changes already, I twist my spine and try to read the size printed on the back of my waistband, thus giving myself a wedgie. Now I literally have my knickers in a twist.What else was I \u2026?  Oh, yeah.  Clutching the two acceptable bras in one hand (I\u2019m terrified of setting them down in a forgetful moment, never again to discover where I left them or what style they were), I peruse the racks of nighties.  There are garish sleep-sets with silly slogans, such as girls wear in dorms, and there are strange little numbers that are designed to allude to something lewd, but don\u2019t look very comfortable.  Oh, silly me; I guess one isn\u2019t expected to actually sleep in them. A satiny negligee and robe in a soft honey colour are pretty, but the former is trimmed with that damn scratchy lace, and I give up on the whole idea of a new nightie.  I have several, and crawling in bed nude is always more than acceptable.Finally I leave the shop.  My couple handfuls of undergarments have been propagated into a big frothy mass of flamingo-coloured tissue paper, barely contained by the shiny embossed bag dangling absurdly from my hand. It\u2019s not enough that I spent all that time and money there, but I have to advertise the fact to everyone else. Wending my way through the other shoppers like a salmon swimming upstream, it occurs to me that in times past, \u201csandwich board men\u201d were paid to be walking billboards, but nowadays we pay companies to do the honour of providing advertising for them.  Gad, I hate shopping.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.arthistory.upenn.edu/smr04/101910/Slide6.jpg", "http://www.memoriespictures.co.uk/socialhistory/london%20life/Sandwich%20board%20man%20LL40.jpg"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/22/lingering-around-the-lingerie/", "title": "Lingering Around the\u00a0Lingerie"},

That\u2019s about as great a slot as getting to do an hour-long presentation in a warm, dark auditorium right after lunch when the audience is stuffed full of turkey sandwiches (ooh, tryptophan, zzzz\u2026)  Hey, I\u2019ve done that gig.  And I tripped spectacularly en route to the lectern (tripping over nothing, because I\u2019m just so talented that way).  And then the AV equipment didn\u2019t work at first.  And I was coming down with the flu.  But public speaking is still theatre of sorts, and I joke about my clumsiness and the malfunctioning equipment (\u201cThis stuff never happens to you all, right?\u201d) and the show goes on, because this is What We Do.  They even laughed at the jokes, bless them.But it\u2019s time to take a break from work!

There will be some lovely refreshments (no Cricket Crunch, unless there\u2019s a request), and of course the food will be labelled for allergens.  We\u2019ll be hanging out around the patio with the tropical foliage, so you won\u2019t be surrounded by pollen or my friends the bees unless you want to venture further out.  Plenty of seating has been arranged for those \u201cchair-impaired\u201d folks who don\u2019t travel with their own, including a bunch of gliders for those of us who  like to sit and rock.  Fortunately this is an \u201coff\u201d year for the big cicadas, so we\u2019ll be able to hear the stories easily, and arrangements have been made for interpreters.Lessee\u2026 anything else?

A spacesuit that doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re wearing horribly cumbersome elephant\u2019s pyjamas or a really cheesy robot costume.

Less cumbersome also means that a person can move more naturally, which is simply good ergonomics; wearing the suit will be less fatiguing and straining to the body.

Not the obvious, surface situations, but what is going on in the social dynamics? And we can we do to change things?(Click on headlines for links to full news stories.)Autistic boy not welcome in music store(New York City)\nAs an autistic savant, Ryan Morales has an extraordinary talent for music \u2014 he can play the piano by ear; he has an encyclopedic knowledge of Broadway trivia, and he loves to go to his local music store to look at the drums. But the owner of Lane Music Center blocked the 13-year-old boy and his caregiver from entering the New Dorp Lane shop this week because, the store owner said, Ryan\u2019s behavior makes him feel uncomfortable.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not going to let you in,\u201d owner Alan Wilcov reportedly told Ryan\u2019s caregiver, Oluwaseun Cole, whose job it is to take Ryan on walks through the community to familiarize him with the social rituals of everyday life. \u201cI just can\u2019t let him in,\u201d Cole said Wilcov had told him on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI have a problem with his kind,\u201d he allegedly told Ryan\u2019s parents and caregiver later that night, when they went to the store to discuss what had happened; it was a heated conversation that left both parties fuming.\n\u2026Woman Claims Abuse By Fellow Animal Control Officers(Kansas City, Missouri)\nCindy Earnshaw said it was her dream job to work as an Overland Park, Kan., Animal Control officer. But after nine years of exemplary job evaluations, Earnshaw was deemed unfit for duty. Earnshaw said it is because of her disability. \u201cI crawled my whole life to get there. When I got there, I was good and gave it 100 percent,\u201d Earnshaw told KMBC\u2019s Lara Moritz. Earnshaw said she felt most comfortable in her uniform, driving her Animal Control truck and taking care of animals in Overland Park.\n\u201cI so loved my job, and I was so passionate about it, and was able to serve my citizens and my animals, which kind of compensated,\u201d Earnshaw said. Earnshaw said the job compensated her for what she claims was constant bullying by her fellow Animal Control officers. \u201cI\u2019m there to work, you know. All I got for that was torment and abuse and bullying. They articulated, \u2018You are purposely trying to make us look bad,'\u201d Earnshaw said.\n\u2026Autistic Mum\u2019s Baby Taken Into Care (Wales)\nThe grandfather of a baby taken into care immediately after he was born is accusing social services of discriminating against his daughter because she has a form of autism. The baby\u2019s 21-year-old mother has Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, a condition associated with problems concerning social and communication skills.\nThe grandfather, who lives in South Wales but cannot be identified for legal reasons, said, \u201cWithin hours of the baby being born two weeks ago, social workers arrived at the hospital and served papers on my daughter saying they would be applying for an interim care order. She was beside herself. \u201cTwo weeks before what should have been the happiest day of her life, we as a family attended a case conference where Monmouthshire County Council placed the unborn baby on an \u2018at risk\u2019 register. Their argument was that because she has Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, she is at risk of getting post-natal depression, and that there would therefore be the likelihood of her neglecting the baby. \u201cIn my view, all this stress sent my daughter into labour four weeks early.\n\u2026These are three different stories about three different situations, in three different parts of the world.  All three people have been discriminated against (howsoever the local courts may or may not rule), because they are autistic.  None of them, as described in these news stories, ran afoul of civic laws because of what they did.  Rather, they were harassed by others because they were different, or because of what they might do because they are perceived as being different.It would be easy to say that these people, and millions of others with their own unpublished stories,  were victims of bullying.But that would be wrong.A lot of research and media attention is paid to those who are on the receiving end of emotional or physical violence. These people are often referred to as the \u201cvictims\u201d. This is unfortunately a rather poor word choice, because the word victim implies that the events were in some part the fault of the recipient.  That is, If you didn\u2019t behave in such obviously \u201cweird\u201d ways, or if you learned to chit-chat better, this wouldn\u2019t happen to you.Being a victim means that you had no choice in the matter, that you were weak and powerless to prevent or to stop things. Being a victim meant that when all was said and done, you lost.But despite the protestations of attackers, none of the problem is the fault of the recipient of the violence. People do not make their spouses or partners beat them, children do not make their peers bully them, employees do not make their bosses harass them, and people do not make rapists attack them.People on the receiving end are better described as targets. Being a victim is a passive, helpless role. In contrast, being a target puts one in the position of needing to figure out a strategy, like a chess player who must either move the piece, block the line of attack, or take offensive action.Targets are often selected because they have some vulnerability, but too often this is over-emphasized, because everyone has weaker aspects of their skills, aptitudes or personalities. Again, having a weakness does not mean that the target is at fault.I derived the next three paragraphs describing the bully\u2019s mode of operation from the general descriptions available at Bully OnLine. It\u2019s not that most of us haven\u2019t seen these things happen in our own personal realities, but it is in many ways reassuring to see such analyses codified and neatly listed.  (\u201cIt\u2019s not just me.\u201d) What is especially interesting is that because many of the criteria for good bullying targets are those which are found in earnest employees, especially relatively na\u00efve autistic employees, we are such prime targets for bullying.  Indeed, there is no lack of news articles or research evidence to support such.  Some pertinent factors mentioned:1. Surprisingly, sometimes those \u201cweaknesses\u201d found in the targets are the same qualities which make for a person who can work well with others (assuming that the others are sane, rational, accepting people): self-deprecating (sense of humor), willing to defer to other\u2019s needs and opinions, willing to negotiate and play fairly, good at apologising, reliance on other\u2019s perceptions of one\u2019s work for feedback about progress, and the need to be a valued team member. The attacker\u2019s underhanded methods do not always include overt physical violence, but may also include or instead include gossiping, innuendo, and splitting members of the same organisation or class into opposing subgroups.2. In the work environment, targets are also selected because the attacker feels threatened by them; the target is good at their work (better than those who would denigrate them), and the target demonstrates better integrity or values (which threatens the attackers power plays by not playing into them). The target is usually someone who would rather negotiate or discuss problems rather than resort to antagonistic means. Unfortunately it\u2019s all too easy for the more clever adult attackers to re-frame accusations as nothing more than \u201cpersonality conflicts\u201d. Attackers are frequently pros at deflecting responsibility for their own behaviour, and will deny what happened by reframing, dismissing and/or diminishing events, will retaliate, or most absurdly, will try to subvert accusations to describe themselves as being the \u201ctrue\u201d victim.3. Targets may also be such because they are good at following directions and rules. Bullies for example, are notorious for working behind, outside and underneath the rules and making poorly-designed rules work for them and against their targets. The flip side is that targets are frequently those people who won\u2019t or can\u2019t become part of the social cliques, which once again creates islands of untouchable inaction in the attacker\u2019s power plays. The independent worker who is imaginative, quiet, and more interested in solving problems efficiently than in joining in the water-cooler gossip can easily be a target because they are (in some respects) already an outsider. Sometimes the target is selected because the previous interpersonal dynamics have changed due to people leaving and/or arriving; the attacker needs a new \u201cfall guy\u201d to be the recipient of the \u201cresponsibility\u201d for being the \u201ccause\u201d of all the attacker\u2019s problems.Although the Web site describes bullying at work, the patterns are easily transferable into the many other situations we find ourselves. In other community situations, there are a number of different causes for bullying, many of which stem from fear.  The different or disabled person is feared and scorned because they are misunderstood, or because their actions may seem erratic, or are misinterpreted as meaning something antagonistic.  Fear of the unknown, or gross assumptions about abilities drive this kind of bullying.Unfortunately, it\u2019s often hard to advocate effectively, as targets may be pathologised by any number of people, including law enforcement officers and mental health clinicians.  Protests are dismissed, ignored, or even turned against the target as further evidence of their perceived \u201cdeficits\u201d.  The targets\u2019 self-defense measures get re-cast as aggression, in much the same manner of the targets of domestic abuse. The toll of resistance results in nervousness, exhaustion, and confusion, which are deemed to be evidence of \u201cmental illness\u201d, rather than efforts at retaining personal rights.  After all, everyone knows that autism is a \u201chorrible mental illness\u201d, so obviously any issues the autistic person has stems from being autistic, rather than from how others treat the autistic person.  In other words, the effects of the bullying are misinterpreted as the causes \u2014 the bully has deflected responsibility onto the target.Compared to the suave reassurances and assertions of the manipulative [neurotypical] perpetrator, the beleaguered recipient appears reactionary.  Any resistance to the efforts official people make to \u201chelp\u201d the two people reconcile is of course, further proof of the target\u2019s mental illness.  (It\u2019s such a neat, tidy package!)Given the bullying that creates the problems, and the results of trying to resolve those problems, it\u2019s no surprise that targets get depressed.  The situations create masses of \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d, the emotional reaction to events that contradict what you know; they make your brain hurt.So how do we handle this?  What do we do about it?There are no easy answers for preventing and resolving bullying and targeting.  This is a large-scale, multifaceted effort taken on many fronts.  But the first front we must address is inside. We must begin by changing our own perceptions and actions. It is not enough to recognise bullying; most of us are more-than-familiar with such.  Instead, we must be able to recognise that as targets, we are not deserving of such treatment.  We must both expect and become co-creators of respectful social interactions.(If you cannot reliably navigate these social situations due to communication issues or other problems, then you will have to enlist the aid of allies who can help advocate.)Don\u2019t try to negotiate with bullies by way of that strange shadowy world of unspoken conversational meanings.  There\u2019s no real negotiating with bullies, and it\u2019s the rare autistic person who is quick, perceptive and adept at using and manipulating conversations to their own end.  Trying to fight bullies on their own turf is an uphill battle, as they have more than just a \u201chome field advantage\u201d.  Instead, follow your particular strengths, and use your natural bluntness to be polite and direct.Describe what you are seeing \u2014 so often bullying relies upon the social fiction that everyone pretends they cannot see what is really happening.  So use your ability to ignore the imaginary social dramas and cut through the fog of \u201clet\u2019s-pretend\u201d by telling it like it really is.  (Don\u2019t insult people \u2014 stick to objective facts.)Explain what you need, not as something \u201cspecial\u201d that you need because you are some kind of broken, incomplete person, but as something you need simply because everybody has the same basic needs for safety and acceptance.  Because everyone is different, we don\u2019t all fulfill our needs in the same ways, and that\u2019s why you do things differently. You don\u2019t \u201cask\u201d for your rights, you expect them. Announce what you expect others to do that is appropriate to the situation, useful, and respectful of all involved.Look, what\u2019s obvious to us is not obvious to others.  Not in the understanding or the analysis of the situation, or in the remedying of the situation.  This is one of those things where the mind\u2019s eye is blind. But it\u2019s not just autistics \u2014 other people have this same problem in relation to us.  If other people don\u2019t understand, they aren\u2019t going to see the problem or be helpful.We must learn to use our natural aptitudes for speaking plainly and turn them into an assets for clarity and assertiveness.  When used wisely, our weaknesses become our strengths.\u201cOur deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.  Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.  It is our light, not our darkness that frightens us.\u201d\n~ Nelson Mandela", "outgoing_links": ["http://blog.silive.com/advanceupdate/2007/07/autistic_boy_not_welcome_in_mu.html", "http://www.thekansascitychannel.com/news/13296425/detail.html", "http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0200wales/tm_headline=autistic-mum--8217-s-baby-taken-into-care%26method=full%26objectid=19418874%26siteid=50082-name_page.html", "http://www.bullyoffline.org/workbully/bully.htm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/24/that-kind/", "title": "\u201cThat Kind\u201d"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t25 July 2007", "body": "A big part of my frustrations with the social realm are the crazy bits that keep surfacing in dialogues, like rocks that keep surfacing from a nicely tilled field.One of those crazy bits are the unstated, inferential messages with which neurotypical people fill their conversations.  You ask a nice, straightforward question, and you get \u2026 ambiguity like a fog obscuring the field.  You get hidden meanings to stub your toes upon.The conversation is full of subtexts, like coded messages. But unlike real coded messages where \u201cGrandma knitted me some socks,\u201d really means \u201cYou\u2019re in peril, leave the country immediately,\u201d these subtexts are not codified.  They do not have a specific meaning known to both parties.  Instead the subtexts could be any number of meanings, and it\u2019s up to the other party to guess what those true meanings might be and which one they might be!  The subtexts don\u2019t even remain consistent; the same phrase might be used to mean completely different things at different times.I like cryptograms as an intellectual puzzle, but I don\u2019t like them in everyday conversations like this one where I ask:\u201cDo you want some soup now?\u201d\n\u201cI could have it later, what about you?\u201dI\u2019m too tired to spend the effort deciphering what other unstated hints or desires might lie behind such a \u201cpolite\u201d response, so I send out a familiar preface, and repeat, \u201cI\u2019m asking, do-you-want-some-soup-now?\u201dHubby acquiesces to my simple, blunt question, \u201cSure, that sounds fine.\u201dThere, now, see what an easy interaction that really is?  \u201cDo you want some soup now?\u201d is a straightforward, binary question.  It can be answered with, \u201cYes, please,\u201d or \u201cNo, thank you.\u201dBut the original reply, \u201cI could have it later, what about you?\u201d is a very fuzzy response.    It is not literal.  It can, as I have slowly ascertained over the years, actually mean anything from:\u201cI\u2019m not hungry right now. You can go ahead and eat your soup now if you want.\u201d\n\u201cWould you wait and eat your soup later when I\u2019m hungry and want to eat my soup, and we can share the meal together.\u201d\n\u201cDo you really want to bother making soup for dinner? We could just heat up leftovers.\u201d\n\u201cSoup in general sounds fine, but actually I don\u2019t like that particular recipe you made.\u201d This is actually a subtext with another subtext: But I won\u2019t tell you I don\u2019t like it, and will spend years coming up with \u201cpolite\u201d excuses not to eat it.\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry, but soup doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d This too is actually a subtext with another subtext: Guess what I might want to eat instead!\n\u201cI really want you to suggest that we go out to eat instead.\u201d  This is yet another a subtext with another subtext: If you really loved me you would know that I want to be welcomed home from my business trip by doing something special for dinner.\n(Quite possibly there are other subtexts that I have yet to suss out!)So I ladle out two bowls of soup and set them on the kitchen table with a couple napkins and spoons, and a carton of blueberries.  Why the blueberries?  Because they are fresh and delicious and nutritious and need to be eaten before they spoil.  That\u2019s all \u2014 there is no hidden context to the blueberries.  They don\u2019t imply that hubby should watch his cholesterol, or signify my desire to move to a \u201cBlue State\u201d, or that I\u2019m protesting produce shipped halfway around the planet, or that I\u2019m proclaiming my emancipation from kitchen drudgery by keeping the dinner simple, or any number of weird plot devices, post-modern or otherwise. The blueberries are not a signifier of anything.(No, they don\u2019t even symbolise what I harvest from my rock-strewn field. You can assign all the meaning you want, but for me they\u2019re not literary devices, they\u2019re just a box of fruit.  When I use literary devices, it\u2019s pretty damn plain that they are literary devices.)How the hell do people figure these conversational subtext things out?  I have no clue.~~#~~Another one of those crazy bits are the distractors.  These are the things that people riddle their conversations with that especially drive me nuts.  They drive me nuts because the conversation is going wrong \u2014 way wrong \u2014 on several different levels.  Not only is it not literal, with subtexts mining the conversational field, but the distractors serve strange purposes that are contrary to productive conversation.  They are like roadblocks and detours.  Roadblocks and detours have no business out in the middle of our nicely tilled field, but there I am, trying to deal with them anyway.The dialogue begins sensibly, but then the other person throws in this wild piece of business:\u201cShe\u2019s going to be living in a place with no gas [heat] and nothing but Ramen to eat!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely. That\u2019s taken to extreme scenarios; it\u2019s just a straw man argument.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just talking about my feelings!\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not talking about \u2018feelings\u2019 at all \u2014 you haven\u2019t mention one emotion.\u201d\n\u201cYes I am \u2014 I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t have a decent place to live!\u201d\n\u201cThere: \u2018afraid\u2019.  That\u2019s the first feeling you\u2019ve mentioned so far.\u201d\n\u201cStop telling me what I\u2019m feeling\u2013\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not telling what you\u2019re feeling, or how you should feel. I\u2019m saying that\u2019s the first time you have mentioned a feeling.  The other things you\u2019ve been saying are just extreme scenarios, they\u2019re straw man arguments.  \u2018Talking about feelings\u2019 is actually mentioning the emotions you\u2019re feeling.\u201dThis isn\u2019t useful dialogue; it\u2019s just creating argumentative fallacies and wrapping them in the inviolate cloak of \u201cfeelings\u201d.  Because feelings are subjective and personal, they cannot be disputed.  But calling nonsense \u201cfeelings\u201d does not make it any less nonsensical, nor any less subject to rational discussion.  Asserting, \u201cThat\u2019s just how I feel about it,\u201d does not make absurd statements reasonable.So now instead of discussing living options and the likelihoods of specific scenarios actually happening, we are now having an argument about what we\u2019re arguing about, and why we\u2019re having an argument.  The actual purpose of opening the dialogue has been subverted from real problem-solving, to me trying to identify the distractors going on and calling-out statements that don\u2019t make sense to me, plus responding to a lot of emotionally-driven protests from the other person.We don\u2019t need to \u201cjustify\u201d how we feel about things; we feel whatever we feel, depending upon our views.  It\u2019s an absurd cycle to use circumstances and opinions to justify feelings, and then to use feelings to justify logical fallacies. This kind of situation, like all distractors, is really just a complex, maladaptive strategy to set up roadblocks, and detour the useful intent of the dialogue.Well, they interfere with my purposes for dialogue, which are the exchange of information, and the subsequent identification of problems, and the creation of proposals and resolutions for problems.  Obviously I\u2019m not playing the conversational game the \u201cright\u201d way.All of these things, the subtexts and the distractors, probably serve some internal functions for the people who use them, but they certainly don\u2019t help me.  Instead, they cloud actual problems with murky interpersonal \u201cissues\u201d, most of which are neither necessary nor functional.

In this regard, it\u2019s meant to be a browsing aid. Using the More button also allows readers to automatically see the comments posted at the end of the posts.

I use the medium of blogging because I find it an easier medium for communication, and because it can be more accessible. Kindly let me know if there\u2019s something I can do to make it more accessible. Blogging is indeed an ego-driven phenomenon, and that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s narcissistic, but that people want to express thoughts about things that are important in their lives.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t27 July 2007", "body": "I always thought it would be cool to have a superpower. You know, be able to fly, be invisible, walk through walls, be utterly graceful \u2026 impossible things like those.Turns out I have a bit of a superpower after all. Took me long enough to figure that out, though. As a child, I figured it would be pretty damn obvious to me that I could do something that other people couldn\u2019t, right? Well, it would be if I could fly or turn invisible. Those things are apparent, so to speak.Instead, I find that I can hear all kinds of obnoxious noises that most people cannot hear. The hell of it is, it\u2019s a lousy superpower.First of all, it\u2019s hard tell you have it. I know, you don\u2019t believe me. \u201cWhat,\u201d you ask, \u201cis so hard about that? You hear things, other people don\u2019t, they\u2019re amazed. Instant fame, right?\u201dFame isn\u2019t quite the word for it. I hear things, sure. I hear all sorts of annoying high-frequency shit, mostly electronic stuff. But for the fame scenario to happen, there\u2019s a fixed series of events that must first occur.Firstly, I must realise that I am hearing something that other people aren\u2019t. Most of the time I don\u2019t know what other people aren\u2019t hearing. High-frequency noises are background annoyances; they\u2019re not the sort of things that are important to the average person\u2019s \u00dcmwelt, their significant, subjective sensory world. (Probably because er, a lot of people can\u2019t hear them, at least not past youth.) Since they\u2019re not especially notable, the sounds are not common signifiers. People who can hear them don\u2019t have a functional use for such noises, and therefore don\u2019t mention them. I just assume that nearly everyone\u2019s hearing what I\u2019m hearing. It\u2019s not until I make mention of something, asking \u201cWhat the hell is that annoying noise?\u201d or noting with alarm, \u201cSomething is seriously wrong with your hard drive \u2014 it sounds \u2018sour\u2019,\u201d that we both realise that I\u2019m hearing things, and they aren\u2019t.Or rather, they think that I\u2019m \u201cjust hearing things\u201d. And there\u2019s the second failure point in the fixed series. Either they think that I\u2019m imagining noises because they can\u2019t hear them, or they think I\u2019m just being whiney because what\u2019s obnoxious to me is barely perceptible to them. The third failure point in the fixed series is that they have to value \u2014 or at least be impressed by \u2014 the \u201csuperpower\u201d. But no one is. I\u2019ve yet to do anything heroic with such an ability, aside from predicting the immanent demise of a computer that everyone knew was old and cranky anyway.These are not the grand moments of realised superpowers we script in our daydreams.Granted, there is something satisfying about announcing to a student, \u201cYour cell phone\u2019s ringing; weren\u2019t you supposed to keep that in your locker?\u201d Student of course denies having the device on their person. Student thinks they\u2019re being clever by having downloaded that \u201cmosquito ringtone\u201d that supposedly older people can\u2019t hear. I of course, can hear it, despite belonging to the demographic group that gets dubious thrills like annual mammograms.(If clicking on the mosquito ringtone link in the article to listen to the 17 kHz sample, then laptop users should first plug in some high-quality headphones because crappy laptop speakers don\u2019t go that high.)And it\u2019s only a little useful, inasmuch as I have SuperMomHearing above and beyond all such necessities, which neatly made for my (ex-)husband\u2019s hearing loss, but also which made for poor sleep. There\u2019s nothing like waking bolt upright because a cat is hacking, two stories down, at the other end of the house. (That\u2019s \u201chacking\u201d as in coughing up hairballs; we don\u2019t have LOLcats fixing motherboards or scripting code.)Not only can I hear all this stuff, but I\u2019m overly-sensitive to loud, sudden or high-pitched noises. When someone drops a glass in a restaurant, I nearly jump out of my seat. I keep earplugs in my purse to dampen overwhelming situations, and try to avoid being indoors when they test fire alarms at school.Can I sue my Fairy Godmother for malpractice? Most of the gifts are okay, but was it really necessary to give me the hyperacussis, or Muses that are such night-owls? I mean hell, I\u2019m exhausted, it\u2019s midnight, and then one\u2019s gotta grab me by the collar and pester me until I\u2019ve written out some long piece of poetry or prose. And although it\u2019s handy to be able to scratch my own back, the weird bendy tricks that come with hypermobility don\u2019t really make up for the creeping osteoarthritis. But that\u2019s a rant for another day \u2026(Speaking of Beings Fantastickal, I really need someone to come by and engage in some pest control, as we have a terrible infestation of Tea-Sucking F\u00e6ries. No sooner than I brew myself a nice cuppa then I turn my back to attend to a needy cat, or go riffling through a stack of papers or heap of books, and one of them flits by and has drained off a goodly portion, leaving me cold dregs.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t29 July 2007", "body": "I just got back from an \u201copen house\u201d hosted by my former uni.  Happened to get some nice insect photos along the way, which pleased me.  But I had an annoying experience talking to a researcher who\u2019d recently been made a full professor.  He told me about his students, and how they\u2019d graduated and gone off and gotten jobs.  I mentioned that over a year later, I was still looking for a job that reflected my post-graduate degree.  What, he asked me, hadn\u2019t I been applying for This job and That job?  Yes, I had, I replied.  Once again I had that bewildering sense, the vertigo of the psyche, where it seems like everyone else graduates and goes off to get gainful employment.He couldn\u2019t understand my dilemma.  There were jobs out there (obviously, if his graduate students had been getting them).  Unstated, but staining the tone of his questions, was the disdain of what was wrong with [me] that I couldn\u2019t get a job? I ended up feeling like an unemployable idiot.I\u2019m not of course \u2014 actually, I have three different jobs. Put them together, and I have something almost like a full-time job. I get excellent employee reviews on my jobs. But it\u2019s still patchwork employment at low pay.  Jobs are not a given, under any economic circumstances.  Sure his students got jobs \u2014 but for every person who does get the job for which they applied, there\u2019s a score or more of other people who didn\u2019t get that job. And despite my academic achievements (completed with great struggle against health issues), in the realm of employment I have \u201cfailed\u201d to succeed at the appropriate performance levels expected for someone of my social station.  I\u2019m bidding too low in the marketplace for citizenship.\u201cBeing included in society\u201d means that you are given full benefits of that membership. Being included in society also means that you are considered to be an autonomous and self-directed person.In contrast, someone who does not fulfill such requirements is not completely adult and independent \u2014 they are a minor in the quasi-legal sense, both dependent and diminished. To gain inclusion, one must somehow prove that they are \u201cworthy\u201d.  This sense of worthiness means that you have earned the respect of others.  You have proven that you can fit in socially, and behave in the ways that people expect you.  You can prove that you are responsible for doing those activities that are decreed by the society-at-large as being necessary to your station.If someone fails to complete or maintain these expectations, then the society will withdraw or withhold respect, and you will no longer be integrated.  Not being integrated ranges from being snubbed to being completely shunned.You will, in other words, have lost your personal rights to be a member of society.  As people are fond of reciting, \u201cRights equal responsibilities!\u201d  Well yes, they do.  We are all responsible for behaving appropriately and compassionately with one another. But in some situations the  word \u201cresponsibilities\u201d becomes twisted into meaning something different, into meaning attaining specific kinds of performance levels.For instance, if one tries to be independent, then others assume that you are signing yourself up for a completely unassisted r\u00f4le. To be independent means that one must be self-sufficient in all applicable realms (householding, acquiring work etc).  It\u2019s as if they\u2019re setting up this  performance bar, where you have promised to be able to do everything all by yourself to some arbitrary level of expertise.  If you cannot always maintain that level by yourself, then you have also accepted being dunned for failing.  Failing therefore means that you \u201cdeserve\u201d to lose your \u201cprivilege\u201d to participate in the social realm.\u201cWell, you made your bed, now lie in it!\u201d is the figure of speech one sometimes hears, which generally means, \u201cYou created the mess you\u2019re in, now you have to deal with it.\u201d  In cases like this, the figure of speech can also mean, \u201cWell, you should have known that you wouldn\u2019t be able to hack it.  If you can\u2019t, that\u2019s your problem.  Don\u2019t expect any help from me.\u201dBut who the hell is deciding these things?  It\u2019s often not conscious, but part of the empowered majority\u2019s view of what makes them competent, and therefore worthy of being in that majority.    People hang onto the skill requirements because they had to struggle to reach them, therefore everyone else must, too. Making life easier for anyone else would diminish their own hard efforts.Those who are members of society uphold these expectations of others, thus reinforcing the status quo. The value of a citizen is judged by how well they can perform up to standards, where someone in a particular social station is expected to be competent in all skill areas (educational, employment, domestic, the social realm, etc). Anyone who is not competent in such skills is of a lower social rank.  And as lower-ranked members of the society, they have less power.  As lower-ranked members of the society, they also receive less respect.To be respected, one must be \u201cresponsible\u201d by being able to perform at the requisite skill levels, and/or one must be deemed \u201cuseful\u201d.  Those with physical disabilities or cognitive dysfunctions are given special status if they can provide some exceptional skill or savant talent that makes up for their inabilities.  They\u2019ve been given the social contract, but one amended with a lot of asterisks leading to conditional statements.The general public is defined as everyone but the disabled or otherwise marginalised.  In contrast, the \u201clow-functioning\u201d disabled are the not-useful people, and the  \u201chigh-functioning\u201d disabled are marginally useful \u2014 tolerated, but see contract amendments *, **, and ***.We\u2019re expected to live up to standards that describe not just about how well we\u2019re supposed to be able to do something, but also how we do it.  Heaven forfend you achieve the same end results by going about things in some totally bizarre manner, or one that takes appreciably longer, or one where you accompany the task by performing strange little tics or rituals \u201cfor no reason at all\u201d.  \u201cNo reason at all\u201d means the normals don\u2019t understand why you do things that way because they don\u2019t do things that way, not that you don\u2019t have a reason for why you do things the way you do. If people can\u2019t imagine why you would act the way you do, they may erroneously attribute various motivations or faults to you, despite the lack of real evidence for such.Well I have a newsflash for the rest of society:Citizenship is a given, not something \u201cearned\u201d.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/29/buying-citizenship/", "title": "Buying Citizenship"},

I vote in elections, give blood, pay taxes, get my pets neutered-spayed-vaccinated, make charitable donations, pick up random bits of trash I find blowing around, and do those kinds of things that good citizens do. Although doing these things is sometimes overwhelming, and there are aspects that I must to differently to accomplish similar ends, there\u2019s nothing particularly amazing about the fact that \u201cspecial\u201d people like me have ordinary lives. Sure I have overcome a lot of hurdles. Most of those were not intrinsic to my particular disabilities \u2014 they were socially created, artificial handicaps. So please don\u2019t go congratulating me for having overcome the hurdles that you and others have put in my way.You also said that you could never do what I do for a job.  Thank you for realising that, and not trying to do what I do.  I have encountered plenty of people who also couldn\u2019t do what I do, but even if they realised it, they kept on trying, year after year.  They were indeed, very trying.I don\u2019t do this job because I have a Calling in the seminary sense, but because I enjoy it, because I have an aptitude for it, and because I have a passion for social justice.  I do not personally feel that I ended up in these jobs because some deity deemed it necessary.  But regardless of what kind of pretty little fiction you have painted in your imagination, I have not undertaken a Holy Calling, nor have I taken a vow of poverty.  I have a graduate degree and for some silly reason would actually like to earn something reflecting that, rather than the $11/hr I currently earn.  A newspaper editor with whom I worked once commented that the socially important jobs never paid well, and I have seen little to refute that assertion.  On the other hand, history is not destiny; if you think that people like me are doing God\u2019s Important Work, then for God\u2019s sake and ours, help us earn a living wage!Please don\u2019t feel the need to regale me with your earnest-but-clueless story about how your sister\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s son was \u201ccured\u201d of \u201cA\u201d by doing \u201cX\u201d and \u201cY\u201d and giving him \u201cZ\u201d.  If everyone with \u201cA\u201d really could be \u201ccured\u201d, the whole world would know about it and would be using it, and I wouldn\u2019t be working with all those \u201cA\u201d kids, now would I?By the way, \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d are not caused by bad parenting, food dyes, video games, or other horrors of the modern age.  The reason that you didn\u2019t have fellow students in your classrooms diagnosed with \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d when you were a kid, was because \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d didn\u2019t even exist as diagnoses, and \u201cA\u201d was frequently misdiagnosed or just not recognised.  Some of those \u201cA\u201d kids weren\u2019t allowed to go to school, and the rest of the \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d kids just struggled along, including me.  Remember, back then our science textbooks also didn\u2019t have the all the moons and planetoids that we know about nowadays, but that doesn\u2019t mean that those celestial bodies weren\u2019t orbiting the sun, just outside of our scanning range. Likewise, what we used to call the Brontosaurus actually turned out to be the Apatosaurus.  (If you don\u2019t believe me, go find some Aspie kid whose special interest is astronomy or dinosaurs, and I\u2019m sure they will tell you all about it.) The same kinds of things are true about diagnoses.When you say that you are \u201cinspired\u201d I feel uncomfortable.  I don\u2019t want to be put upon some teetery pedestal to be gawked at and talked about, rather than talked with. That\u2019s objectifying.  It makes me something exotic and not-quite-human, a kind of angel that will be re-cast as a kind of devil at the first sign of failure.Nor do I want to be some kind of free, walking textbook about my disabilities, available 24/7.  I will be glad to discuss things with you on occasion, but they will always be from my perspective.  Just because you have met one person with \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d or \u201cC\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that every other person with \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d or \u201cC\u201d will be just like them. That\u2019s partly because you are actually meeting AB1, AC2+, and BDFQ people. In real life, real people don\u2019t fit into neat little categories. I also cannot tell you for absolutely sure why your sister\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s son does this or that, or what the guaranteed solution is to the difficulties he faces.  Rather, I would suggest that you ask him.I don\u2019t know how to break this to you, so I\u2019ll be blunt:  people were yanking you around when they appealed to your heart and pocketbook by staging telethons and other pity-party fundraisers.  When they lay on all that pity, they put alienation and fear and distance between everyone. Sending money to charities doesn\u2019t create a good luck charm that will keep the weirdos away, so you don\u2019t have to deal with your discomfort. Those charity people taught you the wrong things. Having a disability isn\u2019t horrible.  Facing attitudes like those, and having to deal with handicapping social systems is what\u2019s terrible.If you really want to be inspired, then get to know me as a real person. I\u2019m sure that eventually you will find something about my life that you find inspirational.  But you know what?  That\u2019s true for most anyone you get to know.

These Acts, Bills and Executive Orders keep piling up.  It reminds me of the scene in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix when Professor Dolores Umbridge took over as Head Master, and the walls of Hogwarts were being smothered in edicts.  The latest item is just one in many, which creates a more than uncomfortable trend.  It\u2019s now a disturbing reality.  Let\u2019s see, now we have:Be able to sieze the property of anyone who is deemed to \u201chave committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing\u201d actions that will block the \u201cstabilization\u201d of efforts in Iraq. The recent Executive Order notes that there need be no warning for such:Sec. 5.  For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets  instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual.  I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and expanded in Executive Order 13315, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this order.Er, does that apply to protesting the war?  Probably, if George W. Bush wants it to.  The Patriot Act was all about enlarging the government\u2019s ability to act against anyone, steamrollering over previously-established civil rights.  Even amendments to the Act in reaction to those damages are watered down or ignored.The current US President has shown a consistent disregard for believing that laws apply to him or his cronies. He has repeated added \u201csigning statements\u201d to the bills he signs, more so than any other president, indicating his prerogative on bills. Boston Globe reporter Charlie Savage offers the following examples:When reauthorizing the Patriot Act last year, \u201c\u2026Bush said that he did not consider himself bound to tell Congress how the Patriot Act powers were being used and that, despite the law\u2019s requirements, he could withhold the information \u2026\u201d\nAfter The New York Times disclosed in December that Bush had authorized the military to conduct electronic surveillance of Americans\u2019 international phone calls and e-mails without obtaining warrants, as required by law, Bush said his wartime powers gave him the right to ignore the warrant law.\nAnd when Congress passed a law forbidding the torture of any detainee in US custody, Bush signed the bill but issued a signing statement declaring that he could bypass the law if he believed using harsh interrogation techniques was necessary to protect national security.Oh yes, it\u2019s that old \u201cprotect national security\u201d mantra.  Keep repeating it and those pesky citizens will clam up and quit complaining.  One way or another.But boy, when that national security emergency happens, the president must be able to take control of everything!Be able to declare a state of national emergency for any reason to take control. The National Security Presidential Directive/ NSPD 51 & Homeland Security Presidential Directive/ HSPD-20 gives the president the ability to declare a state of national emergency for any reason,(1)(b)  \u201cCatastrophic Emergency\u201d means any incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions;without needing any previous warnings or public awareness of such:(4)  Continuity requirements shall be incorporated into daily operations of all executive departments and agencies.  As a result of the asymmetric threat environment, adequate warning of potential emergencies that could pose a significant risk to the homeland might not be available, and therefore all continuity planning shall be based on the assumption that no such warning will be received.Of course, it\u2019s the President who gets the power to run things,(6)  The President shall lead the activities of the Federal Government for ensuring constitutional government.and to decide what constitutes a state of national emergency:(12)  In order to provide a coordinated response to escalating threat levels or actual emergencies, the Continuity of Government Readiness Conditions (COGCON) system establishes executive branch continuity program readiness levels, focusing   on possible threats to the National Capital Region.  The President will determine and issue the COGCON Level.Naturally, if something happens to President Bush, then Vice-President Dick Cheney will be in control:20)  This directive shall be implemented in a manner that is consistent with, and facilitates effective implementation of, provisions of the Constitution concerning succession to the Presidency or the exercise of its powers, and the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (3 U.S.C. 19), with consultation of the Vice President and, as appropriate, others involved.  Heads of executive departments and agencies shall ensure that appropriate   support is available to the Vice President and others involved as necessary to be prepared at all times to implement those provisions.Isn\u2019t that comforting.Don\u2019t worry, during that time of martial law we\u2019ll have lots of camps to concentrate the hundreds or thousands of dangerous people threatening our country.Build detention camps.  VP Cheney\u2019s old company, Halliburton, got the $385 million contract.  Somehow they were the only company bidding.  (Oh who cares if they\u2019re prone to overcharging?) Ostensibly the detention centers are for aliens, but that handy disaster scenario is mentioned again, too.\u201cKBR would build the centers for the Homeland Security Department for an unexpected influx of immigrants, to house people in the event of a natural disaster or for new programs that require additional detention space, company executives said.\u201dActually, we already have rather nasty concentration camps in our country.  (That is, we have them again \u2014 during World War II, Japanese-Americans were held in such.)  The T. Don Hutto detention facility in Taylor, Texas keeps children and families in prison conditions. A report by the American Civil Liberties Union states,\u201cAt the time of the ACLU\u2019s initial court filings, child detainees had to wear prison garb. They received one hour of recreation per day and opportunities to spend this hour outdoors were very rare. Children were detained in small cells for about 11 or 12 hours each day, and were prohibited from keeping food and toys in these cells, which lack any privacy. Although some of these conditions have improved slightly, they are still far from adequate.\nIn addition, access to adequate medical, dental, and mental health treatment is severely limited and, as a result, many children suffer from chronic ailments that worsen as they are left undiagnosed and untreated. Children are not afforded meaningful educational opportunities. Guards frequently discipline the children by threatening to separate them from their families.\u201d\nThanks to the Department of Homeland Security, our country is  safe from the dangers of small, under-educated children.But these things just quietly slide under the news radar. Instead, we get distractors to divert our attention from matters of real importance. Why else would the news be full of fluff stories about celebrities who are famous for merely being famous, rather than about ways to reduce carbon footprints, reductions in civil rights, lack of health care, or other critical concerns?Distraction is only part of it.  Not only is important to have a populace that is content with its bread and circuses,  but one that only knows what it ought to know, including how to be good drones and consumers.  Our future citizenry won\u2019t be well-informed because the whole NCLB focus is upon \u201ceducating\u201d students by way of training them to parrot back the desired standardized test answer, rather than understand how to think independently and critically. How can we create an informed and effective future citizenry unless they can  create original and clear writing? How can we create an informed and effective future citizenry unless they can calculate budgets and understand the perils of debt loads?How can we create an informed and effective future citizenry unless they can understand the process and concepts of science that explain and create our world.  Science is all about imaginative enquiry, testing, critical thinking, and pushing the boundaries of knowledge.  No wonder that science as a subject, and science teachers and scientists are under attack by conservative groups who feel their closed world-views are  under attack.  Letting people think for themselves is dangerous, because they might question our great leaders.  Obviously our elected (?) leaders find science threatening, as they stifle or water-down the messages of scientists, whether they are disseminating news about public health issues, world environment issues, or even how the universe came about. It\u2019s dangerous for the citizens to know about or to believe ideas contrary to the administration\u2019s beliefs.Having an informed, thinking citizenry has always necessary to a functional democracy. But nowadays, instead of teaching subjects, teachers are being pressured to train students how to pass standardized tests.  Good teachers are retiring and quitting in droves, and the collective school administrations end up selecting for those who can work under such a mindless system. Sure, we want good schools \u2014 but the NCLB and its testing regimens are really just more distractors.Freedom and security must be balanced, and when governments start selling more and more national security, this means that they are denying their citizens have fewer and fewer individual freedoms.\u201cNaturally the common people don\u2019t want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.\u201d\n~ Hermann Goering~~#~~I have added a new piece to my blog sidebar, the quote box.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t31 July 2007", "body": "Stuck. Off. Transfixed.  Whatever you want to call it.My attention was unexpectedly snagged by sight of something on the kitchen side table.  The red cap to a Sharpie, a permanent marker with a pale ash grey barrel.  Next to it  was a black-capped Sharpie.It was as though I was see RED for the first time again.  Bright, cherry red, a fascinating color that reverberated up and down my consciousness.  Red as a primary hue.  Red as a color with the name, \u201cred\u201d.  Red as a sweet brightness against the grey, see how it glowed.  Red as a brilliancy against the shiny darkness of black.  Flick back to seeing red again, just as itself.  Looking at it more closely, even though I\u2019d not moved a bit, being swallowed up in the sleek ultra-cherry-red landscape of a fat Sharpie cap.Remembering other similarly red things.  A Twixt game with an ash-grey board, and bright red pieces and shiny black pieces.  Being caught up in the patterns of game pieces, the red ones together, the formations of the black ones, how the reds and blacks interacted, how they appeared en masse against the board.  How the board leapt forwards from the mixed background of the pieces. A single red piece, now one connected to its neighbors, then all the red ones again, and so one.  Patterns emerging and flickering and shifting and comparing and contrasting.  Lovely.  Fascinating.  Appreciating patterns just for their own abstract web-like qualities, then seeing them as strategems, and back again to artforms.Other red experiences crowd back to memory. Slick new red Corvette parked across the street, all smooth curves that begged to have wax buffed on.  A fresh gumball (never a perfect sphere, to my dismay).  Some little girl\u2019s red patent-leather Mary Jane shoes, perfectly matched to a summer dress with a shiny red satin sash, and little faux cherries sewn onto the collar.Button racks at the fabric store.  Oh, now there\u2019s a great stimmy place, card after card of shiny things, lots of different colors and shapes and textures, all begging to have you pay attention to them.  All pegged up on racks, inviting you to just stand there and admire them, one after the other.  So few places in the world encourage such utter rapt fascination.Buttons are fabulous things \u2026 Grandma had a tin full of buttons, gleaned from years of leftovers from making clothes, or rescued from garments before they hit the rag bag. I spend hours sorting buttons.  Sorting them by size.  Sorting them by color.  Sorting them by plain or fancy.  Sorting them by shape.  Counting the various categories. Spreading categories out into mosaics. Myriads of buttons. Periodic tables of buttons. Armies of buttons lined up in marching battalions.  Taxonomies of buttons. Pyramidal arrays of buttons cross-referenced by three qualities. (You want systemetizing Dr B-C, we have it all sewn up!)I recollect where I am now.  Standing in the kitchen, staring at pen caps.  Has it been a few seconds, or a couple minutes, I know not.  The red is lovely.  It\u2019s a joy to get lost in something like that.  There never seems to be enough time any more.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sharpie.com/enUS/Product/Sharpie_Super_Permanent_Marker.html", "http://www.brettspillguiden.no/kritikker/index.php?gid=226&kommentar=true"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/07/31/stuck/", "title": "Snagged"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 November 2006", "body": "\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Survey question: Ever been absolutely bored to tears in a class?Of course you have! We get bored from things that are too easy, that seem too irrelevant, or that are so familiar and routine that they fail to hold our attention (especially those of us for whom attention is a slippery thing to begin with).A little novelty can be a wonderful thing in teaching. It can catch and retain students\u2019 attention to present them with new material. It can invigorate familiar subjects with new perspectives. Used judiciously, it can raise the challenge to a manageable level that makes students reach to stretch their boundaries, without being so high they run the risk of complete failure.Novelty can affect educational difficulties in different ways. Educational difficulties are frequently described as \u201clearning difficulties\u201d, although not all of them are expressed in \u201clearning\u201d, the acquisition and integration of new knowledge. Rather, educational difficulties can result from mismatches in teaching methods or in environmental factors. When we run into environments with high levels of novelty, we can run into educational difficulties. Take for example, field trips \u2026Field trips are chock-full of novelty! New places, new things to see, perhaps to handle, smell and taste, and hopefully new things to do as well. Novelty can help a person more consistently retain attention, especially those people who have problems with varying levels of attention. Please note that \u201cmore consistent attention\u201d does not necessarily mean that your AD/HD or autistic student will be \u201cbetter behaved\u201d on a field trip!This is because attention-switching can be more difficult when the novel thing has become a sudden, fascinating, all-absorbing interest. Thus, one has to \u201cdrag away\u201d a girl from an exhibit on steam engines. Or, the novelty can be so overwhelming that the student hardly knows where to turn \u2013 everything in the Hall of Egypt is fascinating! This is the student that won\u2019t dutifully follow the troop from one exhibit to the next in a quiet and linear manner. Instead, he is bouncing all over the place, \u201cHey, look at this cat wearing an earring! Wow, a real sarcophagus!\u201d His attention is on the exhibit, but nearly all of it all at once. Either way, the teacher leading these \u201cpoky little puppies\u201d or \u201cbouncing kangaroos\u201d despairs of keeping the class together, either in the literal sense or in the pedagogical sense when delivering explanations about the materials. (And that, O Best Beloved, is why teachers are always drafting additional adults to be chaperones.)On the other hand, novel environments, or even familiar environments with highly novel activities, can be problematic for students whose coping strategies are dependent upon having a particular enabling environment, or dependent upon having particular way of approaching and processing work in different ways, either physically or cognitively. This can happen even if the concepts and methods being used are familiar. Sometimes (with strokes, other kinds of brain damage, pharmaceutical side effects, auditory or visual processing difficulties, or autism) students simply have certain processes that they won\u2019t be able to access consistently, but those kinds of events will also happen when nothing has outwardly changed, which indicates that the difficulty is interior to the person.But sometimes there is something so profoundly new in the system that it \u201cthrows a spanner into the works\u201d. The mental gears come to a halt. Outwardly, it appears that the student is either being noncompliant, or else has forgotten what they learned earlier. But in the case of excessive novelty, no amount of cajoling, rebuking or of punishments & rewards is going to \u201cmake\u201d the student comply.In situations where the student gets profoundly stuck or shuts down, it helps to remember that everyone is an organism within an environmental system. Is there something different in the environment since the task was last accomplished? Is there something different in the methods being used? Is the instructor using a very different approach or verbiage? In cases like this, we want to go back and re-establish the previous situational parameters, and reinforce the abilities gained before. This may have to be done on another day; sometimes \u201cstuckness\u201d can be sticky for hours.Having achieved the skill again, practice it with a single minor change. During the practices, modify the change in small increments, and do not try to introduce multiple changes. Don\u2019t expect to make very many changes at once, either. Doing something differently three times may not be enough to cement it in, and when assaying the task again, it may take a few more tries to get things down thoroughly with all the new changes.\u00a0In situations like this, the difficulty can also be with generalising, or being able to apply familiar skills in unfamiliar situations. This isn\u2019t the same problem of being unable to access the skills, but rather, of recognising that this new situation requires that particular set of skills.Lest these problems seem absurd, and related only to students with cognitive disabilities, then think back to when you got an entirely new version of your computer\u2019s operating system, or when you changed from one word-processing program to another. It\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t know how to use the \u201cfile cabinet\u201d in Windows 3.1, or how to save files in WordStar, but rather that lurching into Windows 1996 or WordPerfect, and then later on lurching into Windows 2000 or Word, has changed all of your familiar cues and ways of doing things. You may have had the skills, but now you\u2019re looking for the old things in new places, or using slightly different commands or names for things. Or if you\u2019re a newbie to the world of computers, then think back to your second car, and having to switch on the windshield wipers or headlights with different controls, and of not having the radio buttons working in familiar ways. Somehow, even though it\u2019s the same old thing you\u2019ve been using competantly for a long time, it\u2019s also all new, and every single task is fraught with a dozen little glitches to trap you. Or if you\u2019ve traveled to other countries, consider the first time you stepped into a market and couldn\u2019t automatically identify the packaged goods. The brands, label configurations, aisle locations, even what shapes of containers your items would be packaged in, are all different. It makes the head spin.Such are the effects of excessive novelty: too much invigoration or too many inputs to sort. Think of it as \u201ceducational jetlag\u201d.P.S.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t6 November 2006", "body": "\u201cThird Rock from the Sun\u201d television show:\nOne of the human characters, Mary, was explaining to Dick (one of the aliens trying to impersonate humans), her reservations regarding dating him. Mary:  \u201cIt\u2019s as if you were out of sync with every other person on this planet!\u201d\nDick:  \u201cWhat do you mean?  Every day I go out of my way to do things that appear normal!\u201dThere\u2019s a lot of attention placed upon trying to make people with various differences appear to be \u201cnormal\u201d, everything from in-the-ear hearing aids (that often are not as useful as behind-the-ear aids), to prostheses, to training autistics to mimic NT social behaviour. Not all of these are bad things necessarily. Given the current popularity of going around wearing a Bluetooth mobile phone on one\u2019s ear like some kind of of cyborg, I can see hearing aids turning into equally high-tech decorative bits.Unfortunately, emulation works against the overall health of the autistic, for a number of reasons.Emulation is not a viable goal because it creates additional stress.\n\nSpending extra energy to appear normal is stressful. Spending time trying to make eye contact and worrying if it is being done enough, and suppressing little mannerisms or tics adds to the work load of existing. Spending mental energy attending to these things means having less to devote to other activities, such as decoding speech or organizing and monitoring the visual environment.Even if depression has a partly genetic basis, extra environmental stress worsens that.Emulation is not a viable goal because even if the social rituals like eye-contact are performed, that does not mean the autistic will gain the same information from the activity.Whether or not emotional perception on the part of the autistic is due to less eye contact and facial observation or vice versa, may be a chicken and egg question that will doubtless take more neurophysiological study to unravel. However, the result is the same, because even if the autistic attends to facial observation, that does not necessarily mean the same information will be perceived.Emulation is not a viable goal because an impaired ability to do so results in ostracism from the community.If it isn\u2019t done well all the time, people feel fooled. Trying to normalize me or make me \u201cindistinguishable from my peers\u201d isn\u2019t going to work. I don\u2019t do it well. My little weirdnesses aren\u2019t that noticeable at first, but they pile up like snowflakes obscuring the scenery. Then people get annoyed at me because they feel betrayed and fooled, thinking I was a one-of-them normal person.Emulation is not a viable goal because it devalues the inherent qualities of the person.Lack of acceptance for who or what one truly is leads to additional stress, depression, increases and/or aggravates the types of stress-related health problems. Lack of acceptance for who or what one truly is leads to increased self-esteem problems and increases the difficulties in social interaction.\n\nMy recommendation: Quit trying to forcibly mold autistic children (and adults) to emulate neurotypical behaviors. Focus instead upon working with the person rather than against them. Work with their skills and aptitudes, work upon stress-reduction techniques, and work on methods for interacting with others that are natural for both the autistic and neurotypical people. Work beyond denial or tolerance toward acceptance and appreciation of diversity in schools, work places, medical care settings, and other arenas of social interaction.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/11/06/the-perils-of-passing/", "title": "The Perils of\u00a0Passing"},

But once you understand how a system works, you can rely upon it to be predictable.But sometimes the hardware is crappy, and sometimes the software is crappy, and sometimes it\u2019s the \u201cwet-ware\u201d (me) that\u2019s introducing errors, and when things get bad, it\u2019s all of those.\u00a0 And then I spend literally hours trying to get the simplest of tasks done.\u00a0 Even ordinary things, like \u2026 getting messages.1.I have voice-mail messages to listen to during my brief lunch not-hour.\u00a0 I\u2019m sitting in a desk by the window, hoping that the signal doesn\u2019t break up due to Invisible Wireless Velociraptors or whatever the hell makes the signal erratic from one minute to the next.The first time around I miss half the message because I\u2019m having trouble punching the mobile button and then getting it back to my ear quick enough to catch the beginning of the message.The second time I dial back into my voice-mail, all I can understand is that there\u2019s an Important Message from someone.The third time around all I can understand is that someone whose name sounds like \u201cSpencer Wallace\u201d is calling me, and then two people in the room begin chatting and Mr Wallace\u2019s message gets blenderized with their words.I clap the phone shut in annoyance and go outside to redial my voice-mail a fourth time, and finally hear enough to realise that this is (A) a recorded message and (B) punching \u201c1\u201d will connect me to a live body \u2026 hopefully.(Granted I have a lot of trouble understanding voice-mail messages because of my auditory processing problems, but you would think that a major mobile phone company could at least make sure their automated recordings were clearer.)Yes, it\u2019s a live body!\u00a0 She informs me that No, it\u2019s not Spencer Wallace, but Sprint Wireless. Damn, Live Body is mumbly or has an accent or is required to stick to scripts that aren\u2019t helpful for me right now.\u00a0 Rather than spend the rest of my break time trying to muddle out the situation, I thank her and return inside to bolt down the rest of my lunch before it gets disgustingly congealed. (The sad part is that microwaved fries/chips with leftover chile and cheese is the best lunch I\u2019ve had all week.)In addition to needing clearer messages, getting phone service inside of the school buildings where I work would also be a good thing \u2014 on one campus, I have to leave the building and walk across the open-air plaza and try facing cardinal directions in hopes of securing a signal.\u00a0 Sometimes I have to pull up the antenna, hold the phone up to the sky, and stroll halfway to the next building to get signal.\u00a0 Mind you, I am at a college in a heavily-populated area, not the intersection of Cornfield and Bob\u2019s Road in the hinterlands.\u00a0 [Name that movie reference!]2.Another voice mail was from the department secretary.\u00a0 Plus, apparently I missed some e-mails from her as well.\u00a0 Oh heavens, that\u2019s right \u2014 I have a staff e-mail account in addition to the other e-mail account I use at the college. I had totally forgotten about getting the password set up a couple of weeks ago, because I was starting two jobs at the same time and both jobs required lots of paperwork and setting up user ID\u2019s and passwords for various and sundry programs.Yes, I have two e-mail accounts provided by the college.\u00a0 Not just two e-mail addresses, but two separate systems that run on two different programs.\u00a0 The secretary kindly reminds me of the URL to access my other account program.Unfortunately, that is just the sign-in page for the second account.\u00a0 It runs on Microsoft Outlook, and there are no helpful user links to click for \u201cI forgot my password\u201d.\u00a0 (Insert Mac user\u2019s rant about Microsoftware.)\u00a0 An hour later, I have finally noodled through enough of the college\u2019s Web site to have found where to set/re-set my password (and received no less than five unwanted pdf\u2019s that automatically downloaded after clicking on an internal search-engine result).\u00a0 Finally I can go back to that sign-in page.Polysyllabic Expletive!I have 21,059 e-mails.I shit thee not; apparently the account was set up for me back in September of 2003. I had no idea it was there. I assumed that my other account was \u201cthe\u201d account, because that was the address that all of the links and documents contained.Obviously any e-mails before this year can be deleted.\u00a0 There are so many because 99.9% of them seem to be list-serve messages sent to everyone at the college.But Techies, GET A CLUE: it would be a good idea to set up a small routine to flag when you have users who have more than a couple hundred unread e-mails AND who have never sent any e-mails, so you can send them an alert by some means other than their e-mail account.Crap, do I have some housekeeping to do. I have to read through the past month\u2019s e-mails to make sure I\u2019m not missing anything critical.\u00a0 Anything else that\u2019s critical, because I already missed something.Then I have to figure out how to set one of the college\u2019s e-mail systems to automatically forward to the other system.Of course, that\u2019s in addition to other little things this weekend, like teaching my Saturday class, writing the next three exams, figuring out how to use the grade-keeping program, grading the last two exams, and entering the two-week-point attendance (which information the secretary needs to drop anyone who hasn\u2019t shown up).3.Now that I\u2019m at home, I also have to listen to the household voice-mails on the land line.Oh, and I ALSO need to slog through setting up my voice-mail account with the college as well!\nVoice-mails on my mobile.\nVoice mails at the house.\nVoice mails at the college.\nE-mails at home.\nE-mails at the school.\nE-mails at the college.\nThe other e-mails at the college.\nThe e-mails within class-access program  for the two classes I teach (Blackboard, which has its own special set of glitches).\nMy inner child is now whining, \u201cDo I gotta?\u201dI could just cry.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t4 September 2006 ", "body": "It\u2019s too easy for blogging to end up as nothing more than a series of rants, so here\u2019s something positive.It\u2019s that time of year when millions of people (leastwise, those in the northern hemisphere) are starting new school years. As someone who tutors (other) students with ADD and learning disabilities, I thought I\u2019d share a bevy of helpful ideas I\u2019ve scraped together over the years.GETTING READY TO READPut the material into the Big Picture.  Before starting a chapter/ module/ unit, review your syllabus to see how the content of this one fits within the logical flow of the previous unit, and how it might be important to the next unit. This helps the material make more sense and seem less like a giant pile of loose facts.\n\nRead the textbook backwards.  Start with the Summary in the back of the chapter; this is the \u201cTV Guide\u201d version to what the chapter is about, so you know what you\u2019re heading into before you dive into all the excruciating details. Read over the new terms in the Glossary, so when you encounter them in the text you won\u2019t have those unintelligible speed-bumps that interrupt your understanding of the reading.This is helpful if this subject is entirely new to you and you have little or no background in the concepts and terminology of this particular field of study.From the first day of class, create a personal glossary of new terms and their definitions.  This is imperative if you are starting a new field of study because you will soon find yourself in possession of a swarm of new words for which you are responsible. Trying to look up a word for its definition by flipping through masses of notes, handouts and textbooks only slows you down and makes you frustrated. Staring into space, pacing, rocking or banging your head do not aid in remembering new terms, so having that personal glossary will give you a ready list to access. Don\u2019t forget to add helpful tips to your definitions, such as cautions about similar-sounding words that you might confuse, or terms with complementary or opposite meanings.This is especially helpful if you are slow at recalling words, or have difficulties with spelling.Block off distracting printed material with a mask. Use a half sheet of thin cardboard, a 3/4 sheet cut into an \u201cL\u201d shape, or two blank index cards to mask off distracting graphics, or simply to block off everything but the single question, objective, or paragraph you need to focus upon.This is helpful if you are someone who is easily distracted by fascinating pictures, or if you have reading difficulties.TAME THE PAPER TIGERAssign a particular color to each class.  I like to have the binder match the textbook color, so when I\u2019m getting things together for class I only have to grab \u201ctwo red things\u201d. After the test, keep the notes and handouts in the colored binder or manilla folder. Use that color of ink to mark due dates for assignments and test dates on your calendar. Use that color of manilla or pocket folder to keep all the stray bits of useful stuff you are collecting for a report/project \u2013 having that special \u201cparking place\u201d will help organize and reduce the \u201cfile by pile\u201d mess on your desk, floor, table, window ledge and other random surfaces\u2026Buy a hole punch with a trap. The trap collects all the \u201cdots\u201d so they don\u2019t litter the floor. A 3- or 4-hole punch (depending on whether you use 8.5\u2033 x 11\u2033 or A4 paper) is vastly easier than a single-hole punch, as it not only reduces the number of clenches you have to perform, but also because it makes hole spacing that is perfectly even for the binder. Hole-punch all of your handouts and put them into the binder with your notes, so the two can live in wedded bliss.Buy several packages of index dividers so you can separate the different chapters/units in your binder and more quickly flip through them for studying.Make liberal use of colored sticky-notes. These are the greatest invention since the microwave oven! They will save tremendous amounts of time from having to endlessly flip through textbook, lab manual, handout, and note pages to track down important information.Use colored sticky-notes to mark where important graphs, lists, charts, and diagrams are located in the textbook \u2013 write a key word on the external, flagging end of the sticky.Use different colors of sticky-note for different chapters/modules/units, to make studying easier when you have tests that come after you have begun the next chapter/module/unit.Use sticky-notes to mark chapter sections for those classes that skip around a lot within a textbook. If you are only using section 3.2 of a chapter, then you may begin by reading the summary for just section 3.2 of that chapter, but it might also be helpful to briefly review what the rest of the chapter summary has to say, to understand how the ideas in this section are connected to other ideas.NOTABLE TIPS FOR NOTE-TAKING & STUDYINGAlways take notes in black ink.  There is nothing more horrifying during Midterm or Final Exams than discovering that a semester\u2019s worth of pencil-written lecture notes has turned into a smeary, unreadable mess. Oh, the horror\u2026 Also, some kinds of blue ink are close to \u201cnon-photo / non-repro\u201d blue, a color that\u2019s nearly invisible to many photocopiers; this is usually not a problem unless you need to photocopy those notes for any reason.Always date and/or number your note pages.  Of course, if you live a charmed life and never have sudden \u201cgravity fluctuations\u201d in your part of the planet that cause you to drop or spill note papers, or you never own binders that lose their \u201cbite\u201d, then don\u2019t bother. Otherwise, dating the pages lets you keep track of what was lectured on at a particular time (handy if someone asks to borrow your notes from last Tuesday). If you take more than one page of notes per day (which is nearly always) then numbering the pages instead of or in addition to dating them makes it even easier to put spilled pages back to rights.\n\nTitle each page.  Even if it\u2019s just by abbreviation, describe the page of notes by the lecture topic, the unit or chapter title. This not only makes it easier to find the right notes when studying for tests, but it also helps you remember what the overall pattern of ideas is during the course of the class across the semester.\nExample:\nMITOSIS        WED   2 FEB          p.1Take notes in two columns: the left side for listing the main idea titles, important names, terms, dates or formulae, and the right side for all the regular details and sentences.  If there is a page in your textbook, lab manual or whatever that has a particular graph, chart or listing, write down that page number on the left side as well, as well as a word or two to title why that page number is important. This speeds up your test studying because you can glance through pages of notes to find the one that has the specific information you\u2019re looking for.Use the Objectives listed in the chapter/unit/module as your study guide for the test, and write out a full answer to each one as though it were a question. Pay attention to key verbs such as Describe, Compare, List, Define or Identify \u2013 these can give you an idea of what kind of test question could be asked. Writing these out does two things: it not only helps you self-test your own understanding before you get to the class test, but it also changes your answers from something you have to invent during the test (which is time-consuming) into something you just have to recall during the test (which is much quicker and easier).Writing out answers to the objectives in full sentences is especially helpful if English is not your first language, and/or if you are slow at remembering words,and/or otherwise have difficulty expressing the knowledge that\u2019s stuck in your head.\n\nDECIMATED BY NUMBERSTurn lined paper sideways to have ready-made columns for keeping your place-values straight in big arithmetic calculations. Another option is to use green \u201cengineer\u2019s paper\u201d that has graph squares on one side and is blank on the other side, but the graph grid is still somewhat visible on the blank side, and the green tint is more restful on the eyes.This is especially helpful if your handwriting tends to wander around or slope down a page, and will keep your numbers and decimals in order.If you are doing mathematical equations or other things that are processes, write out your own set of numbered directions describing how to do the process.  For instance, it may not be as obvious to you as it was to the author of the formula that you need to determine the value of \u201cC\u201d before you put the other values into the formula. So in your own directions, you should note \u201cFind the value for \u201cC\u201d by ~ ~ ~\u201d as one of the earlier steps.\nWhenever you solve an equation or do a statistical analysis, write out in a complete sentence what the answer to the calculations MEANS in regards to the original problem/story/question given.These are especially helpful if you are more of a \u201cwords\u201d person than a \u201cnumbers\u201d person.If you have several different formulae , make yourself a flow-chart (meaning, a series of decisions) that helps you figure out which one you use for different kinds of circumstances. When you are studying a chapter or doing that day\u2019s homework, it\u2019s obvious which one you need to use \u2013 it\u2019s the one you\u2019re learning that day! But come test time, you will need to be able to understand which one you use for each kind of situation.This is especially helpful if you are one of those people for whom \u201call the formulae look the same\u201d. Use name and address labels on everything, and add your phone number or email as well. Put them on your textbooks, lab manuals, various notebooks, calculator, data CD, flash/keychain drive, assorted binders, notepads, calendar-organizer, each piece of art & drafting equipment plus the carrying case, and all the other things that you need to survive as a student, to help guarantee that the person who finds them can help get them back home to you.\n\nThis is especially helpful if you are forgetful, distractible, prone to leaving things in various places, and/or are juggling a variety of classes and jobs.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t1 October 2006 ", "body": "\u201c \u2018Four on the floor\u2019, please,\u201d I ask one of the students, meaning sit with all four chair legs down on the floor, rather than balancing on the back two. Then by way of explanation I add, \u201cI\u2019ve seen what those poor chairs have been through, and wouldn\u2019t want you to get hurt if it breaks.\u201dAnd that\u2019s the truth. I\u2019m not hung up on \u201cgood sitting\u201d, and I really don\u2019t want to see a student who weighs over 200 pounds/90 kilos to be leaning back on the rear two legs of a cheap school chair. (Or for that matter, sitting on a desk that\u2019s been screwed back together an uncounted number of times due to being pitched by a student having a tantrum.)One reason why I\u2019m not terribly concerned with sitting properly is the fact that like myself, a good number of our students have AD/HD and sitting still and neatly is simply impossible. Sitting bolt upright is really only necessary if you\u2019re playing a musical instrument. Furthermore, when I was young, I really hated hearing orders to \u201csit right\u201d or \u201csit appropriately\u201d, as given by my family or by my teachers. (Thankfully we weren\u2019t a church-going family, as I can guarantee that sitting still during a service would have been damn near impossible.)Most of us know that sitting appropriately means both feet on the floor and \u201cgood posture\u201d. Granted, good posture is important to maximize aerobic capacity when playing music, and to reduce mechanical (physiological) stresses when typing/keyboarding for long periods of time. However, enforcing \u201cgood posture\u201d to have a classroom of children all lined up like robots or like soldiers on parade is nothing more than an exercise in creating and enforcing conformity and sheep-like docility.But perhaps you\u2019re not an irrepressibly squirmy sort yourself, so you might ask, How do you \u201csit inappropriately\u201d anyway?  If you\u2019re sitting, what\u2019s the problem?Let\u2019s see\u2026\nyou sit on your desk and put your feet on your chair seat, or worse, on the chair back with the chair balanced on its back feet and the chair seat against your calves;\nyou straddle your chair like a cowhand (facing backwards), draping your arms over the backrest;\nyou slouch way down so your buttocks are nearly hanging off the edge of the seat and your chin is resting on your chest;\nyou lay on the floor and prop your calves and feet up on the seat of the chair;\nyou sit perpendicular on a chair by draping yourself by laying your stomach across the seat, reading a book on the floor;\nyou bend one leg akimbo, and sit atop your foot that\u2019s on the chair seat, causing you to wobble all through the lesson (or mealtime);\nyou constantly jiggle one leg while leaning on a table, thus making the table vibrate (this earns you many disparaging remarks when it results in rattling crockery at dinner time);\ncommanded to \u201cSit still already!\u201d because of the constant fidgeting, you wind a foot around a chair leg and lean on top of your desk, leaving hardly any room for the arithmetic worksheet (and thus get eraser crumbs and pencil smudges on your shirt);\nyou shift nearly constantly in a hard chair, trying to hold yourself aloft by pressing palms-down on the seat, because some fool decided to dress you in \u201crumba panties\u201d (little girl\u2019s underwear with rows of lace across the butt), and the horrifying corrugated itchiness makes it impossible to get comfortable;\nowing to the fact that your shoelaces have come untied again (shoelaces are \u201cthe work of the devil\u201d!) and by treating the combination of school desk and seat like a Roman couch, you are stretched out on your side with one leg stuck out into the aisle between the school desks, and your toes swivel back and forth in the heel end of your shoe;\nyou lack the anchor of a back-rest while sitting on the stool in art class, and so end up rocking side to side and quietly humming and staring at the pile of paper or clay while mentally flicking through a panorama of 3D images as you plan out your project.\nOutside of the classroom:\nyou sit perpendicular on a rocking chair, legs draped over one of the arms, rocking the chair by grabbing the shelf of a nearby bookcase with the toes of one foot;\nyou pretzel up on the end of the sofa, one knee bent to your chest and the other foot once again jiggling \u2013 sometimes that foot is raised with the leg straight and the ankle resting on the top of the sofa back as though it were a ballet barre;\nyou slouch down in the padded theatre seating in the school auditorium or on the school bus, and prop your knees on the back of the seat in front of you;\nyou wiggle underneath a beanbag chair (to feel the pressure) while leafing through a book on a particular interest of yours;\nyou spin around-and-around-and-around on the doctor\u2019s examination stool;\nyou stare out the window at the clouds or at a lazily-spinning ceiling fan or at a knot in the furniture veneer, or lay your head on the desk and \u201cdrive\u201d your finger along the patterns in the laminate, or pick compulsively at the remnant of an old price tag on the back of a text book. In short, you look at anything but the person speaking to you, because you are concentrating on what someone is saying, rather than concentrating on making eye contact.\nAmazingly, for all I received a number of comments in class, none of my teachers ever commented on this on my report cards. I supposed that was because I was a quiet, otherwise generally obedient child.Come to think of it, I still find myself sitting \u201cinappropriately\u201d at times. It\u2019s less of an issue now, not because I don\u2019t still have the impulse, but rather because I\u2019ve found other ways of venting energy, or getting more proprioceptive input, or simply creating more opportunities for getting up from my seat on a frequent basis.Back in my current classroom, the student mumbles at me, a mere formality of acknowledgement or perhaps token resistance, as he lets the chair drop to a more stable position. \u201cThank you,\u201d I reply. (No way would I ever commend someone with \u201cGood sitting!\u201d as though they were a dog.) I have no personal need for my students to \u201csit right\u201d \u2013 my concern is that they are able to interact with their peers and the staff appropriately, and to be able to achieve their personal educational objectives. I recognize that some of them will end up doing so orbiting their desks (or other work surfaces) in a number of postures. And that\u2019s okay by me.(Addendum: we might note that during the writing of this I sat in my rocker in a number of postures, including both legs folded on the seat with one knee up by my shoulder. More conventional postures are engaged in only when one of our four cats requests a lap to sit upon.)", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/10/01/good-sitting/", "title": "\u201cGood Sitting\u201d"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t30 August 2006 ", "body": "I promised to address \u201cperson-first\u201d language. (And my pal David promised to \u201crip the piss outa [me]\u201d, for which I\u2019m curious what-all he has to say. Then again, I\u2019m really curious as to what all of you readers here have to say; just who ARE you people??)Person-first language refers to saying things like \u201cperson with a hearing loss\u201d, as opposed to someone \u201cbeing hard-of-hearing\u2019. The philosophy behind this is that the person is more important than an impairment they have; that a person should not be known by a diagnosis. This is a reasonable goal, but like anything, it can be taken to extremes and has been.I think \u201cperson-with\u201d makes better rational linguistic sense when the \u201cwith\u201d is a temporary (or preferably temporary) condition, as in \u201cperson with broken leg\u201d or \u201cperson with cancer\u201d. Person-first language makes all kinds of sense when trying to avoid the bad hospital habit of saying \u201cthe emphysema in 402\u201d. The ENT says I am a person with hyperacussis and tinnitus.Actually, I would end up saying things like, \u201cI am nearsighted and have Auditory Processing Disorder\u201d, and skip the whole person-with scenario. \u201cI am brunette\u201d is infinitely handier than saying \u201cI have (or am a person with) brunette hair\u201d. It\u2019s understood that it\u2019s my hair color we\u2019re talking about, and that a description of me is only slightly delineated by that descriptor \u2013 I\u2019m more than my hair.When the condition is rather a state of being \u2014 something fairly permanent, whether acquired or developmental \u2014 then it\u2019s (noun) as in autistic, Deaf, gay, male, dyslexic, Canadian et cetera.Person-first can be prissy and awkward and sometimes is simply benign earnestness at being polite \u2013 well-intended but treacly. Or, person-first can be Politically Correct at its most obnoxious, demonstrating a belief that the condition is \u201crecoverable\u201d and thus meaning something should be done about it. At its worst, person-first demonstrates a belief that the condition is shameful, to be avoided or hidden, such as a person with homosexual tendencies who just needs a good dose of religious correction and a burning desire to be morally uprighteous and \u201cnormal\u201d.Early in my life I started doing things left-handed, so they made sure I learned to write with my right hand. And I\u2019m still left-handed. My inner right-handed person was never \u201crecovered\u201d from that pathological condition, because that imaginary person was never there. I\u2019m a lefty who has learned how to be ambidextrous, which often means that I\u2019m clumsy any way I go about it. Trying to pretend I\u2019m really a right-handed person and calling me such never changed that. Likewise, autistics are not broken or diseased neurotypicals, anymore than gays and lesbians are not confused or immoral heterosexuals.(I just wish there was a better term for \u201cI have ADHD\u201d; ADDer just doesn\u2019t cut it for me. Maybe they\u2019ll rename it \u2013 again \u2013 and we\u2019ll have a more euphonic term.)", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/08/30/to-be-a-person-or-not-to-be-a-person-with/", "title": "To Be A Person, or, Not To Be A\u00a0Person-With"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t2 September 2006 ", "body": "Mum-is-thinking tagged me to answer a book survey. My answers are a motley collection, and I think that motley collections are always the most interesting. I\u2019m guessing that people like to read these kinds of meme-tag surveys because they either want to hear how others have loved the same books they have, or else want to hear about books they had not yet (or possibly would not have) encountered, but would also enjoy.One book that changed my life\nI\u2019ll have to take this is \u201cone of many\u201d rather than as \u201cthe one with the greatest impact\u201d because surely different books have had done this at different stages in my life. There are a lot of contenders for books that were the first (if not always the best) to open up my knowledge-base to completely new fields of understanding, such as those on AD/HD or autism. Those are valuable in that regard, but more important are the books that give a different kind of insight, looking behind social paradigms to critically analyse the how and why of human interaction.For the way that humans interact with their environments, Donald A. Norman\u2019s The Design of Everyday Things looks at the problems that bad design causes people, and how people assume that their difficulties are considered to be their fault, rather than bad design. He touches but lightly on the issues of handicap accessibility, and I don\u2019t think he mentions Universal Design at all, but the central message is still the same. My inner geek adores good, useful, imaginative and \u00e6sthetic design, and it drives me nutz when tools, machines or environments are badly designed.For the way that humans interact with medical & emotional health care providers, Paula Kamen\u2019s All In My Head: An Epic Quest to Cure an Unrelenting, Totally Unreasonable, And Only Slightly Enlightening Headache that describes some of the problems with the medical models of psychology, such as being a problem patient rather than a person with a problem, or the need to find \u201ccures\u201d for everything when instead one can be helped and be healed without being cured.Strong messages from both of these books.One book that you\u2019ve read more than once\nWho doesn\u2019t have a comfily-tattered set of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s four-volume Middle Earth trilogy? (Yes, trilogy means three books, but The Hobbit is part of the Lord of the Rings, and science fiction & fantasy is rife with trilogies composed of more than three volumes.) For my favorite re-read when stuck abed with a nasty virus, I really enjoy Anne McCaffrey & S.M. Stirling\u2019s The City Who Fought. It\u2019s a fun piece of adult science fiction with the well-drawn characters and nitty-gritty techy details and swashbuckling action that make for a engaging read.One book you\u2019d want on a desert island\nMost people like to pack either something really long, or else an extensive practical reference book. But I don\u2019t think that I\u2019d want to be stuck with some interminably long piece of fiction, no matter how well-written, and I\u2019ve probably read enough references over the years that I could eventually solve any manner of functional issues. What I want would be a huge book of blank pages, so I could keep a journal of thoughts about various things. It\u2019s often difficult for me to work out mental explorations without a written medium. I\u2019ll remember or figure out the right knots for lashing together poles, but being able to compose my thoughts is integral to my equalibrium.\nOne book that made you laugh\nTerry Pratchett\u2019s Mort was the first Discworld novel I ever read, and Death is still my favorite character, possibly because he\u2019s so practical and the human world doesn\u2019t always make sense to him. Plus, he talks in ALL CAPS. Soul Music is damn funny, too.  I love the puns and unexpected turns in Pratchett\u2019s books.One book that made you cry\nEbbing & Gammon\u2019s General Chemistry (sixth edition). The authors of this uninspired, heavy tome had an interminable number of equations to solve. I made it through four semesters of chemistry and sweated through this volume for half of them.One book you wish you had written\nActually, I\u2019m still compiling thoughts for my next book.  I don\u2019t tend to dwell on wish-I-had\u2019s.One book you\u2019re currently reading\nI never read just one book at a time, which explains why it takes me so long to finish anything! I just finished Joseph P. Shapiro\u2019s No Pity.  I\u2019m furthest into Majia Nadesan\u2019s most interesting Constructing Autism, which I will finish as soon as I remember where the hell I left the book laying about.Currently my bedside pile contains: Thomas Skrtic\u2019s Behind Special Education, Alfie Kohn\u2019s What Does It Mean to Be Educated?, Kegan & Lahey\u2019s How the Way We Talk Can Change the Way We Work, Marshall B. Rosenberg\u2019s Nonviolent Communications, Fisher & Shapiro\u2019s beyond reason, and Walter Kauffmann\u2019s translation of Basic Writings of Nietzsche (maybe after finishing the book I\u2019ll be able to spell N\u2019s name without looking it up every time). I had just started on Richard Dawkin\u2019s The Selfish Gene and then my daughter took it back with her to college; bad girl.  By default I\u2019m also reading Hardman, Drew & Egan\u2019s Human Exceptionality: School, Community and Family because it\u2019s my current textbook.One book you\u2019ve been meaning to read\nThe future pile-by-my-bed:  Daniel C.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 October 2006 ", "body": "So there\u2019s the aspie kid, frustrated about a sophomore English writing assignment, a persuasive essay. It wasn\u2019t coming up with the topic or the supporting details, but rather, figuring out why there needed to be any explanation about how the evidence supported the assertion. It was perfectly obvious! Well, at least it was to the author, and complaints about the explanation being \u201credundant\u201d resulted in my having to explain, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious to you, but you have to explain it to someone else.\u201dI remember having these slight \u201cmindblindness\u201d issues myself. It\u2019s an inability to construct an imaginary understanding of another\u2019s comprehension based solely upon their reading of your written material, because in any writing, you always can assume that the reader does know some stuff. It\u2019s what you can assume the reader doesn\u2019t know that is the tricky part. To build up that \u201cTheory of Mind\u201d (which really everyone does have, including autistics) you have to be able to build a set of common patterns about what different people know and don\u2019t know, based upon their ages, genders, backgrounds and such. To create that you need a trend, and to create a trend you need multiple sets of data, which arrive from much conversing with people. Spending your lunch periods doing math homework is efficient for reducing homework (and backpack) loads, but certainly reduces the opportunities to socialise. Then again, it also gives one necessary time to de-stress and recharge for the rest of the school day. Everything is choices!In this situation with the essay, our student doesn\u2019t understand the difference between the data and the analysis (which frankly, some graduate students don\u2019t), or rather, between the analysis and the discussion. \u201cHere\u2019s the opinion,\u201d I explain, \u201chere\u2019s what the evidence is, and here\u2019s why it supports that opinion.\u201dHmn \u2026 finally aspie kid is getting frustrated with maternal explanations; the fact that I tutor college students in composition isn\u2019t impressive \u2014 in this sphere, I\u2019m still just Mom.So when faced with these kinds of frustrations, there\u2019s that tried-and-true solace:  the trampoline.I\u2019m tickled that for someone who has never been into organised sports, aspie kid has become progressively more co\u00f6rdinated and agile over the years, especially with the not-inconsiderable adolescent growth spurt. In fact, I\u2019m more clumsy than the kid is. This improvement is very reassuring, because during toddlerhood this child accidentally broke a number of things, including a window. I was in fact, amazed that no bones ever got broken.I think much of that is due to the trampoline. It certainly seems to have improved the vestibular & proprioceptive organisation, meaning the sense of balance, and understanding where the body is in space and the relationships of different body parts. We bought it for fun, but this play equipment has (in retrospect) proven to be rather therapeutic.Our giant backyard trampoline has gotten plenty of use over the years. During more hyperactive days, this ADHD child was sent to go bounce out excess energy in order to have enough focus for doing homework. Or even for sitting through dinner.Aspie kid is no longer hyperactive. But the trampoline still gets used just for the sheer joy of bouncing, and for working through assorted mental knots, like this business of the persuasive essay. After the workout, our student returned to finish up the persuasive essay with the required elaborations.When compared to equally atypical peers, our child\u2019s difficulties have been not nearly as noticeable, most likely due to having had an enabling sort of childhood environment. The trampoline helps with the hyperactivity and co\u00f6rdination. The closed-captioned television (for hard-of-hearing dad) helps with the auditory processing disorder. The household routines are set up to be as ADHD-friendly as possible, lest Mom totally fall apart organisation-wise. This means that various mental quirks aren\u2019t seen as being extremely odd, but rather as things that one simply deals with in stride, because everyone has different needs.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/10/10/jump-for-joy/", "title": "Jump For Joy"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t1 July 2008", "body": "(WARNING: This is one of those posts that starts off tangentially. Sometimes that\u2019s the way communication works.)If you peruse the books in the travel sections of stores and libraries, you can find pocket-size volumes of useful phrases in different languages. While pantomiming works well for some situations*, there are times when having the actual word is best for all concerned. (For example, being able to ask a shopkeeper, \u201cTampons?\u201d)* I believe it was travel writer Rick Steves who noted that one does not always need a phrase book \u2014 merely pointing at your injured foot and screaming does get the point across just fine.Sure, there are plenty of little words of politeness that are great to memorise, please, thank-you, excuse me, and the rest. But these little bits do not a conversation make. And anyway, phrase books are always of limited use; anyone who has tried such can explain the inherent problems that result by being about to make statements or ask questions, but not being able to understand the answers, or know what you are to do with the other person\u2019s reply.And that\u2019s where we sometimes end up when wandering through the awkward territory of small talk. As I have blogged on before (\u201cSmall and Medium-size Talk\u201d), the big sorts of talk, those that are the exchange of real information on subjects of mutual interest are generally rather easy \u2014 it\u2019s the medium-size talk that is the social dance of chit-chat which is fraught with difficulties.But there are days when the very-small talk of passing through and exchanging greetings seems to be a strain.Sometimes I am just really tired, or am coming down with a virus, or am skidding into a migraine. Everyone can relate to feeling crappy, and not having the patience or social wherewithal to deal with inanities, even if most people don\u2019t end up with events of halting speech.Sometimes I am really preoccupied with something and deep in thought, or as they say, \u201clost in my own little world\u201d (honestly, who else\u2019s world would I be in?!) and the transition from thinking and only using part of my attention to navigate through space, to having to heed and listen and respond to someone else\u2019s verbiage, is a struggle. In these moments I have the same internal feeling as when the car\u2019s gearbox is cold and uncooperative, and my imprecise stick shifting produces that split-second of horrible grating noise.Sometimes I am simply out of practice. There was a period of graduate school where I would be doing field work or lab work or report-writing for days on end, and I simply wasn\u2019t around other people to converse. Although alone, I did not feel lonely. But when trying to re-integrate my brain to the demanding social milieu that is the grocery store**, I would discover that hours of performing high-level technical written communication work did not transfer to performing basic interpersonal verbal communication work.** Seriously. Travel to a country where you can neither understand nor speak the local language, and see how awkward and electively mute you become.And maybe some of these are reasons why we have those stock social phrases, the likes of which are listed in travel guidebooks, topically categorised into columns of options. Apparently somebody decided it was useful to organise the information that way, and it certainly makes sense to me.One day I realised that I had also sorted all of my phrases in much the same manner. When I can tell that I am in one of those awkward states, I work proactively by mentally accessing the appropriate list before entering the social situations. Assuming I can anticipate which kinds of social situations I will be in, it works pretty well. But then I run into unexpected detours where somebody engages me with an unexpected query or social routine, and am scrambling to find the right response. I am mumbling or stammering or delivering a reply that is two or three seconds late, my volume dropping as I realise that I am speaking to someone who is already exiting stage left.Well, the old Words program works okay, but it\u2019s not great. I\u2019m hoping that there will be a release of iChitChat soon \u2026", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/07/01/mental-menus/", "title": "Mental Menus"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t1 January 2007 ", "body": "Let me set the stage with a visual here:Flight attendant: \u201cWould you like a copy of People magazine to read?\u201d\nMe: \u201cEr, no thank you. Do you have Scientific American or Popular Mechanics?\u201dWhy on earth would I want to read People magazine? I don\u2019t know who most of those people are, even though they\u2019re supposed to be famous actors or beautiful models or important politicians.   My teenage daughter says that the same famous actor was in both the Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and I\u2019ll have to take her word for it; I certainly can\u2019t tell!    Furthermore, I don\u2019t care about fashion models or makeup.  Although I understand why others do, from a strictly intellectual (anthropological) basis:  celebrities are important figures in the greater tribe, therefore it behooves us to be able to recognise them.Among the faceblind there is the concept of \u201cGorbachev effect\u201d \u2013 even the faceblind person can recognize Mikhail Gorbachev because of the distinctive port-wine stain birthmark on his head.  (Well, assuming that the guy isn\u2019t wearing a hat \u2026)  It\u2019s much easier to recognize someone who is highly divergent from the mean.  The more striking people are often either \u201cugly\u201d in some way, or very distinctive from the local group by virtue of ethnicity or body feature.This may be one reason why I gravitate towards environments such as graduate school with all the international students, or special education with all of the physical differences.  Unfortunately, identification is by distinguishing characteristic \u2014 one Indian woman among fifty very \u201cvanilla\u201d North Americans stands out, as does one boy with Down\u2019s Syndrome in a regular classroom.  Put her in a family wedding party or him in a Special Olympics tournament, then to my horror I find that they have suddenly disappeared from my visual horizon and I can no longer find \u201cmy\u201d person by facial exception.  Then I must rely on the slower and less certain factors of gait, voice, mannerisms, or overall body form.In studying animal behavior, Ron Prokopy came up with the idea of a \u201csupernormal stimulus\u201d, meaning a behavioral sign stimulus that is larger-than-life, something even better and more exciting.   For an entomology example, when controlling apple flies we can hang a sticky-coated red ball in an apple tree that still has small, green fruits on it.  The apple fly females see this ball that is larger and redder than all the other fruits, and are (fatally) attracted to it as an optimal resource for laying their eggs.People who are considered to be exceptionally beautiful exhibit a kind of supernormal stimulus: their features are more optimal by being more regular and symmetric than the average person\u2019s.  Their features are not just normal exemplars (models) of what a desirable human should look like; they are supernormal, hence they are supermodels.The ultimate causality for being attracted to \u201cbeautiful\u201d people is that even, normal features suggest both good genes and good health.  Even though there are various fads among cultures and time periods about what is considered to be \u201csexy\u201d or \u201cattractive\u201d, there are still some basic qualities that are universally perceived as beautiful because they suggest a healthy, young adult that would be a good mate choice.From a proximate standpoint, the faceblind person may prefer the faces of people who are distinctive, because they can be more easily recognized, and thus are associated with less stress of identification, and because they increase the likelihood of repeated identification.  As you might expect, faceblindness plays hell with dating.  (It also has more insidious effects, such as playing hell with one\u2019s ability to network on the job scene \u2014 even the person that one can eventually learn to identify on the job won\u2019t necessarily be identifiable in another time and place, plus the faceblind person simply doesn\u2019t build up that large number of interpersonal connections that the neurotypical person does.)My husband is not extremely different in appearance, albeit when dating he had a beard and wore his hair longer than most men at the time.  Alas, he no longer does, and when he\u2019s barbered in an everyday manner I have mananged to lose him in plain sight multitudinous times in our 25 years of marriage.  When I misplace him yet again, I stop to try and remember what he was wearing, which is usually a blue shirt (he is very fond of such) but unfortunately so are hundreds of other people.  While otherwise focused on taking photographs of plants at a botanic garden, I eventually realised that I\u2019d been absentmindedly tracking the wrong \u201cperson in a blue shirt and khaki shorts\u201d (a surprisingly common subspecies of Homo sapiens \u2014 even the male of the couple we were visiting was dressed identically, so the guys appeared twinned).   Although I can spot a single Viola pedatifida in a prairie, I can\u2019t find my husband in a crowd, so I had to call him on his mobile to arrange a meeting location, whereupon he naturally spotted me first and semaphored dramatically so I could notice him standing there 50 feet away.  And so it goes!In smaller environments, I listen for him, for his asthmatic breathing pattern and his distinctively heavy tread.  It\u2019s a good thing that he can recognise me, because he\u2019s hard of hearing, and besides, I have what others have described as an alarmingly light tread (I \u201csneak up on\u201d them) when I\u2019m not clumsily crashing into objects.Although there is an innate preference for certain kinds of symmetric beauty among all humans, it would be interesting to see if developmental prosopagnosics are able to distinguish among sets of faces those that are generally considered to be more attractive, and if they are personally more attracted to distinctive faces than those that are generally considered to be more attractive in the normal or supernormal sense. The further purpose to such a line of enquiry would be to explore how much of the concept of \u201cbeauty\u201d is innately bound to the process of facial integration and recognition!Personally I suspect that most faceblind people could identify someone as being classically pretty, but would have different qualifiers on whom they personally find attractive.", "outgoing_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/01/01/no-eye-for-beauty/", "title": "No Eye for\u00a0Beauty"},

Bioelectric hybrid circuits are built upon their efficient sensory-response rates.Speaking of non-insect arthropods, artificial spider silks are being developed to help repair damaged nerves.The iridescent blue color of Morpho butterfly wings is really a trick of light reflection (the wings\u2019 true color is brown), and the structural qualities of the scales are being utilised to help produce anti-reflective coatings for radar design.Other anti-reflective qualities are fly eyes, which help improve the surface of solar collectors for more efficient energy production.The beautiful multi-color metallics of some beetles have inspired beautiful iridescent paints.For more information, check out the Biomimicry Guild., or the Center for Biologically Inspired Design (CBID) at Georgia Institute of Technology [Georgia Tech].", "outgoing_links": ["https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/morpho_in_flight.jpg", "http://www.biomimetik.dk/BiomimeticGroups", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1270306.stm", "http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22266034/", "http://www.bionics-cicada.org/", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5172422.stm", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/gallery/2007/jul/24/1?picture=330260808", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/gallery/2007/jul/24/1?picture=330261412", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/gallery/2007/jul/24/1?picture=330260802", "http://www.biomimicryguild.com/guild_about_us.html#", "http://www.cbid.gatech.edu/"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/11/09/the-benefits-of-buggy-design/", "title": "The benefits of buggy\u00a0design"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t2 November 2008 ", "body": "\u201cTime flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.\u201dSome of my special interests are insects, science and special education. The three subjects rarely intersect, but you can bet that when they do, it\u2019s going to be interesting! Populist politics is once again \u2014 or rather \u2014 still degenerating into vast bogs of anti-intellectualism.\u00a0 As noted across many news-editorial and science blogs, Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin positively excels at scorning science.\u00a0 It shows up not only in her stump speeches, but also in her belief in young-earth creationism and stance on teaching Intelligent Design in classrooms. One of the latest foofaraws is her denunciation of funding for research on fruit flies.\u201cYou\u2019ve heard about some of these pet projects, they really don\u2019t make a whole lot of sense and sometimes these dollars go to projects that have little or nothing to do with the public good,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThings like fruit fly research in Paris, France. I kid you not.\u201d [YouTube link]What does Palin have against this line of science?\u00a0 Well, that\u2019s a bit puzzling, especially when we look at the subject of her first policy speech.\u00a0 The VP candidate was talking about special education services and the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\u00a0 But all the pro-funding talk was a bit of a turn-around for the Alaskan governor, who had previously cut the funding for Special Olympics in half.What really stood out is that within her speechifying, the intent of her points about science funding collided with the actual content of part of what she was saying. Palin was (among other things) advocating for more research into the causes of various learning difficulties.\u201cEarly identification of a cognitive or other disorder, especially autism, can make a life-changing difference. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to strengthen NIH. We\u2019re going to work on long-term cures, and in the short-term, we\u2019re going to work on giving these families better information.\u201dShe\u2019s been referred to by her running mate as knowing more about autism than anyone else than McCain knows, because she has an autistic nephew. Palin\u2019s baby, Trig, has Down\u2019s, and (unless any of her other children have undisclosed difficulties) she has not even begun to personally wade through the bureaucracy of IEPs or Special Education. She may be a good cheerleader and figurehead for the voters who choose candidates that have a few personal details in common. But neither these biographical details nor her BA in journalism make her well-versed on the heritability factors of various developmental delays, nor the education of students with specific learning difficulties.\u00a0 For all of the gushing god-talk and the flippant folksy phrases filling her delivery, she doesn\u2019t really display a sense of the basic science of what she\u2019s chattering about.Aside from the inherent difficulty in \u201ccuring\u201d genetic disorders (including autism), we have to wonder just how she expects these cures to be developed when on one hand she says we need more work, but on the other hand she turns right around and scorns spending money on science research.The repudiation in the newspaper editorials and letters, and in the blogosphere was swift in the many detailed defenses of basic research, including using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for research in genetics, evolution and biochemistry.\u00a0 This insect has even been used to help elucidate possible neurological issues in autism. Associate professor of biology from the University of Minnesota Morris, P.Z. Myers, who blogs as Pharyngula, responded:This idiot woman, this blind, shortsighted ignoramus, this pretentious clod, mocks basic research and the international research community. You damn well better believe that there is research going on in animal models \u2014 what does she expect, that scientists should mutagenize human mothers and chop up baby brains for this work? \u2014 and countries like France and Germany and England and Canada and China and India and others are all respected participants in these efforts.Yes, scientists work on fruit flies. Some of the most powerful tools in genetics and molecular biology are available in fruit flies, and these are animals that are particularly amenable to experimentation. Molecular genetics has revealed that humans share key molecules, the basic developmental toolkit, with all other animals, thanks to our shared evolutionary heritage (something else the wackaloon from Wasilla denies), and that we can use these other organisms to probe the fundamental mechanisms that underlie core processes in the formation of the nervous system \u2014 precisely the phenomena Palin claims are so important.But what many people did not realise is that the project Palin (or her script-writers) so dumbly dissed was not about that diminutive Diptera at all. In fact, the Drosophila melanogaster, is not a true fruit fly; it is in the family  Drosophilidae. The fly of likely interest was the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae, in the family Tephritidae, which are the True Fruit Flies. To be fair, only entomologists pay attention to the family-level distinctions, and it\u2019s one of those annoying and sometimes confusing historical accidents of nomenclature that we call Drosophila the Common Fruit Fly.\u00a0 (And this, O Best Beloved, is why the world uses scientific names, to prevent the massive confusion that can result from the same organism having up to hundreds of common names, and the same common name being used for completely unrelated species.\u00a0 We don\u2019t employ binomial nomenclature to sound snooty, despite what some people assert.)Aside from the confusion over types of flies, is this research in France just another pork-barrel project, some useless study that sucks money away from more important things?\u00a0 After all, Palin may not be very familiar with agricultural issues because the arctic circle state is not a major farming state.Well, the olive fruit fly is an exotic insect has no natural enemies in California, where olives are now being grown domestically as a commercial crop.\u00a0 Worse, the damage inflicted can result in a loss of 80-100% of the year\u2019s production. So why would the Alaskan governor even refer to work on a California crop pest?\u00a0 It\u2019s quite possible that the ear-marked research was cited because of a recent report by the Citizens Against Government Waste.\u00a0 Although there certainly are a number of earmarks for construction, cultural, scientific or educational projects that can be questioned for being of dubious value, the scientific ones are prone to misinterpretation simply because the general public usually does not understand the value of basic or applied research.\u00a0 Unlike something more concrete like bridges, the research often takes more context and background information to make sensible evaluations of the usefulness or appropriateness of the monies awarded.\u00a0 In response to the CAGW\u2019s \u201cFrench Kiss Off Award\u201d, Representative Mike Thompson had a prepared statement about the research:\u201cThe Olive Fruit Fly has infested thousands of California olive groves and is the single largest threat to the U.S. olive and olive oil industries,\u201d he said. \u201cI secured $748,000 for olive fruit fly research and irradiation in the (fiscal year 2008) appropriations bill for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA will use some of that funding for their research facility in France. This USDA research facility is located in France because Mediterranean countries like France have dealt with the Olive Fruit Fly for decades, while California has only been exposed since the late 1990s. This is not uncommon; the USDA has several international research facilities throughout the world, including Australia, China and Argentina.\u201dCultural and biological controls are highly important for the successful production of crops.\u00a0 One of the most famous success stories of using biological controls was from California, where the Vedallia ladybeetle was imported to attack the cottony cushion scale populations that threatened to wipe out the newly-established citrus industry in the late 1800\u2019s.\u00a0 There are a lot of parallels here \u2014 a newly-established agricultural industry cannot become a major industry to help provide income to a state\u2019s economy if the crop is severely threatened by a pest.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t nonsense \u2014 this is applied research, with straightforward benefits.Of course, there\u2019s the whole issue of her saying, \u201cParis, France\u201d.\u00a0 Doubtless this (rather provincial and somewhat xenophobic) usage was meant to elicit all sorts of responses in the audience.\u00a0 What response in particular is open to interpretations, such as:\u00a0 (1) It was in Paris, France, as opposed to Paris, Texas. (2) We\u2019re sending money abroad instead of keeping it in the U.S. of A! (3) The money\u2019s going to those socialist Europeans!\u00a0 But actually, the USDA research facility isn\u2019t even in Paris.\u00a0 It\u2019s near Montpellier. The research done there by Americans is for Americans, not only on the olive fruit fly but other devastating agricultural pests. (Well, primary for Americans; research ultimately benefits everyone.)\u00a0 But where better to study the ecology and best biological controls for an exotic pest than from where it originates?\u00a0 After all, this is what we have done for a number of other introduced, exotic crop pests.\u00a0 Why? Because unlike chemical controls, biological and cultural controls don\u2019t fail due to the evolution of pesticide-resistant populations.\u00a0 Yes, it\u2019s true \u2014 species do evolve!\u00a0 Drug-resistant bacteria evolve.\u00a0 Insecticide-resistant insects evolve.I just don\u2019t understand how she expects these advances to be made in understanding the pathogenesis or treatment of various learning disorders when she also turns around and is so contemptuous of science in general, whether agricultural or evolutionary.But who cares about factual details when trying to rouse crowds? It\u2019s always easier to ridicule biologists because you don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re doing or why it\u2019s important. It\u2019s much simpler to make cheap shots at funding entomologists who work to sustain agricultural industries. (Heaven forbid we should have a more virulent pest that decimates the potato crops for our \u201cFreedom Fries\u201d.)

in reality, it\u2019s just a couple of school hallways with frazzled staff trying to keep eyes on several dozen of the district\u2019s most difficult secondary students.Sometimes we\u2019re out in the hallway because we\u2019ve asked an acting-out student to leave the classroom:\nthe student is having an exceptionally juvenile temper-tantrum (that would be one the seventh-graders, who are like whining toddlers with adolescent hormones and cuss words, and yes, a few times someone has lain on the floor to kick and cry because they couldn\u2019t have their way)\nthe student is creating a big scene and we\u2019re removing them from the audience\na student is stuck in a meltdown/rant and needs a safer place than the social boiling pot of the classroom to work through it and regain their composure\nthe student is having a familial crisis and is too emotionally fragile to focus on work while surrounded by their peers\nthe student is unable to resist teasing a peer because they know the peer is equally unable to resist over-reacting dramatically, and we\u2019re trying to interrupt the whole chain reaction (for the ninth time this morning)\nor the target peer has been getting better at ignoring the instigator, and the person we\u2019re removing is one of the audience members who excels at egging-on the antagonists, like an enzyme in a particularly strong acid-base reaction\nIt\u2019s one thing to take an emotionally-fragile student out to the hall so they can sit on a chair and take ten or fifteen minutes to calm down.\u00a0 This is the therapeutic side of taking time out, and when it\u2019s over, the long-term problem may not be solved, but at least it\u2019s manageable again.It\u2019s also much the same thing when we\u2019re working as a surrogate frontal lobe for these students who have various disorders that affect their \u201cexecutive functioning\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 We know that until the melt-down or crisis has passed, they are literally unable to intellectually process what happened and what they might be able to do differently next time.But it\u2019s quite another thing when we\u2019re taking a student out of the classroom because they are being oppositional.\u00a0 Any student can act up once in a while, but there are a few who are here because they do so frequently over the day.(It\u2019s a bit of a misnomer to say that I \u201ctake\u201d someone out of the classroom; we have a No Physical Contact policy, so I can only ask or instruct a student to leave. If the disorderly student is too defiant to leave and is making any kind of teaching impossible, then we ask the rest of the students to leave. Those compliant students usually get some kind of treat for being so helpful. The oppositional students find this so \u201cunfair\u201d that we rarely have to resort to clearing the classroom.\u00a0 They may protest overmuch when asked to take a time out, but they\u2019d rather save face with cussing and door-kicking than be disempowered by everyone else\u2019s co\u00f6peration.)Sometimes these sorts of belligerent students will take advantage of being away from multiple staff members as an opportunity for being especially rude or manipulative.\u00a0 The scene may start out with my request for everyone to take their seats now that the bell has rung:\u201cShut up, bitch!\u00a0 You can\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s a time out,\u201d I announced with a sigh, and opened up the door for the lad who then swaggered out and began dropping the \u201cF-bomb\u201d in a repetitious barrage (as verb, adjective and noun) well after the door had shut behind us.\u00a0 Not not only did he refuse to sit down, but then he also tried to order me about, insisting that he should be given leave to go home \u201cbecause all the teachers are so fucking demanding and full of crap\u201d.\u00a0 I was not even going to respond to that obvious attempt to pull me into an absurd debate \u2014 it was merely intended to be a distraction from his own personal responsibility, as was his next protest,\n\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault that I keep getting into trouble!\u201d\nHmn, the fact that I was hardly the only person documenting his misdeeds was apparently irrelevant \u2026\u00a0 I re-iterated that he needed to have a seat.\u00a0 Once he finally quit kicking the wall and sat down, two minutes later he commanded,\n\u201cYou need to go look at the clock!\u201d\nThe lack of a clock in the hallway was a just ploy that we should go into an office or back into the classroom, where he could make another scene.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t need to; I have a clock on me,\u201d I explained quietly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not obeying me!\u201d\nThis prompted a raised eyebrow from me, as I kept on documenting the precipitating event.  The scene continued on in a similar vein for several more minutes, until eventually the disorderly youth calmed down enough to go onto his next class.  (No, he never apologised; he was, as ever, too full of defiance and entitlement.)Sometimes these 10 to 15 minute time-out breaks in the hallway have that sense of protracted time one normally experiences when stuck in patient resignation in an airport queue, while some inflexible, rude schmuck at the head of the line is pitching a hissy fit because their own own lack of planning or fact-checking has caused their life to not go as they think it should, and now they are blaming everyone else.At times like these, a thick stack of math pages to grade seems like a delightful luxury, especially if the students are elsewhere and I can just sit in the relative peace and quiet, and rock ever-so-slightly while focusing uninterrupted on one thing at a time.Hallways can be tiring, even when the journey is only 50 feet.  Sometimes I can distract myself from the fatigue by marvelling at the sheer outrageousness of quotes like, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault that I keep getting into trouble!\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re not obeying me!\u201dAs teachers everywhere exclaim, \u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up!\u201dSometimes we wish we were.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/03/02/down-a-hall-noisily/", "title": "Down a hall,\u00a0noisily"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t7 February 2009 ", "body": "Howdy folks,This morning I\u2019m again in pain and rather stiff.\u00a0 I know that many of you have rather specialised knowledge, and would appreciate your thoughts on getting diagnostics.I have a number of conditions, both common and uncommon, including Raynaud\u2019s, migraines, cough-variant asthma, tinnitus & hyperacussis and Auditory Processing Disorder, motor tics, and assorted neurological glitches including prosopagnosia (face-blindness) and ADHD. Getting these things diagnosed over the past decade has been wonderfully helpful for those that can be medicated, figuring out how to make accommodations for those that can\u2019t, and being able to prove to others that I have documented reasons for difficulties, and that I\u2019m not being lazy or stupid.However, the crux of this post is that I also have hypermobility-related problems, including osteoarthritis, TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder), prolapsed uterus, repeated shoulder subluxations, crackly joints, stretchy skin and places where my skin repeatedly cracks open, poor proprioception, bruising easily, and local anesthetic not lasting very long (which along with the TMJ makes dental work challenging).You can see my pictures on this page. Several people have suggested that I have Ehlers-Danlos and/or Marfan\u2019s because I have really long fingers and can hardly find women\u2019s shirts that fit because of my long arms. (Funny thing is, I\u2019m the shortest person in my family of origin at 5\u20195\u2033; the rest are around the 6\u2032 range, but similarly proportioned.)\u00a0 More discussion of the proprioceptive issues is here.My problem is that because I have pursued getting so many diagnoses, I fear that my assorted docs may think I\u2019m either a whiner or a hypochondriac (even though I was right in my suspicions).I have a rheumatologist, who put me on the twice-daily Naproxen for the arthralgia and Nifedipine for the Raynaud\u2019s. But it was my psychiatrist who thought put me on twice-daily Gabapentin for pain, which helps me sleep better at night (in addition to the 2\u2033 thick foam mattress topper, and pillow for my knees). Managing pain is sometimes a major preoccupation. As I\u2019ve said before, legitimising the reality of pain is difficult. If you complain, then you\u2019re \u201cjust being whiny\u201d. If you don\u2019t mention it, then no one realises just how difficult your life is, and assume that you\u2019re not functioning well because you\u2019re lazy or stupid. Other people tend to view the episodes of being less obviously in pain, or episodes between migraines, as being evidence that the person affected has \u201crecovered\u201d (like they are supposed to) and that the issue is gone (and thus accommodations are no longer needed).When visiting doctors, there\u2019s a fine balance to strike between self-advocacy and being explicit enough for them to understand the magnitude of the problems, and how those problems interact and magnify each other, but also avoiding coming off as being a neurotic female or a prescription-seeking druggie.I also had to ask my rheumy if I didn\u2019t indeed have hypermobility, which after demonstrating a few \u201ctricks\u201d, she said that I do.\u00a0 She didn\u2019t take a Beighton score, but then again, I performed all those anyway, so that may have been moot. At least she has the hypermobility charted.So if I\u2019m getting at least some of my symptoms treated, why would I want to explore further diagnoses of Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan\u2019s?Well, there are possibilities for other related health issues.\u00a0 But also, my daughter is pregnant, and although it\u2019s my son (rather than my daughter) that has some of my neurological glitches and hypermobility, I\u2019m concerned about genetic issues.\u00a0 Almost ALL of the health problems I have carry some genetic basis.But you can imagine the kind of reception a person would get going in to a doctor and saying, \u201cA bunch of strangers on the Internet say I have this weird, rare disease\u201d!\u00a0 :-DLike I said, I don\u2019t want to be seen as some attention-seeking hypochondriac. But I had to ask my rheumy about the hypermobility, and she\u2019s not gone beyond that, even when I managed to sprain my ankle merely walking across the flat sidewalk into her office.\u00a0 (Although she is otherwise thorough with x-rays to check for bone density & arthritis and blood tests to rule out autoimmune diseases.) My GP refers all of specific health issues to my assorted specialists (OB/GYN, psychiatrist, rheumatologist, etc.) so I know that he would not assess me.Do you have any ideas on how to broach this, \u201cI too, may be a zebra\u201d question with my docs, or get a referral for a geneticist or whatever?\u00a0 (Mind you, I\u2019m in the US, so must deal with the intransigencies of my insurance company.)Thank you for your time and thoughts,andrea", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/02/07/requesting-your-thoughts-please/", "title": "Requesting your thoughts,\u00a0please"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t4 May 2009", "body": "Being bored is a luxury I do not have.Not the boredom that is the enforced tedium from being exhausted by illness, or from waiting and waiting for indeterminate periods of time without diversions. But rather, the boredom that comes from choosing to be disinterested at work.Sure, some jobs are seriously duller than others, such as data entry or assembly.\u00a0 But retail is considerably more interesting than such rote perfectionism.And yet, the other week one of my coworkers was complaining that he found the work at the garden center to be so BORING.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t related to his chosen degree program or career.Certainly, I don\u2019t expect everyone else to be as entertained as I am by \u201cfacing\u201d the plant stock, meaning filling more pots into the gaps shoppers have left in the flats.\u00a0 I really like lining up four-packs or pots, or bringing forwards pots from the back of the benches up to the front so they are more accessible to the buyers.\u00a0 The quick detail makes everything neat and tidy and complete.\u00a0 Even shuffling pots from a nearly-empty flat (tray) to fill another is satisfying, because then we have that flat available for a shopper to use as they are selecting their plants.\u00a0 (Not only does handing out flats free up people\u2019s over-burdened hands, but there\u2019s also a bit of sales psychology, where buyers are more likely to buy a few extra pots to complete the flat.)And to be sure, there are a number of people who find \u201cgrooming\u201d the plants (removing old flowers and dying leaves) to be just too utterly nit-picky and grubby a past-time.\u00a0 But I enjoy this because I know that removing the dead material will help ensure that the plants keep blooming, will lesson the chance of disease and insect problems, and simply makes everything look better.\u00a0 (A lot of novice gardeners will mistake the natural \u201csenescence\u201d or shedding of yellowing old leaves as a symptom of disease.)And of course, most of the garden center cashiers are not horticulturalists; they are cashiers with some basic training in how to water and what the difference is between annuals and perennials.\u00a0 But that\u2019s what I\u2019m there for, to provide the expertise in answering questions, and helping customers select plants for different sites.So despite the varying levels of intrinsic reward in some of the activities, and the vast differences in personal expertise, all of the cashiers can still gain the same kinds of satisfaction in their work.\u00a0 There\u2019s still the basic premise of serving others, even if we\u2019re just loading bags of mulch into someone\u2019s car.Because that\u2019s what we\u2019re there for.So when my coworker complains of being bored, and spends most of his time hidden behind the cash register (checking something on his mobile phone) or wandering around aimlessly listening to his music or chatting with a girlfriend, well, I am mystified.\u00a0 And a bit annoyed.Because like, dude, \u201cfun\u201d is something you make, not something that happens to you.If you\u2019re bored, then get involved.\u00a0 Help me come up with better ways of displaying the new stock that is more aesthetically appealling and more accessible, like the other evening cashier does.\u00a0 Go out and actively assist the customers, like the other cashiers do.If the custom is slow during that lull before people get off work, then make a point to do some of the things that are on the To Do list.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I\u2019m not bored \u2014 I not only do when I have been asked to do as an employee, but I also look for other things to do.If I\u2019m knee-deep in cleaning the spent blossoms from the hanging baskets and watering the stock, then don\u2019t hide out behind the register.\u00a0 I shouldn\u2019t have to mention, \u201cHey, that lady over there has her hands full \u2014 go get her a shopping cart.\u201d [buggy, trolley]It\u2019s awkward when your coworker is slacking off, but you\u2019re not a supervisor.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tried stating, \u201cX, Y and Z need doing,\u201d but that cue was apparently too subtle.\u00a0 I\u2019ve tried offering, \u201cI\u2019ll do W and X if you don\u2019t mind doing Y and Z,\u201d but that produced nothing more than a half-hearted attempt at Y and Z disappeared somewhere along the way.There\u2019s no reason to be bored at a job like this.\u00a0 There are too many different things to do, whether it\u2019s tending the plant stock or chit-chatting with the customers while you ring up their purchases.And you know what?\u00a0 Working in a half-assed way and complaining of being \u201cbored\u201d does not help ensure employability, especially in these economic times.I\u2019m not working two jobs just for the fun of it; I work because I need the income.\u00a0 But despite that, despite that some days I\u2019m cold and wet and stiff and sore due to the exertion and the weather and my health issues, despite that, I still find ways of enjoying my work.I can\u2019t afford to be bored.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/05/04/a-luxury/", "title": "A Luxury"},

And for the non-technical audience, the thing that our earnest-but-irresponsible citizen-crusader should have checked, an article on Snopes about the whole foofaraw.M (a former Army nurse) was unimpressed about the story of a dog named Calypso dying after eating cocoa mulch.\u00a0 \u201cDid anyone do an autotopsy to determine that it was the mulch that actually caused the dog\u2019s death?!\u201d\u201cCorrelation doesn\u2019t equal causality,\u201d I recited, pulling out a handy script while I mentally digested the JAVMA article.\u00a0 \u201cReally, most people \u2014 and animals \u2014 have eaten something before they die.\u00a0 But that doesn\u2019t mean their stomach contents were what caused the death!\u201dI clicked through some more pages.\u00a0 \u201cOh look, the way it\u2019s processed nowadays removes most of the Theobromine and such, anyway.\u201d\u00a0 As an aside, I added, \u201cI tried the stuff a few years ago.\u00a0 It smells GREAT when you open the bag (we had to make brownies afterwards), but it\u2019s so light it blows away, and it tended to get moldy when it rained a lot.\u00a0 It\u2019s also really expensive.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t impressed; I like pine-bark mulch better.\u201d\u201cI wish people would check things out that they read on the Internet before they go around threatening stores,\u201d grumbled M.I harrumped, thinking of the dozens of flavors of bunk associated with horticulture, autism, and other topics.\u201cWell,\u201d he added, \u201cIf that guy comes in again, I\u2019ll let him know that a horticulturalist, a scientist, said it\u2019s not highly toxic.\u00a0 We\u2019re not being irresponsible for selling mulch.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/index.html", "http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jun06/060601b.asp", "http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/cocoamulch.asp", "http://web.archive.org/web/20060614125415/http://www.cocoamulch.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=browse&id=25996&pageid=109"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/05/31/mulch-ado-about-nothing/", "title": "Mulch Ado About\u00a0Nothing"},

We\u2019ve been stacking pallets or propping them up on cinderblocks to put the plants into easier view and reach.\u00a0 (Plus, they\u2019re also easier for us to clean and water \u2014 ergonomics, w00t!)\u00a0 We\u2019ve been making sure that the aisles are frequently broken up into side-paths, and we try to keep the aisles 3-4 feet wide so carts, strollers and wheelchairs can get through.\u00a0 It seems to be working well; every day we get compliments about how good the plants look.But what makes this place pleasant to work for is the concern for helping our customers.\u00a0 Sure, it\u2019s store policy to be helpful (doesn\u2019t every business flog that slogan?), but we are glad to break from running the register or watering to carry things out to the car, or load up bags of mulch and rock, or show you where the Verbena is, or explain the differences between the four varieties of white Petunias.\u00a0 When someone has their hands full, we grab some empty flats, and pull carts (buggies, trolleys) over to make things easier.It\u2019s this \u201cserve everyone\u201d approach that makes helping people with various disabilities so much easier.\u00a0 One of the other clerks knows American Sign Language, so Deaf customers are sure to look for her (my ASL is rather limited).\u00a0 When the gentleman in the power chair thanked a coworker for carrying stuff out to his van, I was tickled to overhear him say, \u201cNo problem!\u00a0 We do that for everyone.\u201d\u00a0 Because we do.Sometimes the \u201cdisabled community\u201d moments are colored in large brush strokes.\u00a0 An older man in a wheelchair came by in search of some herb seeds, accompanied by two women who were of the \u201ccare-taker\u201d rather than \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d mentality.\u00a0 Although neither said anything obviously untoward, there was still a patronizing aura, that his desire to go shopping was being honored but that they were still \u201chumoring\u201d him.\u00a0 It made me uncomfortable, and I kept trying to scan the interactions in the triad to figure out what was going on.But the women were intent on asking me questions of their own, even as they were simultaneously going through the motions of helping him.\u00a0 \u201cHere\u2019s someone who can help you.\u00a0 He\u2019s looking for some seeds.\u00a0 Tell her what you\u2019re looking for.\u00a0 Do you have any seeds?\u00a0 Do you remember what it was he wanted?\u00a0 Ooh, don\u2019t you just love those pink flowers?\u00a0 Isn\u2019t that what you got on your desk?\u201d\u201cWell I dunno, but it\u2019s not flowering any more.\u00a0 Was you looking for parsley?\u00a0 He was wanting to grow some stuff from seed.\u00a0 You sure gots a lot of plants out here.\u201dTrying to track all this verbiage flying by was making me dizzy, and I just wanted to focus on finding out what the man came to get.\u00a0 The customer himself was having some expressive difficulties. (Who wouldn\u2019t have, being around those two all day!)\u00a0 I knelt down on a knee so I could speak with him face to face.\u00a0 I had to.\u00a0 I had to disengage myself from the chatty care-takers who were now trying to ask me random questions unrelated to the needs of my primary customer.\u00a0 I had to be able to focus on what he was asking for, which meant watching him speak.\u00a0 And I had to honor him personally as the customer, not as some second-class accessory.My knees cracked noisily, and I knelt down on one knee, and we conversed, just the garden center clerk and the customer who wanted parsley seeds, and who considered and then decided against the Doubled-Curled or Flat Italian Parsley seedlings.After that moment, I stood back up and we were sucked back into the vortex of the chatty care-givers, who asked me some confused questions about houseplants, and then led/followed him over to the main store entrance.\u00a0 I hoped he would be getting the things that he wanted this evening.Sometimes the community moments come by quietly.\u00a0 I was checking out a couple flats of annuals and several perennials for a woman, cleaning off some old leaves and blossoms and chatting as the register processed her credit card in its own slow time.\u201cThis is going to take me several days to get it all planted,\u201d she offered.\u201cWell, that\u2019s always a good thing to do anyway,\u201d I offered, affirming her wisdom.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s those marathon gardening sessions that break our backs.\u201d\u00a0 The register finally finished hiccoughing through the electronic transmission and spat out her receipt.\u00a0 I picked up her potted rose bush, rested it on a hip, and then deftly tipped up the flat of annuals to balance them on my other hand.\u00a0 (It only sounds tricky; in reality the flats are just boxy grates, and I can curl my fingers into them.)\u00a0 \u201cHere, I\u2019ll carry these out for you,\u201d I said, leaving her to handle her purse and a couple quart pots of perennials, then added,\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t garden for ten hours solid since I got arthritis.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u00a0 I have RA and can only do so much at a time.\u201d\u201cAh, yeah,\u201d I commiserated.\u00a0 \u201cYou have to make dinners ahead, because the next day you\u2019re too exhausted from gardening.\u201d\u00a0 She nodded, already tired from just the idea of the ordeal ahead.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s fun, but you just run out of \u2018spoons\u2019!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 And then I loaded things into her car and we swapped the mutual thanks.\u00a0 My attention turned to the gardening work of my own, left uncompleted or never even started.\u00a0 Oh, and errands.\u00a0 Here I was at the market nearly every day, but I kept forgetting to get my arthritis medicationn refilled!\u201cHey Andrea,\u201d\u00a0 piped up one of my coworkers, \u201cit\u2019s nearly time for you to go on break.\u201d\u00a0 This clerk is a good guy; he\u2019ll remind me when something is coming up, he\u2019ll remind me when it\u2019s time to start, and even after I\u2019ve forgotten it.\u00a0 He asks me if I remembered to clock in, and reminds me (several times) to copy down the next week\u2019s schedule before leaving.\u00a0 It sure is wonderful to have garden center clerks who are so helpful, especially when you when you\u2019re having seriously distracted & forgetful AD/HD days!* I\u2019ve never navigated the women\u2019s restroom in a wheelchair, but there are still the stupid doors to wrangle \u2026", "outgoing_links": ["http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2009/03/hmmmmmmm.html", "http://cripwheels.blogspot.com/2009/05/windshield-writing.html#comments", "http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:yMzHo8S95c8J:butyoudontlooksick.com/navigation/BYDLS-TheSpoonTheory.pdf+spoon+theory&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/cartfuls-of-spoons/", "title": "Cartfuls of Spoons"},

Unless you are calling me (as some of my students with behavior disorders do) a \u201cfucking bitch\u201d or something equally blatant, I\u2019m not going to assume that speaking plainly is meant to be an affront.I will confess that (even into my late 40\u2019s) I am still sorting out the reasons why people say the things they do:\nThere\u2019s the \u201csocial noise\u201d that is meant as non-confrontational space-time filler, to promote social ease in a sort of verbal grooming behavior or stress-displacement behavior.\nThere\u2019s the exchange of opinions and veiled insults meant to establish or maintain odd social status arrangements. (I understand what those are, but I really don\u2019t understand why they exist, aside from the practical necessities of organisational status for allocating responsibilities.)\nThere are the jokes, compliments, and stories meant to promote inclusion and establish group identity by creating a culture of common experiences, affirmation of values, and recognition of effort.\nThere\u2019s the philosophical or creative exchange of ideas, including word play, humor, and problem solving.\nThen there are the murkier forms of communication that I have trouble fathoming, even when I can (after a few minutes or days\u2019 consideration), identify what is going on.\u00a0 These include the more oblique types of flirting, the affective persuasion of political campaigning (including the sort that happens at work and other organisations), and other mysterious interchanges that involve even less emphasis on word choice, and more upon paraverbal and nonverbal delivery.\u00a0 (\u201cParaverbal\u201d is how the words are said, the inflections; \u201cnonverbal\u201d is the accompanying body language.)\u00a0 I\u2019m actually not sure what these are, but sometimes I can sense that something more is going on, and I\u2019m not sure just what it is that I am missing.At school, I spend all day surrounded by people who are constantly negotiating with each other to get what they want or feel they need at the moment (what in Functional Behavioral Analysis is described in the dichotomy of providing a means to Get/Obtain or Protest/Escape/Avoid).\u00a0 A lot of the interpersonal transactions are fairly simple to understand, as most of the students lack subtlety.\u00a0 At the garden center, the focus of my interactions revolve around the transmission of factual information, and the curious scripts of commerce that combine both \u201ccheerful servant\u201d and \u201cautocratic cashier\u201d.\u00a0 The latter set is usually easier, and I\u2019m even beginning to pick up on the \u201cThank you,\u201d that really means, \u201cI don\u2019t need any more information now\u201d.But after interacting with people for twelve hours a day, I find that my brain turns to mush from the burdens of doing my physical jobs with focusing lots of working memory on perceiving, analysing, and replying to all the heavily-coded and loaded talktalktalk.Sometimes I miss the simplicity of working in a lab, where one could spend their day simply transmitting facts.Of course, I later found that even that was a misperception.\u00a0 There was all the office politics going on just at the edge of my radar, and there was the inevitable problem of others assigning meanings to my para/nonverbals that I was not really intending to transmit, and there was the third problem of others being annoyed or dissappointed because I had not picked up on their para/nonverbals and thus missed a large chunk of what they \u201creally meant\u201d.Life would be so much simpler if people would just mean what they say, and say what they mean!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/all-we-want-are-the-facts-maam/", "title": "\u201cAll we want are the facts, ma\u2019am.\u201d"},

I am divorcing him.Disabilities can change how the processes of falling in love, joining, living together, loving together, and separating happen.For most disabled people, their disabilities affect how others perceive them as even being interested or capable to find love or sex. (WTF?!)For many disabled people, their disabilities can even change whether or not others afford them even the opportunities to find love or sex. (Again, WTF?!)Although my husband and I both have disabilities that have changed how we are employed, communicate with each other and others, parent our children, or even sleep together (literally and figuratively), the divorce had nothing to do with our disabilities.\u00a0 It\u2019s just about the usual sorts of moral failings that can lead to divorce (even after the sensible year of counselling to assay changes).Because in the end, love and sex do not happen because people are able or disabled.\u00a0 They happen because all people are people.\u00a0 And when love and sex quit, they happen because all people are people.\u00a0 Just people.\u00a0 Like everyone else.This post is (slightly belated) part of Dave Hingsburger\u2019s \u201cSexy Bloggers\u201d blog carnival on disabilities and love/sexuality, over at his blog, Chewing the Fat.", "outgoing_links": ["http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2009/02/sexy-bloggers.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/for-the-first-time-in-28-years/", "title": "For the first time in 28\u00a0years"},

But gluten-intolerant woman cannot live on iceberg lettuce and a bottle of flavored water.If I\u2019m lucky on the days of these communal-noshing events, I sit there and nom on a gluten-free energy bar I keep for such emergencies, or what might be leftover from my previous day\u2019s sack lunch.I hate to sound picky; I know that it\u2019s hard to feed 50 or more people economically.\u00a0 But staring down a long buffet table and seeing nothing but dishes like chicken noodle or French onion soup, mini quiches, spreads on crackers, soft tacos, fried fish or chicken with batter or breading, meatloaf, pasta salad, lasagne, macaroni & cheese, casseroles, onion rings, breadsticks, rolls, and of course, cake, cookies, brownies or pies, is dispiriting.\u00a0 Do I want to stand in a slow line to end up with a meager plate bearing a couple slices of cheese, a few under-ripe strawberries and some overcooked green beans?\u00a0 I sure as hell do if all I had to eat earlier was that lettuce, and maybe a packet of chips (crisps) or chocolate bar from the vending machine.Sure, I\u2019m just one person in a crowd, and sure, diabetics, vegetarians and people with allergies also have to carefully navigate the catering.\u00a0 (Heck, I don\u2019t technically have coeliac, I just get gassy and loose stools, so I try to avoid eating more than a couple bites of wheat, especially when stuck all day in long meetings or on trans-Atlantic flights.\u00a0 We\u2019re all much happier this way, trust me.)But it\u2019s really, really hard to find anything to eat that\u2019s not based on wheat.\u00a0 Frankly, just eating the cheese off a slice of pizza is not very satisfying, and I appear picky in the wrong way.\u00a0 The one time when I tried the school cafeteria\u2019s \u201cchicken patty\u201d sans bun, I later realised with distress that the protein in the processed poultry patty was probably boosted by gluten. Semolina (pasta flour) and couscous are just more words for wheat, as is bulghur salad.\u00a0 Even innocent-sounding cornbread and buckwheat pancakes are still mostly made from wheat flour.I\u2019ve only been working here three years, but I would appreciate being able to share in the annual catered lunch, or enjoy a treat at the weekly meeting more often than the once-a-year happenstance when there is ice cream.I guess that I should start bringing refreshments to meetings.  It\u2019s just that we now have more people in our department, anything nice or gluten-free is expensive, and I can barely pay my bills.Curiously, at one of my previous jobs there were a lot more rice-based dishes at events.\u00a0 That\u2019s because we were a more international bunch of folks, who were incidentally, researching pest-resistant crop lines.

I now have removed a cubic meter of paperness from our house, and transferred a few hundred books from one room to another.  I still have the virus (or maybe a second one, as our students have not the best hygiene), but not the second job.(Now, if anyone is looking for an experienced secondary or college tutor or after-school care for special-needs children, let me know via andreasbuzzing care of my gmail account.)But aside from all that, there have been some thought-provoking ups and downs in the news that I don\u2019t want to let pass before they become \u201colds\u201d:In an brief article in the New York Times, researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine studied some 11,000 third-grade students, and found that recess helps improve behavioral problems, and that many children don\u2019t get enough recess.  We would all expect this to be in the category of \u201cno shit!\u201d news, but we also know that such assumptions don\u2019t officially exist until someone has done a decent study proving such.  So there you are:  give your students recess before we all go Nutz, and don\u2019t deprive them of recess as a punishment!Moving right along \u2026 as reported in the Orange County Register, Connie Kasari, an educational psychologist at UCLA discovered that six weeks of social skills training with autistic children does not help tremendously, but that what does help is \u2026 (get this) \u2026 teaching their typical peers how to be good friends.  Basically, one cannot heap the onus of the social adaptation upon the autistic child, because they do not socialise in a vaccuum.  Gee, imagine that!On the other hand, I observed from a flashy piece on CNN.com, that if you call education \u201ctherapy\u201d, then you can charge as much as $20,000 a week.  Also, if you package a promotional piece as an amazing and heart-wrenching news story, you can get lots of high-exposure press.  ($20,000 a week!  Wow, that\u2019s more than I make in a year; I must be doing something wrong.)Totally unrelated to the realm of special education is this from the UK.\u00a0 The notoriously homophobic Westboro Baptist Church aims to picket at a production of The Laramie Project being done in Hampshire.\u00a0 The Telegraph chose to offer paper pulp space for Shirley Phelps-Roper, who went on for a number of paragraphs in this vein:But your goofy queen and her adulterous whore of a son \u2013 YIKES    put their hand and you all put your hands to mischief at every turn.The antichrist is sitting now, in the Whitehouse, the time is SO SHORT \u2013 the Lord    is coming and this generation is DOOMED!Fortunately the BBC reassures us that the UK Border Agency isn\u2019t letting members of the WBC into the country.\u201cBoth these individuals have engaged in unacceptable behaviour by inciting hatred against a number of communities.\u201cWe will continue to stop those who want to spread extremism, hatred and violent messages in our communities from coming to our country.\u201cThe exclusions policy is targeted at all those who seek to stir up tension and provoke others to violence regardless of their origins and beliefs.\u201dI would like to extend my apologies as an American to the entire United Kingdom:\u00a0 I\u2019m sorry our country manages to produce such bilious twits, and thank you for helping hold up the front against extremists.Speaking of the BBC, apparently there are some parents who just can\u2019t deal with the idea that a children\u2019s show host only has one hand:Nine official complaints have so far been lodged with the BBC \u2013 plus many more blog postings \u2013 about 29-year-old children\u2019s television presenter Cerrie Burnell, who was born with only one hand. Parents have complained that they cannot let their children watch her because the sight will \u201cpossibly cause sleep problems\u201d, that she is scaring toddlers, and that they are being forced to discuss the issue of disability with their offspring before they are ready.I\u2019m not familiar with the show(s) being referred to as we watch the BBC programmes for adults.\u00a0 But to be honest, even after glancing over the photograph, I had to read the text of the story to find out just what the foofaraw was about, because a one-handed person is just not that bizarre.\u00a0 (Uncommon, yes.\u00a0 Bizarre, no.\u00a0 Easier for the faceblind person to identify, very much so.)\u00a0 As editorialist Lucy Mangan points out, it\u2019s not the children who are having problems, it\u2019s the parents.Young children are not inherently scared of disability and difference, merely curious.\u00a0 Furthermore, providing simple explanations is all that\u2019s necessary, because for small children, everything in the world is novel.\u00a0 Novel, and more often than not, interesting instead of scary \u2026 just ask Dave Hingsburger.So in the end, what\u2019s the point to all these stories?\u00a0 That there are foolish, mean-hearted people everywhere, and we needn\u2019t give in to them.\u00a0 And that children need to play, and to be taught how to be good friends with each other.\u00a0 Epecially so they grow up to be adults who know how to be friends with each other.andrea,\nbuzzing off to tend to her own beeswax", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/03/health/research/03chil.html?ref=science", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/autism-kids-one-2295344-social-children", "http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/04/autism.resolution/index.html", "The Laramie Project at a school theatre in Basingstoke, Hampshire", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/7898972.stm", "http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/feb/24/cerrie-burnell-tv-disability-cbeebies?commentpage=2", "http://davehingsburger.blogspot.com/2009/02/jacksons-lesson.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/02/25/piques-and-valleys/", "title": "Piques and Valleys"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t15 March 2009 ", "body": "The other night we were holding vigil in the ER (A&E) waiting rooms while a family member was being treated.\u00a0 Having spent plenty of hours in the waiting places of life, I had brought with me my latest amusement, a sorting box containing a bunch of old necklaces that I was dismantling for salvageable parts.\u00a0 Aside from the whole reason for being in the waiting room, it was a pleasant experience, and I sat there rocking slightly, filled with the delight of organising bits into rainbow order.I parked myself in an empty waiting area down the hall from the seats by the ER entrance, free of drafts from the automatic doors, the distractions of anxious people bursting in, and germ-laden sneezes.\u00a0 I sat there snipping strings, slipping off beads where they rattled into a tray, sorting them, scooping the pieces into small containers, and carefully snapping lids shut.So I was sitting there at a table where I could keep an eye on the hallway, when a guy shuffled into my airspace.\u00a0 The first thing I noticed about him was that he reeked of old cigarette smoke and looked disheveled, which I discounted slightly as no one spiffs up for ER visits.\u00a0 As he began talking to me, I noticed that his speech and comprehension were a bit off, and quickly realised this wasn\u2019t likely a manifestation of an intrinsic impairment \u2014 the grungy bloke was drunk.Oh, joys ( /sarcasm).\u00a0 I don\u2019t like chit-chat*, and here I was being engaged by a garrulous drunkard.\u00a0 We then had the most incredible conversation, which he began by asking me,\u201cAre you counting pills for the pharmacy?\u201d(Yeah, this was my first clue that the guy was drunk.)\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorting beads to make jewelry.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d he answered, coming near to look at my materials, \u201cthat must be very [garble].\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cTherra-pyoo-tic,\u201d he enunciated and hazarded, \u201cYou do ther\u2019py with patients.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201dOoh, I thought to myself, you\u2019re assuming anyone doing craftwork at a table is a \u201ctherapist\u201d \u2014 I bet you\u2019ve spent time in institutions. I notched up my mental assessment from \u201cdrunk\u201d to \u201cpossibly chronic alcoholic\u201d.  (Yes, I was leaping to conclusions.  On the other hand, one does meet a rather motley assortment of characters during late weekend nights in the ER.  Making these quick assessments by observations is part of how I keep myself safe when out in the community.)I bent over my next pile of mixed beads to sort them out, hoping he would wander off and take his malodorous miasma with him.\u201cYou\u2019re make\u2019 those [garble] for patients?\u201dApparently he had not noticed that I was wearing casual clothes, not an official Hospital Volunteer smock.  My monosyllabic reply was then responded with a rambling tale that had no discernible point, and sometimes lacked key parts of speech.  He sat down across from me, and I graciously pulled my purse out of the way, onto the floor by my feet.Snip, carefully pull beads off strings, sort, sort, sort.\u201cIt\u2019s really boring hangin around waiting.  I\u2019m waiting for an x-er\u2019ray to see if my ribs are broke.  Or maybe bruised. Broken.  Or fuctrac \u2026 fruck \u2014 cracked.  I hurt \u2019em at work.  Do lots of work. With stone.

Build\u2019 work with stone now.\u201dOh thank heavens, a conversational angle.\u201cDo you work with ashlar?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cDressed stone; it\u2019s faceted for even sides.\u201d\n\u201cI build things with limestone blocks.  Theys cut all even.  Have to use a diamond saw to cut them.\u201d\n\u201cA diamond saw?  But I thought limestone was low on the Mohs?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cMohs Scale \u2014 how hard rock is.  Isn\u2019t limestone like a 3 or 4?\u201dI was remembering all the native limestone bricks you see in century-old buildings; the farmers and masons were not using diamond-toothed saws to mill those blocks!  (Today I looked it up limestone; calcium carbonate is a 3 on the Mohs Scale, a relatively soft rock.)At this point it seemed that he was really drunk, an ignorant hired hand, was spinning confabulations, or some combination of the above.  Why me? I mentally asked the universe, I don\u2019t like chit-chat and here I am with a garrulous drunkard. Apparently the conversational topic of mineralogy was too geeky, and to my relief he informed me that he was going to check on his x-ray.Later on, my daughter (who was waiting by Triage) informed me that he had been bothering the the ER staff, and they had told him to go elsewhere to wait for his radiography results.  So I guess that\u2019s Why Me.  (I sure seem to spend a lot of my life keeping nudniks productively occupied so others can do their jobs.)I finished my sorting after I got home.\u00a0 It took a while, especially as I had a particularly unexpected and spastic motor tic, and flipped a whole 2cc box of seed beads all over the kitchen floor.\u00a0 \u201cSeed\u201d beads are as tiny as yellow mustard seeds, and the pale beads mingled in with the fragments of catnip, stray pieces of kibble, dustbunnies of cat hair, toast crumbs, and the other debris one finds on kitchen floors a few days after the last sweeping.I learned several important tips about working with itsy-bitsy beads:\nWork on a felt mat, instead of\u00a0 a hard table that makes dropped beads bounce every-bloody-where.\nA small, thin, antique sugar spoon is a great for scooping up minuscule beads.\nVacuum the kitchen floor before working; you always spot the gold spacer beads just before they are sucked up the nozzle of the cannister vac.\u00a0 :: sigh ::\nDon\u2019t just store beads in boxes; put those boxes into bigger boxes and put those bigger boxes into a zippered bag, locked attache case, or drawer. As I discovered this morning, despite lacking opposable thumbs, Bad Kitties can open up wee boxes that challenge Arthritic Woman.\u00a0 Muchas Oys. \nBut O, what a wondrous thing is a case full of lovingly organised, beautiful beads.\u00a0 Just watch out for drunkards and kitties!* The good news is that waiting room chit-chat is much less demanding than party chit-chat; it\u2019s actually a good time to practice your \u201csympathetic noise\u201d scripts, or more advanced skills in Responsive Listening.", "outgoing_links": ["http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/enterprise-solutions/what-the-heck-is-responsive-listening-10645"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/03/15/itsy-bitsy/", "title": "Itsy-Bitsy"},

Not surprisingly, treatments with higher price tags make patients feel better, even when there are not any differences in the treatments, nor even when the treatments are just placebos!\u00a0 Per research by Waber et al., (\u201cCommercial Features of Placebo and Therapeutic Efficacy\u201d)These results are consistent with described phenomena of commercial variables affecting quality expectations and expectations influencing therapeutic efficacy. Placebo responses to commercial features have many potential clinical implications. For example, they may help explain the popularity of high-cost medical therapies (eg, cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors) over inexpensive, widely available alternatives (eg,  over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and why patients switching from branded medications may report that their generic equivalents are less effective.In other words, patients perceive more expensive treatment as being more effective.\u00a0 This is in many parts \u201cresearch as confirmation of what we already know\u201d, also known as \u201cA Duh! Study\u201d.\u00a0 (Which is why it was in the 2008 Ig Nobel Awards.)\u00a0 However, this preference for expensive treatments can also be a post-purchase rationalization, where we have the unconscious tendency to rationalize why the things we have paid for were such good choices.Human beings are subject to a large number of cognitive fallacies and biases of judgment.\u00a0 We unconsciously deceive ourselves in a number of ways, which is why scientists must use randomized, double-blinded, and repeatable studies with falsifiable hypotheses. (The word \u201cfalsifiable\u201d is somewhat confusing or misleading; it simply means that the hypotheses can be proven wrong, which is statistically safer than trying to prove them correct.)Our brains love to find patterns \u2014 that\u2019s how we make sense of all the sensory input we\u2019re bombarded with \u2014 but we will also see patterns even when they don\u2019t exist.\u00a0 Even the most earnestly objective researcher can misinterpret incomplete data, or give more attention to data that supports their hypothesis than that which doesn\u2019t.\u00a0 This is why double-blinded studies are important, so neither the study subjects nor the data gatherers know who is in the treatment or the control groups.Naturally, shysters will take advantage of people by manipulating these various misperceptions.\u00a0 That hefty price tag is part of the explanation for why woomeisters are able to peddle hellaciously expensive but dubious \u201ccures\u201d and \u201ctreatments\u201d for various conditions, disorders and actual illnesses. It doesn\u2019t even matter if a condition (such as autism) is primarily genetic and thus incurable.\u00a0 (Note that some things like ADHD may sometimes be treated to reduce some of the effects or to lessen stresses; treatments are different than \u201ccures\u201d.)Those \u201cmaverick\u201d medics (and pseudo-medics) are also selling themselves, with their fables of how they nobly struggle against the status quo, Big Pharma, and everyone else who disagrees with their unproven claims or points out the lack of solid evidence for what they\u2019re selling. Such self-described authorities encourage their clients to give their recommendations authority bias that goes beyond what is given to ordinary doctors.Confirmation bias also plays into these scenarios, where clients will notice and remember any signs that the treatment might be working.\u00a0 Indeed, subject-expectancy effects can create positive outcomes that would not have otherwise happened.\u00a0 Patients will also assign any improvements to the treatment, even when those outcomes are no better than they would be without the treatment. Clients may also over-report improvements because they feel the need to be a \u201cgood patient\u201d, thus earning positive reinforcement.In addition to these natural biases that allow patients or clients to fall prey to sciency-sounding shysters, there is a whole other set of reasons why patients may reinforce each other to continue believing in the false promises of bunk cures, even when their own personal lack of results shows otherwise.\u00a0 But that\u2019s a post for another day.", "outgoing_links": ["http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299/9/1016", "http://improbable.com/ig/ig-pastwinners.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/01/03/with-a-price-tag-like-that-you-know-its-whats-best/", "title": "With a price tag like that, you know it\u2019s what\u2019s\u00a0best"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 January 2009", "body": "\nA few summers ago, right in the middle of my graduate programme, I was hit with Mono and Lyme. Taking a shower was exhausting. I kept falling asleep in statistics classes, and in the lab where I tried to work. Putting thoughts together in any of my research analysis or writing, or even learning new concepts, was like stringing beads while wearing heavy ski mittens.\nEven after submitting a letter from the doctor to my department head, he couldn\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t get things done, and when he did see me around, why I was staggering around and looking like \u201cdeath warmed over\u201d. He was of course, operating on the Willpower/ Mind Over Matter principle, where all one really needed was just More Determination. (And this was even in a biological science, where you\u2019d think they would have some kind of clue!)\nI got over the diseases. A couple of the most important things I learned from that whole experience were tied to Paula Kamen\u2019s lovely book, \u201cAll in my head: an epic quest to cure an unrelenting, totally unreasonable, and only slightly enlightening HEADACHE\u201d. One important thought is: \u201cThere is a difference between getting cured and getting healed.\u201d Another is:  \u201cAcceptance is not the same thing as resignation.\u201d\nI also got a crash course in how little empathy some people have in real life, compared to the words that come out of their mouths. Of course, it was hardly the first (or last) time I had experienced such in life, just an event when things were painted with such broad strokes.\nWeird thing is, the official word is that autistics lack empathy.\u00a0 That\u2019s the line, but there are plenty of people who beg to differ.In an NPR interview, Temple Grandin had this to say about empathy:Normal people have an incredible lack of empathy. They have good emotional empathy, but they don\u2019t have much empathy for the autistic kid who is screaming at the baseball game because he can\u2019t stand the sensory overload. Or the autistic kid having a meltdown in the school cafeteria because there\u2019s too much stimulation. I\u2019m frustrated with the inability of normal people to have sensory empathy. They can\u2019t seem to acknowledge these different realities because they\u2019re so far away from their own experiences.Unlike someone with Antisocial Personality Disorder (sociopathy) or Narcissistic Personality Disorder who truly does lack much real empathy, the autistic person does not really lack empathy.  Rather, they do not respond in ways that demonstrate empathy in typically recognisable fashion.  This is in contrast to those sociopaths, bullies and narcissists that may demonstrate a lot of the shallow social-noise that appears to be sympathetic, but on the deeper level is really more about manipulation to gain something for themselves, rather than true empathy.Just because someone doesn\u2019t respond in the expected manner, that does not mean they lack the feelings we associate with those responses.The term \u201cempathy\u201d is one of those words that carries several meanings, and is used in different ways.  This conflation of meaning results in things like this issue of the Asperger\u2019s/autistic person being described as \u201clacking empathy\u201d.  Plenty of parents, spouses, other family members and close friends will assert that despite diagnostic criteria, their person \u201creally is loving\u201d and \u201cshows empathy\u201d and demonstrates both passion and compassion.So what\u2019s going on here with this definition, and in the person?\u00a0 Things like:\nperceiving other\u2019s distress\nidentifying the feelings being experienced\ndiscerning probable causes\nbeing able to identify with such situations\nBeing able to identify one\u2019s own feelings can be hard because people demonstrate feelings in different ways:If I don\u2019t react like that other person, does that mean I\u2019m not experiencing the same feeling? Or, if I  don\u2019t react to the same situation in the same way, does that mean I don\u2019t have feelings, or that I\u2019m having the \u201cwrong\u201d feelings?There are also glitches that can happen in responding to someone else\u2019s situation.\u00a0 There can be timing issues, especially when auditory processing glitches occurs.\u00a0 Delays can happen from figuring out what was going on, before going back and responding to the person about the situation.Sometimes the hitch is figuring out how to communicate that empathetic response.\u00a0 In a curiously autistic manner, this is sometimes expressed as describing how they had a similar kind of situation, where the emotional response that is in common may not necessarily be explicitly expressed but is inferred. Unfortunately, to a lot of neurotypicals this comes off as being \u201cself-involved\u201d because the autistic person is talking about theirself, when what they\u2019re really trying to do is to connect with you by describing how they can understand and empathise with what you\u2019re experiencing, as they have had similar things happen. It\u2019s just that the response does not use the typical social word-fluff, the stock sympathy phrases.  In some ways, this autistic response is more genuine, because it\u2019s coming from personal experience and from the heart, rather than someone responding with trite sayings.  But because they are not producing those expected responses, their responses are not interpreted \u2013or perceived \u2014 in the same way.Part of empathy is about being sympathetic \u2014 one understands another\u2019s plight, and feels badly for them.  Being sympathetic means that one has to recognise what\u2019s going on, and what the other person is feeling.  If we have trouble picking up on the sources and types of distress, then it\u2019s hard to respond.  It\u2019s not that we can\u2019t tell someone is upset; we\u2019re just not sure why.  Sometimes the lack of response is that we have tried to express our sympathies before, but because we\u2019ve somehow done so \u201cthe wrong way\u201d, we\u2019re uncertain about how we\u2019re supposed to do it the \u201cright way\u201d.Sometimes the issue is not decoding or expressing the sympathy, but is about being too empathetic!  Some people are almost hypersensitive to others\u2019 moods, and either the pure empathetic stress is so strong that one nearly or does have a meltdown or shutdown, or one is so overwhelmed that trying to communicate the sympathy can be difficult because of the intensity of the feelings being shared.   Many children who have AD/HD and/or who are very smart can have this sort of reaction.Children or students who are described as doing better with those those teachers or therapists who are calm and happy, are usually those who are being very sensitive to their moods.  If those children are autistic, descriptions for being \u201csensitive\u201d as meaning sympathetic or empathetic may not be used; they may be described as being \u201csensitive\u201d in the sense that they are emotionally volatile and prone to having shutdowns or meltdowns.The children are responding to the emotions of the people in their environment, but do not have the internal resources to understand, and relate with the person, and cope (more) successfully with the overwhelming input and internal responses.  (Having a shutdown is somewhat a more successful coping method, at least compared to having a meltdown.  But the person is still being overwhelmed, and unable to function.)Sometimes people who are so empathetically hypersensitive will eventually deal with this by overcompensating to the point that they try to wall off all that emotional barrage, and block their own like responses.  The young child who was an emotional roller-coaster that turns into the stony-faced teen who resists or avoids all the emotional scenes may be trying to cope in such a manner.Have that child be in a family where the culture of the \u201cmicrosystem\u201d is highly affective, where the coin of connectedness revolves around the \u201cappropriate\u201dexpression and reciprocity of emotional states, and the relationships of the family members with the child will become strained because the person is \u201cdoing it all wrong\u201d.\u00a0 This sort of thing is evident in the \u201cAutism Every Day\u201d video (as described by MOM-NOS), where children are seen hugging their moms even as the women talk about their autistic children never demonstrating affection.\u00a0 (As Paula Kamen said, \u201cAcceptance is not the same thing as resignation.\u201d)Just because someone doesn\u2019t respond in the expected manner, that does not mean they lack the feelings we associate with those responses.\u00a0 If you cannot see that autistic people do indeed have empathy, then possibly you are not perceiving their distress, identifying the feelings being experienced, discerning probable causes, and being able to identify with such situations.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/All-Head-Unrelenting-Unreasonable-Enlightening/dp/0738210390/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231818958&sr=8-1", "http://www.amazon.com/All-Head-Unrelenting-Unreasonable-Enlightening/dp/0738210390/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1231818958&sr=8-1", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5488844", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urie_Bronfenbrenner", "http://momnos.blogspot.com/2006/07/alternate-view-of-autism-every-day.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/you-just-dont-get-it/", "title": "You just don\u2019t get\u00a0it"},

Parents may feel these things at times, and for any number of things, including the sleep-deprivation of newborn care, or even dropping your child off for the first day of preschool or Kindergarten and experiencing the fallout of separation anxiety.\u00a0 But the process of receiving a diagnosis is described like slogging through of an abyss of despair, with the \u201c4 Stages\u201d listed as 1.Denial, 2.Anger, 3.Grief, 4.Acceptance.A problem with riffing on these \u201cstages of loss\u201d (familiar to anyone who has taken Psych 101), is that although there is evidence that many people do experience such upon receiving various diagnoses, the very presence of articles such as this may serve to reinforce the despair as much as they seek to lighten it.How so?\u00a0 Firstly, many people in various support industries related to disability (including educational and social work realms) are taught that people will go through these grieving stages, so they may understand why and how people experience such, and therefore how to support them.\u00a0 Unfortunately, this means that they expect people to go through these stages, so don\u2019t realise that not everyone does, nor even needs to.Secondly, while articles like this help parents (and others) understand such feelings, they can also magnify such feelings, or even reinforce or create such feelings.\u00a0 Well of course, it\u2019s only natural you\u2019re going to feel that way, and of course you will also experience all this other Sturm und Drang.\u00a0 Likewise, support groups and discussion boards are rife with such.\u00a0 Although they allow people to vent frustration and commiserate, they can also perpetuate and sometimes increase such despair.In novel situations, people will pick up the social clues about how they are \u201csupposed\u201d to act and feel, and the clues can magnify or squelch the original actions and feelings.\u00a0 These social clues come from articles, news stories, books, radio and television programs, online videos, blogs, discussion boards, local support groups, even conversations with others in the local community.\u00a0 In other words, social expectations can create self-fulfilling prophecies, \u201cMy kid\u2019s just been diagnosed with autism (ADHD, dyslexia, APD etc.), so now I\u2019m heart-broken and my life will never be the same.\u201dShockingly, such stages of grief are not automatic, and not everyone goes through them.\u00a0 Support workers should also know that if someone is not exhibiting such grief stages, that does not automatically mean they are \u201cin denial\u201d \u2014 they may already be in acceptance and have skipped the crisis altogether.Guess what:\u00a0 getting a diagnosis may not be a \u201ccrisis\u201d at all!\u00a0 Yes, it will be a major life event, a turning point.\u00a0 It will be the culmination of many ups and downs, and the corner turned that initiates many other ups and downs (such is life). But it doesn\u2019t have to be a crisis.Here are four stages you might go through instead.\u00a0 Keep in mind that these aren\u2019t linear \u2014 you don\u2019t necessarily start at 1 and go sequentially to 2 then 3 and end up at 4.\u00a0 Rather, you may find yourself switching between or even experiencing a couple at the same time (think of overlapping sets in a Venn diagram, rather than a number line).ReliefOh, thank goodness!\u00a0 Things finally make sense.\u00a0 \u201cOf course! Why didn\u2019t we figure this out sooner?\u201d\u00a0 Over time, with our new information we realise that a lot of other things make more sense, too.\u00a0 *whew*ValidationYou knew that something was different, and now you have an Official Diagnosis to show your extended family, friends, neighbors, school, or office that, \u201cYes, I\u2019m not being lazy, stupid, or hypochondriac.\u201d (And yes, I actually know what I\u2019m talking about, more often than not.)MomentumA shiny new diagnosis gives you the means to move forwards and get some assistance, accommodations, treatment, medication, or whatever else is appropriate in your case.\u00a0 You are now un-stuck from the limbo of the have-suspicions-but-undiagnosed.\u00a0 Whee, progress!\u00a0 \u201cOutta my way, sob-sister, I got things to do and people to be \u2026 we are gonna effect some positive change here.\u201dCamaraderie\u201cHey, I\u2019m not alone!\u00a0 There are other people out here dealing with the same issues!\u201d They can help me figure out how to do things, how to get what I need, and I can learn from them so I don\u2019t have to re-invent the wheel.\u00a0 Plus, they provide moral support when I\u2019m down, and an ear when I need to bitch, and they will serve as reality-checks and let me know when I\u2019m being foolish or spouting off nonsense.PROGRESS:\u00a0 YOU MIGHT BE GETTING IN THE WAY\n(instead of leading)Several large bison blocking a dirt road", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.4-healthcare.info/2008/11/childs-autism-diagnosis-4-stages-you.html", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/bison1.jpg"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/11/26/4-stages-you-dont-have-to-go-through/", "title": "4 Stages You Don\u2019t Have to Go\u00a0Through"},

(links to show posted on YouTube; Rudolph introduced at 4:06.)\u00a0 There was always something unsettling about the whole story of this reindeer with the glowing nose, and it wasn\u2019t until late in my own high school years that I figured it out.No one liked Rudolph because he was different.\u00a0 In the beginning, his family tries to hide his nonconformity, covering up his nose with mud, but then Rudolph talks funny from the congestion.\u00a0 Still, it is deemed better that Rudolph be perceived as talking funny, than for everyone to actually know the truth.\u00a0 Eventually the disguise breaks down, and Rudolph\u2019s glaring, glowing nose is revealed in the rough-and-tumble of playground mischief.\u00a0 Everyone is horrified.\u00a0 They always are when someone tries to \u201cpass for normal\u201d and is eventually outed.\u00a0 People feel deceived, because the Other was not what they thought.The reindeer games coach orders Rudolph away. So shunned, he leaves his North Pole village, joining up with another misfit, Herbie the elf, who wanted to be, oh horror, a dentist rather than a toy-maker.A few years later there is a Christmas eve of such epically foggy proportions that Santa Claus cannot make his usual gift-giving rounds.\u00a0 Santa realizes that he can still do so if Rudolph is allowed to lead.\u00a0 Eventually everyone decides to tolerate the mutant reindeer, perhaps accept Rudolph a little bit, but only because he can be useful to them, lighting the way for Santa\u2019s sleigh.\u00a0 (Herbie gets to be a dentist, another occupation that is tolerable because it is useful to the others, rather than because Herbie has a passion for dental care.)The program was made in the early 1960\u2019s, coming off of the ultra-conformism of the 1950\u2019s.\u00a0 Everyone thought it was cute and sweet.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t explain the intrinsic discomfort I felt as a child, not from viewing that particular show, or even in everyday life.\u00a0 Nor could I explain why I identified so strongly with Rudolph or for that matter, the alien Spock from \u201cStar Trek\u201d.\u00a0 When the neighbor girls compared me to the Professor from \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d, I couldn\u2019t understand why that wouldn\u2019t be a compliment \u2013 he was the only sensible one of the castaways!\u00a0 But even the Professor, a quintessent geek (though thankfully neither of the foolish nor ugly duckling sort), was the odd one out.The telethon poster child or \u201codd team-mate\u201d is held up in the same way, but also held away at arm\u2019s length, and Othered.\u00a0 We\u2019ll let him be on the team in an accessory manner because it makes us feel munificent, and because he might be exceptionally good at something we need.\u00a0 (Were he merely mediocre, or even near or at the bottom of the list for overall skills, would he be on the team?)But the mere fact that a team-mate is known more for being different than for any aptitude or acquired skill, and even the fact that stories about such people are circulated as ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! and exceptional shows that pity is still stronger than acceptance.The problem with pity is that it creates division; it puts distance between people.Pity prevents respect by implying inferiority; there is a humiliating lack of worth, because the person is defined by what they cannot do instead of what they can do.\u00a0 Victims receive pity \u2013 but nobody wants to be a victim!Pity is disempowering.\u00a0 It does not decrease burdens by sharing resources and abilities. The people who see only the \u201cbroken\u201d part are uncomfortable; that discomfort is a kind of Schadenfreude, a sense of relief that the bad thing (the disability) did not happen to you.Pity is like magical thinking, where people want to give Fate some kind of token payment to avoid similar disaster from befalling them.Pity is similar to both fear of the other, and to contempt for the Other; the Other must somehow have done something bad, and \u201cdeserved\u201d their fate (as given to our social mores from the Puritan ethos).\u00a0 Either way, it is dismissive of the person\u2019s concerns, and denies their opinions, and their own personal view of reality.Pity is not the same thing as compassion, where the other person is seen as being similar to one\u2019s self, and is identified by who they are, is known for what they can do, and is accepted as being a worthwhile person to play with or work with, and to know and to love.\u201cBecause he has been so devoted to the team, for the last game of the season, Coach Johnson actually decided to let Jason suit up \u2013 not to let him play necessarily, just to let him feel what it\u2019s like to wear a jersey,\u201d says the newscaster.::BARF::Meanwhile, too many people work endlessly hard at trying to \u201cpass for normal\u201d. The problem with pretending to be normal is that it gives power to the paradigm, to this concept of normalcy.\u00a0 As long as the person is pretending to be whatever kind of average-normal they are not, they are devaluing themselves and allowing others to devalue them, and they are handing over their personal power to the realm of the imaginary Normal people.Normal, average people are imaginary, because no-one is wholly average and normal.\u00a0 However, the imaginary-normal people are a very real majority group.\u00a0 They all pretend to be normal, and en masse they have majority power under that paradigm.Wow, isn\u2019t it absolutely amazing!\u00a0 Autistics can play basketball.\u00a0 Next thing you know, they\u2019ll let Negroes or women play basketball \u2026Feh.", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fw1CcxCUgg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVkyaeAGh9w&feature=related"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/12/24/the-return-of-rudolph/", "title": "The return of\u00a0Rudolph"},

Using a study to examine the decision-making in autistic and neurotypical subjects, they found that the former were less likely to be swayed by \u201cframing effects\u201d in the opportunity descriptions.\u201cPeople with autism tended to be more consistent in their pattern of choices, their greater attention to detail perhaps helping them avoid being swayed by their emotions,\u201d says Dr Neil Harrison.Although this attention to detail and a reduced influence of emotion during decision making is beneficial in some situations, it may be a handicap in daily life, explains Dr Benedetto De Martino.\u201cDuring social interactions a lot of information must be processed simultaneously, making this a very complicated computational task for the brain,\u201d he says. \u201cTo solve these complex problems we rely on simplifying heuristics \u2013 gut instincts \u2013 rather than extensive logical reasoning. However, the price that we seem to pay for this ability is that sometimes irrelevant contextual information leads us to make inconsistent or illogical choices.\u201cLess reliance on gut instincts by people with autism may underlie their difficulties in social situations, but also enable them to avoid potentially irrelevant emotional information and make more consistent choices.\u201dAs ever, it helps to remember that the benefits or problems associated with skewed skill sets will always be affected by how necessary or valued are those skill sets.\u00a0 The important part is to enable people by arranging their (home, job & school) workloads that will utilise their skills, rather than accentuate their deficits.\u00a0 After all, we all have skills and deficits \u2014 some of us have more pronounced skills and/or deficits.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2008/WTX051031.htm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/10/17/yes-they-really-are-irrational/", "title": "Yes, they really are\u00a0irrational"},

Despite the many thoughtful improvements that have been publicly documented for creating better and more accessible environments, the initial architecture and resulting construction of many office and classroom setups continue to run on the default setting of inertia-by-tradition.\u00a0 That\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done it.Even trying to protest the inherent problems, and self-advocate to get some kind of marginally useful exceptions are seen as outrageous behavior.\u00a0 How dare anyone complain!\u00a0 How utterly ungrateful! What selfishness!After all, they can\u2019t let anyone get uppity and think they deserve something special.\u00a0 Next thing you know, everyone will want more comfortable and functional environments.\u00a0 They would actually have to spend time and energy discussing things with employees and students, and come up with alternatives, and implement them, and that\u2019s just too much trouble!\u00a0 It\u2019s just easier and more efficient to pretend that everyone is happy, and that everyone works best when treated as replaceable and identical cogs in the corporate or educational machine.Furthermore, the greatest thing about the dismissive \u201cfairness\u201d excuses is that they put the blame back on the person requesting accommodations.\u00a0 The excuses even let the rest of the people around know that the squeaky wheel* is a suitable target for sour-grapes derision.\u00a0 Why, the powers that be don\u2019t even have to institute or maintain the excuses for denial \u2014 everyone else is often happy to squelch \u201cspecial requests\u201d because of their own beaten-down spirits and internalised poverty of social generosity.Holy shit, but working against socially-sanctioned discrimination is such hard work.\u00a0 It\u2019s like swimming upstream, or fighting fog, or shoveling the walk while it\u2019s snowing.So here\u2019s a toast to everyone out there who does their part \u2014 no matter how small or inconsistent \u2014 to keep unbuilding physical and social barriers, and keep prodding others into the 21st century.\u00a0 Because damnit, this is where we LIVE our lives.* You don\u2019t have to use a wheelchair to be a squeaky wheel.\u00a0 But as a student once noted, it does make it easier to run over people\u2019s toes, \u201cOops, sorry, we really need sufficient aisle space around here, don\u2019t we?\u201d", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/10/21/excuses-excuses/", "title": "Excuses, excuses"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 October 2008", "body": "It\u2019s not just me.  A lot of people whom I know in person or via the internet have complained about near-futility of trying to get to sleep earlier at a \u201creasonable\u201d time, meaning one that would give a person enough hours of sleep before having to rise for the next day.My children and I can\u2019t get to sleep before 11 p.m. unless we\u2019ve been hit by dire viruses, or else have simply stayed up the entire night.  In contrast, hubby can retire early and then go from laying down to snoring in less than five minutes, and we\u2019re all mystified at how he manages this!  Obviously, such a somnolent physiology was not something our children inherited from dad.While our young adults have endeavoured to find college classes that start later in the morning (not unlike the majority of college students out there), I myself do not have the luxury of that option.  I\u2019m expected to be at the school at 7:30, which means leaving at 7:00.  (In reality, I need to leave by 7:10, but I keep aiming for 7:00 to give me the necessary buffer in my nutz ADHD distractedness.)\u00a0 Given the zombie-like staggering arthritic stiffness and mental sluggishness of my morning routine, I need to roll out of bed at 6. Now that really isn\u2019t an unusual time for working folks to get up, but my problem is that for most of my life I\u2019ve not been able to get to sleep until midnight, even when I\u2019ve put myself to bed by 10 p.m.Part of that delay was due to the fact that the stupid motor tics (\u201cTourette\u2019s lite\u201d) would repeatedly cause me to wake up just as I was mentally drifting into that nonsense-chatter of early sleep.  Now I take a little Clonidine in the evening, and that has made a world of difference for me, tics-wise.  (It makes me too dopey to take it during the day, but the daytime ticcing is minor and not a problem.)So here we are, wide-awake and on our \u201csecond wind\u201d both mentally and physically in the late evening.  Any of us could readily stay awake and not be ready for sleep until the wee hours of the next day.  The problem then is that to get a full period of sleep, no one would be getting up until the afternoon.  And then on this second day there\u2019s that long wakeful period, and things get even further out of synch \u2026People who have such problems may be medically referred to having \u201cDelayed Sleep Phase Syndrome\u201d (DSPS).\u00a0 This is described as where someone both goes to sleep late and wakens late because their circadian rhythm is out of order.\u00a0 Some people take melatonin in the evening to aid their sleep, and this is sometimes described as being really helpful by the chronically sleep-deprived parents of super-night-owl autistic children.\u00a0 (Ask your doctor; I\u2019m not licensed to practice medicine.) Light therapy is also sometimes recommended for inducing entrainment (synchronisation); this involves being exposed to bright light in the morning, but not in the evening.\u00a0 Sometimes depression can co-occur with DSPS, which is hardly surprising because chronic sleep deprivation does all sorts of things to neurotransmitters, and feeling inefficient and groggy all morning also doesn\u2019t help one\u2019s work ability or self-esteem.Modern life with artificial lighting, and exciting distractions like mounds of really good books, DVDs, the internet, or just the hyperactive ADHD brain that just keeps thinking and thinking about random stuff, all work against the daylight effects upon circadian rhythm.When the family was on holiday in the UK for a couple of weeks, I figured that the time difference and jetlag would mean that the kids could finally get to sleep on time.\u00a0 But was I ever wrong!\u00a0 After a couple of days, the three of us were once again living in the \u201cwrong time zone\u201d of wanting to be up late.\u00a0 The fact that the summer sun sets late during in Scotland certainly didn\u2019t help, either.\u00a0 That\u2019s when I finally realised that no matter what, we were all night-owls, doomed to be awake and sleepy at all the wrong times, no matter where we were.\u00a0 (Teh suckage!)A number of research studies have shown that both photoperiod (the \u201czeitgeber\u201d) and social schedules help keep people\u2019s circadian rhythms in order.\u00a0 In a polar study, it was found that the latter can sometimes over-ride the former, but may also cause problems. In other studies, when research subjects are given \u201ctimeless\u201d environments for long periods, their bodies will still stay within 24 1/2 to 26 hour periods (albeit their personal perceptions of time may seem slower or faster, as as everyone\u2019s do in clocked and natural light conditions). But those studies may not have had such atypical subjects as us. For some of us, neither daylength nor social environments seem to be sufficient to keep our circadian rhythms in synch with the rest of the world.Daylight Savings Time in the U.S. (Summer Time in the UK) certainly does nothing to help anyone\u2019s circadian rhythms by setting the clocks forward an hour in the spring and then back again in the fall. (\u201cSpring forward and fall back.\u201d)\u00a0 It messes up work and learning efficiency for days, if not weeks, and now that nearly all of society uses artificial lighting for work, there\u2019s less benefit economically, aside from evening sports schedules in grounds without field lights.\u00a0 There are some areas, such as the states of Arizona and Hawaii that don\u2019t even follow DST.\u00a0 The lost hour in the spring is the worse part to deal with; I can\u2019t get to sleep on time generally, and suddenly making it an hour later on the clock doesn\u2019t help!\u00a0 Getting that hour back in the fall is nice, but that benefit doesn\u2019t last past the one day.But what if we were not constrained by this diem brevis?\u00a0 As my friend Liam once pointed out, what we really need is a planet with a 36-hour day \u2013 that way we would have all the awake time and asleep time that we need, without being out of synch with the rest of society.\u00a0 Imagine what-all we could get done!", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sleepassociation.org/index.php?p=delayedsleepphasesyndrome", "http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/277/4/R1091", "http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/2187/full", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/10/13/wanted-planet-with-longer-rotational-period/", "title": "Wanted:  Planet with longer rotational\u00a0period"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t25 October 2008 ", "body": "Some of this is not breaking news, but some is.\u00a0 When I was watching someone in another classroom in futile pursuit of said dastardly, dirty diptera, I realised that there is a lot of interesting science behind successful swatting.Flies are hard to swat for a number of reasons.\u00a0 They avoid predation by both sensory detection and behavioral responses.\u00a0 With its large eyes, a fly can see nearly 360\u00b0, including behind itself.\u00a0 This means that it\u2019s nearly impossible to \u201csneak up\u201d on a fly. Because an insect\u2019s flicker fusion frequency is 250 Hertz or more (compared to the human 50), they are vastly more sensitive to motion. Flies can see a flyswatter coming at them, no matter how slow or fast you move it. As anyone who has ever examined their prey has noted, flies are also hairy.\u00a0 These \u201chairs\u201d (setae) make them sensitive to changes in ambient air speed and direction \u2014 they can feel the acceleration of the air from the pressure wave created by the flyswatter.Michael Dickinson and others at the California Institute of Technology have recently teased out other details to the flys\u2019 success.\u00a0 They used high-speed imaging to discover that flies will make changes in their body position (including limb angles) upon seeing the swatter.\u00a0 These adjustments enable flies to take off at the appropriate escape angles when they leap into the air.\u00a0 Dickson\u2019s advice to fly killers is to aim the swatter to where the fly is going, rather than where it is.\u00a0 This is of course good advice, but (unlike the details of fly posture) not breaking news to anyone who has hunted moving targets, whether shooting ducks, netting dragonflies, or intercepting soccer balls.My own advice is slightly different, as it was built upon behavioural observations from several years ago.Firstly, one can halt (though not immediately kill) a fly in mid-flight by fouling up its airstream.\u00a0 This involves using not a flyswatter, but a piece of fabric, such as a kitchen towel or piece of random laundry from the washbasket or bedroom floor (you know who you are). You\u2019re still trying to hit the fly, but instead of \u201csnapping\u201d it with a whip action, you\u2019re trying to knock it out of the air.\u00a0 The stunned fly plummets to a horizontal surface where you can quickly squish it with a tissue.Secondly, one can outright swat a fly that has (finally!) chosen to land somewhere.\u00a0 I usually do this with both hands, which naturally requires one to get over the learned repugnance of touching a fly. (But hey, we do have soap and running water, right?)Now, we already know that the fly can see you coming, and can feel you coming.\u00a0 Neither stealth by flyswatter speed nor approach angle will work.\u00a0 What I do is to pluck a tissue from the box, set it nearby, and then \u201cbookend\u201d the fly by framing open hands (with fingers closed together) on each side of it.\u00a0 I\u2019m not trying to swat the surface (which then necessitates waiting for the fly to land on something both hard and washable), but rather the airspace several inches/ centimeters just above the surface.When I clap my hands together, it doesn\u2019t matter which direction the fly is positioned to take off \u2014 it\u2019s still caught between my hands.\u00a0 Because I have bony fingers, sometimes the fly is caught in the pocket between the base of two fingers and my palm, but a slight twist of my hands in opposite directions is sufficient to do the pest in. It\u2019s not necessary to reduce the fly to a messy smear \u2014 just enough pressure to break the wings is enough to disable it so you can deliver the killing crack while picking it up with the tissue.Having then rid the room of the rambunctious irritation, I then go to wash my hands of the whole affair.P.S.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t1 April 2009", "body": "BayDisability has begun blogging about prosopagnosia, and how it affects her life.\u00a0 Because hers is an acquired case, it has affected her profoundly.\u00a0 (Amazingly, it\u2019s not some strange story she came up with to create \u201clesbian drama\u201d! Oy.)I have to say that from the self-reports I\u2019ve read, faceblindness due to injury is much more disabling than the developmental (genetic) sort, such as I have.\u00a0  I think this is probably due to the fact that for those of us who have always been this way, our brains have adapted to using auxiliary clues from the start.We don\u2019t know any other way of identifying people than through their overall physical shape, gait, voice, hair style, mannerisms, and favorite articles of clothing.\u00a0 We do however, spend our lives in a perpetual state of background free-floating anxiety due to either not knowing why we have problems, or being aware of our problems and then trying to consciously apply what coping methods we can.This is not to say that despite our limited coping abilities, we don\u2019t have the typical long litanies of embarrassing moments of not recognising people, of mis-recognising people (thinking a person is someone else), of \u201ctwinning\u201d two similar people into one, of \u201closing\u201d familiar people (even family members!) in crowds, of misunderstanding movie plots, of being totally clueless about celebrities, of being stressed to the gills with learning new job tasks as well as trying to reliably identify a couple of key people, of \u2026However, the person who acquires prosopagnosia has a much harder time with the socially disabling aspects.\u00a0 And with faceblindness, it\u2019s all socially disabling, and the \u201csocial model of disability\u201d is apparent to a degree that warrants billboard-size attention.\u00a0 The \u201csocial model of disability\u201d refers to how the way other people relate to you socially and physically due to how they perceive disabled people, and how the disability is created or magnified just because of the way things are artificially set up.\u00a0 In an oft-cited example, stairs are physically disabling, but ramps much less so. People who refuse to even acknowledge your presence or who ridicule or abuse or take advantage of you because you are the \u201cOther\u201d are engaging in social disablement.Most disabilities have some intrinsically disabling factor that prevent you from doing things at all, from doing them easily, from doing them consistently, and/or from doing them in a manner that is reasonably typical.\u00a0 (Many disabilities are not total, nor even consistent in their effects from one hour or day to the other.) But when I\u2019m alone, the fact that I\u2019m faceblind is totally irrelevant.\u00a0 It has no bearing on my ability to garden, do domestic chores, my personal bookkeeping, drive a vehicle, write, or do any of my hobbies. Essentially, I have no disability; *poof!* It\u2019s disappeared.\u00a0 There\u2019s no way to tell that I have any neurological glitches in facial recognition.\u00a0 (If I see a dirty face in a mirror, I can safely assume that\u2019s me with schmutz on my cheek.)It\u2019s only when I try to interact with other humans*\u00a0 that I am disabled.\u00a0 This is true even if that interaction is the one-way passive sort of watching recorded video.\u00a0 The few television shows I watch have morphologically distinct people, e.g. the various Star Treks.\u00a0 But there are still episodes where I get lost; for example, if the CSI agents are wearing HazMat suits with nothing but their faces or eyes showing through masks, then I am stuck trying to identify people by their voices, or am bugging my house-mates,\u201cWho\u2019s that? Wait, that isn\u2019t Warrick?\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s Doc Robbins already!\u201d\n\u201cOh, yeah, Warrick is brown.\u201d\n\u201cShhh!\u201dIn addition to the lack of lifelong adaptation, the person who acquires prosopagnosia has a much harder time because they are acutely aware of what they are missing, and are suffering not only the sense of loss, but also the abrupt, full-frontal immersion into the world of social disability and of trying to explain that faux pas are due to an invisible handicap that no one\u2019s heard of.Additionally, the person who acquires prosopagnosia has a much harder time because they are trying to force their brains to \u201crewire circuits\u201d to re-invent previous skills, and find that not only is there no recognition, but that all identification is conscious, slow, problematic, and prone to much error.\u00a0 It\u2019s also damn exhausting.In contrast, those who are born faceblind have varying levels of weakness.We may or may not be impaired in recognising emotions, or may easily identify broad emotions but miss the subtleties.\u00a0 I can generally tell how people are feeling, but fail to see much differences in the \u201cemotions in the eyes\u201d pictures, beyond surprised, sidelong glances, and squinting.We may additionally have topographical agnosia (lost in place), or excel at way-finding.We may be somewhat adept at identifying small numbers of regularly-met people, especially if they are in their expected locations.We may be able to identify photographs of familiar people, but only if we remember the events.We may be able to identify a few famous people by distinctive features, or from having memorized the inkblot-like patterns of commonly-used stock photographs.Given such common (yet modest) successes, it\u2019s easy to go through life thinking that the remaining omissions and mistakes are typical for others; after all, everyone complains of \u201cbeing bad at names and faces\u201d.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to realise just how much we\u2019re missing, until a family member is waving one down from a restaurant table just ten feet away.But then again, no matter what the level of impairment, we\u2019re all still isolated by not being able to easily build up friendships (much less keeping track of potential dates), by failing to remember anyone from one interview or networking event to the next, and by not knowing anyone outside of the immediate group at the company or school.In a pocket of my purse I have several name badges, for each of my different jobs.\u00a0 They all have the same name, and one has a photograph of someone wearing clothes and glasses like mine, whom I assume is me.\u00a0 I love name badges, and wear mine regularly, in an easily-read location near my head.\u00a0 I wish everyone wore them!\u00a0 So does BayDisability, in her latest post of helpful social tips.

I never thought of that.\u201d\n(I regret that I am not making this up.)This was a rant from last week, by one of the secondary teachers: Students who come in from the parking lot and leave the doors standing wide open \u2014 even when it\u2019s raining and cold and draughty.\u00a0 I seconded the rant \u2014 our classroom is the coldest room in the building already, notwithstanding that it\u2019s also across from the outside doors.\u00a0 Come on folks, surely I wasn\u2019t the only person in the world who grew up with a family elder who went around repeating, \u201cShut the door \u2014 we\u2019re not heating/air conditioning the whole out of doors!\u201d\u00a0 :: sigh :: Maybe it\u2019s time for me to take up that torch.

They\u2019ve just been standing there in line staring at the promotional banners or magazine covers for several minutes.\u00a0 Why?Ditto students who stand around the cafeteria queue yapping, and then wait until it\u2019s their turn before the matron to think about what they want to eat for lunch.\u00a0 Nevermind that the week\u2019s menus are on the classroom bulletin boards and written on the board at the very beginning of the line.\u00a0 I can understand waiting to choose between two items until you can see them to judge the apparent quality \u2014 but that still includes applying some forethought to the whole decision process.\u00a0 And yes, the milk costs the same thing it did last week, and the week before, and the week before that.Folks who spend several minutes circling around the huge parking lots at the mall to get a \u201cclose parking space\u201d so they can spend two or three hours walking around the mall. Why?Tonight a student asked to speak to me privately before a written exam.\u00a0 It turned out that he wasn\u2019t prepared, and was asking to take it in a day or two, even at a 10% grade reduction. It\u2019s amazing how much detail people will volunteer if you keep your mouth shut and keep nodding; he added that he\u2019d remembered the test was today, that he\u2019d had the study guide, that he\u2019d looked at the study guide, but only studied part of the material.\u00a0 Mental props to him for not coming up with some stupid my-grandma-died excuse, but I still declined the request to delay his sitting the exam, encouraging him to not panic and do his best.\u00a0 (As the saying goes, \u201cfailure to prepare on your part does not constitute a crisis on my part.\u201d)\u00a0 I get this sort of non-emergency request several times a semester \u2026 why does anyone think a prof is going to say Yes?One young woman to another, \u201cOh look, black is \u2018in\u2019 this year!\u201d\u00a0 Folks, here\u2019s a fashion secret: black is always \u2018in\u2019.\u00a0 It was \u2018in\u2019 even before Steampunk and Goth and even before Beatniks.\u00a0 Ditto black and white together.\u00a0 Why do fashion mavens act like this is breaking news?\nThen there are the things that annoy me, far out of proportion to the intrinsic value of the incidents. I keep reminding myself that such things aren\u2019t worth the mental energy it takes to be annoyed.\u00a0 But still!Students who stick their textbooks back onto the shelf in a manner both upside-down and backwards (binding toward the back). This also makes the OCD-ish part of my brain hurt.People who leave the new roll of toilet paper (loo roll) balanced precariously atop the empty cardboard tube of the previous roll, instead of slipping it onto the spindle.\u00a0 Surely the custodians and I are not the only three people in the entire building who know how to perform this small task?\u00a0 Do you know how often someone has bumped into the fat, new roll, and it\u2019s now slumped sodden in some dubious puddle on the floor of the toilet stall, leaving everyone without resources?Students who spend two minutes grinding away at pencils in the sharpener, but who also complain because all of the pencils are runty little things.\u00a0 (We finally instituted a rule that only the staff members can sharpen the classroom pencils.)Dear World:\u00a0 Get a CLUE.In happier news, the latest Skeptic\u2019s Circle is up at The Uncredible Hallq.\u00a0 You can fill up your brain with sensible stuff over there.\u00a0 I highly recommend it as a good antidote to the foolishness we all have in our lives.", "outgoing_links": ["http://trashcansunlimited.com/library/PolderChromeBulletTrashCan10-gal.jpg", "http://uncrediblehallq.net/blog/?p=180"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/10/29/things-that-mystify-me/", "title": "Things that mystify\u00a0me"},

These were difficult checking assignments \u2014 not because of the parents, but because as a cashier I was also trying to keep track of the assorted tots with regards to alerting their adult to their safety, or asking their adult if the candy or toy items coming down the conveyor belt were approved purchases.\nPeople with bunches of the organically-grown bananas (PLU 94011; all the organic produce starts with a 9).\nTired working folks picking up a sandwich from the deli, a banana, and an energy drink for their meal.\nFrazzled parents rushing through with bananas, applesauce and bread.

As in, my hands shake rapidly from side to side, causing my (long, limber) fingers to dually perform that single-handed clapping.\u00a0 In the recent years, I have learned that \u201cflapping\u201d (done in many different ways) is one of those \u201cstereotypies\u201d associated with autism, or with Down\u2019s, or with cognitive disabilities (mental retardation), or with any number of differences that are often socially ostracised.Which to me does not make a whole lot of sense.\u00a0 Seriously, WTF?\u00a0 It does not harm anyone.\u00a0 And if you have spent much time in North America and seen game shows like The Price Is Right, then you will have observed a lot of (ostensibly) neurotypical/normal people jumping up and down and flapping in their excitement at being called up to play.\u00a0 But of course, someone will be sure to point out that is a \u201cspecial circumstance\u201d and that people who are chosen for the audience are selected because they are excited about the opportunity, and are outrageously dressed, and will generally perform in such highly exaggerated manner, and thus be good television fodder.\u00a0 Well, perhaps.\u00a0 But my point is that we all engage in stereotypies. (In a previous post, \u201cStimulating Topics of Conversation\u201d, I noted that fiddling/stimming is another stereotypy that everyone does.)Unfortunately, we also engage in stereotyping \u2014 it is almost impossible not to at some level, as creating such thought patterns is how the brain organises the world.\u00a0 But we can be aware of and work against negative stereotypes that are socially harmful.Of course, to deliver that reply effectively, I have to have a script that is not only thought-provoking and easy to remember (without tripping over the words), but is also SHORT.\u00a0 And if you have read more than two of my posts, you know that brevity is not my strong suit!But I know how to get around that in my brain. I turn ideas into bulleted points, which from force of teaching habit makes me distill things into highly condensed form, without a lot of jargon:\nWhat exactly are you indicating to me?\nI am not trying to provoke you, but I\u2019d like you to think about something:\nDoes flapping mean I am stupid?\nDoes flapping mean I cannot do my job?\nDoes flapping hurt anyone?\nBut you are implying those things.\nEven if you don\u2019t believe them yourself, you are using and reinforcing negative stereotypes.\nAnd I don\u2019t believe that helps anyone.\nSo, think about it.\nOf course, weeks or months may go by before the next event occurs.\u00a0 We\u2019ll see if I actually remember the gist of this, and can have enough self-awareness to advocate effectively.The problem is that I get so in-the-moment that my awareness gets really tunneled \u2014 not my vision per se, but my ability to notice what-all is going on, and to also be able to interpret it.\u00a0 Because of this \u201ctunnelling\u201d,\u00a0 I spend most of my active processing trying to respond to the event both internally and externally. (Mind you, I\u2019m normally a highly verbal person, so when I start having expressive issues, you know that I\u2019m really taken aback by the situation.)In this strangely configured moment, when time seems to simultaneously slow down yet slide by too fast, I am:\nrealising that Yes, this really IS one of those moments, and then in an insecure silent panic, am double-checking my short-term memory to make sure I\u2019m interpreting things correctly,\nand remembering Oh! I was going to do something different in response;\nand remembering what that was;\nand trying to recall the particular wording;\nand trying to emblazon some of the key words on my mental desktop so I don\u2019t drop them halfway through the sentence;\nand trying to get the words out without losing one, getting clauses out of order, and/or tripping over them by stuttering or mumbling.\nFrom years of speech therapy, I worked really hard to enunciate clearly.\u00a0 I endeavoured to not use \u201cum\u201d, or \u201cand uh\u201d, what one of my English teachers referred to as \u201clazy parts of speech\u201d.\u00a0 Being so conscientious, plus frequently delivering  long, scripted, grammatically-correct, fact-riddled announcements full of polysyllabic words earned me no lack of jibing for sounding stilted.\u00a0 The ironic part is that sometimes I get dysnomic to the point that I don\u2019t even say \u201cum\u201d, or \u201cand uh\u201d, which verbal place-holders would otherwise have alerted others that I was going to finish my sentence, and people have actually wandered off thinking that I was done talking. Not so useful!Which-all means that by that point I am doing a lousy job of monitoring how others are responding.\u00a0 Alas, this is the sort of moment when that would be most helpful.\u00a0 Ditto having my auditory processing on \u201cRecord\u201d so I could later reflect upon the chain of events.Oh, well.\u00a0 It might not be a \u201cgold medal\u201d response, but I think that recognising the situation and then being able to get my scripted response out is good enough for a bronze.\u00a0 You think maybe?", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/not-flapping-my-lips/", "title": "Not Flapping My\u00a0Lips"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t6 August 2008", "body": "This belated post is especially for Debora, who asked for my impressions about ADD/ADHD medications for children.\u00a0 (Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, nor do I play one on television.)Medicating kids or adults for ADHD is a sticky topic.\u00a0 Everyone has opinions!\u00a0 Like many topics of heated discussion, usually everyone has several good points to make, and there are always a few people who take things to absurd extremes.\u00a0 So let\u2019s look at these points individually.\u00a0 (I\u2019ve boldfaced the points, so if you\u2019ve already reached a state of analysis on that point, you can skip to the next one.)Does ADD/ADHD even exist?\u00a0 Is it just some scam made up by drug companies to make money?Some years ago I received an email from someone who had decided the latter. I replied back with the following, which I have updated to reflect new information:I find it interesting (alarming? saddening?) that you say you \u201cdon\u2019t believe in ADHD.\u201d Doubtless there have been/are some children who mis-diagnosed with and treated for ADHD and this is a real shame.\u00a0 Equally tragic are those children (and adults) who missed diagnoses and struggle through life.\nObjective evidence for ADD includes PET brain scans that show marked differences in the frontal lobe operations of people with and without ADHD. There is also evidence for a mostly genetic basis.\nIt is not a result of laziness, rebelliousness, bad parenting, or diet.\u00a0 About 60% of the people with ADHD do not grow out of it.\u00a0 (Those who do seem to \u201cgrow out of it\u201d may be demonstrating that children don\u2019t all mature at the same rate.) Although the some of the symptoms of ADHD can at times be present in anyone, it is both the 1) degree and 2) consistency over time to which these symptoms manifest themselves that allows for the diagnosis.\nThe prescription medication I am taking is a time-release combination of dopamine and norepinephrine, which are neural transmitters (chemicals involved in the transmission of electrical impulses from one nerve/brain cell to another.)\u00a0 With the medication I don\u2019t jiggle all the time, bite my nails less, interrupt less often, don\u2019t daydream or mentally wander off-subject in class or during meetings, and can focus on studying for 90 minutes at a time, instead of 5 or 10 minutes.\u00a0 Early on (without knowing about the diagnosis or medication) my daughter remarked to me, \u201cMom, you actually SAT through a whole movie!\u201d\nAnd yes, the medication is an amphetamine, and it is curious to note that with the medication, I can get to sleep more easily and have less hand tremors! I also drink a lot less coffee, which implies unconscious attempts at self-medication with stimulants.\u00a0\u00a0 This is in direct contrast to what would happen for an ordinary person taking an amphetamine.\u00a0 It affects me differently because I am wired slightly differently. (More objective evidence: a different physical makeup of the body results in a different physical reaction.)\nTo be prescribed medication, I visited not only a psychologist, but also a psychiatrist, had to undergo interview testing (which paperwork hubby also had to fill out, in lieu of a parent) and my wretched school history was also gone over.\u00a0 I did not undertake this diagnosis lightly, but after having struggled with school for 35 years (!) and consistently getting poor evaluations despite being smart and working hard.\nIf ADD is real, and I have it, why wasn\u2019t I diagnosed with it earlier?\u00a0 Because it wasn\u2019t added to the Diagnostic Statistics Manual (DSM) until the early 1980\u2019s, after I had (through much struggle) managed to graduate high school!\u00a0 An earlier diagnosis was charmingly called \u201cMinimal Brain Damage\u201d and had different criteria (it was thought to be caused by physical trauma from birth or accident). The hyperactivity part was a separate diagnosis. It is not that ADHD didn\u2019t exist earlier, but that the specific name and diagnostic criteria didn\u2019t exist.\u00a0 This is one of the reasons why there were \u201csuddenly\u201d more children (and adults) being diagnosed with ADHD.\nBut what if someone says they \u201cdon\u2019t believe in ADHD.\u201d Think on this: some people have asthma and take medication to treat the symptoms.\u00a0 Most people don\u2019t \u201cgrow out of\u201d the asthma, nor is it imaginary.\u00a0 It has a direct impact on how well a person can function at times. What if someone said to you, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in asthma\u201d?\u00a0 What if they said, \u201cYou just wheeze because you are out of shape.\u00a0 That\u2019s just an excuse.\u00a0 You just need to TRY HARDER.\u00a0 If you practiced or exercised more you could do just as well as everyone else.\u201d What would you tell them?Oh noes, labels!People hesitate to get testing because they are worried that diagnoses will mean that there are \u201clabels\u201d assigned to their children.\u00a0 But think about this:\u00a0 what kind of \u201clabels\u201d are already assigned to your child?\u00a0 Are they helping him, or preventing him from being helped?\u00a0 Will the label actually give him less of an education because it refers him to different but unequal education?What does the label mean to you?\u00a0 A person is not the label given to them.\u00a0 Furthermore, if you fear your child being labeled, what does this say about your own attitudes?\u00a0 Do you fear that the identification of a particular kind is a stigma?\u00a0 If your child is that particular kind of person, does that make them less of a person or a not-good or not-okay person?Sometimes there are other things that will occur in addition to ADHD, such as sleep issues, handwriting problems (dysgraphia), [central] auditory processing disorder (APD or CAPD), nonverbal learning disorder (NLD or NVLD), Asperger\u2019s or tics. These are technically known as \u201ccomorbid\u201d conditions, a term which I find awkward.\u00a0 Sometimes things like APD are misdiagnosed as ADHD, simply because there are overlapping categories of effects, and people are more familiar with ADHD.\u00a0 But don\u2019t panic.\u00a0 I certainly don\u2019t mean to scare you; it is not an overwhelming percentage, by a long shot.\u00a0 Just be aware that other issues may surface over the years, and don\u2019t let schools act like everything is due to ADHD, and/or that a student is limited to one diagnosis.The good news is that being really bright can also be \u201ccomorbid\u201d with ADHD!\u00a0 (-:\u00a0 Indeed, these \u201ctwice-exceptional\u201d students can be hard to diagnose, because the smarts and the disabilities tend to cancel each other out.\u00a0 Plus, people can get so over-focused on remediating the behavioral problems that they forget there\u2019s a smart and really bored kid \u2026 smart + bored + bouncey + inquisitive = ____ Well, it depends partly on the teacher; the result could be a stellar student, or one who is just known for \u201cbeing a problem\u201d instead of \u201chaving specific problems\u201d.\u00a0 ::sigh::Is there too much over-diagnosis?\u00a0 Is there too much over-medication?Deciding whether or not to take medications is a big issue.\u00a0 Doubtless there have been/are some children who mis-diagnosed with and treated for ADHD, and this is a real shame, if not possibly dangerous.\u00a0 Equally tragic are those children and adults who missed diagnoses, and struggle through life, feeling like they are lazy, stupid, etc.\u00a0 (Readers, feel free to \u201craise your hand\u201d and comment!)Although Ritalin and similar meds are amphetamines, they do not have the same affect upon the ADHD brain that they do upon the NT (neurotypical, i.e. \u201cnormal\u201d) brain.\u00a0 If a person does not respond well to medication, it might be the formulation (type of medication; they\u2019re not all the same), the dosage, the diagnosis (other things can share some of the symptoms ADHD), or the person just might be someone who doesn\u2019t respond well to the meds.Some people are concerned that, \u201cwe don\u2019t know enough about these medications and how they affect kids\u201d.\u00a0 (Some of those are people who feel that nothing but 100% surety is enough, which is unreasonable because hardly anything in life is that sure.)\u00a0 In truth, stimulant meds have been in use for about fifty years, so most of the effects are pretty well known, even the long-term ones.\u00a0 Plus, research keeps plugging along and we discover new things.One of those things is that although there will be a few people with Tourette\u2019s or tic disorders may have an earlier onset of tics when treated with stimulant meds, that does not mean that stimulant meds will cause tics or Tourette\u2019s, nor even necessarily aggravate them. Personally, I\u2019ve always had some tics, and they have become more pronounced over the years (as have other issues, such as nearsightedness, tinnitus, arthritis).\u00a0 I went off the ADHD meds for nearly two years, and realized that there wasn\u2019t really much difference in the tics, but that I really did better with the meds, so I went back on them.\u00a0 That may seem like a long time, especially since the meds wear off so quick.\u00a0 But tics will wax and wane and the types of tics tend to change and repeat over time, so a longer time period helps determine if the results are just those normal ups and downs or a real trend (this is what the stats people refer to as \u201cregression toward the mean\u201d). It\u2019s also notable that although stress does not cause tics, stress can aggravate tics. Entering puberty can also trigger Tourette\u2019s or tic disorders; merely being diagnosed with ADHD and getting the stimulant meds, and then developing tics does not mean the meds caused the tics.\u00a0 Of course, my personal story doesn\u2019t mean squat (\u201ctestimonials are not data\u201d), but I could pull up the research paper titles if anyone really wants to know.\u201cTake this pill \u2013 it\u2019ll make everything better\u201d \u2013 NOT.There is also the simple fact that medication does not completely resolve the problems associated with ADHD.The first few weeks on the meds, it is amazing!\u00a0 You can get things done, sit still, pay attention, whee! People around you notice.\u00a0 They like it when you are on the meds.\u00a0 You get concerned; you want them to like the \u201creal\u201d you, not the medicated you.\u00a0 Well, big news:\u00a0 YOU ARE STILL YOU. The medication does not change your core personality. You are perhaps a bit less frantic you, and perhaps a bit more attentive.\u00a0 As for myself, I am still the same nutz person I have always been.\u00a0 (Classic disclaimer:\u00a0 \u201cYour results may differ.\u201d)And after a while \u2026 you notice that although the meds help, you still have some problems.\u00a0 Part of those problems may be issues of organization, study habits, work habit is, et cetera; actually, those can now be dealt with more effectively with the meds, as you learn or re-train yourself.I tried a week off the meds.\u00a0 I felt like, \u201cOh, I really don\u2019t need them; they don\u2019t help that much.\u201d\u00a0 And then I got comments like a class feedback form saying, \u201cInstructor should consider switching to decaf coffee\u201d \u2014 and I HAD been drinking decaffeinated coffee \u2014 yikes!\u00a0 Um\u2026\u00a0 Well, now I understand why some people go off their \u201ccrazy-meds\u201d; they feel like they are just fine!\u00a0 And then things start sliding downhill\u2026The meds of course don\u2019t \u201ccure\u201d the problems, nor do they remove them \u2014 they make it easier to be more focused and get less distracted, and can help settle down some of the impulsivity and boing!boing!boing! (That said, I\u2019m still a leg-jiggler, and just tell my students, \u201cfidget quietly!\u201d)Research tells us that usually works best is a combination of meds and counseling or teaching of coping strategies. (We\u2019re not shocked when other research also tells us that the same is true for depression \u2014 antidepressives make it easier to be interested in and make use of counseling.) The meds make it easier for the person to assess and understand what sort of things are going on, to implement strategies, and to evaluate progress. It can be helpful to brain-storm ideas and solutions with other ADHD people, assuming the conversation doesn\u2019t get too off track. Alas, some of those ADHD chat boards are pretty useless, as they are such pity-parties, gah!Things like ADHD, Asperger\u2019s, NVLD, APD, Tourette\u2019s and so on all have some similarities of frontal lobe processing that is referred to as Executive Function.\u00a0 EF includes planning, prioritising, initiating, being aware of what one is doing, assessing what one is doing, correcting actions (troubleshooting), and inhibiting wrong actions or distractions. Doing all these things at once requires juggling a lot of thoughts in short-term and active processing memory; they use up a lot of cerebral RAM. Unfortunately, getting those aforementioned coping mechanisms implemented and whatnot requires \u2026 Executive Function!\u00a0 Oh, the irony.Some people react badly to medication.\u00a0 If one does not work, do consider trying another.\u00a0\u00a0 Side effects can be seriously not-fun business; I had numerous side effects to two different medications.\u00a0 I had never before had side effects from meds, but then I realized that all I had ever had were ordinary analgesics and antibiotics.\u00a0 I have since had side effects from still other kinds of medications (including mundane things like blood pressure medication).It has also been found that some drug-abusers are undiagnosed ADHD and were self-medicating with stimulants.\u00a0 Moreover, the happy reverse it true; persons prescribed with the correct meds end up with fewer problems with drug addiction.Well, it is a loaded issue.\u00a0 Ask sixteen people, and you will get sixteen different opinions. But I\u2019ll warn you, ask someone with ADHD and you probably won\u2019t get a short answer!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/08/06/prescription-for-thought/", "title": "Prescription for Thought"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t11 August 2008", "body": "When we watch old movies or programs, read old books, listen to old audio recordings, it quickly become apparent that tastes in humor change, mostly due to evolving senses of what is appropriate for being laughed at. There are racist and sexist and disableist jokes that are only painful to hear, because it is embarrassing to realize that some people find/found their humor in the ridicule of demeaning others. When the \u201cJokes you cannot tell in mixed company\u201d have turned into \u201cJokes you wouldn\u2019t even want to tell in any kind of company\u201d, you get some hope that maybe society is growing up \u2026 just a little bit.Or, not.An upcoming movie is such an example of humor that fails its efforts to parody. Much of comedy has to be \u201ccutting edge\u201d to have the surprise value.\u00a0 It pushes at the borders of acceptable behavior, and relies on our ability to laugh as a means of dealing with stress.\u00a0 Treading the edges of propriety can be rich source, but can also backfire if the comedian does not have a good sense of the audience and of the purpose of their material.Satire is a particular type of humor; by definition it is designed to \u201cmake fun of something\u201d \u2014 but to a purpose.\u00a0 It illuminates personal and social problems that we had not really thought about or could not easily discuss, and cleverly uses humor to deflect some of the tension that would have otherwise occurred.\u00a0 Its tools are heavy irony and sarcasm, puns and wordplay, and parodies and comparisons.\u00a0 Properly used satire is wit that seeks to improve society, rather than simply demeaning people. But satire can be misinterpreted.\u00a0 Sometimes the result is more serious than mock-serious, and the audience does not understand that the performer is not really advocating, or believing in what they are presenting.Comedy can also be misused when poorly-done attempts at humor are sometimes passed off as \u201csatire\u201d. There is a big difference between laughing with someone, and laughing at someone. Attacking someone and then saying, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just a joke; whatsamatter, can\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d is not true humor. This is \u201chumor\u201d derived from a feeling of superiority, using shame and derision. As I said, satire is wit that seeks to improve society, rather than simply demeaning people.\u00a0 Parody can be a part of satire, but just parody is not necessarily satire.\u00a0 Parody can easily slide into snide efforts that not only lack sacred cows, but also lack sensibility and purpose.\u00a0 Just because you can say something doesn\u2019t mean you should.And that\u2019s where we seem to be with major parts of this Tropic Thunder movie, that seeks to make fun of many foibles of the movie industry and the whole genre of war movies.\u00a0 Granted, those are certainly rich sources for parody.But the line gets crossed when people start throwing around the R-word, retard. (Transcript of the scene, and trailer.) No one gives a second thought to using the R-word, even would they would refrain from saying faggot, nigger, kike or any number of other categorically insulting terms. Most people don\u2019t stop to think that it is inherently demeaning to call someone a \u201cRe-tard\u201d. Why?\u00a0 Because compared to other minorities, it\u2019s still \u201copen season\u201d for insulting people with disabilities.\u00a0 It\u2019s assumed to be socially acceptable just because disabled people are considered to be inherently unequal.\u00a0 Most people don\u2019t even give it a second thought.If this movie is released without edit, I am going to spend the next year hearing kids use the quote, \u201cnever go full retard\u201d and cringing and having to bring them up short as to why that word usage is Not Appropriate.\u00a0 They will of course dismiss my concerns by saying that it\u2019s \u201cjust a word\u201d and \u201cno one cares\u201d and \u201ceveryone says it\u201d and that it\u2019s their \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d and I\u2019m \u201cjust being over-sensitive\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t have a sense of humor\u201d.\u00a0 It\u2019s always an uphill battle for justice when you first have to point out the injustice, and then explain why the things people are doing are wrong, and then get them to believe you, before you can even insist that people change their habits, and then help change social values.\u00a0 Just read the comments on Patricia E Bauer\u2019s blog post about the movie.The verb \u201cto retard\u201d means to hinder or delay, and \u201cmentally retarded\u201d is still frequently used to refer to someone who has significant difficulties in learning speed and ability.\u00a0 But there is no nice usage for addressing someone as a Retard.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t even matter whether or not the person being described or addressed as Retard has such problems.\u00a0 As I have described before, Retard is simply an insulting word. Using the word er, retards efforts at eliminating disablism.And yet an alarmingly large number of people can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s a problem or why the movie shouldn\u2019t be edited.\u00a0 This is going to be a long, uphill effort.Here is a video put together by ASAN about the word; it\u2019s captioned subtitled.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.patriciaebauer.com/2008/08/01/never-go-full-retard/", "http://www.fandango.com/videos_1_863151/v389934", "http://www.patriciaebauer.com/2008/08/04/readers-advice/"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/08/11/when-humor-is-not-a-laughing-matter/", "title": "When \u201cHumor\u201d is Not A Laughing\u00a0Matter"},

You can give it to as many people as you want but please award at least 10.Wow, TEN people.\u00a0 It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t think of ten great blogs, but rather, how do I choose?\u00a0 (Plus, I would like to nominate folks whom I\u2019ve not nominated for other awards, and of course, there\u2019s the inevitable issue of finding bloggers that weren\u2019t already nominated\u2026)My nominations are:\nYoung Female Scientist who frequently kvetches from the lab bench, and often has pithy things to say about the socio-political side of research\nAnnette of Fun With Play-Dough has a wicked sense of the absurd about politics, parenting, and an incredible ability to find strange news items\nMs Cornelius at A Shrewdness of Apes whose reports from the circus of high school only sound improbable to non-educators\nEpi Wonk slices, dices and juliennes absurd epidemiology reporting, and also deconstructs claims in an exceptionally clear manner\nElizabeth of Screw Bronze! who ostensibly did not become perilously sick to corner the market on Goth Hello Kitty bandages\nno-nonsense abfh, who is always thought-provoking\nthe Midlife and Treachery blog; imfunnytoo manages to squeeze an impressive amount of social analysis from events that only seem mundane on the surface\nIra of SpeEdChange who\u2019s all about accessibility and advocacy and movies\nPiss Poor Prof at Burnt Out Adjunct, who is unwittingly providing something of a mentorship by pointing out road hazards\nthe ornery gang at Skepchick who also make me feel not so alone (I know with whom I want to go elbow-lifting)\nA statuette of an angel in a strapless blue gown, standing upon a gold-colored wave with the title, \"Arte y Pico\" curved onto the inside of the waveWell, as if that wasn\u2019t enough, on the 4th of July TherExtras nominated me for a really interesting award, the Arte y Pico.\u00a0 Only I didn\u2019t get any message telling me such.\u00a0 In fact, it was only because every once in a while I go back and look through my WordPress \u201cdashboard\u201d section that tells me who has linked to my blog, that I discovered that Excavator had also nominated me for this same award, on August 6th.1. Pick five blogs that you consider deserve this award for their creativity, design, interesting material, and also for contributing to the blogging community, no matter what language.\n2. Each award must have the name of the author and a link to his or her blog to be visited by everyone.\n3. Each award winner must show the award and put the name and link to the blog that has given her or him the award itself. Award-winner and the one who has given the prize have to show the link of \u201cArte y Pico\u201d blog, so everyone will know the origin of this award.My nominations are:\nThe talented Bev at Asperger Square 8 who creates the most amazing satirical products and cartoons\nWheelchair Dancer whose dance company #1 on my list for seeing, should our locations ever synch\nUphilldowndale whose photographs of daily life and scenery in northern England make me dretfully unhomesick\ngluten-free girl who makes me wish I spent fewer evenings staring dumbly at the fridge trying to remember what it was I was going to make for dinner\nRandall of xkcd, who proves that stick figures and cartooning are not incompatible with high concepts and erudite geekitude\nAll this makes me realise that I need to update my blogroll, but in addition to everything else I have to go to market today, so that\u2019s not going to happen for quite a while.As for my extra stipulation, it\u2019s this:WHEN YOU NOMINATE SOMEONE FOR AN AWARD, SEND THEM AN E-MAIL OR POST A COMMENT ON THEIR BLOG.So they know.\u00a0 And don\u2019t have to discover it accidentally, long, long down the road.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t7 August 2008 ", "body": "The Kid recently took the ACT test, which like the SAT, is frequently used by colleges to determine scholastic abilities, and in his case helped place him for which college writing class he needed.\u00a0 He had to ask his sister what the test was like, and her impressions about its difficulty level.\u00a0 I could not personally provide any opinions, because I had never taken the ACT or SAT.I never took them because no one thought I would go to college.They made massive assumptions about my abilities and my future. So here\u2019s what happened, and something to think about. I welcome you to please post comments, and more links to other positive blogs and sites.My grades in secondary school grew worse over the years, and I had to re-take a semester in one class (English of all things, which in later years proved to be ironic when I became a freelance writer, with hundreds of items in print).By this time in my life, my parents had divorced.\u00a0 My dad lived in another state, and was even more of a non-player in my life.\u00a0 Alas, my mother had spent years futilely trying to make me more \u201cnormal\u201d, from requiring me to learn right-handed penmanship, enrolling me in a \u201ccharm school\u201d at the local Sears & Roebucks to improve my feminine graces, and so on.\u00a0 But as the years wore on, my faults (problems) became more and more apparent.\u00a0 She no longer described me as \u201cvery bright\u201d, but was quick to list all my failures and describe them in damning detail, until I was ready to vomit or pass out from the stress (though I never did, even though either would have been a relief).By 9th grade it was apparent to all that I was not gifted scholastically, and the general consensus was that I was lazy, stupid at math, not trying hard enough, and acting up just to make her life difficult.\u00a0 When she was drunk, my failures and interests and personality traits would be compared to her ex-husband\u2019s, \u201cyou\u2019re just like your father, the bastard\u201d.\u00a0 Even as much of a socially-clueless 14 year old that I was, I knew that these kinds of comments were untrue and inappropriate, and the problem was with her attitudes and her drinking.\u00a0 But they still hurt, terribly.I would not be diagnosed with ADHD, Auditory Processing Disorder, and Prosopagnosia until I was in my 40\u2019s.\u00a0 Such diagnosis hardly existed in those days; certainly my difficulties were not considered to be due to anything but my own personal failings.No way, my family and school officials decided, could I be college material.\u00a0 I could not keep track of my assignments, I still struggled to learn and remember my multiplication facts into 8th grade, and I flunked or barely passed classes.Given my social difficulties and subsequent lack of dating, and even my utter lack of domestic abilities (mom warned me off taking a sewing class because doing so would \u201cruin my GPA\u201d \u2013 grade point average), I was obviously not highly marriageable. This was the 1970s, and most people still thought along those lines \u2014 an astonishing number of girls went to college to \u201cget their MRS\u201d.The goal then was to get me some kind of minimal trade training, so I would, as she fiercely reminded me many times, not be a burden on the family. It was made plain to me that once I graduated high school, and then later turned 18, I was to be out on my own.\u00a0 I should not expect financial assistance from her.So I was enrolled in typing, which was a miserable experience beyond the whole ordinary ordeal of learning to type on manual typewriters.\u00a0 The room was a cacophony of noise.\u00a0 The instructor was adamant about constant attention to task, proper posture, and graded with the intent on us producing perfection \u2014 as soon as a student produced a typographical error, then the score was made. (Additionally, the students\u2019 pages were\u00a0 held up to the light against her perfect copies to check centering and spacing). There were many days when I would produce an entire page that was otherwise perfect but for a typo in the second line, and my grade would be an F because I had such a low word-count.\u00a0 Given my problems with developing manual speed, tracking text (near-point copying), attention, and transposing letters and numbers, I struggled to get a C grade.But the clerical work that was deemed best for me also required taking bookkeeping.\u00a0 Not surprisingly, this was also a very difficult class for me.\u00a0 My aptitudes and interests were not really taken into consideration, because after all, even if writing and science and art were what I liked best, I had not done well in those classes, now had I?\u00a0 Besides, clerical work was what my mother knew, so like many parents she expected me to follow occupational suit.Unlike many such students, my story has a relatively happy ending.\u00a0 I did manage to graduate high school, to everyone\u2019s relief.\u00a0 A year later, I even enrolled in an evening class at the local community college.\u00a0 College classes were not easy, partly from my intrinsic difficulties, partly from not having the necessary study skills, and partly from not having a solid academic background.But the glory of the American system is that such colleges provide opportunities for adults of all ages to acquire the these things, and to gain higher education. I worked hard, and slowly figuring out how I learned, which was not always in the ways that others thought I should study.\u00a0 Sometimes I had to drop a class and re-try it later on, to finish it successfully. Later on in my 40\u2019s I was to also get some of my issues diagnosed.I now have a Master\u2019s of Science. I teach college students.\u00a0 No one would have expected this based upon my previous performance. (Employers who place near-complete trust in Behavioral-Based Interviewing, please note!)\u00a0 And this point, amongst all the others about the perils of attribution errors, and learning disabilities, and dysfunctional families, this point is crucial:A child\u2019s future abilities cannot always be predicted, when based upon their current abilities.Many parents of children who have developmental disorders worry that their children will never be able to attend school, or finish school, or go on to college, or hold a job, or live on their own, or be loved by a partner, or have a family, or talk, or be potty-trained, or any number of milestones.\u00a0 Just because the child cannot do the same things that their age peers can do, or are expected to do.This is one of the biggest points of contention or discussion between the \u201cautism community\u201d (parents of autistic children) and the \u201cautistic community\u201d (children, teens and adults who are autistic, and many of whom are parents as well).\u00a0 Even beyond the farcical assumptions that either community is monolithic with regards to attitudes and knowledge and politics et cetera, there are inherent issues that need to be mutually addressed.One of the best resources for the autism communities are the autistic communities.\u00a0 If parents go around just talking to other parents, especially those other parents who are consumed by the \u201cTerrible Tragedy and Selfless Suffering Families\u201d world-views, they may fall prey to this easy assumption:\u00a0 If my child can\u2019t do it now, he\u2019ll never be able to do it, and our lives will be ruined.Sure, not everyone takes it to that extreme.\u00a0 Sure, there are a few children who do not achieve many of those life-goals.\u00a0 But those lack of achievements does NOT automatically mean that their lives are ruined, or their families\u2019 lives are ruined. They do NOT automatically mean that people cannot live relatively happy, healthy, and productive lives.Please do NOT assume that not being able to use speech as a reliable means of communication is the same as not being able to think, or not being able to communicate, or not having anything to communicate.Please do not assume that because a child does not learn in a traditional manner that they are learning \u201cthe wrong way\u201d, or that they cannot learn at all, or that they must be taught \u201cremedial learning lessons\u201d.Please do know that even when children have problems, and are slower to acquire skills, they are not doomed.Please do not give up on them.\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d~First words (at age 35) of an autistic man [quote source]I welcome you to please post comments, and more links to other positive blogs and sites.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t16 August 2008", "body": "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long week \u2014 I bet you\u2019re ready to decompose.\u201dI stared at my husband, blinking through the mental fog of too-many-jobs-not-enough-sleep.\u201cI\u2019m not ready for the compost pile yet,\u201d I replied,  trying to figure out what his latest malapropism was meant to be.\u201cOr whatever the term is,\u201d he added.My brain finally catches up. \u201cDecompress,\u201d I answered.What an incredibly long week.\u00a0 I can\u2019t remember the last time I had one like this, and in my over-busy world that\u2019s saying something.Wednesday last week I had a pneumonia vaccination, which left my arm so sore I couldn\u2019t take off my jogbra without assistance, nor even get my hand up to head level until the weekend.\u00a0 Moreover, I can hardly eat due to canker sores.\u00a0 My doctor says am supposed to be eating more (often) because I lost weight due to previous canker sores. (I\u2019m not on a slimming diet, I am undernourished.)\u00a0 He also says that not getting enough sleep can make a person more prone to canker sores.I had a horrible night\u2019s sleep on Sunday. Monday there were inservice training and staff meetings in the mornings and afternoons.\u00a0 Tuesday was more of the same crappy five hours of sleep and training and meetings, with adjunct prof training in the evening.\u00a0 I remember my doctor\u2019s admonishments to get in more nutrition throughout the day, but most of the time I haven\u2019t been in places where I could get or consume such.\u00a0 You would think I would be able to get to sleep early or sleep better, but no. Wednesday had yet more training and meetings, and just when I was getting tired of those, I went home to finish my syllabi and prepare for my first classes, only to realise that the crushing feeling that had been piling up all day was a developing migraine with heavy tinnitus and an ear ache and arthralgia.Were the students not returning for the first day of school, and were I not doing my first-ever college teaching (solo, not GTA), I would have just called in sick.\u00a0 Oh, did I really, really want to soak in a hot bath and then hide in bed for the next 24 hours.\u00a0 But I had to get most of my syllabus finished, and find the information I needed to present the next evening.\u00a0 I added in some necessary chunks of information, and then repeatedly shuffled the same pieces of paper around, until finally I realised that I didn\u2019t have have two neurons to rub together, and that my eyeballs just plain ached.\u00a0 I gave up, set upon my chair the stuff for job #2 that I had to take with me to work on during the job #1 half-hour lunch break, and crashed in bed.Whereupon I spent the next couple hours tossing and turning because my ear hurt and my joints hurt and the noise in my head was driving me nuts and my arm was still tender and I was alternately hot and then cold and hot again.\u00a0 Finally I slid sideways into fitful sleep until a cat awoke me at 3:30 to complain about the lack of kibble.\u00a0 I was heartless and scooped the cat off the bed. Three hours later I had to get up, after yet another too-short night\u2019s sleep.\u00a0 Crap.And then things got worse.Long day at job #1, where we have new students who don\u2019t know the system, and staff who are equally confused because there are new staff who also don\u2019t know the system, and the returning staff are confused because there have been a number of changes in the system, and more changes keep happening throughout the day, without a good system to disseminate that information.\u00a0 We hope in vain that the next day when the rest of the students return will be better, but realise that won\u2019t happen.When I get home I make a feeble attempt at feeding the kids, one of whom got soaked biking to the first day of college classes, and the other who is recovering from oral surgery (both of us are eating soft foods).\u00a0 They are otherwise in good cheer, and I work feverishly to finish my syllabus and find the pages for the first handout. This drives me nutz, because I normally have stuff ready a week ahead of time, especially when I\u2019m teaching a class for the first time. I\u2019m stressed to the gills, but I have to pull it off.I dash off to the college, stopping by the department office (in building A) to see if the roster is in my mailbox; it\u2019s not, but the department head is there and she tells me where to find it on the Web site. Then I need to get the handouts to the copy center (in building B), only to find that in yet-another-ADHD-moment I left the syllabus on the printer at the house.\u00a0 (I do this so damn often.\u00a0 I began to wonder if I need a medication dosage adjustment, and then realised that what I really need is just more sleep.) Thankfully I have my laptop and flashdrive, so I can go over to the library and copy the file from my laptop to the flashdrive and the onto a library computer and then to use their printer to print it, and then make a return trip to the copy center. It is now 15 minutes before class starts at the other end of campus.Someday I want a job with my own office so I don\u2019t have to go through all this hassle.Of course, I also find that key control (in building C) closed before I got on campus, so I have to drive across campus and find a second parking spot (by building D), then wait around my classroom door waiting for security to let me in.\u00a0 I am not feeling as professional as I want to be at this point, and the fact that I am throwing together an impromptu PowerPoint at the last minute doesn\u2019t help.\u00a0 But once we get started, things manage to go along fairly well.\u00a0 I hope.\u00a0 Heaven knows what the students thought; I\u2019d read that snacks weren\u2019t allowed in the lab, and they said that they\u2019d been eating and drinking in there for semesters \u2014 I told them I would check; maybe it was new policy.\u00a0 (Heck, I want to have a hot drink!)\u00a0 They want a break halfway through, and I forgot to do that too, in my exhausted concerns over not forgetting things or running over time.When I get back home, I can\u2019t sleep right away because my mind is a-whirl with details, and with the over-extended momentum of being beyond tired.\u00a0 I post some files for the students on the class access page, and finally crash.And then it\u2019s Friday all too soon, and I drag myself from bed because I would not abandon my coworkers (in job #1) to the guaranteed chaos that this day will be.\u00a0 By the end of the day, the students were no worse than expected (cussing? check. meltdown? check. arguments between students? check.)\u00a0 But the scheduling SNAFUs with the busses and the parent pick-up times and I don\u2019t even have a place to keep my purse and briefcase except in the teacher\u2019s closet and the kids\u2019 injuries requiring the nurse\u2019s attention and the ongoing lack of solid schedules for the staff and individual schedules for the students and the confusion over what some of the new classes were supposed to be doing and the IEP meeting that pulled teachers away for a couple of periods and getting all the students to establish new computer passwords and teaching them how to operate their lockers and the lack of student editions of a set of textbooks but multiple copies of teacher editions \u2026 OMG.There are no commas in that last sentence because our day did not come equipped with the luxury of commas, just a surfeit of exclamation points.Some day I want a job with my own desk so I don\u2019t have to deal with some of this.You don\u2019t even want to know what the house looks like.\u00a0 The yard is just as bad.\u00a0 I have no energy to take care of either.\u00a0 Hubby says the water bill is $15 more than usual, and wonders if a toilet is running.\u00a0 Any more, I can\u2019t tell half the time because that noise is too similar to my tinnitus, and thus drowned out by it.\u00a0 I need to add \u201cfix toilet\u201d to the eternal list of repairs I have to do.Tonight I have plans to go to bed earlier and then sleep in.\u00a0 My housekeeping and weeding and toilet repairs await, as does preparing for teaching the other class on Monday night.\u00a0 Soon I shall have a hot bath, put on my jammies, and compose myself for sleep.Or, maybe I will just \u201cdecompose\u201d, like the old joke about how dead Beethoven wrote his symphonies backwards.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/08/16/backwards-symphonies/", "title": "Backwards Symphonies"},

That I also have chronic free-floating anxiety about forgetting something Very Important is also not surprising.Back in the early 1980\u2019s, I stayed home with our tots and was a free-lance writer.\u00a0 Anyone who has done this knows that one never fills either role as well as they would like, and that the paying job doesn\u2019t pay well because it\u2019s part-time, and the non-parenting hours (and even the parenting hours) are filled with trying to cram in tasks edge-wise.Because I was working for several employers simultaneously while also sending out queries to magazines, the sheer amount of paper to keep straight and deadlines to meet and the inevitable scheduling glitches (the can\u2019t do This because I gotta do That but-before I can do That I gotta do The Other Thing) damn near drove me nuts.\u00a0 I know my frantic moments and frustrations and disorganisation damn near drove my family nuts some days as well.The number of times I forgot my hair cut appointments were an embarrassment. The number of times I would get home and then had to go back out to drop something off or pick something up were legion. At that time, ADHD had only recently hit the DSM, and people usually associated such with hyperactive boys.\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t get my own diagnosis until 20 years later.Like many people with ADHD, I felt terrible about my inability to stay organised.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t try.\u00a0 I tried appointment books and made lists and made calendars and made lists and re-organised my paper filing system and made lists \u2026 and still I failed to keep track of stuff.\u00a0 I even managed to lose track of a check by using it as a bookmark! (Reading that Einstein did the same thing was mollifying, but would not have impressed the bank.)The problem of course is not a lack of willpower.\u00a0 It\u2019s not always a problem with writing things down \u2014 after all, I HAD that calendar and the lists.\u00a0 The problem was \u201cremembering to remember\u201d, meaning remember to check the lists and the calendar at the appropriate times, especially with regards to calling people during \u201cnormal\u201d business hours.\u00a0 The problem was putting things into the Things To Do pile, and then not remembering to get them done before they were due.Of course, the reason that everything I was using was piled on top of my desk was that out-of-sight meant out-of-mind.\u00a0 (Plus, there were the random moments of putting Very Important Objects in Safe Places and then forgetting where they were.)\u00a0 The only way to literally have everything in sight would have been to cover an entire wall in cork tiles and buy a gross of push-pins.\u00a0 But other factors prevented this, including the fact that my first home \u201coffice\u201d was nothing more than a shelf in the linen closet where I stored postal supplies, manilla folders, and an antique typewriter that was so painfully cranky it would have even given pause to a steampunk enthusiast.Eventually I did learn how to develop enabling routines.\u00a0 One of those is what I have spent the past half an hour doing, whilst also scanning various documents and slides, and working on this blogpost, because hey \u2014 multi-tasking is what we like to do!I make it a point to de-clutter my desktop every Friday or weekend.Not only do I remove the trashy bits, but I also rediscover things I need to attend to on a regular basis, refill my pill minder, pay any bills that are due, and I check my calendar and re-assess what my new To Do list needs to include.Fortunately, the decluttering has gotten easier over the years, as I finally realised what general categories of clutter pile up.\nI have the wastepaper basket at hand to dump rubbish into.\nI have a place to set all the papers that simply need filing.\nI have a desk hutch with shelves for each of my classes and jobs, and to improve upon that file-by-pile method I also have brightly-colored folders to fine-sort each pile.\nI make a separate pile of things that need to go elsewhere, and not until everything is sorted do I make just one loop around the house to put those away.\nIf I have a set of papers that is turning into a new project to keep track of, I grab another folder to put them in.\nI review my small bulletin board and remove old things I no longer need, and tack up new things I don\u2019t want to lose \u2014 part of what makes a small board effective is that it does not stay the same week after week \u2014 constancy means a loss of apparency as it simply becomes part of the scenery and thus unnoticed.\nWell, the scanning is done, so I need to wrap this up and make up a test for Monday (et cetera).\u00a0 The other part of what makes the system work is to not get so wrapped up in tidying and organising that I don\u2019t get back to the actual work!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/08/24/depiling/", "title": "Depiling"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t2 March 2007", "body": "I had a half-hour long drive home.  There\u2019s a word stuck in my head, which I end up exorcising in the best way I know how, by repeating it.  (Sometimes they call doing that \u201cpalilalia\u201d.  I call it simply getting stuck on a word.) Special.  Special. Special. Special.  Special. Special. Special.  Special. Special. Special.  Special. Special. Ssssspessshullll.Maybe you know why it\u2019s gotten stuck in my head, because you\u2019ve heard it used in that horribly obnoxious way: \u201cHe\u2019s special.\u201dWhat a stupid word.  Well, a perfectly ordinary word used in stupid ways.Special: something distinct, individual, unique, peculiar, distinguished, unusual, exceptional, extraordinary, or especially valued.In its honest, original meaning, the word lends positive weight.  And then it got horribly warped and weighted down with social baggage.  (Albeit, not quite as badly as words such as \u201cfaggot\u201d, which used to refer to a bundle of sticks for kindling.)  But just use it in (ahem) special wordings, and you get a variety of negative visceral responses.A special school for special children.  Comes off variably snooty, smarmy, or condescending \u2013 what, the rest of the children aren\u2019t special in their own ways?  ::bleh::\n\nMy child has special needs.  Generates pity: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that.\u201d  May generate distrust or denial: \u201cWhat\u2019s so \u2018special\u2019 about your child? How come they get something extra?\u201d  May generate resentment: \u201cWhy does Mommy think she\u2019s special and not me?\u201dSpecial education.  A phrase so heavily loaded with a myriad of issues that it generates sighs in parents, educators, school administrators and educational psychologists everywhere.  People fight to get special education, fix special education, or even to get out of special education.  \u201cSpecial\u201d education was created because regular (or \u201cnormal\u201d) education isn\u2019t flexible enough to deal with the fact that students are not interchangeable units.  At its worst special education meant segregation from one\u2019s school peers, with reduced expectations and educational opportunities.Oh, how the word special can be seriously weighted down with derision: \u201cIsn\u2019t that just so special?\u201dDuring my drive home, I remembered a classic joke, one that ranks highly on sarcasm points: \u201cRemember, you\u2019re special, just like everyone else.\u201d  The sarcasm comes from the acknowledgement that the phrase \u201cyou\u2019re special\u201d is derived from the total deformation of the meaning of the word.  There\u2019s really nothing \u201cspecial\u201d about having different abilities and different needs than everyone else, because everyone does in some manner or another.  The perfectly average person is actually profoundly rare, because everyone is un-average in at least one way.  So why is a child \u201cspecial\u201d, or why are their needs \u201cspecial\u201d, or why does education have to be \u201cspecial\u201d?\u201cOh how special!\u201d \nI hate hearing this.  If everything you do is fabulous, then it doesn\u2019t matter what you do, because you\u2019ll get the same hollow praise and the same insincere responses.  Hey, I\u2019m not looking to be better than other people per se, but I am looking to be recognized for my particular efforts and my accomplishments.I\u2019ve heard it used in a variety of situations, and in a number of r\u00f4les in my life.  After hearing it used by random adults throughout primary school, I began to cringe.  I had no idea who most of those adults were \u2013 they weren\u2019t my teachers, but were usually other associated staff members and parent volunteers (\u201croom mothers\u201d back when it was assumed that mothers stayed at home and were idle).  After-school events (dare I say it? special events) such as ice cream socials or once-a-month films or anything so random as a meeting for the student library volunteers, seemed to attract such adults who then generated these kinds of comments.The well-intended adults wanted to praise and encourage the children around them, and also wanted to keep them docile and occupied, possibly even entertained.  So we as hapless victims ended up with stupid crafts using paper plates, felt or tongue depressors, crafts that no one wanted to do past the age of eight.  Little kids would do the crafts because they just liked to mess around with the materials.  But generally older kids would only do them to be compliant.The problem with such special \u201carts and crafts\u201d was that they were not very functional \u2013 we couldn\u2019t learn any new real-world skills, and nothing useful to be made.  What is anyone going to do with a \u201cbook mark\u201d made from beads glued on a strip of felt?  You can\u2019t really use it because the glue won\u2019t hold the beads, and even if you did, the beads were so lumpy they would damage the book.  What is the point of a \u201cplace mat\u201d made from construction paper and poster paint that will dissolve and then stain anything slightly damp?  It really wasn\u2019t a \u201cspecial treat\u201d to be told to cut out this shape from this color and glue to it this spot, and yet also be \u201ccreative\u201d while doing so.Even after I became an adult, I still hear people issuing bizarre commands and praises to the children and young adults (!) in their care, utterances like \u201cGive me blue\u201d or \u201cNice hands\u201d.  (Please folks, if you want children to learn to speak correctly, then you need to model good grammar.)I can hardly explain just how much that squeaky, patronising, coo gets me riled up.  It\u2019s not just the tone of voice, or the phrasing, or the activities.  It\u2019s the adults\u2019 insistence of the children\u2019s slavish obedience to time-filling but personally-unfulfilling special activities.  A few times it\u2019s been all I can do not to upturn the tables of worksheets and ugly crayon stubs, and stomp out of there in frustration. I\u2019ve seen this kind of behaviour in gradeschool classes, Sunday School classes, scout troops, after-school enrichment programs, summer camps and other places.It doesn\u2019t help to explain that no-one wanted to do the arts & crafts last time, and that probably no one will want to do the similar arts & crafts next time.  Telling the children that it is a \u201cspecial\u201d project and that their finished products are also so \u201cspecial\u201d is not going to generate enthusiasm. If they committee members think the result is cute, they assume the children will think it\u2019s cute and their parents will also think it\u2019s cute. The worst part is that scores of people (usually women) seem to find doing this to the \u201cprecious children\u201d to be just so wonderful and happy and helpful! They sit around having little hen-parties about how to come up with more saccharine phrases and more inane, time-wasting cutesy projects.I do my best to avoid such situations. I\u2019m not \u201caloof\u201d, I\u2019m horrified.\u201cIsn\u2019t that special!\u201d  If only.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/03/02/just-so-special/", "title": "Just So Special"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t28 March 2007", "body": "\u201cIt\u2019s not about YOU,\u201d I explained, although I had that dreaded sinking sensation that although the words flowed by her ears and pinballed through the processing areas of her brain, that although she was hearing and listening and understanding the verbiage, the other staff member was also not really understanding what the hell I meant.  Meanwhile, the children around us were bouncing around in various levels of happiness, impulsiveness, mild disobedience, and general obliviousness to rules.  As long as no one was getting hurt, the minor details of behaviour didn\u2019t matter; this was yet another day at the city pool, in a long line of such overly-hot summer days at the city pool.\u201cIt\u2019s not about what you\u2019re doing,\u201d I tried in vain to rephrase, although my efforts were getting to be pretty lame by this time in the afternoon, what with the combination of summer heat, the impact of children\u2019s high-decibel noise aggravated by hyperacussis, and the strain of trying to track a dozen children despite mild faceblindness.  \u201cI mean, how you handle it does matter, but \u2026\u201d  I stared into the distance, as one of our charges was wandering around with her bathing suit bottom halfway up one buttock. I kept track of our children by remembering what bathing suits they were wearing, so I was predisposed to notice such. \u201cBut it\u2019s not about you.\u201d I finished, flapping my hands a bit in agitation as those words were still in my verbal buffer, but I was instead needing to formulate some kind of sentence directed to another staff member closer to our wayward girl.\u201cOh, he\u2019s just being defiant, and I\u2019m not going to let him,\u201d she replied in the self-assured manner of the barely-twenty-something, and left me to go refill her cup of iced cola.  I heaved a big sigh at the idea of \u201cletting\u201d someone be defiant, and went to intercept one of our autistic boys so he wouldn\u2019t toss bits of paper into an air conditioner fan.There are some children who are just explosive in temperament, for any number of reasons.  Handling such children is always tricky, because it\u2019s all to easy to get sucked into the whole situation and end up aggravating the dynamic instead of damping it.Some children get angry because they are being defiant, and are pushing you into a power struggle.  We\u2019re familiar with how this works with toddlers who return instruction with a, \u201cNO!\u201d  The best approach for such is to give them choices that are acceptable to you \u2013 the toddler feels they now have some measure of immediate control over their life, and yet you are still in ultimate control by being able to select options that are appropriate.  Teenagers are sometimes like toddlers-with-hormones, and frequently benefit from similar tactics.  In any regard, you shouldn\u2019t respond to the power struggle, but rather respond to the situation and help the child understand the options they have available to them, and how to anticipate the results of their choices.  (Sometimes I hate to use the word \u201cconsequences\u201d because it has gotten so laden with meaning punishments.)This particular staff member was predictably playing into the power struggle, and was determined that she was going to \u201cwin\u201d by proving something or another to the child.  However, this child wasn\u2019t really being defiant in the volitional sense.  The defiance wasn\u2019t premeditated or consciously malicious.  This was just one of those children who didn\u2019t have sufficiently well-developed mental \u201cbrakes\u201d to be self-aware, anticipate things, and stop himself before he reacted to situations.  Such children frequently have low frustration levels, which are also a result of this kind of dysfunction.The issue here was many-fold.  For one thing, the staff member was reacting to the effects of the problem (the blow-ups) instead of the cause of the problem (the child\u2019s processing dysfunction, plus the ongoing presence of situations that fed into the blow-ups).  For another thing, the staff member believed that she had a lot more ownership of the solution to the problem than she did.  She probably also likely believed that the child had a lot more ownership of the cause of the problem than he did.  But although the child rarely meant to get so upset or angry, he still had to have some responsibility for what he did, otherwise he would end up reneging on most of his personal responsibility and go from being a child with a problem to being a brat with a problem.It\u2019s one of those weird little subconscious glitches in our brains that leads us to make fundamental attribution errors \u2013 our own lapses are caused by environmental reasons (\u201cI of course couldn\u2019t help but be incoherent as the heat and noise was making me tired\u201d), but other\u2019s lapses are caused by their moral failing (\u201cbut she was being foolish\u201d).  Staff members, teachers and other people usually assign successes to themselves, and failures to the children.But in real life, education \u201ctakes two to tango\u201d \u2013 both the teacher and the student need to work at the process.  So does engaging in arguments \u2013 the second person has to continue to give the first person enough responses that reinforce all the hollering and carrying-on.Diffusing these explosive situations is difficult.  We have to figure out just when a child is being truly manipulative, and when it\u2019s some kind of cognitive dysfunction, and when it\u2019s a child with some kind of cognitive dysfunction that on that day is just being manipulative \u2013 life is messy! Sometimes we can identify what kinds of situations tend to spark these meltdowns, and then during a good time, discuss with the child what ways we could work with them to change things so they would be less problematic.  We can also defuse or at least reduce those meltdowns by not giving into the power struggles.  We have to remain compassionate, but detached.  Be calm, remove extra people from the situation, give plenty of personal space, have open and friendly body language to reduce the feeling of threat, even be silent sometimes to let the argument fizzle out.  After the child has calmed down then we can reflect with them in an objective manner about what happened, what needs to be done to rectify the problem by restitution to the others who were involved, and work proactively to reduce such future events.But as I redirected the boy from flicking bits of paper to flicking pool water, I realised that I would not be able to \u201cmake\u201d the other staff member understand something until she was ready to look beyond the necessity for \u201cnot letting\u201d him do something.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t9 March 2007", "body": "Today is International Women\u2019s Day.  This year\u2019s theme is:  \u201cEnding Impunity for Violence against Women and Girls\u201dPeople with disabilities have a variety of difficulties across their lives, not just from the intrinsic problems associated with the disability, but also the handicaps they face socially.  Disabled people are much less likely to finish secondary school, even less likely to go on to further education in university, have more difficulties acquiring jobs compared to their equally qualified non-disabled peers, and therefore generally earn less.  Around the world, women in general also are much less likely to finish secondary school, even less likely to go on to further education in university, have more difficulties acquiring jobs compared to their equally qualified non-disabled peers, and therefore generally earn even less.Not surprisingly disabled women fare worse than disabled men.   But hey, you don\u2019t have to take my word for it.  According to a report by the Independent Living Institute, disabled women:\nData referring to the E.U. shows that percentage of employment in men without disability is 76% versus 36% in disabled men. Regarding women, the percentages vary from 55% in non-disabled to 25% in disabled women.\nStudies done on specific groups (autistic, for example) show that they are more inclined to remain in institutions for longer periods of time than men.\nThere are a lot of barriers that make access to birth control and family planning very difficult, such as physical barriers, communication barriers etc.\nIn hospitals disabled women are used as models for trainee doctors, without previously asking them for their permission. Videos and slides are taken of disabled women to be used as teaching aids without any control over their use.\nThere are permanent debates on the role women are supposed to play, and that assigned to disabled persons. As a result, while women in general are pressured by society to motherhood, disabled women are forced into not having children, and this many times leads to unauthorised sterilisation, or denial of adoption on the basis of the \u201cincapacity of the mother\u201d to take care of them adequately.\nIn theme with this year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day, there\u2019s also the issue of violence against women.  Again, women who are disabled fare worse off than those who are not.  Furthermore, it is even more difficult for women with disabilities to recognise, prevent or stop such problems.The report goes on to describe the various kinds of violence that happen to women with disabilities.  These are described as Active Violence (physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, economic abuse) and Passive Violence (physical neglect, emotional neglect).  These can be manifested in the following ways:Physical abuse:\nAny direct or indirect action that can damage the life, welfare or health of disabled women, provoking pain, unnecessary suffering or health deficiency.\nManifestations:\n* Aggressions in different parts of the body\n* Unjustified administration of drugs.\n* Restrictions of mobility.\nAlert Signs:\n* To be found in sedative or nervous conditions.\n* Motor dysfunction not due to their disability.\n* Signs of physical violence: marks in wrists and ankles, fractures, bites, internal damages, burns, etc.\n* Detriment in their remains of physical capacity.\nEmotional abuse:\nBehaviour model that results from damage to the welfare and emotional balance of a disabled woman.\nManifestations:\n* Isolation, prohibiting or limiting the access to means of communication (phone, mail..), to information and to keep in contact with other relatives and neighbours.\n* Oral cruelty, by means of insults, constant criticism, making fun of their body, punishments in the presence of others.\n* Over protection.\n* Speaking, deciding or giving opinions in her name.\n* Intimidation, and /or emotional blackmail.\nAlert Signs:\n* Depression.\n* Communication and interrelation difficulties.\n* Insecurity, and low self-esteem.\nSexual abuse:\nActions that are a sexual aggression towards disabled women, and can produce physical or emotional harm.\nManifestations:\n* Rape.\n* Sexual vexation or humiliation.\nAlert Signs:\n* Marks or/and injuries in genitals.\n* Fear to relate with certain people.\n* Undesired pregnancies.\n* Venereal diseases.\nEconomical abuse:\nActions that pursue the loss of control and rights on properties, money or family shared inheritances. The use of the image of a disabled woman against her will, to gain money for third persons, is also considered economic abuse.\nManifestations:\n* The use of disabled girls or women in mendacity.\n* Employing disabled women in poorly paid jobs usually linked to clandestine employment.\n* Limiting the access to information and management of personal economy.\n* The use of money as a sanction.\n* The family denies the access to external economic resources (jobs, grants..).\nAlert Signs:\n* Depending too much on others.\n* Little expectations regarding herself and her personal or professional projection.\nPhysical neglect:\nIt is understood as such, the denial or privation of the basic aspects to keep the body in good shape, in relation with health, hygiene and image.\nManifestations:\n* Negligence in feeding.\n* Personal carelessness.\n* Neglecting hygienic measures.\n* Lack of supervision.\nAlert Signs:\n* Malnutrition.\n* Frequent illnesses not caused by disability.\n* Inadequate cloths regarding sex, climate, and the persons\u2019 handicaps.\n* Dirty clothes.\n* Long periods of time without supervision.\n* Physical problems worsen due to lack of treatment.\nEmotional neglect:\nThose actions that deny or deprive attention, consideration and respect towards disabled women.\nManifestations:\n* Ignoring their existence.\n* Giving no value to their opinion.\n* Feeling ashamed about them.\nAlert Signs:\n* Lack of interaction.\n* No motivation concerning their personal development.\n* Scarce or no participation in family or social activities.The study came up with the following conclusions:\nMany disabled women see themselves as subjects of maltreatment and abuse, while society ignores the problem.\nMany disabled women do not see themselves subjects of violence, because they consider these situations habitual in their lives and associated with disability.\nDisability is a risk factor when suffering abuse and maltreatment situations, which added to the fact of being a woman, increases the risk to higher rates than those of the violence suffered by women in general.\nWomen with sensorial, learning, and communication problems, are more likely to suffer abuse and violence.\nNot having the traditional female roles assigned contributes to lower self-esteem and increases vulnerability, elements that favour becoming an object of violence.\nViolence against disabled women shares common characteristics with the female collective, but has specific characteristics as well.\nMost professionals in charge of counselling and interventions in maltreatment to women ignore that many disabled women are in the same situation. Either because information does not reach them, or because they do not typify as violent acts those they believe associated to disability.\nDepending on others to cope in daily life increases the risk of being objects of violent actions. This risk is believed lower when personal assistance is given with former professional training and psychological aptitude.\nViolence against disabled women has more to do with the fact it is considered an extenuating circumstance that these actions are perpetrated against \u201ca faulty being\u201d, than on using a woman\u2019s body as a demonstration of power and control.\nThe report goes on to describe specific details from several countries.  Near the end, the authors describe some of the difficulties that disabled women face when trying to extricate themselves from abusive situations:It is extremely difficult for any abused woman to leave a situation of abuse. A woman is hit by a husband or a partner an average of 35 times before she calls the police. Battering undermines self-esteem and can make a woman feel she is somehow responsible for her own abuse. For a woman with a disability, this situation is even more difficult. She may be dependent on her abuser for affection, communication and financial, physical and medical support. If she reports the abuse, she may risk poverty and loss of housing and support. She may fear she will not be heard or believed is she speaks out. She may face further violence, institutionalisation, or loss of her children if she seeks help. She may not have access to information about existing support services for victims of violence. Even if she has this information, many sources of support may not be accessible. She may not be able to contact the police or women\u2019s shelters because they do not have communication devices as telecommunication devices for the deaf. She may not be able to physically leave her situation because of a lack of accessible transportation. Her lack of options may leave her feeling so powerless and despairing that suicide seems the only viable choice. And if she seeks help in dealing with suicidal thoughts or attempts, she is unlikely to find counselling which takes account of her own reality. And so she is left isolated and possibly suicidal.Just as the problems are multifaceted, so are the solutions.  The report recommends:\nAbusive behaviour needs to be acknowledged as a serious social and in some cases criminal problem, rather than being considered a private matter.\nProtocols need to be developed for institutions to screen potential employees and volunteers.\nProtocols need to be developed to address the abuse that occurs in institutional settings.\nCommunity living alternatives need to be made available for women with disabilities.\nCourses need to be made accessible and available to women with disabilities (in self-defence, assertiveness training, and sex education).\nAppropriate suicide consoling which meets the special needs of women with disabilities needs to be made available.\nTransition houses and other existing support services need to be made accessible, and frontline workers in shelter facilities need to be sensitised to the needs of women with disabilities.\nWomen with disabilities need to be hired to provide this training and to work in these centres and\nWomen in all communities need to work together develop a co-ordinated approach to dealing with the abuse of all women.\n", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.un.org/events/women/iwd/2007/background.shtml", "http://www.independentliving.org/docs1/iglesiasetal1998.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/03/09/international-disabled-womens-day/", "title": "International ^DISABLED Women\u2019s\u00a0Day"},

The same also applies to feelings, despite all the social conventions we ascribe to making someone sad or someone else making us happy, or a situation making us frustrated. No one is actually responsible for someone else\u2019s feelings.In truth, our feelings arise not from the situations and not from what people say or do, but rather from our views and opinions about events.  This is why different people can have different responses to the same situations.This is why the verbal abuse from others rolls right past me now, because I understand that it\u2019s not really about me, it\u2019s about other people acting out their problems.\u201cI didn\u2019t really mean it,\u201d he protested, \u201cShe knows I didn\u2019t really mean it; I was just all stressed out about my mom.  She shouldn\u2019t get so mad.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still responsible for what you say to others that can be upsetting to them.\u201dNor is anyone necessarily responsible for the feelings they have, especially given that they arise from parts of the brain that we do not have conscious control over.However, everyone is responsible for their own actions.  We are responsible for what we do that others can react to in their happiness, sadness, anger or fear.  We are also responsible for our own words and actions derived from our own happiness, sadness, anger or fear.\u201cI can\u2019t help it \u2013 I\u2019m pissed!\u201d he ranted, pacing back and forth.\u201cOkay, you can\u2019t help being angry.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 February 2007 ", "body": "Everyone in life has to compensate in some manner or another, because no one excels at everything. If you are not mechanically inclined, you take your car to a shop to get the oil changed, and you call a plumber to fix leaks or replace worn faucets. If you\u2019re not comfortable with arithmetic calculations, you have a a tax specialist do your annual return, and you arrange for automatic payroll deposits and bill payments with your bank. These are ways that ordinary people deal with ordinary difficulties, and no one thinks any less of them. In fact, the economy depends upon people\u2019s interdependency \u2014 earning your living doing things for others is important to the Gross National Product, is important to a town\u2019s sense of community, and is important to a person\u2019s self-worth from feeling useful.It is curious that people who have others do everyday things for them because they are rich are envied, whereas people who have others do everyday things for them because they are unable to do them are looked down upon. People with ability sets that are different than the \u201caverage\u201d person\u2019s run into problems because they are being \u201cinappropriately incompetant\u201d. Some of those \u201cshould be able to\u201d things are related to sex-r\u00f4le stereotypes: a man should be able to fix a leaky faucet, a woman should be able to sew her own shirts. Among more traditional or conservative populations, a person is not faulted if they are incompetant at a skill that is reserved for the other gender. However, when someone cannot do something that is expected of everyone, or cannot do it well, or cannot do it consistently, they are then open to derision.The Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler noted how people compensated and even over-compensated as ways of dealing with perceived incompentancies and avoiding feelings of inferiority. Not all \u201cincompentancies\u201d really are gross difficulties \u2014 they may merely be assigned as such by others around us.I\u2019ve mentioned before that my life is a mass of compensatory strategies. I compensate for auditory processing problems, and the tinnitus that increases the background noise problem. I compensate for prosopagnosia (difficulties recognising people from their faces). I compensate for all those organisational, time-sense, and executive-functioning issues related to ADHD and Asperger\u2019s (planning, executing tasks including the getting-past-the-inertia stages, self-monitoring). I compensate for the hyperacusis, and my general clumsiness, tics and stuttering, and migraines. Generally speaking I compensate fairly well. So much so that most people don\u2019t realise that I am working much harder to achieve nearly as well. I \u201cpass for normal\u201d most days, so people can\u2019t understand why I\u2019m having problems when I\u2019m ill or stressed or simply trying to compensate for too many things simultaneously.Adler would probably say that I over-compensate.I had to go through Driver\u2019s Education class twice to acquire the necessary motor skills. I did eventually learn to drive stick shift (manual transmission) and have even driven in both the UK and US. The day that I parallel-parked in front of my high school to request a transcript to be sent to a college was indeed a threshold moment in my life. (Even the transcript part was a highlight, as assaying higher education was uncertain due to my previous academic difficulties.) My husband once asked me, \u201cWhat, can\u2019t you drive and talk at the same time?\u201d and I did not feel that it was unreasonable to answer, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d I cannot drive a stick shift vehicle through city traffic, trying to find a business I had never been to, and talk on a cell phone. (I have Auditory Processing Disorder and he has a severe hearing loss \u2014 talking on the phone can be inherently confusing in its own right.)There are classes when I struggle to keep my attention focused on the instructor, and also to understand what they are saying, especially if the classroom is mechanically noisy, or if the instructor mumbles or talks while facing the whiteboard or doesn\u2019t present information in a clearly-defined format or use supplementary visuals. Because I am very good at being able to distinguish the important material in an educational presentation and record those details in sensible paragraphs, I have been a note-taker for dysgraphic or hearing-impaired students. But I have only been able to do that in those subjects where I was already familiar with most of the information \u2014 I could not be a note-taker for others if I was still learning all the vocabulary and concepts myself.Mathematics presents special difficulties for me because of problems with sequencing, slow working speed, and occasional transpositions. It took me four years to memorise my multiplication tables, and I have flunked a number of tests over the years, and nearly had to take a class over. In university I dropped a course that I was getting D or F grades, to try it again later on to get C, B or A grades, and did that with more than one course. It was slow, difficult work slogging through college algebra, trigonometry, calculus, statistics, physics, and four semesters of chemistry. One of my current jobs is working as a special education paraprofessional. I help in the science classroom, but my main assignment is in the math classroom. The extremely ironic thing is that not only am I helping students with mathematics, but also that I am doing so in the very same school I attended years ago, in the same classrooms where I had once sat flunking math tests. (My first work week was not only difficult from the prosopagnosia-aggravated new-job disorientation, but also from \u201cpost-traumatic school disorder\u201d as I had ongoing flashbacks.)I actually did flunk a semester of secondary English and had to re-take that portion of the course. I have also written a book and hundreds of articles (on a variety of subjects) for magazines and newspapers. I tutor college students in composition classes.Given these examples, it might sound as though my difficulties were all in the past, and have been made up for by my recent successes. That isn\u2019t quite true. What I have done is learned how to work around some kinds of difficulties. With others I simply have to work harder to puzzle through consciously to figure out those things that most people do easily and without conscious effort.  Some days I feel like Alice Through the Looking Glass, running as fast as I can just to stay in place.The problem with over-compensation is that although I have at times felt that I had vanquished my personal demons of incompetancy by having overcome various failures with landmark achievements, those successes do not mean that I cannot or will not have future problems!  What helped more than those moments of personal glory (exhilerating though they were, despite lacking exciting soundtrack music), has been finding out why I have problems, how those problems manifest in my daily life, and how to work with them.  Self-understanding improves self-image because it gives me tools for those ongoing and future difficulties.  Self-understanding means that the next time I fail something (not \u201cif\u201d but \u201cwhen\u201d, because everyone does fail periodically), I will have the necessary cognitive and emotional tools to handle the disappointment.  I will be able to handle defeat graciously, because it is a failure of task-specific achievement, not moral failure.  Furthermore, I can extend that same grace to others, because we all have such problems, even though the details differ.Out in our various communities, we need to be able to not only acknowledge that Yes, not everyone can do the same thing, but also destigmatise that fact.  One of the tragedies with the current paradigms in the helping professions is the disdain and depersonalisation from \u201ccare-givers\u201d to that people who need personal attendant services or other forms of assistance.  We can\u2019t all do the same things.  Needing someone to change your diaper should be no more stigmatising than needing someone to change the oil in your car.  There\u2019s really something sick about people who feel superior those whom they serve \u2014 there\u2019s an element of self-loathing transferred from one\u2019s self to one\u2019s job to the client.  It is overcompensation of the soul-eating malicious sort.  Service to others is about sharing strengths, not about bolstering one\u2019s damaged self-worth at the expense of others\u2019.We should not have to overwork ourselves to over-compensate just to earn other\u2019s acceptance.", "outgoing_links": ["http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/adler.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen%27s_race"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/02/03/running-with-the-red-queen/", "title": "Running With the Red\u00a0Queen"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t8 February 2007 ", "body": "At 45, I can now claim to being somewhere in that amorphous zone of \u201cmiddle-aged\u201d where one is no longer the puppy-faced young adult, but hasn\u2019t quite slipped over to the realm of the white-haired elders.  By this point I have had enough \u201ccharacter-building experiences\u201d to go from Having Character to at times Being A Character.Character-building experiences are usually the sorts of events that push you to go beyond your usual boundaries.  Sometimes they are single events that require extreme effort or pushing past fears, and sometimes they are ongoing events that require tenacity and adaptability.  In any case, the \u201ccharacter-building\u201d part means that you have expanded your positive self-image, and realise that you can do more than you thought you could, and that you can be resolute in your efforts in future difficulties.Not all character-building experiences are heroic in scale; some of them come from periods of quiet desperation where the efforts are on the inside.  Other people cannot see the amount of work required in the soul-searching, and overcoming the wavering to just give up, but that hardly negates the importance of the experience, and the sheer amount of bravery it involved.Many people misunderstand what is meant by \u201cbravery\u201d.  Being brave does not mean that you aren\u2019t scared.  Rather, being brave means that you do what you need to do, even when you are scared.However, not all \u201cadversity\u201d is the same. Teaching and parenting involves providing people with tasks that are a bit challenging, but not beyond their abilities. It\u2019s our job to help teach them the tools they need, and to scaffold them up to the next level. If we give them tasks that are way beyond their abilities or dump them into situations without the right tools or guidance, then we are setting them up for a lot of failures.There\u2019s also a big difference between challenging someone, and simply making things unnecessarily difficult for them. I\u2019ve had more than my fill of the latter, thank you.  (Clue:  they don\u2019t build character, they just make me annoyed!)Making things unnecessarily hard often involves adding problems that are really not needed, and have no direct bearing on the ultimate purpose of the task at hand.  Making a child learn how to tie shoelaces in order to participate in sports is an example of this.  Although a player may need to wear a uniform or protective equipment, being able to tie shoelaces should not be a stumbling block to the benefits of sporting activities, such as getting exercise, having fun, learning to work with team members, and being a part of a group that shares goals and experiences.Another example would be grading a poster done for a school assignment on penmanship in addition to how well the content of the poster fulfilled the requirements for factual presentation and layout.  It\u2019s much more sensible to let students type out their labels and descriptions, rather than let them get frustrated over their slowness or difficulty in handwriting.When we go from making things challenging to merely making things difficult, we don\u2019t help people expand their positive self-image.  Instead, we create situations that too easily add more to the burden of negative self-image.  Here the student or child does not learn what we set out to teach.What we learn from the \u201cschool of hard knocks\u201d depends very much upon what we bring with ourselves in the way of skills and attitudes.  But in any regard, my goals do not include teaching people that life\u2019s a bitch and people are bastards, even if those are sometimes true.I\u2019ve yet to meet anyone who has not had enough of those kinds of experiences in their life.  And everyone I have met has needed more of the kinds of experiences that help them learn how to overcome their own self-doubts and how to deal with problems in life.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/02/08/building-a-character/", "title": "Building A Character"},

I see young and middle-aged men and women on campus, at grocery stores, at malls and other mundane places walking about with such headsets clipped to their ears, like so many cyborgs.Having one of these doesn\u2019t just mean that you can talk on the phone while having your hand[s] free to do other things. They are also new and flashy. (Other kinds of hands-free mobile phone equipment have been around a while, but are much less \u00e6sthetic and look like electronics shop prototypes.) Wearing one is a means of conspicuous consumption \u2013 it shows off how affluent and \u201cimportant\u201d you are because you need to talk to people and other people need to talk to you, and it shows that you are comfortable with newer kinds of tech compared to the now-mundane pocket mobile phone.My [ex-]husband bought a hands-free attachment for his mobile phone before they became widespread. His is different though \u2013 it consists of a lavalier microphone that he wears around his neck. The mike sends the outgoing signal to his mobile phone, but the incoming signal from his mobile phone is sent directly to his (programmable, digital) behind-the-ear hearing aids.This means that every time he makes or receives a phone call he has to switch from environmental reception to wireless telephone reception, and also that his incoming auditory signal is stripped of most of the environmental sounds, thus producing a cleaner signal with less real noise and less digital \u201cnoise\u201d. (This is an improvement over using land-line phones, few of which have volume-control receivers.)The unexpected part was that compared to the everyday mobile phone user, most people cannot tell when he is in phone conversation. He\u2019s usually standing with his hands in his pockets or pacing about. Unlike someone\u2019s chunky piece of electronic ear jewelry, his behind-the-ear aids are less noticeable (especially if it\u2019s been a while since his last haircut). Plus, people don\u2019t usually associate hearing aids with wireless communication.So what we have is hubby standing there, staring at nothing in particular and absent-mindedly fiddling with stuff in his pockets, as he talks in an animated manner to someone who isn\u2019t there, pausing for them to reply periodically. Of course, everyone around him cannot hear the other end of the conversation, and most people don\u2019t notice the lavalier mike. My husband appears to be conversing with the voices in his head.And then there\u2019s those fiddly moments when he adjusts switches on his hearing aides, microphone, and mobile phone to finish or start a call, and what he is actually doing becomes more apparent. Those around him regularly learn what\u2019s going on, especially as anyone who\u2019s ever phoned him has had to pause a moment while he switches to his microphone.Like millions of other people, my husband has been wearing hearing aids since he was a small boy. And yet society still associates hearing aids with decrepit old age. Advertisements in various media abound describing how this-or-that brand of aid is \u201cinvisible\u201d, and the models are white-haired folk. Although hearing aids now come in a variety of fun, shockingly-bright on-my-head-and-in-your-face colors and jewelry styles, most of the advertisements you see are still for the \u201cflesh-tone\u201d beige sort that don\u2019t match anyone\u2019s flesh tone, especially someone the least bit brown-skinned. In contrast, glasses have become much less of a stigma, and we even have funky sports cords and beaded chains to keep track of those that are intermittently worn.Given the rising popularity of wearing one\u2019s hardware as a piece of body ornamentation, maybe our auditory & visual devices \u2013 hey, even assorted orthotic devices \u2013 can become simply part of the ordinary accoutrement.Then again, maybe not. The dividing line between has always been about prestige versus need. Only the very wealthy have been able to have the luxury of lady\u2019s maids or butlers to do mundane activities for them. Only the most \u201cbroken\u201d helpless at the bottom of the social heap have been forced to have personal assistants do mundane activities for them. It\u2019s staff-as-luxury versus staff-as-necessity.Makes no sense to me. Humans are so irrational.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/productlist/CA/EN,crid=2192", "http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/TOS/character/1112511.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobot#Lobot", "http://www.guytel.ca/index.php?fuseaction=cat.detail&ID=34", "http://www.westone.com/hhc/hhp_colors.html", "http://www.earwearinc.com/catgD.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/03/31/cyborg-cool-versus-crip-pity/", "title": "\u201cCyborg Cool\u201d   Versus \u201cCrip\u00a0Pity\u201d"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t17 February 2007", "body": "They were staging a sit-in.  All four of them, sitting there and staring intently at me, What is she going to do?I looked at the other adult in the room and asked, \u201cDid you say the four-letter F-word?\u201dHe shook his head no.  He had in fact said neither Fish nor even Chicken.  But there were all four cats gathered by their dishes and staring fixedly at me.  They do that every now and then \u2013 instead or one or two cats reminding some random person that the kibble dishes are getting empty, all four of them will gather round and complain at me, specifically. The woman who can read enough feline body language to know that the congregation is requesting goodies from the pop-top cans.  Manna from Mama.  Apparently the usual dry kibble gets boring, and they want \u201cchicken slices in gravy\u201d or some such thing.Except for tonight. Spot isn\u2019t having any of it.  He\u2019s not swarming around my ankles and meowing, but rather sitting on a dining chair and staring at me with his great, golden eyes.  The goody from the pop-top can doesn\u2019t appeal.  He probably smelled the bag of grilled salmon take-out that hubby had brought home and popped in the refrigerator.  Spot prefers \u201creal\u201d fish to the processed glop from the tin; he used to catch his own meals at a lake.  In fact, the past few times I\u2019ve cooked fish he has waited for and requested the leftovers, which he\u2019s welcome to because fish doesn\u2019t reheat well.It only took a few meals for Spot to learn what I meant when I asked him, \u201cHey, Spot!  Fish?\u201d  Spot\u2019s a smart cat; it took less than half a dozen repetitions (\u201ctrials\u201d as they are known in training parlance) for him to associate hearing the human word \u201cFish\u201d with the generalised concept of sushi tuna, grilled salmon or poached tilapia for him to eat.  Those trials didn\u2019t even happen in the same hour or the same day.Now, teaching Spot to learn the word \u201cfish\u201d did not involve any rigorous training sessions.  I merely caught his attention by saying his name, then set down a dish containing some various leftovers while saying, \u201cFish!\u201d It\u2019s simple associative learning.  Granted, food is a good reinforcement, and he was already aware that some of the things people say are directed to him and are meant to inform him of something.He also knows that when I say, \u201cWater\u2019s boiling,\u201d this means that he needs to get off my lap so I can get up and make a cup of tea, and that I\u2019ll return in a minute to make a lap for him again.  That\u2019s actually much more complex; for all he knows, the syllables \u201cWater\u2019s boiling,\u201d really mean, \u201cGet up\u201d.  But he\u2019s also observed that when I say \u201cWater\u2019s boiling,\u201d instead of something like, \u201cOkay, I gotta get up now,\u201d or \u201cTime to make dinner,\u201d that I am going to return to my chair shortly, and that if he hangs around he gets to curl up with me again.  Sometimes he stands on the chair cushion, rather than laying down on it, because he knows I\u2019m likely to come back and sit down.  That\u2019s a more complex chain of events; he\u2019s not only associated a spoken word with an action for him to do, but he\u2019s also observing my behavioural patterns so he can choose his next course of action.But for all of his high level of feline intelligence, he\u2019s still limited in what he can learn.  Especially compared to a human child.If you use food as a familiar, desireable food reinforcement, how many trials do you think it will take for a human child to learn to associate a word or two with an action?  For example, \u201csit down\u201d or \u201cstand up\u201d.Six?  Twelve? Maybe fifteen?How about over 100?  We\u2019re talking about children who have grown up in a home where other people have been using language with the child for over two years.  Presumably the child knows that some of the things people say are directed to him and are meant to inform him of something. Food is a good reinforcement, and the child\u2019s favorite foods are even used. (We have to assume that the child\u2019s hearing is fine, and that the adult has the child\u2019s attention.)Here\u2019s a parent\u2019s description of an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) training session with their child (wwwautismtoday.com/karen.htm):\u201cSit down,\u201d I\u2019d repeat, this time placing my hands on his shoulders to gently guide him into the chair. Eyes still averted, he allowed me to ease him down.\n\u201cGood boy!\u201d  I\u2019d squeeze an M&M between his pursed lips for his efforts, recording a \u201cP\u201d to indicate that I \u2018d had to manually prompt him for his second trial.\n\u201cSit down,\u201d I\u2019d repeat 27 more times, alternating between M&M\u2019s, chocolate chips, hugs and tickles, recording each discrete trial.\nThen I\u2019d begin with 30 trials of \u201cstand up,\u201d \u201cturn around\u201d, and other \u201cone-step\u201d commands before moving on to teaching Jake to \u201cdo this\u201d as I manually prompted him 30 times to drop a block in a bucket.\nAfter each of the 30 trials, we\u2019d take a structured play break.\nIt took a total of 150 trials over three weeks to teach Jake to sit down, 180 trials over three weeks to teach Jake to stand up, and 2,100 trials over 10 weeks to teach Jake to look at us when we called his name.The child was two years old.  There were people doing this with him for forty hours a week, month after month.Different children learn in different ways, and on their own different time schedules.   Some skills take longer than others. I was eight years old before I learned to tie my shoelaces; I had to acquire the fine-motor dexterity to manipulate the laces and maintain the right tension, and be able to remember and follow the sequence of steps. I compensated for my lack of shoelace tying by wearing buckle shoes during my first three years of school.  In the grand scheme of all things scholastic, it wasn\u2019t a big deal.  It was a big deal for my parents and I do remember spending a lot of frustrated days sitting around fighting with the laces on my sneakers (trainers).  Every now and then some adult would sit down with me and show me how they tied shoelaces.  Thankfully, my third-grade teacher\u2019s method of direction was different enough that the process finally made sense.But when an instructional method requires 150 or 180 repeated trials for the child to learn to associate a word with an activity they already know how to do \u2026 that really seems like it\u2019s the wrong teaching approach for the child.Maybe parents are too fearful of another four-letter F-word, Fail.  They are afraid that without endless hours of intensive, repetitious work (and mounds of data sheets to show for it), that their children will fail to learn and grow.  Amazingly, children do learn and grow.  I\u2019m not saying that additional instructional is not sometimes necessary, but rather than given these kinds of results, such an approach does not seem to be the best method.Applied Behavioural Analysis is neither a good nor a bad thing unto itself.  But any good teaching naturally uses behavioural observation and analysis.  And if those observations show that someone has not learned something after a considerable number of tries, then the instructor needs to analyse where in the teaching process the breakdown is occurring, and to consider what other means might be more efficacious.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/02/17/the-four-letter-f-word/", "title": "The Four-Letter F-Word"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 February 2007 ", "body": "I teach community-education classes on gardening. Unlike typical college credit classes where the instructor can generally assume some base level of knowledge and even some demographic homogeneity, these attendees are a real mixed group.I get complete novices, and seasoned gardeners who just want to pick up some new ideas. I get dysgraphic students who are relieved to see extensive handouts.  I get enthused teenagers and first time home-owners, and old people who haven\u2019t gardened since they were children helping feed the family during times of economic scarcity. I get students in wheelchairs who are glad to see tables instead of combined desk-chair units.  I get students who have not finished high school and need science concepts explained, and students who have advanced degrees in other fields and want to know how the basic science gets applied in the practical side of horticulture. I get dyslexic students who request being able to audio-record the lecture or get a printout of the powerpoint pictures. I get students who have lived in the area for years, and others who have just moved from a completely different part of the continent and are unfamiliar with the climate and local flora. I get students who are shadowed by sign-language interpreters for whom I fetch seating and make sure that the lighting is set to illuminate them. In other words, I get ordinary students who are a sample group that reflects the population at large.  (Well, a horticulturally-interested subset of that population at large.)I get adults who will come in and meekly ask where they are \u201csupposed to\u201d sit.  Oft times these are older adults, who I am assuming are defaulting to some childhood paradigm of Being The Good Student.  It\u2019s interesting to see if they find being told, \u201cYou may sit where-ever you want!\u201d to be a liberating or momentarily disconcerting.  (The side-to-side ranks of tables do not easily lend themselves to a someone who is mentally defaulting to traditional school desks lined up in front-to-back rows.)I like to set out the handouts on the tables before class starts.  This helps prevent me from forgetting some of the parts, and also helps prevent that confused flurry that results from handing out stacks of paper to the people at front and letting each person in the crowd try to figure out how things should be passed back. (The students in my classes never sit together in a solid cluster, so the paper-passing is not the simple conveyer-belt effect one might expect to see.)Having the handouts out ahead of time also serves another utility for me in that it gives me some measure of control over the attendee scatter.  Generally I don\u2019t care where people sit, but sometimes I am given large lecture rooms that seat 120 when I only have 10 students.  If the students follow the diffusion typical of dining areas and libraries, they would be all over the place, which is a strain on my vocal cords when I am going to be talking for two hours.  So when someone comes in and doesn\u2019t sit at a place that already has handouts, I tell them, \u201cYou\u2019ll need some handouts.  You can sit where-ever you want, but it\u2019s easier if I don\u2019t have to holler to the back of the room, as I don\u2019t have a microphone.\u201d  Once in a while I will have someone who feels the need for more personal space and sits a few rows back from the last person.  That\u2019s okay with me; we don\u2019t need to be in a huddle.I also tell my students, \u201cIf you need to get up and move around during that class because of a back problem or if you\u2019re just hyperactive, that\u2019s okay.  I shouldn\u2019t get to be the only one who\u2019s pacing around!\u201dI also get distressed students.  I get young moms who are desperately hoping they can get through large chunks of the class without having to take a fussy baby or rambunctious toddler out into the hallway. I get doctors and the relatives of patients who have to suddenly depart at a pager call.  I get students who arrive nearly half an hour late because they may have ADD and almost forgot that they had a class today, or who may have some level of geographic agnosia and had to ask half a dozen people on campus how to get to the building, hallway, and classroom.  I get students who come defensively clutching notepads and multiples of pens because they are worried about having to take notes and then being tested, even though this is an ungraded class without exams. All these students need reassuring that I am not going to be upset at them, and that I am not grading or judging them, but rather that I am here to help them.Although the individual class topics are about specific kinds of gardens, describing suitable plants and methods for the category is only my proximate goal.  My ultimate goal is to answer the specific questions that each student has brought with them.  I want my students to feel that they have received whatever it was that they came to my class to get.  This is tricky when they are not even consciously aware of what that is!  But it is important that they be able to identify their needs, and then to have those addressed.  That way they will feel that they have spent the two hours in a satisfying manner, and I will be able to both adjust and keep the focus of my classes on what the students need and want. I am not making my classes to follow what I think they \u201cshould\u201d need.Because I am supposed to take roll, I ask everyone to tell me their name (I run on the theory that no one mispronounces their own name!), and to share with the class what in particular they are needing to know that day.  This question gets easier for the students to answer after the first few replies gets people thinking. As the students list topics, I mention if they are already addressed in what I\u2019ve prepared or I will write myself a word or two on the board to jog my ADHD brain and make sure that I answer them in the appropriate context.  All the while, I am mentally adjusting my delivery according to this feedback.This exercise works well on several fronts.  It\u2019s a bit of an ice-breaker, and makes people feel more relaxed about asking questions. The newbies are relieved to hear that other people have the same problems and questions they do, and are less reluctant to speak up.  Sometimes the students already know what they want to do and just want someone to affirm that Yes, it\u2019s your yard, and it\u2019s okay to rip up a shrub you don\u2019t like!  This exercise is also especially good for those subdued Good Students who are not used to being \u201callowed\u201d to have their own opinions about what they want or need to learn, and then advocating to have those needs met.My job description is officially about teaching horticulture, yet in that there is a surprising amount of passing-along of acceptance and self-advocacy.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/02/13/where-ever-you-please/", "title": "Where-ever You Please"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t11 February 2007 ", "body": "\u201cThis process of the good life is not, I am convinced, a life for the faint-hearted. It involves the stretching and growing of becoming more and more of one\u2019s potentialities. It involves the courage to be. It means launching oneself fully into the stream of life.\u201d\n~ Carl RogersWow.  The other day I was looking at my blog stats, and it said that I had 22,000 hits. I have also recently written my 100th post since June; that\u2019s close to thrice a week, for the mathematically disinclined.  So I thought I would take a step back and review what has gone by, to see what kinds of topical trends emerge, and pull up some of what I think are the better posts, for those of you who are newer visitors.Bloggers are usually loquacious and opinionated, a description I do not fail to meet.  But why do I blog? Some bloggers just natter about their lives, others blog as an outlet for kvetching, some are pushing a specific agenda, and still others like to analyse what they see.  I do a little of all the above, but mostly I like to analyse.  I am less concerned about persuading you than I am about giving you something to think about.  After all, if we all believed the same things, the dialogues would get pretty dull!Now that there is data from which to draw a pattern, what kinds of things do I blog about?  In a way it is hard to sort posts into single categories, because topically there is an n-dimensional hypervolume of intersecting sets.  But as an approach, I like to explore themes from personal experience or news events, and also from philosophical perspectives.  I feel that philosophy loses some of its significance without grounding it in the phenomenal fields of people\u2019s lives.  And telling stories of lives without examining the what and wherefore of those events falls short of the ultimate value of storytelling:  revealing the patterns in human relations, and learning from them.Some of the greater categories revolve around education, from both student and instructor perspectives, and they revolve around the politics of disability and advocacy. In contrast, there are some themes that connect those categories.  One of the most important themes is taking the traditional understandings of how social systems work, and taking those apart to reveal very different perspectives on what is happening.These systems include how we communicate, such as when the language of \u201cchoice\u201d is really just a distractor, or doublespeak meant to transfer the apparent (symbolic) power to the one person who in actuality has little power over the situation.  These systems also include power paradigms, including how we \u201chelp\u201d people, how people miss the mark when trying to create \u201cinclusiveness\u201d, and why pity is such a evil force because it creates distance between people. (There is no need to congratulate me for having \u201cbravely overcome\u201d the insults and artificial obstacles that people put in my way.)I also look at how the assumptions we make determine how we define groups of people, from the way that we create diagnostic labels, to the sometimes-absurdities of \u201cperson-first language\u201d, and concepts of \u201ctolerance\u201d.In the end, we don\u2019t need better ways of \u201cbeating\u201d the system, because we are all part of the system, and the beatings must stop. (They haven\u2019t improved morale yet.) What we need are ways of overhauling the system by sidestepping these terrible games and introducing different ways of working together.Our perceptions of the world influence how we act, including how we view and understand others. Sometimes people mistake better identification or newer kinds of identification with \u201cepidemics\u201d of autism, AD/HD et cetera. But I bet if we\u2019d had these kinds of identifiers decades ago, a lot more of us would have been better understood.  Hyperactive kids are kind of hard to miss, even those who otherwise do not misbehave.  (You wouldn\u2019t believe how many ways there are to sit inappropriately!)  More boys than girls are diagnosed, but I have to wonder if that isn\u2019t due more to diagnostic criteria than actual prevalence rate.  Why didn\u2019t we see kids with these kinds of \u201cneeds\u201d in previous decades? Partly because some of those kids didn\u2019t even go to regular schools \u2014 they were kept at home or in institutions.  Those who did go to regular schools just had to struggle along. They rarely had IEPs and such because their parents didn\u2019t \u2013 couldn\u2019t \u2013 ask for services that simply did not exist.When we make these changes in understanding systems and in our perceptions, they can be outwardly expressed by seeking to become a better advocates. Being able to create a new r\u00f4le for one\u2019s self includes being able to learn about the various r\u00f4les that others have played.  (But just try to find sources on disability studies at the local bookstore!)  Advocacy requires overcoming inertia and moving into commitment, and moving into commitment and inclusiveness.  We also have to be able to recognise our own sources of ability and power, especially if we\u2019ve been convinced otherwise.Advocacy is complex, and the concerns of parents for the futures of their disabled children is an important part of that.  Unfortunately, people whine about how hard it is to have an autistic child, or any kind of exceptional child. All too often there are terrible news reports about parents who have killed their handicapped or autistic children because they were such a horrid burden. Even more horrifying is when the press perspective or quotes are full of sympathy for the murderer because killing your own child is \u201cunderstandable\u201d because a person can\u2019t help but be insanely stressed from dealing with the child\u2019s abnormality.It\u2019s hardly not a new trend. But this millennia-old attitude does a terrible disservice to disabled people everywhere to be cast as either devils or angels. It is dehumanizing, and removes us from our humanity, and thus our basic human rights.  In light of the fact that many things have a genetic basis, then hating disabilities in our children involves a curious kind of denial and self-loathing.Distraught parents also need to understand that there is a difference between getting cured and being healed.  The unresolved grief leaves parents susceptible to errors of judgment, and these well-intended but scientifically ignorant people who buy into these things are being duped by charlatans, sometimes with loss of life as well as with great monetary expense. Then the problem is propagated because those well-intended but scientifically ignorant people become meme agents, earnestly spreading the false gospel.  Meanwhile, the rest of us are left to weed out the \u201cAstroturf\u201d of faux grass-roots efforts.Advocacy efforts include those in our schools, and involve administrators, educators, parents, and the students themselves.  Sometimes teachers and parents worry about school accommodations because they fear it will leave the students unready for when they have to venture into the \u201creal world\u201d.  Or, by misunderstanding the differences between equity, equality and need, teachers fear that giving accommodations \u201cwouldn\u2019t be fair\u201d to the other students.Parenting our students with learning difficulties is not easy \u2013 the traditional methods do not work, which is often why the students end up in \u201cspecial\u201d education.  In turn, the students also get frustrated, and attempts to deal with the unmotivated student can sometimes create further problems.  We also have to be careful to distinguish between challenging our students, and just making things more difficult for them.  Distinguishing between cause and effect in misbehaviour is important \u2013 we need to address the causes to resolve problems.The teaching end of things can also be rife with issues, and college professors can sometimes fall prey to pedagogical myths.  Equally absurd is how learning difficulties are often not recognized until the student has been failing or near-failing for a while, thus allowing the student to get further behind and more entrenched in negative mind-sets.  On the flip side, we identify exceptionality by contrasting it to what\u2019s common for the group, or by how well a person functions.  But what if our sampling group is far from average, or if the environment is less disabling?Tutoring and teaching is another means of engaging in advocacy, and one of the best means I have is to share with my students the tools for how they can solve new kinds of problems in the future, for themselves and by themselves.  It also gives me the opportunity to constantly learn from my students.  During this co-educational process, we often need to figure out where in the learning process they are getting stuck, then come up with different ways of helping them learn new information, and different methods for studying.  Sometimes the educational changes we make can be as simple as the way a test is typed up, making it more accessible to all the students.  The way the audio-visual equipment is set up also makes a significant difference, including the kinds of computer monitors and lighting used.  As a tool for engaging your students\u2019 attention, novelty can be a big help.  It can also backfire in unexpected ways\u2026On the more personal scale, I\u2019m always seeking better ways of dealing with my own challenges of \u201cExecutive Functioning\u201d, like dealing with all the stuff, stuff, stuff that piles up, losing something in the Dreaded Safe Place, coping with the inertia of task paralysis, or just getting \u201cstuck\u201d when the Plan B falls apart or I unexpectedly get engrossed in something.  In worse cases, this means pulling myself out of an awful case of the Betweens, which condition you won\u2019t find listed in any manual, but one that any ADD or autistic person will surely recognise. Regardless, it still helps to remember that strategies for compensating are just that \u2013 and that when there\u2019s too much load on the system, those strategies won\u2019t all succeed.  That makes it difficult for me, but sometimes others\u2019 lack of understanding is the greater problem.When I sat and contemplated my place in the grand scheme of things, I found myself wondering just how it was that I could be \u201cdoing things the wrong way\u201d and yet still be producing the right results. Were the processes really as important as the results?  Doing things \u201cnormally\u201d is very important to the general public.  People with a wide variety of differences go to extreme effort trying to \u201cpass for normal\u201d, but this can be perilous.  Some parents spend great effort to ensure their autistic children learn how to do \u201cgood eye contact\u201d, but this may be a poor goal for some unexpected reasons.  People can get hung up on developmental timetables, or they worry and wonder why their child likes to spend lots of time lining things up (it\u2019s a good thing, really).Adults can come up with some pretty off-the-wall assumptions about what is, or is not, going on in a child\u2019s head; we cannot always assign mental processes to the results we see.  Then there\u2019s the situations that an earnest-yet-clueless ADHD or Aspie kid can find themselves in, such as failing to cheat.  The really scary part is how these children who have difficulties socialising with their peers will fall prey to bullying and abuse, and general depression.  Then we grow up into adults, and there\u2019s the whole sticky territory of trying to make Small Talk, and the repercussions of just having a different sense of humor.On the lighter end, a few posts are just for fun; about once a month there\u2019s a \u201cRecess\u201d. Recess means we take a break and play \u2013 it\u2019s important to do that once in a while.  During dinner our family discusses why \u201cresistance is fruitile\u201d, and how to be \u201cunderly pedantic\u201d.  Meanwhile, I have fun with repeating words, and enjoy taking photographs of improbable things.My thanks to you for stopping by, and please to leave comments!andrea ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/02/11/centenary-retrospective/", "title": "Centenary Retrospective"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t17 February 2007 ", "body": "While soaking my aching joints in a hot bath, it occurred to me that as an organism, I am not naturally suited for the environment where I am living.  It\u2019s below the freezing temperature outside, and I don\u2019t hibernate or have enough fur or feathers to keep me warm, plus I would have extreme difficulty acquiring enough food to eat with just tooth and nail.  Furthermore, human young are born at any season, and take years to rear.  From a purely biological perspective, you would think that this hominid species would be limited to foraging family groups living in tropical areas.  We are in high contrast to other intelligent, tool-using species that are well-adapted to their environments.In biology, there are a lot of different means to achieve the same end. All living organisms need to acquire particular kinds of molecules and the energy to assemble them into useful materials so they can grow and reproduce, and also be able to get rid of the kinds of molecules they don\u2019t need; if they reproduce sexually then they need to find another organism with compatible genetic material; and lastly they need to be able to fend off other organisms and to protect themselves from abiotic (environmental) forces that interfere with these activities.  Organisms are \u201csuccessful\u201d by how well they adapt to the available ecological niches, or how well they can create or exploit new kinds of niches.Cetaceans (whales, porpoises, dolphins) and proboscids (elephants) are nearly-furless, polyphagous mammalian species that are well-adapted to the ecological niches they inhabit (\u201cpolyphagous\u201d means an animal eats a variety of foods, which increases the chances for successful foraging or hunting).  They have relatively large brains for their body size, and are intelligent animals with long memories, good learning and problem-solving abilities, and forms of language.  Hominids (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans) are furred polyphagous mammalian species that are well-adapted to the ecological niches they inhabit. Hominids also have relatively large brains for their body size, and are intelligent animals with long memories, good learning and problem-solving abilities, and forms of language.Ecologists refer to such species as being \u201cK-selected\u201d or \u201cK-strategists\u201d, because the numbers of these animals will (under natural conditions) come close to the \u201cK value\u201d, the carrying capacity of the local environment.  That means that the population numbers remain fairly high and stable, and this is reflected in the animals\u2019 ability to live a long time and be able to care for a limited number of slow-maturing offspring.  The intelligence, knowledge and learning ability, and forms of  language contribute to that ability to rear those offspring, and to pass on knowledge in forms of culture.In some contrast, the fourth hominid, the human, is a nearly-furless, polyphagous, invasive mammalian species that is poorly adapted for most of the ecological environments that it inhabits. Humans are also K-strategists, although being an invasive species with high adaptive abilities, sometimes exceeds the local carrying capacity of its environments.  Because of this, humans have the ability to change local and world-wide environments to a far greater degree, and in a shorter period of time, than any other organism.The only reason why the species is not limited to foraging bands living in tropical areas (the prim\u00e6val \u201cEden\u201d) is because we can create so many tools that compensate for our various deficiencies.  We have been able to expand our niche beyond that which is biologically natural by taking tool-making far beyond the immediate-problem-solving level that other animals employ. Social insects such as termites, ants and bees create structures, farm fungus or herd aphid livestock, transform raw materials into honey, structural waxes and papers, but the individual species are still limited by their requirements for specific ecotones.When the \u201cnaked ape\u201d is disabled by not being naturally-adapted to its current environment, it responds by creating long-term tools.  We create clothing and shelter to cope with colder temperature ranges.  We manipulate food resources by herding, farming, hoarding, drying, fermenting, and freezing, and also by selecting, breeding and displacing species far from their natural places of origin.  We create machineries of transport to move ourselves and our things.  We create tools to compensate for limitations of sensory perception, to increase our ability to get information about our environments.  We create tools for the greater memory/storage and dissemination of cultural information.The human is a terrestrial anomaly because it actively seeks to put itself into disabling environments, and creates tools that will allow it to live and thrive in those environments.  Orcas and other dolphins don\u2019t create tools that will allow them to live on land, and elephants don\u2019t make tools that will allow them to colonise temperate zones.  Meanwhile, there are millions of individual humans who would not be able to physically survive in their natural environments, and I don\u2019t just mean the \u201cextremophiles\u201d in low earth orbit or Antarctica.  Easily 99% of the humans alive today rely upon the accommodations of farmed food, shelter and clothing, plus things like corrective lenses, hearing aids, wheels, and health-maintaining pharmaceuticals.There\u2019s a reason why we have different connotations for the words \u201cnude\u201d and \u201cnaked\u201d.  A human is only nude when they feel safe and protected from the world.  But a naked human hominid, stripped of its clothing and other tools, is fairly defenceless, and not easily a successful organism in most environments.One of the benefits to being able to modify environments according to needs is that humans are able to create so many more niches. We can create different personal environments by using different materials to perform different jobs. We can compensate for different abilities in ways that other animals cannot, and thus succeed individually. Our ability to make long-term tools and create micro-environments for ourselves allows us to be successful to live out our natural lifespans, to rear children and care for each other at different life stages.Given that humans must compensate for so many natural disabilities, it\u2019s surprising that we will go out of our way to create additional disabilities for ourselves, those handicaps that are created by the social environments.  The idea that people should be \u201cindependent\u201d and not need things to enable us to function is wholly absurd.  We all need other people and things to learn and to function; it\u2019s the specifics that sometimes differ.  These are artificial barriers to successful living, not natural barriers.The human being as a species is simultaneously the most disabled and yet the most successful organism on the planet.  We need to remember that, especially when we seek to pretend that disabled people are not \u201cnormal\u201d people.  Specific disabilities may not be average, but being disabled is inherently normal.  You can\u2019t get much more inherently disabled than being a naked ape outside of \u201cEden\u201d.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/02/17/ecological-adaptation-and-disability/", "title": "Ecological Adaptation and\u00a0Disability"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t21 February 2007", "body": "CRASH!Some of us are old enough to remember the Ed Sullivan Show, which was a variety show on television.  One guest was a man who would spin plates on sticks.  He\u2019d prop a dowel onto a stand, and get a china plate spinning atop of it (the top of the dowel inside the lip around the base of the plate).  Then when this one was going, he\u2019d start up another plate, and another one, then have to rush over and give the first plate a fresh spin because it would be getting wobbly, re-spin the second plate, add another plate or two, re-spin the third plate, and so on, until his time was spent rushing back and forth re-spinning all his plates.Of course what made this act popular was that it wasn\u2019t just a parlor trick; it was a metaphor for all the things we have to juggle in our lives and sometimes cannot.  You know what happens when you have too many plates spinning; one is likely to get away from you (crash!) as you devote time to another \u2026Some days everything runs pretty well.  I compensate for various difficulties.  I feel smart, converse appropriately, don\u2019t get overly sidetracked, and get things done. No one notices that I am having to work as hard as I really am to \u201cspin all my plates\u201d and keep them in the air.Other days are bumpy and uneven; I do well at some activities, but less well at others.  I can spin all my figurative plates with varying degrees of efficiency, but it is obviously a strain and I don\u2019t try to keep the intensity up all day.  I might drop a plate or two, but manage to pick it back up and get it going again.Then there are the days when my plate-spinning skills suck.  I get too overwhelmed by the quantities of novel inputs I am trying to sort out, or the numbers of simultaneous inputs that all require high-level cognitive work, combined with my internal processing glitches.   Days like this are not unlike switching from a high-speed cable internet connection on a new computer with a GHz processor, to a low-speed dial-up connection on an old computer with a low-MHz processor.  The slow internet connection makes the Web pages load s-l-o-w-l-y frame by frame. Trying to run more than one program at once makes all of them process in an anxious, halting manner.  Every now and then an error message pops up, a program will abruptly close, or the entire system will freeze up and the computer has to be force-quit and rebooted.When my processing gets overloaded, my perceptions of things around me are reduced.  Objects are not individually distinct, but can erratically devolve into indistinct patterns of color and lighting. I cannot identify people by my usual gestalts of nonfacial characteristics, and sometimes I don\u2019t even perceive them as people but just as moving objects. Some kinds of visuals, such as high-contrast vertical stripes or flashing things derail my attention completely, leaving me frozen and entranced.My reading ability gets dyslexic \u2013 I interpret a newspaper headline as \u201cStove Jar Bunk\u201d (instead of \u201cStar Drove Drunk\u201d), and I mix up 2 and 5 or 7 and L.  Grading multiple-choice assignments with all those b and d answers is dizzying, especially with so many of our students also being dysgraphic.  My own writing ability gets erratic, and I spell things inside out, drop entire words, have to focus on forming individual letters, and at worst writing only works at the level of \u201cautofill\u201d where I\u2019m mostly writing or keyboarding by kinesthetic memory.Sounds get intermingled, and the audio processing track gets stutters, repeat loops, and blank spots.  The tinnitus gets worse, and goes from mild background mosquito-whine in one ear to louder buzzing noise or two-tone noises in both ears.  Sometimes when people talk to me I don\u2019t realize they are speaking, or that they are speaking to me, so there\u2019s additional decoding delay.  When I talk I am more likely to stutter, drop certain phonemes, substitute some random word, or stop in mid-sentence because I have suddenly lost the rest of the words I was about to say.The number of texture sensations I feel are reduced to just one or two, but frequently switches from my socks, my glasses, the chair, my shirt, or something in my hand.  Sometimes those sensations become magnified, where much of my world becomes filled with the annoyance of socks drooping down my ankles.  When I try to focus my attention to one sensory processing channel, then I can\u2019t pay attention to the others.  The tics get more pronounced, I shake one hand repeatedly, and my proprioception is off, making me trip or drop things or walk in a somewhat spastic manner.I\u2019ve heard that outwardly I appear clumsy, stupid, drunken or sick.  Random people ask me, \u201cAre you okay?\u201dIt takes so much effort to realise that (1) the noise is people talking (2) the person is talking to Me (3) who this person might be (4) what the words are (5) what the words mean (6) that they are asking a non-rhetorical question that requires some kind of answer (7) trying to self-assess:  am I okay?  (8) what would \u201cokay\u201d be?  (9) does someone else need to do something for me?Coming up with an answer that is both functional and is bracketed with something close to the appropriate \u201csocial noise\u201d (polite fluff) is a bit much to expect from me at this point.  It\u2019s hard to think of a suitably informative reply, but of one thing I am certain: please don\u2019t make me go sit in tiny places painted institutional pea-green. I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019ve encountered those before, just that I know it was a not-good situation and I don\u2019t want to go there again.The best answer is an \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d pulled from the mental drop-down menu of stock social phrases.  Most people don\u2019t really want to get involved; they just want to be reassured that an ambulance is not required.  Even if I\u2019m not making eye contact and my delivery sounds flat, this seems to be an adequate answer.  Sometimes I\u2019m mentally stuck on that drop-down menu, and deliver an additional, \u201cThank you,\u201d or \u201cExcuse me,\u201d but apparently this is okay because the value of social noise currency is in the act of exchanging, not in the specific coin.Getting too overloaded means I have to shut down for a while, slumping numbly in a chair and rocking without being focused upon anything.  Unless of course I get snagged by one of those shiny, glittering or flashing things, such as the glowing blue light on an electronic mechanism, or slips of sunshine flickering through tree leaves.  Even so, I\u2019m not entirely \u201cthere\u201d, and am probably still rocking a bit.The trick is noticing when I am at the beginning of getting overwhelmed, of noticing the buzz that\u2019s swamping my nervous system in transmission noise.  The problem of course, is that by then I have even less mental processing for self-monitoring to realise what\u2019s going on!\u00a0 But I\u2019ve figured out that experiencing tingling-numbness, really loud tinnitus, or pronounced difficulty in reading or writing are useful cues that I need to take a good break from whatever I\u2019m doing.Otherwise my plates wobble and start crashing.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/02/21/system-overload-error-messages/", "title": "System Overload (Error\u00a0Messages)"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t12 January 2007", "body": "Reading the morning news is dreadful for the happy digestion of my breakfast.  Everywhere I look there are devils and angels, pantheons and freak shows, all in the name of disability.It\u2019s hardly not a new trend.  But this millennia-old attitude does a terrible disservice to disabled people everywhere to be cast as either devils or angels.  It is dehumanizing, and removes us from our humanity, and thus our basic human rights.Being disabled is seen as a condition so horrid that no one could imagine living a happy, (otherwise) healthy, productive life.  Not despite the disability, and not especially with the disability or even because of the disability.  Being disabled is a fate worse than death. It turns a person into a \u201ctoxic train wreck\u201d or it\u2019s \u201cworse than cancer\u201d (because a person with autism, unlike a person with cancer, has a normal lifespan).  So horribly unimaginable is being disabled that euthanasia is often deemed acceptable and even an appropriate \u201csolution\u201d to disability.It has been not very long since people with various disabilities (and other differences) were routinely institutionalized (unfit for being in human society), and often sterilized.  A person could be subjected to forcible surgery for such eugenic reasons as being blind, deaf, epileptic, poor, of a native (aboriginal) race, of mixed races, alcoholic, having a physical deformity, cognitive disability or perceived mental illness.  Had I been institutionalized as a teenager, my children might not exist.Being disabled is also seen as a condition where a family is divinely blessed to have been given such a special child who is looked after by angels.  I\u2019m not slamming those parents who feel that their children are blessings, but rather saying that all children are such \u2013 having a disabled child in the family does not earn a person extra cosmic \u201cbrownie points\u201d.The angelic disabled person is not-quite-human, a tragic but romanticized virgin on a pedestal of virtue.  Certainly not an everyday sexual adult; a female person should never do anything as inconvenient as menstruate.  Like 19th-century women, the disabled are sometimes cast as cherubic, above the base animal instincts of men, and held in divine favor.  In medieval times, the town\u2019s fools were excepted from normal citizenship, either as unclean or sometimes soothsayers, if given to (epileptic or other) fits.In current news there is the case of the \u201cAshley Treatment\u201d where a young disabled girl\u2019s parents have elected to have her undergo several surgical treatments plus \u0153strogen therapy to keep their \u201cpillow angel\u201d a small, manageable size and to remove her breast buds and uterus to prevent her natural sexual development. Removing breast-buds to prevent cancer is a specious argument. I don\u2019t know if the history of cancer is from the maternal and/or paternal side(s) of the family, but it\u2019s pretty telling that we don\u2019t hear of mom and/or dad also having mastectomies to prevent cancer.  After all, cancer is more commonly found in older people.  Likewise it\u2019s another specious argument that making her infertile will prevent the potential for sexual abuse from caregivers \u2013 children are just as easily targets of molestation (it simply makes any abuse more difficult to discover because she won\u2019t unexpectedly come up pregnant).  Were she male, would the child have similar surgeries?At that rate, one could simply hobble a child so they never ran away.  Or one could mute a child so they wouldn\u2019t scream loudly when upset.  Or one could remove all of a child\u2019s teeth so they couldn\u2019t bite anyone when scared \u2013 oh wait, people have already done that \u2026I have to sympathiese with her parents; caring for someone on a daily basis is difficult.  But trying to prevent sexual abuse or care difficulties by surgically removing body parts is working at the wrong end of a major social problem. It\u2019s completely backwards! The problem is not that disabled people exist, but rather that there are not suitable social support networks for disabled people and their family members.  Many handicaps are socially created \u2014 it\u2019s not the person who has the problem, it\u2019s the way society is set up.No longer is the disabled person a sick lurid spectacle to be hidden away.  They are once again on parade, the freak show turned into infobites.  An insidious side effect of freakifying the disabled as devils and angels is that it not only creates the disabled as Other, but it also does a great disservice to those who view themselves as nondisabled:  it makes a person glad to be normal, and content to be average.  It perpetuates the divisions and reinforces the dualities.  With such positions, we can never create inclusivity.What could be worse than being cast as devil or angel?  Being totally discounted as a non-person.  Being neglected and dying a slow, painful death like Sarah Crider or Tiffany Pinckney.The human race has a lot to answer for.", "outgoing_links": ["http://mikestanton.wordpress.com/2006/10/15/does-language-matter/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_points", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_treatment", "http://www.ajc.com/health/content/health/stories/hiddenshame.html", "http://www.thestar.com/News/article/169774"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/01/12/devils-and-angels/", "title": "Devils and Angels"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t15 January 2007", "body": "And now, a topic near-and-dear to everyone\u2019s heart:  using the toilet.Ask six different adults their opinions on toilet-training, and you\u2019ll get six different opinions.  You\u2019ll even more than six opinions if any of them are parents, because a person\u2019s expertise changes with each child, as each child seems to go through the whole process differently.With any child, toilet training is an incremental process that has less to do with the willingness of the adult, and is dependent upon more than just the willingness of the child.  Toilet-training children with developmental disabilities can certainly take much longer than with typical children, due to the number of factors affecting the whole learning process.Toilet training is actually a very complex combination of factors.  The child has to be able to do several things in sequence.  A lot of children (of all sorts!) will get \u201chung up\u201d on one or more points, thus delaying or even permanently hampering their ability to be come fully toilet-trained.Consider the following:1.    The child must be able to be aware of having a full bladder or rectum (these are often acquired separately, with the child mastering one before the other);2.    The child must be able to be aware of the full sensation with enough time to get to the toilet and do everything else necessary before toileting;3.    The child must be able to consciously control both functions (start & stop);4.    The child must be able to undress independently;5.    The child must be able to man\u0153uver themselves correctly onto the toilet seat and back off again;6.    The child must be able to wipe themselves adequately (and remember, it\u2019s hard to dismount the toilet without getting the seat messy \u2014 this is tricky!);7.    The child must be able to re-dress independently;8.    The child must be able to wash their hands adequately.It\u2019s really helpful if the child doesn\u2019t become distracted by some other event or random thought in the middle of the process (especially with boys who pee standing up, and can turn to look at something else\u2026)It\u2019s also really helpful if the child can remember to flush the toilet, and do so without either freaking out at the noise, or becoming fascinated at watching any number of household objects go swirling into oblivion \u2026  ::sigh::Some kids will take much longer to get all these things down.  Every parent in the universe can tell stories of how their child[ren] got hung up at some part of that or another.Not being toilet-trained isn\u2019t the end of the world.  There are, after all, diapers sold for adults for the simple reason that not everyone is fully able to have full control.  These are no more \u201cshameful\u201d than are tampons and pads.And then there\u2019s the whole universe of situations outside of the home that can make toileting a far-from-consistent skill \u2026Something parents find is that their child is happily toilet-trained at home, but not elsewhere.  This is very distressing for some parents, because (subconsciously) they feel that it is their reputations (ego) on the line \u2013 they\u2019ve told everyone that their child is toilet-trained, and here is the child failing to do so.  It seems to reflect badly on their truthfulness or their parenting skills, or damages their social standing among their peers.It\u2019s rarely about the parent, though.When children can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to use other\u2019s toilets, it may be a cognitive maturity thing (being able to generalise what is done at home with doing it elsewhere), it may be a \u201cbashful bladder\u201d issue, and/or it may be a sensory issue.A lot of people don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d these sensory issues.  Allow a bit of autobiographical information here, if you will (don\u2019t worry; nothing gross).Different kinds of toilet seats may feel \u201cwrong\u201d \u2014 the U-shaped seats are uncomfortable for a small child because of their narrow hips.  Or for example, I am cued to toilet on the convex ring seat, but when I encountered a totally flat seat, it felt a lot like a school chair seat!Even worse is the cheap, industrial toilet paper used in schools and public restrooms.  Or the strange toilet paper dispensers that issue small folded sheets or that won\u2019t fully rotate.  Or the soap dispensers that issue gritty powder or strange-smelling goo.  (It\u2019s interesting that if you talk to world travelers you\u2019ll hear lots of stories about difficult toileting situations, and yet somehow many of those same adults would be annoyed if a child had similar difficulties when encountering a strange toilet.)With acute olfactory senses, others\u2019 bathrooms will also smell wrong (it is almost at the level of an animal instinct \u2014 you do not use someone else\u2019s territory).Public bathrooms are noisy and full of commotion, and again from the biological perspective, toileting is done in privacy because the animal is defenseless during the process.Some of the hot-air hand dryers work at an amazing noise frequency that hurts the ears, especially when you are standing or seated nearby with your head at the same height.  And who hangs all these sinks so high that small people and wheelchair users find them difficult to reach?Other people\u2019s home bathrooms may simply be full of distractions \u2014 they are full of interesting objects not contained at home that look different, smell different and work differently.There are sometimes other factors at work that are not apparent; one year in primary school I kept getting re-occuring bladder infections.  The p\u00e6diatrician said for me to quit taking bubble baths.  Well, that helped a little, but the problem remained.  My mother told me that I simply needed to go more often.  \u201cSimply\u201d was difficult, because on weekends I would get so wrapped up in (hyperfocused upon) whatever fascinating thing I was working on that I couldn\u2019t \u201chear\u201d my physiological signals that I needed to go until I really, really needed to go.\u201cSimply\u201d was even more difficult on weekdays, because my fourth-grade teacher was a new graduate who felt a strong need to be in control of her classroom, and letting the students get up at all times to go to the bathroom upset her routine and that control.The bathrooms also smelled. I know, everyone says that school bathrooms smell.  But my personal definition of \u201csmelly\u201d turns out to be quantitatively different than others\u2019 \u201csmelly\u201d:  stale sour body odors compounded with the intrusive artificiality of perfumes, aftershave, scented deodorant, cloying fabric softener, and hairspray; chewing gum and mints and candies; nauseating sting of cigarettes; abrasively floral room \u201cdeodorizer\u201d; caustic bathroom sanitizers; various toileting odors including the muddy smell of used tampons and pads, the sharp sour odor of someone with intestinal upset, or ketosis odor of someone on a high-protein diet; institutional handwashing soap and brown paper towels; and general trenchant skunkiness of locker rooms. If it is a unisex primary school bathroom in the classroom or nurse\u2019s office, then there is the sweet odor of small-boy urine as well. I found these odors to be so over-powering that I avoided the bathroom unless direly necessary.It took months for my mother to understand the problem, because she had to ask me about school, actually take my answers seriously, and then take the enquiry further.  This was because at the time, I totally lacked the understanding that she didn\u2019t know what my class was like, and how the teacher was running the class.  She simply assumed that if I was having a problem that I would be able to identify it, and know how to resolve it, including knowing what I needed to tell whom!  (Sorry, that was too much social awareness for this nine-year old aspie kid.)  Finally we got things sorted out, and my p\u00e6diatrician wrote my mother a note to pass on to my teacher explaining that I was prone to bladder infections and needed to go to the bathroom frequently, and was not merely trying to avoid schoolwork or whatever.Other problems I later had with bathrooms in secondary high was the fact that the bathrooms were where the bullies hung out, who gave me no end of grief. I have some face-blindness issues (which I was unaware of then) so could not identify who those people were.In truth, the whole toilet-training process is more about ability than willingness.  The child has to be ready \u2014 and once they are physiologically ready, they are usually willing as well, provided they understand a benefit to moving from diapers to the toilet.  Avoiding parental upset at still being in diapers is not necessarily a major driving force for some children, especially if parental annoyance has been an everyday part of the home landscape for a long time.The end message here is that what a person is observing (as so many people do with autistics) is the end behaviour. What cannot readily be discerned, but is more important, is what causes the behaviours. If you are dealing with toilet issues, then remember that trying to modify the effect (that is the resulting behaviour) is less effective than to modify the cause of what is creating the behaviour!

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 January 2007 ", "body": "At work there\u2019s a computer room that I take great pains to avoid spending much time in (to erm, avoid great pains). Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I love computers, in general. It\u2019s not so much the noisy CPUs (which in this case are tolerable) but rather the old monitors which flicker, every last one of them. If I have to spend more than 20-30 minutes staring at one, I am setting myself up for risk of a migraine. What\u2019s curious (if not outright frustrating) is that not everyone understands what I\u2019m talking about when I mention that I can\u2019t really spend much time working with some computers because of the screen flicker. Either people can see it, or they can\u2019t.The whole issue of monitor flicker is due to the Refresh Rate setting, which I used to know how to change in old Windows OS, but not in the current one. Whether or not you can see the flickering depends upon the way your brain is wired. But regardless of your ability to vouch for this phenomenon, there is some basic science that is commonly accepted in the computer industry (and elsewhere), so you don\u2019t have to take my word for it!The annoying/tiring flicker of monitors and fluorescent lights is related to Flicker Fusion Frequency (FFF). You have seen and hopefully played with \u201cflip-books\u201d, little booklets of cartoons, when you flip the pages, at the right speed of flipping the pictures appear to get animated. This works just like a motion picture (movie) film is a long serious of still shots that are run quickly by, giving the illusion of motion. The \u201cflicker-fusion frequency\u201d is when the stills flicker by at a speed fast enough that your mind fuses them together.This kind of action is measured in Hertz ( Hz ); 1 Hertz is one cycle per second. For example fluorescent light fixtures run at a rate of 50 Hertz in Europe and 60 Hertz in the US. Fluorescents, unlike incandescent lights (ordinary lamp bulbs) do not emit continuous light. Rather, they flickerOFF-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON-OFF-ON-Each OFF-ON is one cycle. But because the off-on is a sine wave function, they go off and on 100-120 times per second.Most average people cannot consciously discern that flickering, because the \u201caverage\u201d human FFF is only 25 Hz. (I should note that although nearly all humans with adequate vision have the sensing ability, not all have the perceptual ability to discern the flickering \u2014 perception is how the brain interprets the sensory inputs.)The flickering effect is most noticeable outside the corners of eyes, where the rods (light sensing) parts are most sensitive; the cones (color sensing) are most sensitive in the middle. That\u2019s why you notice movement or faint stars outside the corners of your eyes. Theatre movies run at a slower rate of speed (24 Hz) because they are shown in dark surroundings. When something is brighter, it requires an even faster flicker rate to not be noticeable.Old computer monitors and CRTs (Cathode Ray Tube \u2014 those old TV-like green print on black screen terminals) ran at 50 Hz, too. If you happen to recall getting CRT headaches that would be why. In contrast, LCD panel monitors have a refresh rate around 200 Hertz!When a visual input goes higher than an organisms FFF rate, it has reached the Critical Fusion Frequency (CFF) and is no longer perceived as flickering, but as steady. The human CFF is about 50-100 Hz. Apparently some people (including many people with ADD and autistics) have a higher CFF threshold than the neurotypical human. So things like fluorescent lights are more bothersome. (Insects have an even higher FFF than humans; flies have a FFF of 300! You gotta wonder what it does to insect colonies kept in incubators under artificial illumination.)A Swedish ergonomic study found that individuals with a higher critical fusion frequency experienced more stress and decreased accuracy under fluorescent light conditions. Their recommendation was better ballasts, rather than using incandescent or natural lighting. ::rolls eyes::To prevent this problem on your computer, either get a plasma screen, or if not budgeted for such, then set your refresh rate to its maximum capacity \u2014 German researchers recommended 70 Hz for the general population (sorry, reference link now broken).UPDATE: \u00a0The older fluorescent lamps had magnetic ballasts, and those seemed to be the problematic sort. \u00a0Newer fluorescent lamps have electronic ballasts, and fewer issues \u2013 they also seem quieter!", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/tandf/terg/1998/00000041/00000004/art00003#avail"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/01/03/my-off-and-on-and-off-and-on-love-affair-with-computers/", "title": "My Off-and-on-and-off-and-on Love Affair With\u00a0Computers"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t19 January 2007", "body": "I\u2019ve done it plenty often.  Likely you have too.  You have a Very Important Object, be it a button to a blazer, a spare key, a refund to deposit, a passport, et cetera.  (Heavy on the et cetera.) Einstein mislaid a paycheck as a bookmark, if I recall correctly.  So why don\u2019t we feel as brill as Al?Of course, the problem with the Dreaded Safe Place (DSP) is that for all it seems terribly obvious at the time, it\u2019s not.  Later on we can\u2019t remember where we put the Very Important Object (VIO).  Hell, after a while, we can\u2019t even remember what the VIO was, just that we had put a VIO in a DSP, and there we are standing there quite vexed because it needed attending to.  Or will need attending to shortly.  Quite likely something financially, socially, or professionally terrible will happen if we don\u2019t remember the VIO and DSP soon.  ::sigh::There are Safe Places (such as safe deposit boxes at the bank, which are quite safe, especially when we put our key in a DSP), and there are Safe Places that are so safe we can\u2019t find stuff ourselves.  This latter kind of situation is what my Home Economics teacher used to call a \u201cFalse Economy\u201d: something that only seems like a good deal, but really costs you more in the end.Meanwhile, Yours Truly (who seems to be afflicted with a major case of Title Case) has succumbed to pacing recursively about the house in a perseverative frenzy because searching for the VIO has become a Quest, and she can\u2019t rest until she has found it.  Doubtless you know how that goes, too.Once the object is found (either from brute-force tenacity and thoroughness, or from some sideways manner of recollection), there is the \u201cAh-HA!\u201d followed by the \u201cDUH!\u201d followed by the usual lines of self-recrimination about \u201cNot-doing-THAT-again\u201d yadda-yadda-yadda.The reason that DSPs are such is because there are too many possibilities, and not enough parameters.  Where does one keep a blazer button?  On the hall mirror shelf?  In a dish on the dresser?  On the kitchen window sill?  In a drawer so a cat doesn\u2019t play with it?  In the sewing box?  In the desk drawer at work?  At the bottom of the briefcase?  Any of these are DSPs, but none of them have the two necessary qualities of being rational and inescapable.  Meaning, you can figure them out again later, and your search actions should naturally default to them.Rational and inescapable is tied in with the behavioural concept known as \u201cincompatible behaviours\u201d; meaning, if you are doing A, then you can\u2019t be doing B.  It\u2019s one of those brilliant, obvious-in-retrospect things.  The best kind of SP involves putting the object in such a location that completing the necessary action will require you to encounter the object.  Bonus points if you can figure out how you can make yourself remember to do the activity!When I go on a trip, I will definitely want my bathing suit in case I stay in a hotel with a whirlpool tub.  Therefore, I keep all of my trip things in the best Safe Place of all, my suitcase!  (I also have a note to myself reminding myself of those things I keep forgetting to pack, namely my kimono and woolen slippers, emergency flashlight and a belt for my slacks.)  This way I can\u2019t pack my suitcase without the necessary items.A good rational & inescapable Safe Place for the button would be a blazer pocket.  Of course, when Our Hero has ADHD, remembering to sew on the button at some other time than getting-dressed-running-late is another issue.  This is why a dry-erase marker lives next to the toothbrushes, so I can make myself a note \u201cblazer button\u201d on the bathroom mirror for when I return home.Just don\u2019t ask me where to put books.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t26 January 2007", "body": "You love people for who they are, not for who you want them to be.  Stick that in the back of your mind for a minute.  Let\u2019s move sideways to look at some other quotes.  These are from Paula Kamen\u2019s lovely book, All in my head: an epic quest to cure an unrelenting, totally unreasonable, and only slightly enlightening HEADACHE.    One important thought is: \u201cThere is a difference between getting cured and getting healed.\u201dAnother is: \u201cAcceptance is not the same thing as resignation.\u201dThese are very potent concepts, the sort that are easily-understood on the surface verbal level, but take longer to fully integrate through all the layers of one\u2019s consciousness.\u201cGetting cured\u201d means being rid of a medical or psychological problem to become healthy.  In contrast, \u201cgetting healed\u201d does not mean that one needs to be rid of the medical or psychological problem in order to move from merely surviving to living life fairly happily.One can accept disability without being resigned to the concept that life is ruined because it will never be the way that was anticipated. Instead, one accepts that life will be different, and that this is okay.When parents learn that their child has some kind of disability, they go through a sort of grieving process.   They mourn the child they didn\u2019t get or will no longer have.  (In response, Jim Sinclair\u2019s essay, \u201cDon\u2019t Mourn For Us\u201d is a thought-provoking and reassuring essay for parents of autistic children.)   Not everyone grieves in the same way, and not every parent experiences a lot of grief \u2014 sometimes there is more relief for having \u201cfigured things out\u201d and being able to name, understand, and thus work with the difficulties or differences.Sometimes parents get \u201cstuck\u201d in the blame and bargaining stages of grieving.  They have not accepted the disability, and their child is not okay as a disabled person.  In the denial is the core myth that somehow out there is a cure, and once they can fix the problem, then everything in their lives will be okay.  The parents dwell upon the past and perceived injustices, and nothing less than total \u201ccure\u201d is acceptable.  Sadly, this means that until the parent can announce the child is cured, then the child is not fully acceptable and loved as a full human being.  This is devastating to the social, spiritual, and even physical development of the child.In families that already dysfunctional from other issues, the disabled or different child can serve as a distracter from the real personal and interpersonal issues, and may get stuck in the r\u00f4le of the scapegoat:  \u201cthings would be okay if it weren\u2019t for this tragedy\u201d.When I say that, \u201cYou love people for who they are, not for who you want them to be,\u201d that does not mean that one allows bad behaviour, or does not try to help a person with therapeutic or educational approaches that enable a person to achieve as much as possible.  Rather, it means that you love the person for who and what they are, and that love is not conditional upon the person pretending to be something they are not.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/All-Head-Unrelenting-Unreasonable-Enlightening/dp/0738210390/sr=8-1/qid=1169777621/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2756417-6345768?ie=UTF8&s=books", "http://web.syr.edu/%7Ejisincla/dontmourn.htm"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2007/01/26/getting-over-the-cure/", "title": "Getting Over the\u00a0Cure"},

So here I am, finally with computer issues sorted out and a HEAP of blogging buzzing around in me head, so without further ado, let\u2019s start with:IN RATHER A JAMLast week was National Pollinator Week.  Yes, I missed it, but Bug Girl didn\u2019t!   Pollinators include not only honeybees, but also solitary bees, bumblebees, various species of wasps, flies, butterflies & moths, bats, and birds.  Honeybees are not native to the Americas, but are vital to the production of other equally non-native crops, such as most tree fruits, bramble fruits, tree nuts, herbs, seeds for vegetables and herbs and flowers, the clover and alfalfa consumed by our non-native livestock, cotton, even wine grapes.   As Bug Girl points out, the estimated value of all this pollen-transfer is in the billions (with a B) of dollars for the US alone \u2014 it is multiply times larger when you consider all the crop production in the rest of the world, such as tropical crops like neem, coffee, tea, and chocolate!The reason why I have the nearly-empty jar of jam pictured is because pollinators are not only vitally important for anyone who likes to eat (or wear cotton et cetera), but also because Colony Collapse Disorder is creating great losses of honeybees.  According to a recent release by the USDA, honeybees are responsible for the pollination of 130 major crops, at a value of $ 15 billion annually.  Beekeepers lost 31% of their hives in 2006, and then 35% in 2007.  Not only are food prices rising due to a number of other factors (drought, flooding, fuel costs), but also from the reduced production of produce due to honeybee losses. Do your part to protect pollinators by using any pesticides only when necessary, and following the directions carefully \u2014 for example, Sevin is toxic to honeybees, and if you see honeybees around, they are likely someone\u2019s livestock.  (You wouldn\u2019t stop by a field and start shooting cattle, would you?)  I made a large batch of fantastic blueberry conserve with lemon last year, but this year berry production has dropped, so the quarts of produce are just too dear (expensive).  When this jar is empty, we have No. More.

It\u2019s not even limited by breeding season; there are two broods in northern populations, and four broods in southern.Rather, they are rare because the larvae are monophagous (a fancy word for \u201conly eats one kind of thing\u201d \u2014 a parent might lament, \u201cMy child is seemingly monophagous upon Goldfish crackers\u201d).\u00a0 Well, plenty of catepillars out there are picky.\u00a0 But Zebra Swallowtail \u2018pillars will only eat the leaves of pawpaw trees (Asimina triloba) and other species of the genus.\u00a0 Unlike the ubiquitous callery flowering pear trees or purple barberry shrubs, homeowners and parks managers do not go around planting pawpaws.\u00a0 Unacommodated by the lack of host plants, the butterflies spend their lives beyond the outskirts of the developed world. Only butterfly enthusiasts and rare fruit fanciers who go around planting pawpaws Just Because, or residents of diversified country wilds will have much hope of seeing zebras.It\u2019s not that medical or butterfly zebras don\u2019t exist, but that you have to know where to find them.\u00a0 You also have to be willing to support their particular needs to have the opportunity to get to know them.\u00a0 But either one of those conditions requires understanding that zebras even exist.\u00a0 Yes, you might even (gasp!) have one in Your Back Yard!\u00a0 It\u2019s true.\u00a0 And now that you have a better search image, I guarantee that you will be much more likely to meet them.", "outgoing_links": ["https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/zebra-swallowtail4.jpg"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2008/07/21/meet-the-zebras/", "title": "Meet the Zebras"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t14 October 2006 ", "body": "I hate getting stuck.Everyone does. Hate it, that is. And, everyone gets stuck too, although some of us get \u201cstucker\u201d more than others. Everyone has moments of indecision when they just can\u2019t figure out what to do, thus losing momentum. For most people that just leads to the ordinary sort of stuckness, where one doesn\u2019t make any active decisions for a while, but otherwise continues with the rest of their lives. Or sometimes there\u2019s the \u201cparalysis by analysis\u201d where one dithers endlessly about the problems, analysing and re-analysing them without being able to just settle upon a choice.Then there are the more obnoxious kinds of stuckness that are familiar to autistics (and to others), those moments of paralysing stuckness. There you are, toodling along in ordinary daily business, when something goes dreadfully awry. Generally we have routines, and we have Plan B\u2019s for when those routines get glitches. But what happens when the Plan B\u2019s fall apart? Or when some kind of glitch comes along that is so novel that it doesn\u2019t fall within any previous parameters?I can handle a flat tire. I know how to change tires. I have road service on my mobile phone plan for someone to call if there\u2019s a major breakdown. But when I had a major flat and needed a new tire and I was in a new town, and discovered that none of the familiar service stations sold tires \u2014 I got stuck. Looking in the phone book didn\u2019t help because I couldn\u2019t tell which businesses were in my new town (or where in town they would be) or whether they were in far, neighbouring small towns.In situations like those I don\u2019t stay stuck for very long; I\u2019ve learned to shove myself beyond the decision paralysis and ask others for ideas.The worst sorts of stuckness are the kind that make one look like they\u2019ve been caught in a game of Freeze Tag, or are suffering some odd form of seizure. Sometimes I start and stop repeatedly, beginning and reversing a motion in repeated changes of intent. Sometimes I just halt entirely because my train of thought has become entirely derailed and suddenly I have no idea what I was going to do. This isn\u2019t the ordinary sort of staring confusedly at the interior of the refrigerator and humming idly, wondering what you were going to get, but rather stopping in the middle of my tracks, frozen in mid-gesture.Getting stuck isn\u2019t always about the paralysis of indecision. Sometimes it\u2019s the paralysis of entrancement. My pal David calls it SES: Sudden Engrossment Syndrome (he\u2019s both a psychologist and prone to naming things in a rather tongue-in-cheek manner).I was at the hardware store getting greenhouse supplies yesterday afternoon, and it\u2019s that time of year when they\u2019re putting up the Christmas displays. One of the faux trees there was an entirely white one, for which I have a nostalgic retro fondness. (I\u2019m not one for church holidays, but I do appreciate all the shiny bits to be found this time of year.) This one had no ornaments, but was pre-wired with little sparkly blue lights. I absolutely ADORE blue lights! After a couple minutes I realised what I was doing (or rather, not doing \u2014 I\u2019m supposed to be an adult at work), and had to drag myself away, feet-first. There was a mental echo of my mother hollering at me, \u201cAndrea! Quit staring at things and come on \u2026\u201d Some things never change.As you might imagine, stuckness could have the potential for self-endangerment. I know that I have to come up with Plan B\u2019s, and will sometimes do so to such a nearly-obsessive level that it can be a different kind of stuckness. I also know that I can\u2019t admire the passing scenery when driving, neither the neon nor the street decorations nor the cloudforms.And yet, once in a while Life will throw something at me that trips me up.\u201cOoh, shiny!\u201d", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/10/14/getting-stuck/", "title": "Getting Stuck"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t15 October 2006 ", "body": "Both AD/HD people and autistics can easily find themselves paralysed by tasks, for a variety of reasons. These include the dreadful issue of being able to plan out a process (especially if it\u2019s a new kind of task, or one that is fraught with many fuzzy or unknown variables), and then performing the whole series of steps, from remembering to do the task, finding the necessary materials, and staying with the task long enough to complete it (or at least a significant stage of it).All of these issues fall under the realm of \u201cExecutive Function\u201d, which includes planning, prioritising, initiating, being aware of what one is doing, assessing what one is doing, correcting actions (troubleshooting), and inhibiting wrong actions or distractions. Doing all these things at once requires juggling a lot of thoughts in short-term and active processing memory; they use up a lot of cerebral RAM.It\u2019s really hard to remember everything I need to do, not only in the big time frame of things to do today and during the week, but also what I\u2019m meaning to do within this particular hour. There are usually two dozen things that need doing, all vying for my attention, but floating in and out of consciousness. Years ago, before I or anyone else had heard of AD/HD (decades before it hit the DSM), some witty book author had described a situation as being \u201clike sorting confetti in a wind tunnel\u201d. Alas, I\u2019ve yet to find that particular line again to identify the author, but the analogy is apt.Because the activities I\u2019m doing and trying to do and meaning to do and needing to do will flit in and out of my radar from one minute to the next, and because I know that I simply can\u2019t keep all the necessary information there in my frontal lobes, I rely on accessory ways of organizing and checking myself. I rely upon my highly visual mode of operation, which means it\u2019s easier for me to work things out on paper where I can see them all at once.There are several parts to this:WHAT I need to do\nWHERE I need to do it\nHOW I need to do itThe What part turns into lists. I keep an index card in my pocket where I jot down things-to-do as they occur to me. It\u2019s a maxim that one never thinks of things in the right places \u2013 you remember errands to run while stuck at an office desk, or office tasks while in the bathroom at home, and so on. The back of the index card usually ends up with the ongoing grocery list. I have to make a new index card every few days as jobs get done and scratched off. Heaven forfend I should lose my index card; it takes me about two days to reconstruct one, and that period of time has little flecks of terror as I wonder what important thing I might be forgetting to do.The Where part is what results in those infamous File-By-Pile messes. Since I\u2019m a visual person and have trouble with both remembering to do things and with finishing things, I am prone to having everything I\u2019m trying to work on sitting out . Not enough surface space means that the piles end up atop each other, thus hiding some of the tasks from view, and thus from conscious awareness. They also create difficulties in housekeeping, but that\u2019s another situation to deal with.Part of the \u201cWhere\u201d issue is remembering stuff at the right times and places. It\u2019s not the remembering that\u2019s hard, it\u2019s the remembering-to-remember, such as remembering to check my list of things to do at the right times. So I\u2019ll leave myself reminders, like setting my car keys atop the thing I need to take with me, or putting a sticky-note saying \u201cpick up cat\u201d on my steering wheel, or leaving myself reminders written on the bathroom mirror in dry-erase marker. One of the things I like about my new Beetle is that it will beep at me when it\u2019s getting low on gas, and beep me again when I start it back up and it\u2019s still low on gas. This is a good design feature!The How part is a big problem for many of us. It isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t know what we need to do, in the general sense of things. The inertia results from being overwhelmed by a large job and not knowing where to start. We have trouble breaking down what have what need to do step-wise. Part of this issue is that many large projects are riddled with the dreaded But-Befores: preliminary actions that must be accomplished before doing the next step.In any kind of big project it helps to break things down into concrete, discrete, manageable steps. I usually start brainstorming with an ordinary piece of paper, with GOALS written at the top, followed by two columns, the HAVE and the NEED.\nWhat are my goals?\nWhat do I already have towards that?\nWhat major things do I need to get that?\nHow can I get those things?  What sorts of minor, preliminary things (the But-Befores) do I need to get each of those things?\nWhat information do I still need?  From whom or where can I get that?\nWhat are the timeframes for each of these steps?\nWhen there are deadlines, how much buffer needs to be built in for difficulties in getting things? (This is important \u2013 we frequently underestimate how long it will take to get things. I usually double how much time I think an unfamiliar task reasonably ought to take. Yes, double! Life is thick.)\nOnce I have these lists of tasks and sub-tasks, I then put them into a timeline, including that doubled amount of time in the estimates. This gives me necessary buffer room \u2013 recall that there is the \u201cShit Happens\u201d clause in your User\u2019s Guide to the Cosmos. I can then put this information onto two master documents, a Project Calendar and a Checklist. With those two, I can see my progress, and how the process will occur over time.A smaller part of the inertia is the plain old getting started on things. Oft times getting started is hard because it involves so many steps that require finding or purchasing a diverse set of things, and then having to run errands to finish the task.Mailing presents is a prime example: you have to think of what to buy, find it at a store, track down all the necessary wrapping materials, look up the address, and then take the parcel to a postal station. My ADHD friends and I are content to receive gifts from each other a month past our birthdays simply because we know that getting the things mailed at all was an achievement. (Plus, getting a gift on a random day is an especially pleasant surprise that those super-organised, date-conscious people out there likely haven\u2019t experienced.)A good way of dealing with inertia is to remove those situations from your life whenever possible!Unfortunately, creditors aren\u2019t so sympathetic. I\u2019ve circumvented most bill payment by having the regular bills automatically deducted from my bank account, ditto the paychecks automatically deposited \u2013 I work three different jobs! Electronic Fund Transfer saves millions of financial butts every year, and is something that nearly everyone should make use of. (Trust me; I used to work in customer service at a bank, helping people straighten out their checkbooks.)But for those remaining jobs that need attending, I have several ways of dealing with the inertia. Doing these involves figuring out in what parts of the process you are getting stuck, so you can reduce or remove as many barriers as possible.Firstly, I try to never put things down to \u201cdeal with them later\u201d. No one ever wants to deal with things later, and tossing them onto the pile only adds to the chaos. When I open my mail, I immediately trash the advertisements and outside envelope so I\u2019m left with a tidy set of bills and return envelopes.Secondly, preparing the bills for mailing back has a whole set of issues, so I have everything I need to complete this job right at hand and I don\u2019t get stuck on the finding-things part. This means that the mail pile itself lands next to 1) where I like to set down my purse when I get home 2) a wastepaper basket for the refuse and 3) a rack with address stickers and stamps. Then as soon as I\u2019ve finished processing those bills I take them right back out to the mailbox again. Running out of postage can be an issue, so I either try to buy large packs of stamps, or else put \u201cbuy stamps\u201d on my To Do list when I\u2019m only halfway out, so I will have bought more before I\u2019ve completely out. (I think that\u2019s what they mean by \u201colder and wiser\u201d \u2014 knowing how to work around one\u2019s difficulties.)One thing that\u2019s often left out in coaching is the feedback process. How will you know when you\u2019ve accomplished your task? This may sound obvious, but in some ways it\u2019s not. Merely getting the thing done is not enough. If you recall, part of the executive dysfunction issues are the monitoring and troubleshooting facets. Some ADHD people end up in high-risk or high-excitement jobs because that stress is what gets them over the inertia factor and keeps them focused. (Frankly, we need people who can do such jobs; not everyone is cut out to be an air traffic controller or a firefighter.) But we don\u2019t want to repeatedly end up blazing our way through tasks in crisis mode. This doesn\u2019t do anything for reducing our overall stress levels, or for improving how we approach and resolve problems.Part of completing a task is self-evaluating:How did it go?  Did all of it get done to satisfaction, or were you just squeaking by?\n\nWere there things you needed but didn\u2019t have?  What can you do to acquire those for next time?Did it take longer than you thought it would? This is a big question; AD/HD frequently underestimate real working time. I\u2019ve taken to mentally adding 50% onto what I think familiar tasks ought to take, and that usually gives me time to not only complete them, but also to do those \u201ctweaks\u201d that improve them.What happened that you didn\u2019t anticipate?  Is it likely to happen again?  The correct answer is nearly always Yes \u2013 the world goes as it will, not as you or I would have it.  How do you want to prepare for that next time?And the most important question of all is, How will you implement these additional needs into the task the next time? It\u2019s not enough to say, \u201cOh yes, I need to do thus-and-such,\u201d because for the AD/HD person, merely knowing that on the cognitive level is not enough. You have to imagine yourself doing the task with these added improvements to make it part of the new routine. You also have to figure out how you will remind yourself to change what your process is the next time; nothing is so obvious it can\u2019t be forgotten it in five minutes. As ever, it\u2019s not the remembering that\u2019s hard, it\u2019s the remembering to remember!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/10/15/coping-with-the-inertia-of-task-paralysis/", "title": "Coping With the Inertia of Task\u00a0Paralysis"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t16 October 2006 ", "body": "I\u2019m one of those people who is always working on several things at once, and I have to have all of my task components out where I can see them.\u00a0 This means that like millions of people out there, I use the famous File By Pile system.The obvious problem with that method is that one always has a constant supply of messes.\u00a0 And alas, one invariably loses Important Things under other Important Things, which can lead to the frantic I\u2019m-On-A-Mission hunts to locate whatever.\u00a0 (I have gotten smarter over the years; we now own about eight pairs of scissors, which means we can usually find two or three at any given time.\u00a0 Of course, no one else ever borrows my lefty scissors, so they remain nicely sharp, but then I can\u2019t blame losing track of them on anyone else, either.)Another end result is that some tasks will take more than a day, and when stuff sits out for any length of time, it simply becomes part of the scenery and is no longer noticeable. You can physically see the stacks of papers laying atop the books in the bookcase, but you don\u2019t notice them as things out of place because they are in a semi-permanent \u201ctemporary holding place\u201d. This is how AD/HD people have terribly cluttered houses and offices: lots of ongoing projects, the tendency for things to become invisible to awareness, and of course, the inertia of task paralysis when it comes to cleaning things up.Actual cleaning isn\u2019t hard. It\u2019s not the running the vacuum across the floor, nor swiping things with a tacky dusting cloth, nor wiping down tables, nor mopping floors. Rather, it\u2019s getting to these surfaces, because first one must put a gazillion things away!Putting stuff away can lead to terribly recursive bouts: taking the socks from the living room to the laundry and starting a load of laundry and going to the bedroom to get hangers for the dried clothes and picking up the full waste-basket while in the bedroom and dropping off the hangers atop the washer and finding a pair of undies stuck down between the washer and dryer and setting down the waste-basket to go fetch the yardstick to retrieve the garment and reaching underneath the hutch to grab the yardstick that has fallen down and finding some pieces of junk mail and another stray sock that have gotten kicked under there but not finding the yard stick and throwing away the junk mail and taking the sock up to the laundry and then realising that you still haven\u2019t found the yardstick and then looking for it in the coat closet and having a basket of gloves and hats fall off the shelf and picking them up and \u2026Getting around all these endless loop-de-loops requires temporarily putting a laundry basket at the bottom of the staircase. All the stuff going up gets dumped in there to be distributed after I\u2019m done vacuuming. That way, all the assorted dirty clothes are dropped off in one trip, all the hair elastics are returned to the bathroom cup in one trip, and so on. The basket interrupts the loop-de-loops by collecting things, and then allows me to visit each of the upstairs rooms just once.\u00a0 With any luck I won\u2019t find a newsmagazine I\u2019ve not yet read and get sidetracked by the editorial cartoons.We also have a series of stacking drawers in the kitchen, one for each person. When I\u2019m picking up, I just drop the miscellany in each person\u2019s drawer for them to deal with. \u201cCan\u2019t find it?\u00a0 Did you check your drawer?\u201d I have also put a waste paper basket right by where the mail lands, so the junk mail gets tossed immediately instead of defaulting to the \u201cget around to that later\u201d that rarely happens.Of course, there\u2019s a pile of paper on my desk.\u00a0 It\u2019s mostly stuff I\u2019m working on right now, and stuff I mean to be working on.\u00a0 Back when I was a freelance writer for magazines and newspapers and worked from home, I finally realised that I would have to implement some traditional office procedures.No, I didn\u2019t make myself clean off my desk at the end of each day.\u00a0 However, I did start my Friday mornings by going through my pile and sorting it out.\u00a0 (Initially I tried to do this on Monday mornings, but I really don\u2019t have that much self-discipline or masochism, so it got bumped to Friday mornings.) That\u2019s when I forced myself to do the filing \u2013 I hate filing papers in file drawers, but even I finally realized that putting away a few pieces of paper once a week was much less tedious than waiting until the pile was thicker than the Sunday newspaper.That\u2019s also when I rediscovered bills I\u2019d had to postpone paying due to cash-flow issues, bank statements to balance, little scraps of paper with cryptic notes to myself about new article ideas, magazines I meant to read, catalogs I could probably toss, and other workaday ephemera including an occasional mislaid paycheck that wanted depositing \u2013 I\u2019m not brainy like Einstein, but we do have that in common \u2026Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I must go vacuum the living room while I still have half an impulse to do so, and it remains visible.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/10/16/stuff-stuff-stuff/", "title": "Stuff, Stuff, Stuff"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 January 2007 ", "body": "Well, another semester is revving up, and I\u2019m collecting tutees again.  I tutor a variety of subjects, generally getting students taking introductory writing and biology classes.  The number of tutees always increases right after they have sat their first exams, and discover that taking college classes is not just a shorter-school day version of taking high school classes.  So for all you students out there who are facing your introductory Biology and so on, here are some friendly warnings.A \u201csurvey\u201d course means broad and shallow waters, so start paddling now or you will be left behind!  Survey classes (100- level Biology, Botany, Microbiology etc.) cover a wide variety of material, but do not go in depth on anything in particular.  The in-depth part comes in the next levels of courses about specific subjects.  Because there is such a large quantity of material to cover in a limited number of weeks, the class will be going through roughly a chapter per class, depending upon how many chapters the text book is divided into, and the number of meeting days per week.  This is not high school where you took a week or two (meeting four or five days a week) to go through a chapter.  It\u2019s not so much a question of \u201cdon\u2019t get behind\u201d but rather of \u201cstay on top of things and look ahead\u201d!Vocabulary is going to be an integral part of studying, so find a way of memorization that works well for you. Although every field of study has its own terminology, the life sciences are positively riddled with new words to learn.  Most of these words have Greek or Latin roots, so learning what those prefixes and suffixes mean is important, because then you can decode other new words.Cramming doesn\u2019t work well as a study method when taking identification classes.  Students who try to cram do not do well on tests.  There are certain subjects that have mostly vocabulary and identification, such as Anatomy (human or veterinary), Taxonomy (plant or animal), and courses like Woody Plant Materials.  Don\u2019t mistakenly think that these are \u201ceasy\u201d just because \u201call you have to do is memorise stuff\u201d. Learning hundreds of names, exact spellings, and how to identify hundreds of different birds, flowers, or micro-organisms takes repetition.  Learning takes lots of repetition.  Plan on studying daily.  Be there during all the open-lab time going over models and specimens.  Learn to recognise your organisms (or parts thereof) by generalising from several examples, otherwise you will only have learned to identify your particular Acer saccharum leaf, rather than any sugar maple tree anywhere.When an instructor puts up a graph or diagram, don\u2019t just sit there watching, but make notes about what is significant about the graph, and how that is determined.  You will either have a copy of this illustration in your handouts, or else the instructor will refer to a graph on a particular page in your text.  If the latter, be sure to write down both the page number and the name or number of the graph.  Remember, you can re-draw the graph in your notes after class, but you should do so as soon as possible, while the details are still fresh in your mind.Your job is to take notes on both aspects that being explained about the graph:  firstly, what the significance of the graph is, and secondly, how we know that.  For example, in ecology, the k-values of lines in a graph describe the mortality rates over time \u2013 that\u2019s the \u201cwhat\u201d significance of the graph.  But the \u201chow we know that\u201d part is related to the idea that the closer the slope of an individual line is to a value of 1 (a 45\u00b0 angle), the more important is the particular mortality factor.  When you get to the test, you will need to know not just that the graph describes mortality due to various factors, but also know the latter part and be able to tell which factor was the most important!Science courses are about understanding the principles and concepts particular to the specific discipline.  \u201cUnderstanding\u201d is not the same thing as memorizing. The details of human understanding of events and processes change over time, so there\u2019s no point in memorizing everything in the text book.  Instead, you need to learn what the concepts mean, and how things interact with each other, and then be able to apply your understanding to problems and to new situations.One of my math teachers said that, \u201cLife does not hand us a page of math problems to be solved.  Real life more like word problems, where you have to create the equation and there are no answers in the back of the book.\u201d  We have to do the same thing with science in real life.You may be shocked to discover that in college, multiple-choice (MC) exams are not automatically easy exams.  You cannot rely on simply recognising the correct answer.  Instead, you will have to take those new concepts you have learned, and apply them to new situations.The reason that some people find science classes to be difficult is that not only does a person have to memorise material, but also to apply and analyse and evaluate the concepts, especially in lab experiments.Speaking of taxonomy, the field of education has a system of classification as well: Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy.  This is a hierarchy of cognitive processes, often diagrammed as a pyramid. There are six categories with number 1 being the simplest level at the base of the pyramid, and number six being the highest.  Each step builds upon the previous.1. Knowledge \u2013 the ability to define, recall, identify, recognize, knowledge of methodology, principles, generalizations, trends, facts, terminology, theories, and structures.\n2. Comprehension \u2013 translate, rephrase or restate, interpret, extrapolate\n3. Application \u2013 apply, generalize, choose, organize, develop, use, classify\n4. Analysis \u2013 analyse relationships; to deduce, compare, discriminate, categorize\n5. Synthesis \u2013 derive or create a set of abstract relationships\n6. Evaluation \u2013 to judge, assess, argueWhat this means to you as a student is that basic survey courses (such as 100-level Biology) will be mostly at level 1 and 2, but the more specific junior and senior courses will be integrating the content from several basic courses and requiring you to operate at levels 4-6.  This means that cramming and memorizing material won\u2019t work.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t7 September 2006 ", "body": "It was quite a while before we realized that aspie-kid was more than a trifle unusual. Part of that was not denial, but rather the mental yardsticks employed at home. An aspie kid with parents who have diverse disabilities doesn\u2019t really stand out. (The neurotypical kid once joked about feeling left out for not having any kind of exceptionality. \u201cYou were speech-delayed,\u201d I offered, but our dear loquacious English major pretended to not be mollified.)For example, Aspie kid has some minor sensory issues, and has always been particular about not wanting to wear anything but soft, loose clothing. So what? Who doesn\u2019t have clothing preferences? Aspie kid doesn\u2019t like spicy foods, and even in high school will eat \u201cnaked noodles\u201d (pasta without sauce) more often than not, and is quite content with plain white sticky rice. Hardly a crisis; as far as I can tell, teenagers\u2019 natural forage is pizza, and as a subspecies, doesn\u2019t really require an extremely broad diet beyond what\u2019s required for nutritional balance. Only one style of nubbly hairbrush is acceptable to the kid (natural bristles are intolerable), so there\u2019s no telling if the long hair thing is another sensory issue about not wanting to get haircuts. But hair elastics are cheaper and much less hassle than regular trips to the salon anyway, so no complaints here.The extended family did note the disinclination to join into the chit-chat in favor of hanging quietly on the edge of the gathering. But what this child lacked in mobs of kids visiting our back yard to play has certainly been made up for in a steadfast friendship with a particular pal, which friendship has lasted more than a decade.In later years the teenager\u2019s bedroom floor became the stereotypical mess of clean & dirty clothes and books and snack wrappers et cetera (once again, heavy on the et cetera), but we have to find a certain charm with the periodically-resurfacing habit of lining up objects along shelves \u2013 there may be snack dishes piling up, but the computer accessories are tidy!The other part of not immediately seeing the offspring\u2019s exceptionalities is that they didn\u2019t particularly stand out because we have an enabling home environment. I don\u2019t mean \u201cenabling\u201d in the pathological sense, but rather that home life is designed to reduce problems on a variety of levels.Dad is hard of hearing, so the children grow up reading television captions. This certainly seems to have aided reading and vocabulary skills, and reduces comprehension problems for those of us with Auditory Processing Disorder. Well, at least when we\u2019re watching television. Mixing up people with hearing impairment and APD at the dinner table can lead to some incredibly recursive conversations as we verify and correct what\u2019s being communicated. Text messaging (as a replacement for phoning each other with voice messages) was just made for families like ours.For the teachers, yet another child who repeatedly has trouble remembering to finish or turn in assignments, and who loses winter coats et cetera (heavy on the et cetera) isn\u2019t rather notable. (If the jigglyness doesn\u2019t include interrupting the class, the teachers won\u2019t have time to worry about it.) Thankfully this was the second child, so the ADHD mom had time to figure out some coping strategies of her own for keeping track of objects and tasks, and started working on them with the kid. Of course, dad despairs of the two of us ever sitting through an entire movie or television show without popping up for something-or-another. But gee, isn\u2019t that why the Pause button exists?In the natural environment of the home, our respective disabilities are relatively minor. Sometimes dad doesn\u2019t hear people calling for him, once in a while the grilled cheese sandwiches get overbrowned because Mom gets distracted, and periodically the lawn gets shaggy because the kid is busily perseverating upon some obscure detail of computer gaming. When all else fails, you send the kid to track down dad and let him know that mom\u2019s has finished making a fresh batch of sandwiches and it\u2019s time to eat. The grass will of course, still be there tomorrow morning.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/09/07/c%e2%80%99est-normal-the-enabling-environment/", "title": "C\u2019est Normal:  The Enabling\u00a0Environment"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t25 October 2006 ", "body": "The other week I was typing math tests, generally a task as dull as dusting door lintels.  But this time I was enthused because I was re-typing the tests in order to make them more accessible.You see, the old tests were done in a small 10-point font, with the arithmetic problems set up in the traditional manner of stacking them in long columns and aligned rows.  Many of our students have a variety of learning disabilities, and I suspected the very layout of the tests was aggravating some of the visual and/or graphomotor difficulties.Firstly I increased the numerals to a 14-point font.  This is much closer to natural handwriting size, so it\u2019s easier for the students to write their own numbers under the columns of existing digits.  For dysgraphic students, anything that gives them more room to write is beneficial.  Therefore I also increased the amount of space between the problems, both within the rows and between them.  This way there would be sufficient room for working out the calculations, especially the long division problems.Another reason for giving extra room between the rows was that I wanted to avoid making the students squeeze their answers around smudged calculations.  Nor did I want to have them transfer their answers to a separate page, which could incur errors involving number transpositions, correspondence between the problem and its specifically numbered answer blank, or some of the answers not even getting transferred over.Next I put the problem numbers (enumeration) on different lines than the problems, so there would be less confusion about which was which.  In contrast, the operations signs (plus, minus, multiply or divide) were moved closer to the problems to reduce any confusion about what the student was to do.Another important step was to arrange the individual problems so they were not stacked directly above and below each other.  This reduces some of the spatially-related difficulties some students have, and prevents confusion about which number is involved in a given problem.  It\u2019s too easy to pick up the wrong number or even skip a problem when all the digits are piled up in long wriggling stacks.  Offsetting the problems helps isolate each one in a larger area of white-space.The combination of offset problems plus using a larger font resulted in using two rows for five problems, rather than just one row.  In turn, the tests usually grew longer by a page.  I don\u2019t consider that to be a problem; there\u2019s a time for \u201csaving trees\u201d (conserving paper) and a time when that is a false economy because it creates other problems. When photocopying the tests, I did not copy on both front and back.  It\u2019s too easy to miss a chunk of problems on a test when they are \u201chidden\u201d on the back.  Plus, having blank page backs automatically gives blank space for any additional little calculations that the students need to do.These mathematics tests don\u2019t have much in the way of worded questions, although for those that were included, I doubled the length of the answer blanks so they would be roomy enough for handwritten responses.When laying out tests with worded questions, there are some other techniques that can make test-taking less difficult on the practical end.  Many things are good common sense, but we have to be aware of them to be sure of including them.  These include methods such as:\u2022\tIn matching questions, have the descriptions in column one and terms in column two on the same page (no run-ons to another page);\n\u2022\tUse numbers for one column in the matching and letters for the other column;\n\u2022\tSpell out the words True \u2013 False to be circled (rather than the student writing T or F or t or f and letting the grader guess which was written down);\n\u2022\tAvoid the use of double-negatives in true-false or multiple-choice questions;\n\u2022\tUse capitals in matching or multiple choice (A, B, C, D, E) instead of lower case (a, b, c, d, e) that can be confusing to the student or to the grader (a \u2013 d, b \u2013 d, or c \u2013 e can look similar), and be sure to give a blank to write the answer upon.(As you might guess, this particular grader has her own difficulties reading small font sizes, visually tracking numbers, or sometimes distinguishing certain letters.)The benefit to all these various techniques is that they help all the students, not only those who have particular disabilities that have been diagnosed and for whom accommodations have been established.  Other students who have undiagnosed problems, marginal problems, those who are simply tired or sick, and even those in top form will all benefit from having tests that are easier to read.  (Ditto the teaching staff!)This is the joy of universal design for learning:  make as much of the material as accommodating as possible for a wide group of students, and you will have fewer specific changes to make for individual students, plus everyone will be able to use the material more easily.After all, our end goal is to assess the students\u2019 acquisition of knowledge, not their ability to decipher tests..", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/10/25/testing-1-2-3-%e2%80%a6/", "title": "Testing, 1, 2, 3\u00a0\u2026"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t20 October 2006 ", "body": "We recently rented the video C.S.A., a mockumentary about the semi-fictional history of when the Confederate States of America won Civil War/ Northern War of Aggression. It\u2019s a profoundly (and appropriately) disturbing film on a number of levels. This isn\u2019t a film review, so you can look up more details about it on Amazon, the IMDB, or the official film Web site.  It\u2019s a hell of a good video, in the literal sense.What makes good satire and mockumentary is the admixture of fiction and reality. Fiction (especially science fiction) provides the distance of unreality for us to be able to think about and discuss things that are often too difficult to deal with in full-blown reality. Reality-Lite, as it were. Not that there is anything \u201cLite\u201d about slavery and the numbers of other issues woven into the story line.But on blog-related matters, this flick gave me yoin, which is a Japanese word referring to the ongoing internal reverberation you get from something, even after the moment has passed. They made mention of Drapetomania, and apparently this was one of the reality-nuggets. There it is on Wikipedia:\u201cDrapetomania\u201d was a psychiatric diagnosis proposed in 1851 by Louisiana physician Samuel A. Cartwright to explain the tendency of black slaves to flee captivity. As some slave owners felt they were improving the lives of their slaves, they could not understand the slaves\u2019 desire to escape.There\u2019s not a great deal of discussion of this; the entry also explains,The diagnosis appeared in a paper published in the New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal, where Dr. Cartwright argued that the tendency of slaves to run away from their captors was in fact a treatable medical disorder. His feeling was that with \u201cproper medical advice, strictly followed, this troublesome practice that many Negroes have of running away can be almost entirely prevented.\u201d Cartwright proposed whipping as the most effective treatment of this disorder. Amputation of the toes was also prescribed.\nCartwright also described another disorder, Dysaethesia Aethiopica, to explain the apparent lack of motivation exhibited by many slaves, which he also claimed could be cured by whipping.Wow. So here we have this doctor ascribing a natural human reaction to having a psychiatric condition, and also prescribing the \u201cappropriate\u201d treatment for such. We can easily imagine some alternative history where drapetomania is a regular entry in the DSM.  After all, homosexuality used to be included in the real DSM.Not every reaction or experience in the human condition is a psychiatric problem, syndrome or disorder. The DSM is useful as dictionary \u2014 it\u2019s difficult to discuss things when people aren\u2019t even talking about the same things, so some kind of mutual definition is necessary for a start. We also have entries that go from descriptions of the problems people have in life into the realm of Named Conditions.Take ODD: Oppositional Defiant Disorder. Yes, there are people who are short-tempered, argumentative, annoying, refuse to follow rules, blames others for their problems, are tetchy and so on. This is a definite set of bad behaviours, and there are some people who seem to be entrenched in acting these ways to the point that it seems to be a regular part of their personalities. Do real people act like this? You bet; some of my students act like this. But is it an actual disorder? Some kind of neurophysiological problem?That I\u2019m not so sure about. There may well be some kind of, or several kinds of actual conditions that can result in a person acting like this, but that\u2019s not the same thing. ODD is a good description of someone who is handling themselves badly (for any number of very real reasons), but I wouldn\u2019t classify it as an actual \u201cthing\u201d, a neurophysiological problem. (Then again, we may find some kind of weird dysfunction in the brain caused by genetics or some yet-nameless virus or prion. Life has a way of throwing us curve-balls on a regular basis.)Is every reaction to problematic aspects of life worthy of being identified as a morbidity of some sort, and assigned a billing code for the benefit of insurance companies?The other disturbing part about \u201cdrapetomania\u201d is the telling politics of power. You see, only Negroes were afflicted with drapetomania. Only gays and lesbians were afflicted with homosexuality. Once homosexuality is removed from the DSM as a disorder, then we suddenly have millions fewer patients with \u201cmental illness\u201d. No one was \u201ccured\u201d \u2014 they just weren\u2019t considered ill any more.When we find that we can\u2019t understand why someone does what they do, does it really mean that they gone \u2019round the twist in some way? Or are are they just reacting to what might be an intolerable condition that we\u2019re not properly recognising?", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/CSA-Confederate-America-Kevin-Willmott/dp/B000FZEU0Q/sr=8-1/qid=1161399423/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-9853805-3855810?ie=UTF8", "http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0389828/", "http://www.csathemovie.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/They-Have-Word-Lighthearted-Untranslatable/dp/1889330469/sr=8-1/qid=1161399494/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-9853805-3855810?ie=UTF8", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drapetomania", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/10/20/psychiatric-dysaethesia/", "title": "Psychiatric dysaethesia"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t18 October 2006 ", "body": "So there I was mulling over how to approach long division with one of my seventh-grade students. There are several difficulties involved in his learning of the process, and I\u2019ve only identified a few of them. One thing I do know for sure is that he has a low frustration threshold, and that mathematics is neither an easy nor an interesting subject for him. (Last week he had a meltdown after just a few problems and wouldn\u2019t do any work for the rest of the hour.)I thought back to yesterday\u2019s class. A large part of the problem is that he doesn\u2019t have his multiplication facts memorized. This could be from problems with rote memorization, and it could be also from problems with retrieval of information he already knows. Either or both gives the same result behaviorally. I have to be able to sift through what I observe and what he says, to determine what\u2019s happening. After watching him remember most of what we went over the previous day, and watching him have to stop and calculate 22 minus 18, I suspected that it\u2019s probably more of a rote memorization issue than a recall problem.He also needed a more efficient method of calculating. I showed him that instead of going through the whole rote process of subtracting 8 from 12 by borrowing the 1 from the tens column, he could count from 18 to 22, and (looking at his fingers) see that there\u2019s a difference of four. That sped up his working pace and reduced the cognitive load. It also helped him see that subtracting is finding the distance between two amounts, rather than just cranking through stacks of numerals.He can calculate his multiplication facts (every single time he needs one) because he understands them as adding by multiples, and he figures the product by adding, \u201c4 \u2026. 8 \u2026. 12 \u2026 16\u201d with each group of four on one finger, then look at his fingers and know that 4 times 4 is 16. Doing all this arithmetic with every step (such as figuring out how many 6\u2019s are close to 37 for the first value of the quotient) places heavy demands upon working memory, and thus reduces his ability to learn and recall the larger process. All that work makes it hard to keep the data in short-term memory, and without that, it never makes it to long-term memory.So a couple of days ago I brought out a multiplication table, but he didn\u2019t understand it. Time to backtrack and get a better grip on multiplication! I got some manipulative cubes, and we built up a partial table, setting up 2 sets of 3. He counted each cube, \u201cThat makes six,\u201d and then 3 sets of 2, \u201cThat also makes six,\u201d and he wrote 6\u2019s in both squares. We went over 3\u00d74 and 4\u00d73, and he wrote 12\u2019s in both squares. Ah-ha! The order you multiply doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cThat\u2019s called the Commutative Law,\u201d I explained.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you multiply 4\u00d75 or 5\u00d74, whatever order you multiply them, you still get 20. That means you only have to learn HALF of the multiplication table!\u201d Then we went over 3\u00d73 and 4\u00d74 and 5\u00d75 and learned why a number multiplied times itself is called a square \u2013 the blocks stacked up into squares. Finally he understood how the multiplication table is built and what he can do with it, so we decided to use it in his long division problems.Sequencing is definitely a difficulty; he\u2019s having problems remembering when he\u2019s dividing and when he\u2019s subtracting. He\u2019s also getting confused on whether to put a number down as part of the quotient or as a product. That could also be a spatial processing issue. Some of our students have problems with their columns of numbers wandering about, which plays extra havoc when they get to decimals (I liken it to \u201cgetting decimated\u201d), so I have them turn lined paper sideways and write their numbers in the columns between the lines.One thing I had noticed yesterday was that he could describe the process to me verbally more easily than he could write the problem. He might very well be an auditory learner. This might also be a fine motor co\u00f6rdination issue (he writes his numeral 4 with three separate strokes) so we\u2019ve been doing the problems with a whiteboard and marker. This makes it easier to write the problems down and also erase errors, in contrast to doing them with pencil and paper. The marker glides more easily, and the numerals are naturally larger. It\u2019s also easier for me to see what he\u2019s doing without breathing down his neck, which is more comfortable for both of us.Today I started him out by asking him what his favorite sport is. Yes, that\u2019s an odd way to start math class, and there was a few seconds of delay before he answered, \u201cBaseball.\u201d Tying the subject to his special interest makes it more interesting and relevant, and thus be more likely to \u201cstick\u201d. Starting with something that he likes also helps reduce his aversion to the subject. In this case, we needed to learn the names of the different parts of the division equation. Previously he\u2019d been telling me to, \u201cPut the 2 over the 3,\u201d but knowing how to do one problem by rote process doesn\u2019t always help when you get to a different kind of problem. He also needs to be able to understand that all the problems are built of the same types of pieces. So I explained that just as baseball teams all had the same kinds of positions (catchers, pitchers, basemen, outfielders and so on), so did division problems (divisor, dividend, quotient, product and remainder). Just as each team has different people playing those positions, different problems had different numbers playing different positions. Well, that made sense.With this base of understanding, we began reviewing the process he\u2019d mastered yesterday. Because of his low frustration tolerance, I wanted to be especially sure of emphasizing his achievement. Then we did four problems together, with me correcting errors and also doing the scribing. Having refreshed the process, for the second quartet of problems I had him tell me what do write, and he was nearly soloing. For the third quartet I had him tell me what he\u2019s doing, and he did the writing as well. Then after all that achievement, we looked at the two different ways of writing the same problem, with the bracket or the dotted sign.Of course, the big questions are whether or not today\u2019s understanding made it into his long-term memory (if he can retrieve that process after a day or a weekend or a month), and if he understood what it is actually about.Tomorrow we\u2019ll go over again what a division problem means. 295 divided by 36 describes, \u201cHow many sets of 36 can we make from 295?  Do we have any left over, or does it come out even?\u201d I\u2019ll also have him describe to me the overall process of long division, which I will type up for him to keep. Having the student explain something in their own words requires a higher taxonomic level of learning than just shuffling around a bunch of numbers. Using verbal description also ties the learning to another part of the memory.The problem with learning rote processes without conceptual understanding is that the students will then stumble in pre-algebra. They will need to use abstract reasoning to evaluate which method to use when. Part of that abstract reasoning simply comes from the maturation of the brain, and part of it comes from creating that deeper understanding of different methods.I can sympathize with our students\u2019 mathematical difficulties. It took me four years to learn my multiplication tables, and even in statistics and calculus I still have pauses in recall. (Calculus concepts are a breeze, but I can\u2019t memorize a formula to save my life.) I had also flunked a number of math tests when attending this very same school building, and now here I was teaching it to students. (The irony!) But I take that understanding of the frustration with me every day, and express it as patience. I apply everything I have learned (and continue to learn) about cognition and learning, and everything I have learned about observing people, and put them together in my work as a paraprofessional and as a college tutor.All told, this student successfully completed 13 long division problems today. The whole process is making much more sense, and he persevered with the work through most of the class period. I told him that since he\u2019d stuck with it so well (even when he got a bit frustrated) he could take a break for the last ten minutes of class. He commented that it was kind of fun. \u201cYup,\u201d I agreed, \u201cMath is like games or puzzles once you understand the process!\u201d This is a good sign. It may not last \u2013 one good day after unknown months of difficulties isn\u2019t enough to turn around a student, but it is part of a good start with a new teaching relationship.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/10/18/dividing-we-stand/", "title": "Dividing We Stand"},

So shunned, he leaves his North Pole village, joining up with another misfit, Herbie the elf, who wanted to be, oh horror, a dentist rather than a toy-maker.A few years later there is a Christmas eve of such epically foggy proportions that Santa Claus cannot make his usual gift-giving rounds.\u00a0 Santa realizes that he can still do so if Rudolph is allowed to lead.\u00a0 Eventually everyone decides to tolerate the mutant reindeer, perhaps accept Rudolph a little bit, but only because he can be useful to them, lighting the way for Santa\u2019s sleigh.\u00a0 (Herbie gets to be a dentist, another occupation that is tolerable because it is useful to the others, rather than because Herbie has a passion for dental care.)The program was made in the early 1960\u2019s, coming off of the ultra-conformism of the 1950\u2019s.\u00a0 Everyone thought it was cute and sweet.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t explain the intrinsic discomfort I felt as a child, not from viewing that particular show, or even in everyday life.\u00a0 Nor could I explain why I identified so strongly with Rudolph or for that matter, the alien Spock from \u201cStar Trek\u201d.\u00a0 When the neighbor girls compared me to the Professor from \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d, I couldn\u2019t understand why that wouldn\u2019t be a compliment \u2013 he was the only sensible one of the castaways!\u00a0 But even the Professor, a quintessent geek (though thankfully neither of the foolish nor ugly duckling sort), was the odd one out.The telethon poster child or \u201codd team-mate\u201d is held up in the same way, but also held away at arm\u2019s length, and Othered.\u00a0 We\u2019ll let him be on the team in an accessory manner because it makes us feel munificent, and because he might be exceptionally good at something we need.\u00a0 (Were he merely mediocre, or even near or at the bottom of the list for overall skills, would he be on the team?)But the mere fact that a team-mate is known more for being different than for any aptitude or acquired skill, and even the fact that stories about such people are circulated as ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! and exceptional shows that pity is still stronger than acceptance.The problem with pity is that it creates division; it puts distance between people.Pity prevents respect by implying inferiority; there is a humiliating lack of worth, because the person is defined by what they cannot do instead of what they can do.\u00a0 Victims receive pity \u2013 but nobody wants to be a victim!Pity is disempowering.\u00a0 It does not decrease burdens by sharing resources and abilities. The people who see only the \u201cbroken\u201d part are uncomfortable; that discomfort is a kind of Schadenfreude, a sense of relief that the bad thing (the disability) did not happen to you.Pity is like magical thinking, where people want to give Fate some kind of token payment to avoid similar disaster from befalling them.Pity is similar to both fear of the other, and to contempt for the Other; the Other must somehow have done something bad, and \u201cdeserved\u201d their fate (as given to our social mores from the Puritan ethos).\u00a0 Either way, it is dismissive of the person\u2019s concerns, and denies their opinions, and their own personal view of reality.Pity is not the same thing as compassion, where the other person is seen as being similar to one\u2019s self, and is identified by who they are, is known for what they can do, and is accepted as being a worthwhile person to play with or work with, and to know and to love.\u201cBecause he has been so devoted to the team, for the last game of the season, Coach Johnson actually decided to let Jason suit up \u2013 not to let him play necessarily, just to let him feel what it\u2019s like to wear a jersey,\u201d says the newscaster.::BARF::Meanwhile, too many people work endlessly hard at trying to \u201cpass for normal\u201d. The problem with pretending to be normal is that it gives power to the paradigm, to this concept of normalcy.\u00a0 As long as the person is pretending to be whatever kind of average-normal they are not, they are devaluing themselves and allowing others to devalue them, and they are handing over their personal power to the realm of the imaginary Normal people.Normal, average people are imaginary, because no-one is wholly average and normal.\u00a0 However, the imaginary-normal people are a very real majority group.\u00a0 They all pretend to be normal, and en masse they have majority power under that paradigm.Wow, isn\u2019t it absolutely amazing!\u00a0 Autistics can play basketball.\u00a0 Next thing you know, they\u2019ll let Negroes or women play basketball \u2026Feh.", "outgoing_links": ["http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-818944862742874918", "http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-818944862742874918"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/10/30/games-people-play-off-and-on-the-court/", "title": "Games People Play (off and on the\u00a0court)"},

Sometimes it\u2019s from embarrassment.And sometimes, I have NO idea why people say what they say!My problem is that I am more inclined to straightforward, pragmatic communication, and talking to most others is like conversing in a foreign language.One evening, my husband asks me, \u201cWhat would you think of Italian?\u201d Hmn, I remember eating at the last Italian restaurant we went to, and answer, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like having Italian tonight.

Nowadays we might call them folks, \u201cuppity crips\u201d, and boy howdy were they \u201cuppity\u201d!  Why, they wanted crazy stuff, like being able to ride public transit.  Yesiree!So.\u00a0 This is the story: Those folks got together and started PROTESTING, using civil disobedience.\u00a0 (You have to admit, it\u2019s pretty dang clever using sit-ins and such, especially for some folks who come with their own chairs!\u00a0 NO, they didn\u2019t all use chairs all the time; accessibility is about lots of things, not just parking spaces and curb cuts.)\u00a0 Anyway, these folks created ADAPT, which stood for American Disabled for Accessible Public Transit.(Moment\u2019s pause to re-thread needle.)Well, that took a few years, but it worked so well, they weren\u2019t going to stop there!  So they decided that the next important thing they were going to focus on was getting personal attendant care.\u00a0 As you all know, when rich people have personal attendant care, they\u2019re envied, but when disabled people have personal attendant care, they\u2019re pitied and told they just need to Try Harder.\u00a0 Yeah, right.\u00a0 So they tweaked that great ADAPT acronym to stand for American Disabled For Attendant Programs Today.  Clever, innit?\nWell part of that greater purpose to having personal care is being able to get out of institutions and get back into one\u2019s own home, or being able to stay in one\u2019s own home, or even to get into one\u2019s own home for the first time ever.\u00a0 That\u2019s right, some folks have never-ever had a real home of their own, where they can eat what and when they want, and decorate the way they like, and have friends over when they want, and have all those other everyday discretions that so many of us take for granted.(Pour me a cuppa tea, would you please?)Well, ADAPT is still busy at this, because getting federal action and funding is like moving mountains. Or maybe glaciers; because a ten-year effort is as slow as glacier movement.\u00a0 But anyway. Now they\u2019re preparing for another action toward the Community Choice Act.\u00a0 That means they want to get some of the Medicaid funding to be used for giving people support in their own homes and communities, instead of requiring them to be in institutions for Medicaid funding.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t25 September 2006 ", "body": "I remember being about nine years old (that would have been oh, 1971) when I realized to my utmost horror that because everyone\u2019s experiences are different, that no one will ever understand my words with the exact same \u201cflavor\u201d that I mean them.  This shocked me to the core, and I was inconsolable, silently numb for several days.The whole reverberation only added to my sense of growing isolation.  (\u201cThey don\u2019t know what I am talking about.  They will NEVER know what I am talking about.\u201d)   There is a word in Japanese, \u201cyoin\u201d, which means the experiential reverberation that continues to move you after the external stimulus has ceased.  That moment was a negative sort of yoin.My vocabulary (although large for a person of my age) lacked the sufficient abstract and philosophical terminology that would allow me to share my myriads of thoughts, so my failed attempts only served to worsen the angst.  Then again, I am not sure how much the people around me, the children, teachers or parents, really tried to understand what I was getting at.  Either they did not have the concepts themselves, did not believe a mere child could have such abstract concepts, or did not feel inspired enough to make the effort.Because of my rearing and education, I (wrongly) perceived this inability to communicate highly abstract thoughts as being stupid, rather than as lack of knowledge. (Just as when I was trying to figure out how to optimize the size of a building one could create from a single sheet of construction paper, I thought I was stupid because I couldn\u2019t do it mathematically.  In truth, I couldn\u2019t do it because the calculations I needed required the calculus that I would not study until decades later, rather than the simple arithmetic I had thus far been taught.)Words are but an approximation, a systematized code to give a mutual \u201chandle\u201d on concepts.  Because words are artificial constructs, and each person brings with them a slightly different version of the word, the meanings for words are always created anew, and evolve within the context of the discussion.  Both the sender and receive give slightly different interpretations, based upon their ever-changing personal experiences.Part of what it means to be an intelligent organism is the desire to share experiences with others.  Intelligent apes and dolphins communicate things, although on less complex levels*.  Humans communicate things not only by words, but also by other forms of expression, such as music, dance, and art. There are some days when any good communication seems a miracle!  (Is anyone out there working on that Vulcan mind-meld?)But when you do find someone of like mind, Oh! but when you do, it is the most amazing thing. The words barely keep up with the tumble of concepts that are flashing back and forth. Yes!  They know what I am talking about! Yes! They have thought the same thoughts.  Yes!  They have seen things with much the same perceptual filters; they have the much the same Umwelt**.These moments of rare experiential/perceptual connection to another person are a positive sort of yoin.  They are yet rare; I can count them on the fingers of one hand.  Perhaps finding others of similar neurological bent will increase the incidence for all of us, n\u2019est-ce pas? We are all ever alone \u2014 but \u2014 I would add that we are able to upon occasion reach beyond our individual alonenesses and connect to others. The utter joy and delight, an almost transcendent sense of epiphany one can find in sharing an understanding with some people can be a profound thing.But many times I have come off as being stupid or foolish.  How do you explain to someone that they really cannot always assign mental processes to the results they see? (I think this is one of the reasons I like entomology; people are less likely to assume they can understand what is going on in the wee brains of \u201calien\u201d insects; and yes, many insects are even capable of learning.)  I cannot tell you how many times people have come off with some entirely off-the-wall assumption about me from what they observe.I remember an incident from when I was four years old, and they were testing me for entry to kindergarten (my birthday is after the school year has already started, so I was always the youngest). An adult held up a pen and asked me, \u201cWhat color is this?\u201d I wondered silently to myself, \u201cDoes that mean the color of the case of the pen, or the ink inside it?\u201d I could not really see the ballpoint tip to tell. I knew that some pens have colored nibs on their ends to indicate the ink color, but that not all of them do.Then while I was pondering this, I had a horrifying realisation, \u201cHow can she not know what color it is? This is a grown-up!\u201d I was shocked and concerned and trying to think of a rational reason why an adult might not know their colors that I sat there, silent and not answering. It\u2019s not that I did not know my colors, but rather I could not figure out why she would not, and why on earth she would be asking me. I was just a child! Children don\u2019t help adults \u2013 other adults do. Why wasn\u2019t she talking to the other grown-ups?Of course I was being clueless as usual, and did not realize that she was testing me; I took the interaction at face value. Meanwhile, this person told my mother that I was a foolish child who did not know her colors, and then she used the pen to write something down on a form. Fortunately my mother was there to assert that I did indeed know them, and once it was explained to me what I was supposed to be doing, I rattled off all sorts of color identities about objects, including pink and grey and beige.In the end, it\u2019s our respective perceptions that allow and limit communication.  When we fail to do so, we must always realize that we all carry highly individual conceptual sets.To borrow a line from a song, \u201cI wanted to tell you that I love you, but the words got in the way.\u201d*  Many animals (including insects) can both learn and communicate, but are not considered intelligent because they cannot apply the learning in novel ways to new situations.** The Umwelt is a term coined by von Uexk\u00fcll in the 1920s, meaning the unique sensory world of an organism \u2014 the stimuli to which an animal is responsive in a given motivational state; contrast to the Merkwelt, the set of all environmental factors that are important to the species, whether or not they can actually be perceived.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/09/25/the-words-got-in-the-way/", "title": "The Words Got In the\u00a0Way"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 September 2006 ", "body": "I\u2019ve never found an official name for this. A small, very informal survey indicates that it happens to AD/HD people and autistics, if not others as well. Maybe it will sound familiar to you, too. Let me know.I\u2019ve always just thought of this distinctive funk as The Betweens once I had been through enough cycles to see the overall trend. But The Betweens is more than just your \u201cget-up-and-go done got-up-and-went\u201d.It\u2019s somewhat analogous to the manic ups and depressive downs of bipolar, but doesn\u2019t really function the same way. The Betweens is much more inwardly focused. I would expect that having The Betweens premenstrually or in combination with some other cyclic physiological thing could definitely make it worse.The Betweens are evidenced when the intense GoGoGo from having a new perseveration (or a new slant on a favorite old one) has worn off. Sometimes it\u2019s the body and sometimes it\u2019s the mind. Or maybe it\u2019s both, and you feel about as useful as a beached jellyfish and as brainy as a slug.You can\u2019t keep your train of thought on track. You can\u2019t remember squat, which is frustrating as hell for a mind that\u2019s used to going brilliantly full-tilt. The ennui is horrible, and like a junkie searching for old dribs and drabs of xir favorite fix, you schlump from staring at the dregs of one old obsession to another, staring dumbly at piles of hobby materials or over-loaded bookshelves, and not even sure why you have these things sitting around, or possibly even what you did with them.It\u2019s not just problem of, \u201cI had a brain; I miss my brain\u201d. The pang of nostalgia that seeps across the heart is neither for a particular time nor a place, but is for the feeling of having been\u00a0in some manner\u00a0intensely connected with the universe, and then someone has cruelly cut the umbilicus. (And if this is what \u201cnormal\u201d feels like, I don\u2019t want it!)You ooze out of bed, and once up, seem to be crashing into wall corners and tripping on shoelaces and all those other entertaining tricks, but even more so than usual.You\u2019re disoriented and distractible, and staying focused on a complex task like driving a vehicle requires much more concentration than it ought to. Your adept has turned into un-dept, or some such thing.Even worse is being in graduate school and having a bad case of the Research Betweens, ugh! Academia is rife with stories of students who achieved all their coursework and finished collecting and analysing all the data, and then got started on their theses but never finished the writing, thence never finishing their degrees. One doesn\u2019t have to have been in such circumstances to have done this, but it sure is easy to understand. This is the sort of situation that makes up aspie nightmares, right up there with job interviews and cocktail parties!In a way, The Betweens is like a craving. There probably is some kind of positive-feedback (dopamine?) loop when one is in a long perseveration \u201czone\u201d. Once you crash out, there\u2019s the withdrawal. It\u2019s kind of a rebound depression from a sustained high. C\u2019est normal, but the trick is recognising it, \u201cOh yeah, this is just the cool down / recharging stage\u201d.In a charitable moment, I suppose I could say that the Betweens are an opportunity for recharging one\u2019s batteries. Then again, in real life I need to be spot-on, day after day, and therein lies the problem. Thankfully, The Betweens does go away. But never, never soon enough! ::shudder::I probably would have written some Blues lyrics about, \u201cBeing in The Betweens\u201d except that when you have them \u2014 you can\u2019t\u00a0! (Oy, the irony)The closest thing I have found that works to tripping the Restart button is to do some heavy, simple exercise that takes several hours to complete.Alas, it usually takes me a few days of seeping down into The Betweens before enough stray thoughts coalesce to generate the realisation that, \u201cEr, I am once again suffering from the Betweens!\u201d And then of course, I have to retain that realisation and lurch myself into doing something about it. (Because part of The Betweens is the Nomothetic Fallacy, which explains that merely naming a problem is not the same thing as actually solving it.)\n::sigh::Normally this is when I would go outdoors and do a couple days of heavy-duty gardening.Woe is me if the world outside is covered in ice. There is no indoor work that is analogous. Cleaning out closets is much too mentally taxing, and I have learned the hard way that I would be way too likely to do something terribly foolish, like throw away boxes full of materials that are highly necessary when in another frame of mind. Painting walls might run close, except for all the blasted furniture-moving and hole-spackling and sanding and careful brushing-in the edges.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have the mental energy for this prep-work when I\u2019m in The Betweens.But when I can, shovelling, or raking up thousands of leaves, or turning over the compost heap only requires a few stray neurons for the task, and are such gross motor skills that I am not a threat, even to myself. (Despite that, I bought a leaf rake with plastic tines, just to be sure \u2014 one does get wiser with age).With all this therapeutic manual labor, the brain mushes along lazily for a couple hours, and eventually the rhythm of the labour asserts itself. For some reason, all of my re-set activities end up being those that require me to rock back and forth, but unlike rocking in my chair, this is whole-body rocking. The fact that I am equipped with a rake to collect a pile of leaves, or a pitchfork to man\u0153uvre a heap of dead plant materials into a more aerated mass, is mere camouflage.By the time I am into the soaking-off-the-dirt-in-the-tub stage, the endorphins begin to kick in and my brain is mellowed out from the intellectual vacation. Trickles of concepts begin to flow again. Give me another day, and I will have reached critical mass once more, and be lit afire!\u00a0", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/09/13/the-dreaded-betweens/", "title": "The Dreaded Betweens"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t10 September 2006 ", "body": "Helping the awkward new student seemed like a good idea, so why did it make everything worse?In fourth grade I changed schools between the third and fourth quarters.  I not only changed schools, but also entirely different states, as my mother took my sister and I with her to live with Grandma for a few months.  (I do not know the circumstances behind this; adults did not feel the need to explain things to children.)  Undoubtedly it was to be to my benefit, because my initial fourth-grade teacher was a poor example of the profession, and I did not mind leaving her classroom.  Another benefit to me was leaving the cohort of students I had been with for the past few years; I hoped the new students would be \u201cnicer\u201d.  Unfortunately, I was an odd little girl and apparently went through life with a sign on my back that read \u201cclueless,\u201d as I was to be picked upon where-ever I went.All transfer students face the same challenges of adjusting to different neighborhoods, buildings, teachers, textbooks, rules, and grading schemes.  Apparently it did not take long for the teacher to catch onto the fact that I was not adjusting and making friends in the hoped-for manner.  Presumably a request was put to my classmates to help me by offering me encouragement. I have no idea how this was instituted; like many of the subtler or implicit social things, the effort was completely off my radar.One of the reinforcement mechanisms the teacher had was a \u201cwarm-fuzzy\u201d type box for the students to drop in anonymous notes praising each other for various activities.  These were read aloud by the teacher once a week.  After I had been there for a couple of weeks there was an abrupt flurry of missives complimenting me on my efforts at spending time on reading or being helpful in my classroom duties.  I found such approval odd, for we all had the same duties, and reading was simply something I enjoyed.  Why should someone be commended for having fun?  Actually, I found such praise to be entirely unrewarding, and the realization of that sat uneasily upon my young mind.  I did not have the concept of \u201chollow praise\u201d in my mental world yet, but I knew that although the words given to me were accurate, they lacked any semblance of real meaning.  If the immediate purpose of this exercise was to boost my self-esteem or to comfort me, it truly did not work.  Rather, it made me more anxious with the indescribable angst about how I was \u201csupposed\u201d to feel, and added to the ever-growing concern and unease about what I was \u201cdoing wrong\u201d.Moreover, if the long-term goal of this exercise was to initiate friendships between myself and the other students, it likewise did not work.  Friendship is usually a natural result of being together for periods of time, of having similar backgrounds, circumstances and interests.  Given the numbers of students in the classroom, the chances of at least one or two becoming my friend would have seemed likely.  However my scholastic aptitudes may have been erratic and wanting, I was obviously a socially awkward child.  Not only did I lack the physical graces necessary to playground games, I also lacked the interpersonal graces that were becoming much more important among ten-year olds.  However, I was not just a clumsy nine-year old girl, I also had invisible differences that handicapped my social abilities.  I had trouble recognizing people, and it took me a long time to figure out ways of reliably identifying them.  My conversations lacked the kind of give-and-take where one speaker offers the other person conversational openings.  I had no sense between when people where done with a sentence or done talking, and was prone to interrupting (I still have trouble with this at times).  For all I had a rich imagination, I did not have the intuitive sense of what the stories were supposed to be for \u201cBarbie Gets Married\u201d or other doll games; I derived more pleasure from arranging dollhouse furniture than in doing anything with the figures.I was much more interested in learning about and discussing nonfiction, and my particular passion that year was the fascinating realm of mysteries, detectives, spies and secret codes.  These were not however, the interests of most of the other girls who prattled interminably about horses, pop music, or Betty and Veronica comics.  They instead were developing interests in being stewardesses when they grew up, or in reading and endlessly emoting over pre-teen romance stories. My mother complained, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be more normal?\u201d  The girls told me that I sounded like the Professor from the Gilligan\u2019s Island television show and laughed at me.  I could not figure out why that was not a compliment; he was the only sensible person in the show!Once again, I found more pleasure \u2013 and the opportunity to recharge my energies for the rest of the school day \u2013 by spending all recess on the swings or reading a book. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d the teacher told me, nudging me away from where I was sitting leaning against a tree trunk and reading my latest book (a library volume on how FBI agents caught counterfeiters) \u201cGo and have fun with the other children.\u201dThe efforts to include me failed on several fronts, but they all had the same ulterior mode of operation.  Each of the different man\u0153uvres relied on trying to create friendships by having the previously-bonded group of students \u201chelp\u201d the newcomer.Oh, they tried to help.  Two or three girls made me their special case for a couple of weeks, until they tired of the exercise and dropped me from their attentions.  They dutifully tried to help me integrate into their little play groups, but it was quickly apparent that I was the unplayable Old Maid in the card deck.  Given a choice, eventually no one wanted to add me to their games; my presence was a burden whether on the ball field or the skipping-rope line.  The determination of these few students was probably encouraged by the teacher (and other staff members), and undoubtedly they thrived on the social rewards of being good junior helpers who would care for someone needy. If nothing else, my being the inferior \u201cother\u201d just strengthened the existing social bonds between them.Unfortunately, caring for was not the same thing as caring about.  If I complained to the teacher about being put into awkward situations from being pushed into playgroups where neither I nor the children wanted my presence, my concerns and discomfort were dismissed. \u201cYou should thank them for doing that for you,\u201d the teacher told me, \u201cThey\u2019re letting you play with them.  You should appreciate that.\u201d  But when I played with them, I was made fun of for my inability to do things the right way.  I could not understand why I should express thanks to others for the opportunity to be ridiculed.Ah, ridicule \u2026 I was deficient in any sort of concern for fashion fads, and gave scant thought to my appearance; putting on clean clothes and more or less brushing my hair was adequate in my book. Being tactily defensive, I could not stand to let anyone mess with me. The problem wasn\u2019t who was doing it, but what they were doing. When my mother brushed my hair she would order, \u201cStop being so squirmy!  Why do you have to be so difficult?\u201d  If I complained that being handled hurt, she dismissed my protests, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t hurt \u2013 stop being so whiney!\u201d  Even collar tags on store-bought clothes drove me nuts.  \u201cJust ignore it,\u201d Grandma told me, \u201cyou\u2019re being too sensitive.\u201d  (In turn, Grandma could never stand the feel of cotton balls that came in aspirin bottles, but somehow that was different.)The girls tried to help me look more girly by doing cute things with my hair, but my long, limp tresses were not amenable to being braided or to holding barrettes.  The hairdressing felt like an attack upon my body, a strange sort of help-attack. This activity was especially bad because I was no longer even a person but rather a living salon dummy that needed fixing up. There was a strange lack of personal boundaries; they could touch me but I was not allowed to touch them in like manner, which I could not comprehend. Worse, I was not allowed to protest this inequality, and they chided me, \u201cHush now; hold still and be a good girl.  We\u2019re only trying to help you.\u201d And there I was, compelled by everyone important, that I should co\u00f6perate and make friends. \u201cDon\u2019t be a cry-baby.  You want to be pretty, don\u2019t you?\u201dHelp was apparently something that is done to you and for you; I was the passive recipient for help.  They were strangely disempowering, these activities that were ostensibly for my benefit.  They certainly did nothing to integrate me into the student body. Instead of improving my own grooming abilities, the whole \u201cfix up Andrea\u201d scene only served to further socially disable me. Demonstrating their superior hairdressing abilities not only affirmed their capacities for following the proper r\u00f4les, but also strengthened their memberships in the clique with all that social grooming behavior.Together, my disinclination for being swayed into primping, and my inability to be socially coerced into behaving normally, had serious affects upon my acceptance into the social milieu of the schoolyard and neighborhood. I was poor at \u201cpassing\u201d and although my differences were not obvious at first glance, they eventually piled up like snowflakes obscuring the scenery. People dislike it when someone manages to pass for a while, because the majority then feels that they have been deceived. I was the odd one out, but unlike Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, did not yet have a special talent that would earn me begrudging tolerance for being useful in my oddity.Their attempts to normalize me repeatedly failed, and I bore the given responsibility for that failure.  It was my fault that I had problems; I just needed to \u201ctry harder\u201d to fit in and be a fully functioning member of the scholastic social scene.  The hidden promise was that if I managed to overcome whatever obstacles were in my path, I would be accepted.  However, the true obstacles I had to overcome were not intrinsic, but due to the others\u2019 lack of acceptance of me as myself.  As Charlie Brown lamented in the Valentine\u2019s Day cartoon special:  \u201cI know nobody likes me; why do we need a holiday to emphasize that?\u201dI knew there was something terribly wrong with this entire paradigm, but did not understand it well enough to identify the problem, much less to effectively protest against the dreadfulness of it.  Unfortunately, this was only fourth grade.  There was much worse bullying and sexual harassment in the years ahead of me.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/09/10/being-the-class-project-reflections-upon-false-inclusion/", "title": "Being the Class Project: Reflections upon False\u00a0Inclusion"},

Not as straight-forward as you\u2019d think; often there is extraneous data running around in there that\u2019s not needed. We also run into charming instances of professors and books using different terms to mean the same thing, or handwriting that makes the same term look like a completely different character. \u201cIs that a sigma or a delta?\u201d Pro mea lingua Graeca est.  For added entertainment value, let\u2019s have a hand-written test.Be able to correctly transform the data into the necessary forms, pre-flight.  Are the numbers in the correct units? Do we first need to find means and standard deviations of the 30 values listed in the table? Do we need to flip through 15 pages of lecture notes and a chapter of textbook pages to find or verify the transformational technique? Yes, I have a page of formulae that I\u2019m building.

Let us hope that I don\u2019t have a transcription error on my formula page!Be able to correctly transcribe the data, without transpositions, morphing of numerals, or loss of data.  This is often where I get into trouble \u2013 there\u2019s a sense of spatial meandering as the numbers seem to wander around like ants. Pages with several problems on them make this worse, cluttering the search image. Sometimes I cover over parts of the page with index cards to reduce the visual clutter, but then I have to turn the pages\u2026 Double-check the numbers you\u2019ve entered into the calculator before punching Enter. Oops, dropped a digit; re-enter all the numbers again.Identify which procedure is being called for. Often indirectly stated, especially on tests. Once you know what you need to do, then you need to select which of that mass of massive, messy equations does that trick. It sure would be nice if the professors would spend less time explaining how someone derived the formula \u2013 for all I care, it could have arrived fully-formed, like Athena from the forehead of Zeus. Copying down all the steps someone used to transform one formula into another nifty new formula is not helpful to me \u2013 it just gives me pages of notes of half-cooked formulae that I need to puzzle through while trying to track down the one I really need. I\u2019d rather they spent more time taking us through a flow-chart of how we determine which formula we need.Transcribe the formula onto the homework page, without error.  Then be able to correctly transcribe the data into the formula format, without transpositions, morphing of numerals, or loss of data. Stop and compare the numbers here with those in the problem. All systems \u201cGO\u201d? Clearance from the control tower?Be able to remember where in the sequence of functions you are in the procedure. What was a bit awkward in \u201cborrowing\u201d during subtraction, became confusing in long division, and is downright maddening in regression analyses where each problem is a series of computational subsets. (I sure hope this problem doesn\u2019t take more than one side of the page.) Sometimes I put labels alongside the subsets so I know what the pieces are, but sometimes writing \u2211xy or s2 on the page only adds more ants.

Of course, in a homework assignment, you know what formula(e) you\u2019re supposed to be using; it\u2019s the one related to that section of the book. Now let\u2019s go to a test, where we\u2019re doing several different kinds of problems. The test questions written by the professor state the problems differently than the book did, and require using the formulae in different ways than in the homework, to asses our understanding of the concepts.  Naturally, this means that the problems on the tests don\u2019t look at all familiar, because they aren\u2019t set up the same way that the problems were on the homework.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t6 August 2006 ", "body": "And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off.\n~Mark (ch. IX, v. 43)The current research into the genetic basis for autism includes not just understanding it as an intrinsic and permeating neurological difference, but is straying into the realm of being able to screen for babies carrying those genes, just as one can screen for (and thus not bear) babies with Down\u2019s Syndrome.\u00a0 (It should be noted that Down\u2019s syndrome is a nonheritable genetic difference, but many other conditions are heritable.)There\u2019s an element of hatred in destroying an aspect of one\u2019s self.  The hatred is not always visible as stemming from fear, because the inherent paradox can be repressed.  This paradox of virtue by self-hatred comes from a double-bind disguised as social responsibility:  \u201cDon\u2019t you want to have a healthy baby?\u201d  How could this seemingly innocent question be a double-bind, an unwinnable situation?  If you answer Yes, then you are at fault for not doing/having done the deed.  If you don\u2019t want to do the deed, then you are a worthless [future] parent because you aren\u2019t Doing The Right Thing.If an embryo carries a genetic trait, then that means you were responsible by having the genes in the first place.  If those genes are undesirable, then that can be described as the genetic equivalent to passing on the sins of the fathers to the sons.  Screening embryos for hundreds of \u201cbad\u201d genes is essentially seeking to perfect and breed better humans.  People are uncomfortable with the fact that we can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d everything with science or social engineering, and remove all traces of perceived imperfection.The genetic screening scenario presumes upon knowing which traits are bad and which are good, and ignores the fact that genetic diversity is necessary within a population for it to be able to adapt to new situations.  We need people with different skills to fulfill different roles, some of which may not yet exist.  Furthermore, the \u201cusefulness\u201d of particular genes is not always evident; having two sickle-cell genes makes one anemic, but having one sickle-cell gene confers resistance to malaria.  Useful traits can occur because of clusters of interacting genes, and identifying all the players in the interaction is difficult; you may need some genes (that could be individually problematic) but work in synchrony with other genes to create useful traits.Screening out embryos assumes that autism is a bad trait, rather than a variation caused by combinations of genes.  It also assumes that having autistic children is tragic because there is a social stigma to having a defective/ crippled/ retarded/ autistic child \u2014 the child will never grow up to have a job and marry, but will ever be a burden upon the parents and society in general.  Those \u201cafflicted\u201d are therefore undesirable and not-quite-human; people who are different are unacceptable.  The whole \u201cquality of life\u201d issue given as the rationale for such efforts is presented in tragic, worst-case scenario terms. It paints disability as a fate worse than death that must be avoided at all costs.Such disabled or nonstandard individuals must be able to \u201cprove\u201d their [monetary] worthiness to society to be acceptable, and thus deserving of the same rights and privileges as others. To be acceptable, the deviant people must do their best to \u201cpass for normal\u201d.  One must straighten kinky hair, pretend you don\u2019t have a gay partner, walk with braces rather than use a wheelchair, wear \u201cinvisible\u201d hearing aids, and for heaven\u2019s sake, not flap your hands in public when you get excited about something. Those perceived norms or desirable qualities state a lot about the implicit social power structures:  only the imaginary \u201cnormal\u201d people are okay, even though in reality there is no perfectly average, normal person.Much of the disability seen in autism is from the extrinsic, socially-created problems.  In essence, people are saying that genetic screening is a good thing because those children would have poor-quality lives, but are ignoring that such attitudes are a large part of what create difficult lives for people who are disabled or different!The tragedy is not in having a baby that is in some way different, but rather in the thinly veiled disdain / loathing / fear of the public that is projected onto the baby, and therefore reflects upon the mother\u2019s moral, genetic and social worthiness. It\u2019s her fault if she declines to avail herself of current genetics testing (for any number of anomalies) and bears a \u201cdefective\u201d baby.Should women be required to produce an acceptably standard \u201cproduct\u201d, a baby that will conform to prevailing social norms of desirability and perfection?

It makes their day, sometimes repeatedly, all day long. Every now and then I will re-sample some Coca-cola or Pepsi. Yeup, I still hate cola. I am not fond of carbonation, it is too sweet, and the flavor I simply cannot enjoy. Why do people love this stuff? They even enjoy the caffeine-free or sugar-free sorts, so that cannot be it. I have no idea.So there I am stuck in some social occasion, with my tea or water-no-ice-please, or the hard to find ginger ale, holding it with an occasional swirl, hoping it quickly goes flat.\u00a0I have those dire mental questions about this conversational dance:Is it my turn to contribute something?What would be appropriate to say?Am I talking too much or not enough?Don\u2019t forget to make a little eye contact. Are they really done talking?  Whoops no they weren\u2019t, oh dear.Okay, that IS a pause \u2026 now it is a very long pause; am I supposed to say something, and if so, what about?Are we done with small talking?Should we move apart?What kind of transitional comment am I supposed to make then?The very-small talk of passing and greeting in the hallway, or waiting for a turn at the microwave, or for the coffeepot to finish brewing, is not so hard. One acquires a battery of general phrases to adapt to the particular day.The big talk \u2014 actual conversation as exchange-of-information with persons whom you know or with whom you have things in common \u2014 during lunch time or at a meeting is okay.It is the middle-size talk, the chit-chat, that is difficult. This is the sort one finds at dreaded office parties, dinners with fellow convention attendees, mixers with guests visiting the department, weddings, and such. These people often have some thin connection to one\u2019s self, but for a topic of discussion it is too meager, and if we are near the end of the day there is nothing new to add, and besides by then people want to chit-chat about something else.If you are standing or seated next to the spouse or \u201csignificant other\u201d of the actual attendee, then you have nothing in common, at least nothing than can be perceived in a couple of minutes. Now, it may be that both of you have visited the same place, or have a passing interest in some obscure topic, but without some kind of handy visual \u201cIndex Of Interests\u201d pinned to the lapel like military ribbons, who is to know? Perhaps in an hour\u2019s time you will have discovered that spider-thread of connection, but meanwhile, there are countless bits of the dreaded small-talk to pick one\u2019s way through.And of course, there is the trap of somebody accidentally mentioning something that is a special interest of mine, and unless I am being especially self-aware, I am likely to data-bomb them with more information than they wanted. And of course, I usually cannot tell when \u201cenough is enough already\u201d. ::sigh::Of course, my additional problem is that I have super-acute hearing for all the accessory noises in the environment, yet sometimes have difficulty understanding what people are saying.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t9 August 2006 ", "body": "\u201cHumor is emotional chaos remembered in tranquility.\u201d  ~James Thurberor more technically:\u201cHumor can be defined as surprise that softens our perception of adversity to a psychologically maneageable level.\u201d ~Edward O. WilsonWhy don\u2019t autistics \u201cget\u201d jokes?  Do they lack a sense of humor as some people assert?Humor is a reaction that developed to defuse rage or stress in a situation. It allows groups of individuals to continue coexisting by laughing together, rather than by attacking each other. It is also for defusing embarrassment/ shame, and thus allows an individual to \u201csave face\u201d (not lose their ego/ status) and not risk isolating their self. There is a big difference between laughing at someone, and laughing with someone. The latter is a functionally constructive adaptation.If you are laughing, you cannot simultaneously feel stressed, angry, depressed, anxious or resentful at the same time. It maximizes positive feelings and reduces negative feelings and thus promotes overall personal health, in addition to promoting group cohesion rather than disharmony.SOURCES OF HUMOR: LAUGHING WITH  SOMEONEHumor can occur when we feel relief at a situation that was originally perceived to be a stressor, but at second look is not (e.g., discovering that a \u201csnake\u201d was in fact a dead branch).Humor can occur when we \u201cmake light of\u201d another\u2019s (negative) action or comment by failing to accept it is intended importance. This \u201cTeflon\u201d quality is a form of self-defense, but can also promote group harmony by preventing hostility from progressing by reducing the power of the aggressor, especially if others also deflect the hostility in this manner. There are some kinds of power that only work if both parties \u201cgo along with\u201d their roles as the aggressor and the suppressed.Some humor is simply the delight in witticisms, e.g. puns, word play and such. Those people who are really adept at, and enjoy this sort of humor, often feel that it is rather not the \u201clowest form of humor\u201d, but the highest, because it does not occur at the expense of another\u2019s ability to \u201ckeep face\u201d (maintain their ego/ status).SOURCES OF HUMOR: LAUGHING AT  SOMEONESome humor is \u201cslapstick\u201d, where the amusement is derived from the perceived/ potential, \u201cfake\u201d quality of actors pretending to hurt each other. The audience laughs partly from a sense of schadenfreude when something bad happens to someone else and the observer\u2019s sense of (embarrassed) relief that is felt because it is happening to someone else rather than them. This stems from a sense of insecurity (if the action resulted from another person) or from general anxiety (if the action resulted from an impersonal, environmental act, such as my neighbor getting hit by a falling tree limb). The audience also laughs from a sense of superiority to the victim of the action, as derived from their own insecurities in being able to deal with problems and people in life (\u201cHa-ha, I am not that dumb!\u201d)Slapstick is \u201chumor derived from pain\u201d; it is personally not a form of humor that I enjoy. I did enjoy slapstick to some degree as a young child, but once I actually understood the dynamics of what was going on, it lost all potential for entertainment. I do not see anything funny in the \u201chumor\u201d of hurting others either physically or verbally. (Perhaps this is why many people find clowns scary, rather than funny, in addition to the whole generally strange appearance, and the inability to read emotional intent due to the face-paint?)This humor from schadenfreude can sometimes be positive. It rarely is, being the humorous version of car-wreck carnage that everyone feels obliged to gawp at. But I think that some of the \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d episodes could be considered in this vein. We keep laughing as Lucy digs herself deeper and deeper into a hole, but fortunately she never gets truly hurt. Even as we shake our heads and think that we would never do anything so absurd as Lucy does, we also realize that in other situations, we too could end up behind that conveyer line, trying to cram chocolates somewhere, simply because we were too proud or too embarrassed to holler, \u201cStop the line, I cannot keep up!\u201d\u201cCLOBBERED BY THE PUNCH LINE\u201dLikewise, there are some jokes that I simply do not get; I am \u201cclobbered by the punch line\u201d because I stand there looking confused (perhaps with a weak, apologetic smile) because I do not understand why others find the joke funny. Sometime this is due to my not understanding/ knowing the popular culture reference that gives it the necessary perspective. Of course, if you have to have this kind of joke explained to you, it loses all of it is \u201cfunny\u201d because it is the element of surprise or incongruity that provides the funny! The other times I miss the punch line is when this is due to one of those peculiar social interaction \u201cgames\u201d that (nearly) everyone else intuitively understands, but I am oblivious to. Once again, the joke is funny because it is the element of surprise or incongruity of what the others expect to happen, versus what actually happened in the story of the joke.These are cultural jokes. Some of these cultural facets are common throughout most of the western societies, and because of this seemingly pervasive quality, are thought to be \u201cuniversal\u201d, even though the joke would, even if adequately translated, still fall flat in other, very different cultures. Likewise, there are some jokes that are only funny if you understand the cultural context, but because the cultural context is limited due to smaller population numbers (e.g. Deaf culture jokes), the joke serves an additional purpose of helping define cultural qualities by contrasting what \u201coutsiders\u201d would expect versus what the cultural \u201cinsiders\u201d expect.Autistics who sometimes feel a bit outside of the common cultural spectrum have these feelings of estrangement/ alienation reinforced because we do not \u201cget\u201d some of these culturally-based jokes. Once upon a time, I was accused of \u201cnot having a sense of humor\u201d because I do not enjoy/ understand the humorous value of many of the jokes on the television show \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d. Many of those jokes were based upon characters insulting each other and other forms of personal pain. Indeed, I do not find these kinds of jokes to be humorous. However, I do enjoy the humor of word-play, or of people in painful situations who make jokes to confound the pain or turn the situations upside-down and break the potential pain of the situation (e.g. the television show \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d). In other words, I enjoy shows about people being clever, but not shows about people being mean or stupid.I also love humor derived from absurdity. The joke is funny because of the element of surprise or incongruity of what the others expect to happen, versus what actually happened in the story of the joke. Absurd humor sometimes reveals something about ourselves, because it makes us aware of some familiar aspect of our social/cultural lives, and look at it in a way that we had not thought about it before.For example, in Monty Python\u2019s \u201cHoly Grail\u201d movie, the squire is making cloppity-cloppity sounds with coconut halves while the knight is skipping down the lane, and this reveals to us a set of nested incongruities \u2026 we know that on old radio programs, this was the way the \u201cgalloping horse\u201d sound effect was made \u2014 but this is a moving picture show! There is initial surprise, followed by incongruity: we can see the sound effect being made. The joke gets funnier because the other characters in the scenes act as though this is normal \u2014 they are asking us to perform the \u201cwilling suspension of disbelief\u201d (a fancy term meaning \u201cjust pretend\u201d) for something on stage that is normally only done off stage, which is a further absurdism, or more incongruity.The same also applies to sexual innuendo. In this case, the \u201cpain\u201d being thwarted is the frustrated desire (and/or sometimes the loss of face). In the movie \u201cYoung Frankenstein\u201d there is a scene where a wench asks a guy if he wants to \u201croll in the hay.\u201d We all know that this phrase is a very old euphemism for having sex. The joke is that when he indicates his interest, all the girl does is to \u2026 begin turning over in the haypile saying, \u201croll, roll, roll, roll\u2026\u201d taking the figure of speech literally. The humor lies in what the character and the audience expected (hoped) would happen, versus what unexpected event actually happened. How the character reacts to this frustration is also a bit of sympathetic farce \u2014 most guys can relate to having gotten their um, hopes up, and then totally dashed because the situation with the girl did not turn out as hoped. The humor is thus secondarily derived from coping with the pain of frustration.Much of the humor in sexual innuendo comes from the innuendo part of it and seeing how far one can stretch a bit of word play. The British comedy \u201cAre You Being Served?\u201d is chock-full of this in the dialog of Mr. Humphries and Mrs. Slocombe.The likewise supposed \u201clack of empathy\u201d ascribed to autistics is rather either a lack of being able to identify other\u2019s emotional responses, or a lack of understanding of the motivations that cause other\u2019s emotional reactions. Indeed, I have great sympathy for the victims of slapstick or insulting humor (having often been the victim of such situations) and this is why I do not find it to be funny.\nAnother tangent to the psychological perspective of AS, is that sometimes others view this lack of understanding cultural humor or the lack of enjoyment of insulting humor, as being \u201clacking a sense of humor\u201d altogether. The flippant comments about my perceived humorlessness reflect this: some of the incongruous things I find to be funny, others find quite strange, stupid, or humorless. But it is not a lack of a sense of humor on my part, but sometimes finding humor in different things.WHEN \u201cHUMOR\u201d IS NOT A LAUGHING MATTERSecondly, there is a big difference between laughing at someone, and laughing with someone. Attacking someone and then saying, \u201cOh it is just a joke; whatsamatter, can\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d is not true humor. This is \u201chumor\u201d derived from a feeling of superiority, using shame and derision.Whether or not something is \u201ctruly\u201d funny has to be evaluated. It is really interesting to watch old programs and then you realize that some kinds of humor do not age well. Political satire can be so topical that it is no longer funny or even intelligible a couple of decades later. Tastes in humor change, mostly due to evolving senses of what is appropriate for being laughed at. There are racial and sexist jokes that are only painful to hear, because it is embarrassing to realize that someone could have found their humor in the ridicule of others. When the \u201cJokes you cannot tell in mixed company\u201d end up as \u201cJokes you wouldn\u2019t even want to tell in any kind of company\u201d, you get some hope that maybe society is growing up \u2026 just a little bit.Making fun of someone and laughing at their expense is not funny. Although some forms of humor involve pain, but true humor is derived from averting or deflecting pain, rather than from inflicting pain. The ultimate (evolutionary) purpose of humor is to provide a coping mechanism and to reduce stresses (replacing negative feelings with positive ones) by reducing the importance of an event and it is perceived negative quality, and also to improve group dynamics.Our feelings result not from situations, but from the positions we take or the values that we assign to situations. Likewise, it is often not particular situations that stress us, but the meanings or positions or values that we assign to those situations.Humor enables us to change our perspective on situations, and thus how we can react to them. We laugh to keep from crying. We laugh because when we are powerless to act upon a situation, we are faced with either certain depression, or with using the one act of power left to us, the power to laugh at it.Being able to laugh at situations improves our emotional and physical well-being (aerobics for the cardiopulmonary heart and spiritual heart both), and allows us to more successfully interact with and enjoy other\u2019s company. When life gets too heavy, learn to lighten your load by shrugging off some of the pain. You cannot always prevent things from happening, but you can often choose how you will react to them.Besides, the person who can laugh at their self will never run out of source material!", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/08/09/whats-so-damn-funny/", "title": "What\u2019s So Damn\u00a0Funny?"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t11 August 2006 ", "body": "Well, it\u2019s that time of year again when I sign up for another class. Being that I\u2019m taking this class at a different college, I have to once again go through the process of filing paperwork with the office that provides access services for students with disabilities. (I\u2019ve long since learned to scan the diagnostic documents into pdf files so I can hand out copies, rather than risk losing or damaging the originals.)Going through this process leaves me with mixed feelings. On one hand, I\u2019m relieved that someone takes seriously my persistent difficulties with some processes. I\u2019m glad to finally get the accommodations I need. On the other hand, this whole process of getting accommodations, and indeed the system of special education, is a tacit acknowledgement that the current educational system simply doesn\u2019t work well enough for large numbers of students.The absurd part is that I really don\u2019t need anything extraordinary in the way of accommodations. The things I need aren\u2019t expensive, nor do they require the instructors to do anything radically different in their instruction methods.My accommodations are to give me \u201cpreferential seating\u201d (I sit up front to better see and hear the professor and the board they are writing/projection upon); to have the captions displayed when videos are shown so I can understand all the narration (the students with hearing impairments or who do not have English as their primary language also benefit from the captions); to get copies of lecture notes or PowerPoints so I can be sure of understanding and not missing any of the material being presented, and to have 50% extra time to take tests.What these do is to allow me to do is to acquire the information being presented, and to demonstrate my mastery of the subject material, at levels on par with my peers. These don\u2019t give me a superior advantage over the other students, but rather help bring me up to the same level. (If many of the other students find they would also very much benefit from these things, then the instructional and evaluation methods need re-assessing \u2013 there\u2019s a difference between challenging students and making things hard on them.)Much of the resistance I have gotten from instructors has been on the issue of \u201cfairness\u201d.I have failed \u2013 flunked \u2013 big red \u201cF\u201d on the page \u2013 more math tests than I care to remember. Suddenly I am getting A\u2019s in College Algebra and Calculus! So, I am not innumerate. But what the hell happened? I got much better teachers who were able to teach with a variety of methods geared for different learning styles, and they let me take the time I need to finish the tests.Then I get to a graduate-level statistics course, and talk to the professor at the beginning of the semester, explaining my particular difficulties with transcription errors and such, and ask if I might be able to have extra time if necessary so I can finish my exams. He refuses. He feels that would be \u201cunfair\u201d to the other students. \u201cEveryone gets test anxiety; you will get faster with practice,\u201d he says.I sigh heavily at this familiar refrain, and throw myself into the subject. Like calculus, statistics lives in a theory world of its own, but I find that I understand the concepts. I read the textbook. I take excellent notes in class (people like to borrow my notes when they miss lectures). I do all the homework. I join a study-group. I do the programming projects and get A\u2019s on them.Then I get D\u2019s on the first two tests. (Oh no, not again!) I go back and explain my problems once again to my professor \u2013 I did not even have time to finish one of the tests! I ask him again for extra time, which he refuses. Finally in high frustration, I end up discussing the situation with my grad school advisor, who pushes through a class Drop (even after the official last-drop date; amazingly, it can be done). I retake the class the next semester, this time with my official paperwork filed so I can have half as much more time to take the tests, and therefore will be able to finish them and be able to double-check my calculations for transpositions and such. I get a perfectly acceptable B grade. I just wanted to be tested on my understanding of the material, not my computational speed!\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair,\u201d said the professor.  He missed the point.Ann Welch* makes some excellent distinctions about the different concepts that are lumped together under sometimes misleading heading of \u201cfairness\u201d.\nEquality is about treating everyone the same way because people have the same rights.\nEquity is about recognizing and responding according to the amount of effort given by or achievement of a student. Equity can be best determined when everyone has the same equal opportunity.\nThe third of course is need. Not everyone needs the same things. (After all, no one complains that it\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d that I get to use bifocals when the rest of the students don\u2019t.)Highly competitive cultures place great value on equity; you get what you deserve. (The corollary being that you deserve what you get, and if taken to extremes, that if you\u2019re somehow \u201csubstandard\u201d you must have deserved it. It\u2019s the old sin model of disability.)It\u2019s not that people aren\u2019t terribly concerned with fairness. Indeed, children are almost obsessed with fairness, watching every last gram of sweets being doled out, or time and opportunity with entertainments being shared. That sort of fairness is about equality.Fairness is not just about treating everyone the same; it\u2019s also about giving people what they need.* Ann B.

It is not necessary that the curriculum be \u201cdumbed down\u201d for all the students to master the subject material. Nor is it required that good grades be a commodity in short supply. What is the goal of learning?\u00a0 The goal is the transfer of knowledge.\u00a0 This goal applies to all the students.\u00a0 It is NOT wrong for all the students to do well! Likewise, if so many students are doing poorly on a test and the mass of poor grades need to be curved to create a new grading scale, then something is going seriously awry in the teaching-learning-testing process.Student behavior is best shaped by rewarding correct behaviors with positive reinforcement and punishing incorrect behaviors with negative reinforcement. \nIf a student is not behaving (socially or academically) in the way we expect, we need to find out why.\u00a0\u00a0 Students who are having problems need to be helped, not punished. No long-term benefit is gained by reacting to the symptoms produced by a problem; the cause of the problem must be addressed.\u00a0 \u201cHelping\u201d is not necessarily doing something for a person (which increases their sense of incompetence), but rather aiding them in figuring out how they can help themselves by either removing the cause of their problem or finding some way to compensate for it.\u00a0 Teaching them self-help skills not only gives the student tools to solve future problems, but also builds self-esteem, which in turn improves the student\u2019s ability to learn the curriculum.\u00a0 Punishing the student for having problems not only further breaks down the self-esteem, but can also reinforce learned helplessness.\u00a0 Furthermore, this kind of system turns the motivations from learning (intrinsic) to getting the reward or avoiding the punishment (extrinsic).We\u2019re not here to entertain the students!\u00a0\u00a0 \nNo, but we are here to engage them.\u00a0 An instructor must have enough enthusiasm or thought-provoking information about the subject to create interest.We need \u201cflunk-out\u201d classes like introductory chemistry or physics to weed out the less-than-stellar students. \nUm, I thought the point of education was to teach students the things they don\u2019t know?\u00a0 The purpose of universities is to serve your student clients, not to remove them from the local populations within various colleges.\u00a0 When students know (or just perceive) that there are \u201cflunk-out\u201d classes, this dismotivates them, and you end up with fewer students in necessary fields (like engineering), rather than more students and a greater diversity of students in particular fields.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/08/16/my-top-myths-in-teaching/", "title": "My Top Myths in\u00a0Teaching"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 August 2006 ", "body": "My phone rings, and I am scheduling with one of my new tutees. I am meeting with this particular person less for the more common \u201ccontent\u201d tutoring (explaining concepts in Biology, or editing strategies in Composition) than I am for \u201cprocess\u201d tutoring: figuring out what kinds or organsational methods will work best for her, and helping her figure out how she can solve future problems on her own.I turn on my calendar program, as yet mostly comprised of blank squares for this month. \u201cWe can meet once a week for 90 minutes, or break that up and meet twice a week.\u201d\u201cWell, what do other people do?\u201d she asks, a tone of uncertainty in her voice. I wonder if the uncertainty stems from the scheduling logistics, from the process of getting tutoring, or some other element in her life. Maybe it\u2019s just being tired from what she\u2019d described as getting in late last night from a trip.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what most other people do; what\u2019s important is what you  need,\u201d I assert.There is a pause while she digests this thought. Perhaps it\u2019s a new and dangerous idea, where one\u2019s needs outweigh having to do what everyone else does.I explain the options a bit, \u201cOnce a week might work better because of time constraints, or twice a week might work better so you can review stuff and go to class and then review stuff again. We can also try it one way, and then as things change over the semester, try it the other way and see if that works better. I\u2019m flexible. It\u2019s not carved in stone.\u201dPerhaps the uncertainty comes from not knowing what her needs will be. That kind of prescience comes from experience, of which freshmen and sophomores have less.This is, I have found, one of the paralyzing concepts facing people who don\u2019t have as much experience in making decisions about their own lives. There is this myth that you should know what you\u2019ll need in the future, and have to make The Best, Correct Decision \u2013 Right Now, and that once made, you\u2019re stuck with it forever. That somehow there\u2019s not enough grace in the world to change things and adapt them to your own changing needs, or your changing understanding of your needs. Worse, that if you make the Wrong Decision, or even a Less Useful Decision, then you have screwed up and this reflects poorly upon your character and your intelligence, rather than the fact that wisdom is a pathway trod throughout life.We all want to do the right thing. We all need to learn how to make decisions about our lives and to advocate for ourselves. Doing that takes practice. Practice means that teens, young adults, and even older adults will need to have the opportunity to make mistakes along the way, learn from them, and then try again.Practice means that one has a certain level of support system so we don\u2019t fail to the point of endangerment. The baby learning to toddle is given a safe environment, a certain level of freedom, and encouragement. They are also the opportunity to fall down BUMF! on their diaper-padded butt time and again, to get up and cruise along the furniture until comfortable enough to strike out independently across the floor, and then eventually out the door into the big world.What we don\u2019t need is some people trying to keep us down by using the occasional failure as \u201cproof\u201d that a person is unable to be self-sufficient, and therefore must be bounded and trapped in \u201ccare\u201d situations. As Carol Hanisch said decades ago (regarding the feminist movement), \u201cWe\u2019re messed-over, not messed-up.\u201dMy tutees are not the only ones practicing. I\u2019m a practitioner because I\u2019m also practicing. After a tutoring session I reflect upon what transpired to plan for next time. Sometimes I find that I must take different approaches than those traditionally recommended. This isn\u2019t surprising, because the very reason I\u2019m with these students in the first place is because the \u201cusual methods\u201d are often not adequate to their needs.What this does is require me to come up with novel ways of applying what I know about the person and their situation. This means that for the student, the method I\u2019m proposing has to in some way be partially based upon something they are already familiar with, so it will make sense to them, and so they can begin from a point of comfort derived from familiarity. Then we can take the method and do something different with it.Much of doing this is an interactive process where I am providing the medium for the student to explore what they need, and how they can achieve that for their self. The end point is to help them learn how to problem-solve new kinds of situations, and thus eventually make myself \u201cunemployed\u201d.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/08/13/practicing/", "title": "Practicing"},

secondly, being able to give it a suitable \u201ctest drive\u201d (oft times there\u2019s a learning curve to a new device, so it\u2019s hard to tell how useful it will actually be until you can try it out under fairly natural conditions, which usually doesn\u2019t mean sitting in someone\u2019s office or showroom);

a common marketing ploy, but also a necessary one from that \u201clearning curve\u201d standpoint.\u00a0 I found that the actual learning curve itself was short; after two messages I was comfortable with the process.\u00a0 The challenge, I discovered, was getting hubby on the other end of our figurative tin can and string!\u00a0 He understood texting from technical and sociological perspectives.\u00a0 He just didn\u2019t see any need for it personally.\u00a0 He wanted me to phone him so we could talk.Now, that really made no sense to me; he\u2019s hard of hearing, and I have auditory processing disorder, where my cognitive processing of what I hear sometimes gets blips, not unlike the way my mobile gets erratic signals in buildings.\u00a0 You\u2019d think that the usefulness of this bit of technology would be apparent as all get-out.\u00a0 But his emotional reception was lukewarm; he\u2019s a people-person, and prefers as little technical interface as possible.Doing phone calls during my summer camp job was difficult for several reasons, including crappy reception inside the building, the lack of free time during lunch (we were getting lunch for our campers), and often the utter volume level \u2013 some of the counselors could carry on phone conversations during our typically noisy bus rides, but I couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 Thus, we weren\u2019t able to dependably call each other up for mundane conversations like, \u201cI\u2019m going to the store after work; do we need anything besides bread?\u201dThere\u2019s more than one way to sell something.\u00a0 I\u2019d get a voice-mail, and after listening to it two or three times to understand the message, replied back in text.\u00a0 Text messages have clarity, when-you-can-get-around-to-it convenience of e-mail, but with more of the live-time quality of phoning.\u00a0 I could receive and reply more easily, with greater privacy, and in more places.\u00a0 I found there were additional benefits, like being able to share phone numbers or reminders, and having those available in digital memory for later in the day.\u00a0 That\u2019s a big deal for someone with ADHD!Soon we were texting messages instead of talking on the phone.\u00a0 We were actually communicating more information, and doing so more often.\u00a0 We also found that what the missives may have lacked in warm fuzzy voice tones, they made up for in reduced marital stress.\u201cNeed toilet paper!\u00a0 Home for dinner?\u00a0 Love you.\u201d", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/08/20/read-my-clips/", "title": "Read My Clips"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t26 August 2006 ", "body": "A series of vignettes strung on a chain, now broken.My mother just wanted a \u201cnormal\u201d girl; maybe it was that entrenched social conformism. By 5th grade she kept stressing this idea, so I observed what girls were interested in, which was horses and romances. Therefore I ordered one each of horse and romance stories from the Weekly Reader book club, and found them to be profoundly disinteresting. I could not fathom either the attraction or the point! When I was a high school freshman, Mom decided that I lacked femininity and grace, so enrolled me in a \u201ccharm school\u201d held at Sears & Roebucks, where we were taught the proper way to apply makeup, walk with a book on our heads, kneel to pick up an object from the floor while wearing miniskirts, sit down in a dainty and discreet manner, curtsy and such. Somehow this failed to make me more normal.Shopping for my clothes invariably provoked more complaints; I was \u201cso picky\u201d about clothes, meaning there are many fabrics I cannot stand to touch or wear, not to mention the collar tags (which I now remove). I remember getting overwhelmed at the department store as a child, one of those seriously old-fashioned places with an elevator operator, glass display cases of merchandise, multiple floors of merchandise, and pneumatic tubes slinging upstairs to the cashier\u2019s cage. One department, or maybe the dressing rooms, had high-contrast vertical striped wallpaper that gave me slithery-jangling-willies. Sometimes the floor seems to ripple; busy surfaces like speckled/tweedy commercial-grade carpeting or color-streaked linoleum or striped wallpaper acquire a quivering aspect, like wavelets upon great bodies of water. I know from repeated experiments (done as a child) that these surfaces do not really ripple or undulate, so I generally ignore the effect, but sometimes it takes me by surprise. I get vertigo and things seem to spin around, or close distances yawn far away from me.  Mom hated dragging me with her, because I\u2019d want to hide in the center of the circular coat rack, muffling out the noises and smells and colors in the darkness and comfortingly-heavy pressure of yards of dense fabrics. I was just trying to cope with the sensory overload, but all she could see was that I was being disobedient and an embarrassment to her from by attracting attention to my weird behavior \u2026Unfortunately, in the long run my mother seemed more concerned with assigning blame than resolving problems, and she decided that my long-standing academic difficulties were due to rebelliousness; I was just \u201cacting out.\u201d One day in high school, after I handed over the dreaded report card, she grounded me with the fierce proclamation that \u201cAll children rebel, but you are doing it ALL WRONG!\u201d For her, there was one way things were supposed to be, and I did not fit her expectations: granted I didn\u2019t drink or do drugs, but I also didn\u2019t date, didn\u2019t drive, and didn\u2019t excel in school, sports or social activities.There I was trying to rationally understand how people thought and interacted, and instead I had someone who was (alcoholic and) inconsistent, inexplicable, and unpredictable. I kept trying to wrap my head around making sense of what she said and did, and kept getting my mind tangled up in Laingian knots. What I needed was access to strategies that would allow me to learn how to meet my own needs. Instead, what I got was a denial that those needs existed. She could not, or would not understand that my needs were different than hers. Her denial, disbelief, or dismissal caused me to doubt my own self-understanding, and thus prevented me from helping myself. Years later I finally understand her actions as being narcissistic, for all she asserted that she was only trying to prove to others how hard she worked to \u201chelp\u201d me. It wasn\u2019t just about her \u201cnot understanding\u201d that I was different, it was about my not being able to give her what she needed. It was all about what she needed. Repeatedly, the scenarios played out, as she:\nTold me how I \u201creally\u201d felt emotionally or physically, or told me that I could not possibly be feeling something, that indeed I actually was feeling.\nDiscouraged questions, saying that they were either stupid, or that I didn\u2019t need to know such things, or that everyone knew about ((whatever), and that I was foolish for bothering her to ask about things.\nAsserted that I must be either crazy, lying or on drugs when I described experiencing colors while listening to music.\nSaid I was being \u201ctoo picky\u201d because I could not stand to wear some kinds of fabrics, or got sore spots on my neck from collar tags, or could not stand to have my bedroom curtains open on sunny days, or could not stand the noise when some kinds of woodshop machinery were being used.\nDelivered me curious \u201ccompliments\u201d that did not feel like such, \u201cYou know, if you just wore a little makeup, you might be kinda pretty.\u201d\nDenigrated my interests as being stupid because they were not \u201cnormal\u201d; I should be buying cute hair ties or makeup instead of a Latin dictionary or an antique volume on structural design & engineering by the National Park Service.\nTold me, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to what I say, listen to what I mean!\u201d  (This to someone who misses out on so much unspoken dialog?)\nTook to red-inking my personal diary and creative writing efforts for grammatical errors, ridiculed my social concerns as being absurd, and the story plot ideas as being stupid.\nPeriodically would go through my locker, purse, notebook or bedroom contents in an effort to find something incriminating (drugs I did not use, or notes from non-existent boyfriends), and then accused me of being devious because she could not find anything.\nWould not admit when she was wrong; I was obviously confused, or lying, or making things up.\nAccused me of stealing clothes when my Spanish teacher gave me one of her used blouses, then changed her story and said I had been lying to the teacher and misrepresenting myself as poor and neglected.\nConsidered my expressing frustration as being \u201crebellious.\u201d\nDisbelieved my scholastic problems when I tried to explain them to her, but then turned around and saying that I had been \u201chiding\u201d problems when teachers or my school counselor told her about bad grades from unfinished tests, missing assignments, jumbled math homework, bad spelling and such.\nAsserted that my problems from bullies were all because I had \u201cbrought it upon myself\u201d and was causing the bullying, and simply being \u201cwhiny\u201d and \u201cjust trying to get attention\u201d when I told the problems to various teachers and the school principal.\nRidiculed my concerns about scholastic problems, and demanded good grade results but would not accept the fact that I needed help to achieve those goals, saying that my lack of results was due to merely being lazy and not trying hard enough.\nConvinced others that that my problems were burdens that I created intentionally for her out of rebelliousness.\nDenied my problems or belittled them as being much less important than any of her own problems.\nComplained about the cost/ shopping effort/ need for basic school items (such as a required style of gym socks or graph paper for geometry class) as though these were unusual demands I had invented just to make her life more difficult.\nAssigned guilt by association \u2013 badmouthing my father (her ex-husband) saying I was just like him.\nCurtailed contact with others (my teachers or counselor, interest clubs) and discouraged me from doing things on my own, then said I couldn\u2019t do things because I had no experience or skills.\nGave me responsibility and consequences of things getting done, without giving me the means to do them effectively.\nAs ever, she was more concerned with finding faults and assigning blame than with resolving problems, because it was all about \u201csaving face\u201d on her part. It was my fault; she was trying so heroically to help me, but I was just being stupid or stubborn or rebellious. \u201cDamnit Andrea, you know what your problem is? You don\u2019t have any self-confidence! That\u2019s just so pathetic!\u201dAlthough I now understand the essential errors in this denial, disbelief, and dismissal, these kinds of statements are still things I run into once in a while, from other people. It is a shame, really. Once I began to make sense of the world, I kept trying to change the family dynamics, to improve things, to help her understand, but she actively resisted change, even on those rare occasions when she would acknowledge that things were not right. But, you cannot make people what you want them to be.You can\u2019t change the past, but you can change how you react to it.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/08/26/tying-the-knots/", "title": "Tying the Knots"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t28 August 2006 ", "body": "\u201cIt\u2019s a ganglion cyst,\u201d announced my doctor, after gently squeezing and manipulating my right index finger, and feeling the lump below the middle knuckle.  I\u2019d felt kind of silly going in to the doctor just for a stiff, persistently swollen finger, and had put off the visit for a month until I realized that it was not only getting worse, but also affecting my ability to grip things.  Then the doc went and fetched a foam-padded aluminum splint and some bandage tape.  So now my right index finger is immobilized through the middle of September, in hopes that without physical aggravation from everyday activities, the cyst will subside and I won\u2019t have to see a specialist to have it aspirated or operated upon.Fortunately, I don\u2019t rely on my right hand for everything.  In fact, there\u2019s very little I can\u2019t also do with my left hand, aside from obvious stuff like wear right-handed gloves or type YUIOPHJKL;NM,.  Most lefties are ambidextrous just because they have to live in a world full of things designed for right-handed people (sewing machines being a rare exception).  I have lefty scissors (which stay nice and sharp because no one borrows them), a lefty can opener, and my pen jar lives on the left side of my desk.Which is odd because I don\u2019t write left-handed. I\u2019ve been writing right-handed for the past forty years because that\u2019s the way I was taught, per my mother\u2019s request.  I could never figure out why some of the other kids in my classes got to use the lefty scissors, but I didn\u2019t.  She could never figure out why my penmanship was poor.So here I am, learning to keep my pen in what has been, for penmanship purposes, not my dominant hand, but my dormant hand.  Heaven knows which is my \u201cdominant\u201d hand (I need to ask my psychologist friend, David, what was the final analysis on that random question).  The things I learned as a child I do right-handed, the things I learned as an adult I do left-handed, and many things I do with either hand.I can write left-handed, but not surprisingly, my penmanship looks like a first-grader\u2019s, and it\u2019s slow going from lack of practice.  I\u2019m also finding, much to my surprise, that I have resurrected not only dormant writing skills, but also dormant writing problems: I get b d p q mixed up again.  I know how to spell and I can read okay, but something gets scrambled in the writing process, not unlike the way my numerals get mixed up sometimes.  The ways of the brain are mysterious, indeed.Today is Monday, and sometime tomorrow I need to decide if I can either scribble fast enough or type fast enough on my laptop to take notes in my Thursday class, or else must request a note-taker via the college\u2019s disability access department.Which all is kind of humorous, in a cosmically ironic way.  I\u2019ve been a note-taker for other students, in classes where I was already very familiar with the subject, so I wasn\u2019t spending quite as much effort understanding the teacher.  Equally ironic is that this class I\u2019m taking is on the \u201cExceptional Child\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s all about different kinds of disabilities.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/08/28/dormant/", "title": "Dormant"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t12 November 2006", "body": "My fourth-grade teacher Miss V is standing at the front of the classroom, writing something on the board and announcing the next assignment to the class. I am bobbing and straining to see around the four ranks of students in front of me, watching her gracefully stroking the chalk along the board to produce words in her perfect penmanship. The capitals swirl impressively, and her near-lack of spacing turns the words into ribbons of elegant loops and curls. I blink at it several times, and my focus finally shifts; pop! the calligraphy resolves into the vocabulary words \u201cHuron\u201d and \u201cMichigan\u201d.I realise that today\u2019s social studies lesson must be about geography, and we are studying the Great Lakes. I bet she\u2019ll ask who remembers all of them, so I am mentally scrambling to remember all five lakes; there are always one or two that escape my mental list, as I don\u2019t know any mnemonics for them. (Then again, remembering mnemonics can be even more difficult than remembering the original names.)Wait a minute! Didn\u2019t we color a map last week? I\u2019d better pull that out to have it on hand. I feel proud for having thought of that, and know that Miss V will be very pleased that I\u2019d been able to anticipate that part of her teaching strategy. Humming contentedly, I scoot my chair back so I can rummage around the inside of my school desk. In this classroom the school desks are solid metal shelves underneath heavy tabletops. I have what will decades later be known as ADHD, and not surprisingly the interior of my desk is a chaotic tangle of pencils, crayon bits, mashed-up assignment pages in various stages of completion, cool rocks, a forgotten/unsigned permission slip, well-worn erasers including one with thumb tacks (push pins) stuck in to turn it into a car, text books, treasured bits of shiny colored foil, pages of stories and drawings, Matchbox cars, and other d\u00e9bris.I finally find my map and some of my colored pencils and slap them triumphantly on the desk. Then a pencil rolls off the edge and whilst retrieving it I lean over too far and crash into a neighboring student. Feeling foolish, I concentrate on finishing my preparation by smoothing out the crumpled map. Then I make yet another effort to refocus myself and sit up nice and straight to take a deep breath, responsibly looking toward Miss V \u2013 I am ready!At that point I can see what the students around me have been doing for the past five minutes, and crushingly, I realise that I am totally  off task. They aren\u2019t doing anything at all with maps or colored pencils. The other students have some purple mimeographed worksheets out, and are writing on them. The class is quiet, or at least what the Miss V refers to as \u201cquiet\u201d; for me the room is still abuzz with scratching pencils, stuffy breathing, creaking chairs and desks, the ticking clock, playground noises, and the arguments of crows fighting each other for something that had fallen out of a lunch sack. Uh-oh \u2026 I freeze, feeling clammy and prickly, and my focal field tunnels down to encompass no more than a swirl in the desktop laminate.Oh no, what am I supposed to be doing? What had I missed when she was talking towards the chalkboard? I\u2019m stuck in short focus \u2013 I have peripheral vision but am not making any sense of it, so anything written on the chalkboard on the other side of the room has just become totally inaccessible to me.This isn\u2019t the first time I have gotten distracted, or have had an auditory or visual processing blip, or simply haven\u2019t been able to see around the older-and-bigger students and thus misunderstood an assignment. So I know that if I once again ask the teacher what she just said I would get in trouble for \u201cnot paying attention\u201d, and if I once again ask a nearby student what the Miss V said I would get in trouble for \u201ctalking out of turn\u201d.I need to do something to figure out what I should be doing \u2026 I will just check my neighbor\u2019s page to see what the subject is, and what we are supposed to be doing. Having already annoyed one student by nearly falling on them, I graciously lean the other direction \u2013 thus unintentionally managing to annoy two students in as many minutes.Suddenly Miss V is there looming over me, and her reprimands swirl around in my mind, the sentences weaving together and echoing in broken chunks. She is glaring at me, and once again I am unable to make eye contact so am staring at the ruffles on her pink blouse, stammering as I try to explain, \u201cI was jus\u2019JUST looking at oowwwhat she was doing \u2026\u201dAnd that is why I appeared noncompliant and dishonest, and how I got into trouble for cheating on the reading worksheet about the Huron Indians.Sometimes what looks like cheating isn\u2019t. Rather, what we have is a student who is utilizing other environmental sources to get needed information. The distinction here is that the student is looking at another\u2019s materials not for the answers to the assignment, but rather answers about the assignment, such as which pages or problems are assigned, or how the work is to be performed (e.g. in the book, on a piece of paper, writing out the questions or just the answers, putting spelling words in sentences or just writing them multiple times).After all, it\u2019s generally thought a child with perfect hearing should be able to understand directions. Included in this are the assumptions that in addition to basic sensory hearing, \u201chearing\u201d includes being able to maintain attention (listening), being able to understand what is heard (decoding), and also knowing what is meant by those words (interpreting).Corrective lenses should also mean that the child can see the board as well as anyone else. Included in this are the assumptions that in addition to basic sensory vision, \u201cseeing\u201d means being able to maintain attention from the beginning to the ending of the writing process (watching), being able to orient and select what is seen (discriminating), and also being able to decode what is meant by partially-written instructions (inferring).Lastly, it\u2019s generally thought that an intelligent child should be able to put it all together, to integrate the sensory information, and then turn around and express that processing appropriately, in task performance (planning and execution), in verbal responses (articulation), and in nonverbal responses.Sadly, many people have never considered how many steps there are to processing sensory information. Next time you have a student who appears off-task, noncompliant, willful, rebellious or deceitful, don\u2019t automatically assume that the student is misbehaving on purpose. This is too simplistic. It\u2019s not always about the student trying to aggravate you \u2013 it may not be about you at all. Sometimes won\u2019t is really can\u2019t.  And sometimes can\u2019t is really can\u2019t always.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/11/12/failing-to-cheat/", "title": "Failing to Cheat"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t15 November 2006", "body": "I\u2019ve been teaching for 13 years, and have run into just about every conceivable technical glitch imaginable. Consequently, I\u2019ve gotten picky over the years. I like machinery and environments that actually work!VISUALVideo projection problems generally fall within two categories: light intensity (lumens) and viewing angles. The projected image must be bright enough to compete with ambient room light, and must also not be compromised or blocked by either the angle of projection or the viewing angle of the audience.To be able to effectively compete with any other light in the room, a video projector needs to put out 2000 lumens. (Watch out for those pictures in advertising brochures with their nicely sharp, color-saturated false images, because they don\u2019t really reflect how the light reflects off the projection screen in real life.) It\u2019s a false economy to buy equipment that doesn\u2019t provide enough \u201cmuscle\u201d to adequately serve the people using it.When the image is from a projector that is bouncing the light off a screen (generally overhead transparency projectors, opaque projectors, slide projectors, filmstrip projectors and LCD projectors) there is a certain amount of loss of light intensity between the projector and the screen. There is also a lot of competition between the brightness of the image and the ambient amount of light in the room. Either we try to darken the room completely so the projection doesn\u2019t get all washed out, or we try to leave some lights on for other simultaneous activities. This is problematic for teachers who expect their students to be able to take notes while also being able to see the projected image. Residual lighting in the room must be arranged so it is not shining or reflecting onto the projection screen. Unfortunately, lighting controls are rarely designed to accommodate this situation, despite the fact that projectors are often used in classrooms, and have been in use for half a century!An alternative is an image from a projector that is mounted behind a translucent screen, or from a big monitor or plasma screen. In these cases, the projected image is emitting the light to the audience, so it\u2019s less washed-out. Note that with rear projection, there will also have to be equipment modifications because the image has to be vertically flipped, meaning reversed left and right, or else everything will be backwards. There are but a limited number of students that can read backwards text, although they would derive great pleasure at being able to demonstrate such a rare and obscure skill.Beware of using an ordinary television monitor, because any text (such as captions) on a standard 27\u201d television screen will not be legible beyond a certain distance! Actually, this problem applies to all screens; text that is 1 inch (about 2.5 cm) is only legible for maybe 30 feet (9 meters). Frankly, that\u2019s a bit difficult to read at that distance. Naturally, the larger the text is, the less text overall that can be put on a screen. And then, we have to be able to physically see all the text \u2026Unless you only work with preschool children who are sitting on the floor, projection screens need to be 5-6 feet off the ground, otherwise people\u2019s bodies will block the view of the bottom of the screen to those in the middle and back.Also, a ceiling-mounted projector should not be so low as to block the view of the top of the screen. It\u2019s not always that the projector itself hangs too low from the ceiling, but rather the screen is so low that the image is partially blocked by people or objects!In turn, the students should not sit more than 30-45\u00b0 from the centerline of the screen, or else their viewing is compromised due to blurring and distortion from viewing angle. Please don\u2019t try to squeeze two or three classrooms of children into one classroom, with the students crammed all the way to the walls. Go ahead and take everyone to the auditorium where there is a screen and seating more suitable to the program.When placing projectors on a floor cart, the projection size must match the required magnification size, as well as the projection screen size for the students in the back, and don\u2019t forget, the presence of the projector cart must not break fire codes for the student aisles. How do you do that? You make the aisles wider! Besides, you really don\u2019t want someone sitting right next to the projector, because the machinery noise will reduce their ability to hear the program.Overhead projectors can be problematic because if they are near the front for the teacher to change images or to write on them, then when the head is angled upwards to project high enough for the back of the audience there is often a \u201ckeystone\u201d effect. Keystoning is when the projected image is wider at the top than at the bottom, and this is problematic because the words become distorted and blurry and thus difficult to read.It\u2019s not enough to stand in the center aisle by the back row and look at a screen and say, \u201cOh yeah, I can see everything okay.\u201d Rather, sit in the back row at a corner, behind people and see if you can see all of the screen, and likewise can read the text without straining. Then sit in the front row at the other corner of the seating area and check to see if there is much text distortion from that position as well.AUDIOAudio projection problems often result not from the speaker\u2019s ability, but from background noise. We can refer to the simple Shannon-Weaver model of communication which describes the communication between people as the \u201csignal\u201d between the sender and receiver, and the background problems that interfere with that as the \u201cnoise\u201d.Background noise from HVAC systems (Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning), fluorescent lighting, and projection systems all figure into the noise-to-signal ratio. So do ordinary human sounds of paper shuffling, binder snapping, dropping things, pencil sharpening, pen scratching, crayon rumbling, people talking, muttering to themselves, whispering between each other, laughing, coughing, clearing their throats, eating, chewing gum, walking around, opening doors, their shoes squeaking, chairs scraping and so on. Then there\u2019s the exciting outdoor world, including playground equipment, cars with booming bass, or even a work crew putting on fresh roofing tar on the school building.The amount of background noise must be low enough that the signal (speech from the teacher and the other students) is intelligible without spending lots of mental energy straining to hear, decode, and process what is being said.An adult who is conversing in their native language about a familiar topic has the skills to \u201cfill in\u201d periodic blips in the intelligibility of the conversation if the talking is 6 dB louder than the background noises. (Explanations of dB and Hz and how they relate to human hearing are below.)However, children don\u2019t have that high level of practice. Students don\u2019t have the high level of background familiarity with the topics they are being instructed in (they are, after all, learning). People for whom English is not their first language don\u2019t have the ease of decoding. Students with ear infections, hearing impairments or auditory processing difficulties will likewise not be able to manage, or consistently manage, at that level. A deficit is not the only way to have a problem \u2013 a student with acute hearing may perceive a greater range and volume of background noise than others, and students with attention problems will also find the environment difficult due to all the distractions. They all will need a 25 dB difference between signal and noise.If people are having to strain to hear the words, they have less brainpower to devote to understanding the words, and less brainpower to devote to thinking about the concepts being discussed, and less brainpower to devote to remembering what is being discussed.When rooms have the HVAC fans located within the room (instead of elsewhere in the building), such as window air conditioning units or equipment set in cabinets underneath the windows, then those fans are adding extra background noise. In-room ventilation is cheaper, but \u201ccheaper\u201d in this case only reflects the builder\u2019s costs, not the cost to the people who are trying to use the room with varying levels of success.A teacher who is talking while facing away from the audience, such as when writing on a board, is going to be difficult to hear. Imagine being seated between a thrumming window air conditioner and an LCD projector with its accompanying computer, both of which are emitting high-pitch whines. The student behind you is chewing gum with their mouth open, and another scratching out notes. Meanwhile, the teacher has turned away and is wrestling with the projection screen and says:\u201cThe exam mumbleday is going to cover \u2013\u201c tug, ziiiip, tug, rattle, ziiip, tug, clunk \u201c\u2014and page fiftee-.\u201dWhen\u2019s the exam?  What and page fifteen?  Or was that something and page fifty; the two numbers sound very similar \u2026It\u2019s easy to dismiss the problem and say that students can simply ask for clarification. But neither the teachers nor the students (or even the rest of the classmates) will tolerate frequent requests for clarification. Many students are unwilling to \u201cbother\u201d the teacher, or don\u2019t want to attract attention to their selves. It\u2019s also not helpful to wait until the end of class, for a variety of reasons. There\u2019s the simple logistical problem that stopping to ask the teacher several questions makes it hard to get to the next class on time (then the student would be considered chronically tardy as well as inattentive). More importantly, it\u2019s hard to remember everything that was unclear, and much worse, the content of a class depends upon being able to understand things in a sequence \u2013 lose parts of that sequence, and the flow of concepts or the steps in a process fall apart.That teacher who is facing away from the students is also impossible to watch for those who actively (or unconsciously) lip-read. Although it is possible to equip the teacher with a microphone, this doesn\u2019t help the students to hear each other. Worse, most speakers are designed to amplify music, not human voices. The range of tones for speech is narrower than for music, the range of comfortable volume is narrower than for music, and in contrast, the level of clarity for understanding speech is greater than that for music. If the clarity is not there, then amplification will not help \u2013 louder garble is still garble.With the exceptions of students who need the more focused auditory input of an infrared system, or the echoic dynamics of a large lecture hall or auditorium, we don\u2019t need to amplify the speaker, or blame the student for not trying hard enough \u2013 we really need to quiet the background noise.* Explanations of dB and Hz and how they relate to human hearing:Loudness is measured in decibels (dB): a whisper is about 20 dB, and a loud concert is 80-120 dB. Sounds over 80 dB for a few hours\u2019 time can cause hearing loss, although the pain threshold is above that level, at 120-140 dB, so pain is not a good measure of danger to one\u2019s hearing.The tone or pitch of a sound is measured in Hertz (Hz; which is the number of sound waves per second): a low bass note is about 50 HzHuman hearing is tested in a couple of different parameters; the tone (pitch) and the loudness. The normal speech range for humans is 250 \u2013 1,000 Hz (Hertz). A tone of 250 Hz is a man\u2019s low-pitched voice, and 1,000 Hz is a woman\u2019s high-pitched voice. Good human hearing is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz ( = 20 kHz, 20 kilohertz).It\u2019s interesting to note that a regular hearing exam only tests within the 125 \u2013 8,000 Hz range, so a person can pass a hearing exam and still not have a full range of hearing up to 20 kHz. Normal hearing is considered to be in a range of 0 to just 20 dB of hearing loss. Mild hearing loss is 20-40 dB, moderate hearing loss is 40-60 dB, severe hearing loss is 60 to 80 dB, and profound hearing loss is 80 dB HL or more.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/11/15/classroom-audiovisual-spectacular-or-just-a-spectacle/", "title": "Classroom Audio/Visual: Spectacular or Just a\u00a0Spectacle?"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t12 November 2006 ", "body": "\u00a0Recess means we take a break and play. It\u2019s important to do that once in a while.DID YOU KNOW \u2026\nthat there\u2019s a German word for \u201cthat song stuck in your head\u201d?  Ohrwurm. Literally, an Ohrwurm is an earwig insect, and I have no idea how that bit of entomological etymology evolved. (Earwigs really don\u2019t crawl into people\u2019s ears, despite their names \u2013 they do happen to be beneficial predators of insect pests in greenhouses and orchards). I\u2019ll be polite and refrain from mentioning which songs get stuck in my head \u2013 they\u2019re usually the really obnoxious pop-music sort.An Ohrwurm could also be That Word Stuck In Your Head. A lot of us have run into this perseverative phenomenon. You don\u2019t have to be autistic or have OCD or Tourette\u2019s, although it helps.Repeating a word over and over is a called palilalia, which in an exquisite twist of cosmic irony, is a great word to repeat or play with as well: pali-lali-lali-lali-lalia! One of my favorite words to repeat over and over is \u201csmock\u201d. Say it several times quickly and it becomes quite silly sounding: smocksmocksmocksmocksmocksmocksmocksmock \u2026\nRepeating that word very many times also tends to turn your lips to limp rubber, so be careful.Smock is odd for being on my list. Usually the really good stim words have several syllables: Fescennine, balderdash, interlocutor, reticulated, knee breaches or isoflavinoid. I can play around with the syllable stresses on i-so-fla-vi-noid for a goodly number of blocks of rush-hour traffic driving. \u201cKnee breaches\u201d seems anomalous, but for reasons unknown odd clothing names will suction themselves to my consciousness. A couple of months ago, \u201cdickey\u201d was very sticky. (That\u2019s a false blouse front, an absurd article if ever there was one.) This spring past, \u201cgaloshes\u201d sloshed repeatedly around my cranium. The inside of my head can be a noisy place, tinnitus notwithstanding.Instead of, or addition to engaging an autistic stim, you could have a Tourette\u2019s phonic tic if you go blurting out some random word for no damn good reason at all. Although dramatically used in the media, it\u2019s actually rather rare for Touretters to have coprolalia, where one unintentionally says taboo or cuss words.  In real life, most of us really mean to when we say those words.Speaking of stimming, one really has to wonder about chanting mantras \u2026Lexilalia is when you repeat words aloud after reading them. I run into this with scientific terms and names, many of which have such wonderfully theatrical sounds, like arcane incantations. (Turn on your mental Roll-of-Thunder and Great-Echoing-Chamber sound effects here.) My favorites are:Cumulonimbus!Paradichlorobenzene!Chrysanthemum leucanthemum!Gosh, isn\u2019t that fun?The first is a cloud form, the second refers to a common ingredient in mothballs, and the latter is the garden daisy. Horticultural pedants will note that the taxonomists (bless their wicked hearts) have renamed the daisy as Leucanthemum superbum, which isn\u2019t quite as much fun, although I had a horticulture professor who instead of saying su-PER-bum pronounced the species as SUUP-er-bum.For a while I would burst into uncontrollable laughter at one of my daughter\u2019s Spanish vocabulary words, bufanda (boo-FAHN-da), which means \u201cscarf\u201d. My daughter then had a penchant for spontaneously hollering out the word just to watch me break into giggles. To her dismay and my relief I eventually became desensitised.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t22 November 2006 ", "body": "I was in my teens when my mother announced in a fit of supreme annoyance, \u201cYou know Andrea, all children rebel, but you\u2019re doing it all wrong!\u201dThis comment required some thinking on my part. Indeed, it rolled around in my head for hours as I tried in vain to make sense of it. Granted, I was continuing to have academic difficulties, but those did not stem from rebelliousness. What was I doing wrong? I didn\u2019t date (so no sex), didn\u2019t drink, didn\u2019t do drugs, didn\u2019t even have my driver\u2019s license to be engaging in reckless behavior, didn\u2019t ditch school (wasn\u2019t truant), and wasn\u2019t grossly disrespectful. If someone had created a list of the Six Dreadful D\u2019s that a teen could engage in, I would have been clear of the whole list.The \u201cdoing something all wrong\u201d part of itself wasn\u2019t the difficulty; that was a sadly familiar refrain. It was attaching \u201call children rebel\u201d to it. The words implied that there was a \u201cright\u201d way to rebel that I was failing to accomplish. But parents never wanted their children to rebel \u2026 what a double-bind! Oh, it made my head hurt. Finally by the next day I decided that her comment simply did not make sense. That would later prove to be the turning point of my tediously slow process of untangling an alarming number of double-binds that had for years tied my head up in knots.Part of the reason that I had trouble understanding the nonsensical nature of that remark was that my mother was not the only person from whom I\u2019d heard this refrain about \u201cdoing things the wrong way\u201d.I had inexplicably run into problems in art class (of all places surprisingly \u2013 this subject was normally a source of outstanding marks) because I wasn\u2019t following the directions for figure drawing. We were supposed to be drawing the person perched on a high stool by creating a series of connected ovoids for the torso, limbs, and appendages, and then connecting those ovals and smoothing them to create the figure. That didn\u2019t make much sense to me; it seemed like a lot of unnecessary work. I simply started at the top of the head and proceeded to draw the silhouette. Sometimes I would erase a small section to refine the line, but otherwise I would work my way around to the beginning point, and then filled in the interior details.My art teacher however, was a stickler for \u201cProcess, process, process!\u201d She had managed to get everyone successfully through single and double vanishing-point perspective by careful adherence to procedure, and she was determined to have all her students complete satisfactory still-life drawings of bottles, cow skulls, and humans by careful adherence to procedure. Initially we\u2019d started our still-life work with the typical assemblages of fruits-as-Platonic-solids, but this class was right before lunch and the props kept disappearing. The bottles proved to be adequate subjects for learning techniques, but the cow skulls proved daunting. The system of Platonic solids and ovoids proved to be no match for the murderous complexity created by the mandible and orbital cavities. I was able to draw a respectable cow skull only by virtue of the fact that I could visualize it as a two-dimensional image and then transfer that mental image to my paper, fait accompli. I have no idea if her distrust of my personal process was related to the fact that I wasn\u2019t complying with the given directions (and thus had succeeded in completing the assignment but left her with little to calculate in her grading rubric), or whether it was related to the fact that she had no idea how I could draw by finished silhouette. Even the token artistic genius of the class had to sketch and re-sketch lines repeatedly, for all her finished product was the most refined.Trouble was constantly simmering over in my maths class, and boiled over every nine weeks as progress reports were sent home. Whereas beginning algebra had been a minefield of flunked exams, geometry was taking a much different turn, and not always for the best. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t understand geometry with all its angles and parallel lines and intersections of compass-drawn circles. Indeed, it was the first time I had excelled in understanding anything mathematic. I could consistently answer the homework and exam questions correctly. I just couldn\u2019t consistently show the steps or name the proofs that described how I\u2019d reached those answers. As far as I was concerned, the exam requirements of List the proofs and Show your work were the bane of my life. Generally there weren\u2019t any steps to be had! The answers were obvious. So much so that I spent most of the class lecture time just doodling on the margins of my notepaper, creating recursive labyrinths, spiraling pursuit curves, or re-inventing Voronoi tessellations by marking the areas of influence around random blemishes in the paper.When my maths instructor had taken me aside one day after class to find out just how I was getting my answers (there were suspicions of cheating), I then stupefied him by announcing answers by glancing sideways at the problems. He was totally flummoxed when he found that I figured sums of several numbers by initially clumping complementary pairs of digits in each column into sets of ten before adding them up, rather than starting at the top of the column and consecutively adding each digit. I couldn\u2019t understand why my approach wasn\u2019t natural to everyone, because after all, we were using a base ten system. At least he was satisfied that I was producing the correct answers on my own, no matter what obscure method I used to produce them.When I sat and contemplated my place in the grand scheme of things, I found myself wondering just how it was that I could be \u201cdoing things the wrong way\u201d and yet still be producing the right results. Were the processes really as important as the results? Apparently so, for I was increasingly finding that style was as important as substance when I found myself in social situations. You weren\u2019t supposed to lie, you weren\u2019t supposed to sit there and not participate, and yet you weren\u2019t supposed to say what was really going on. Amazing how often one could be deemed rude for merely sharing facts or for being specific. I repeatedly found myself doing things the wrong way and thus going against what people were telling me to do. Maybe I was rebelling after all.It\u2019s just \u2026 that wasn\u2019t my intent at all.", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.ossafreelance.co.uk/Images/T30015cowskullthumbnail.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solids", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth", "http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20010714/mathtrek.asp", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_tesselation"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/11/22/doing-things-the-wrong-way/", "title": "Doing Things the Wrong\u00a0Way"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t18 November 2006 ", "body": "In an article from the Social Issues Research Centre (out of Oxford), Kate Fox describes in her article, \u201cEvolution, Alienation and Gossip\u201d the functional r\u00f4le of mobile phones for promoting community by aiding gossiping. Apparently my text messages are rather humdrum and atypical, as they relate mostly to grocery expeditions, dinner attendance, and doctor appointments rather than gossip.However, a particular paragraph caught my eye:\u201cGossip is the human equivalent of \u2018social grooming\u2019 among primates, which has been shown to stimulate production of endorphins, relieving stress and boosting the immune system. Two-thirds of all human conversation is gossip, because this \u2018vocal grooming\u2019 is essential to our social, psychological and physical well-being.\u201dGrooming-talking (\u201cphatic communion\u201d for the psycholinguistics word buffs out there) is the verbal equivalent of grooming other apes.Perhaps stimming fulfills many of the same functions, to \u201cstimulate production of endorphins, relieving stress and boosting the immune system\u201d?I realise the comparison sounds really odd. Instead of being a social kind of functioning, it is a typically autistic kind of functioning.  I mean, gossiping is a social activity of the highest sort. Rather than communicating in the sense of exchanging necessary data, it is passing along information as a means to promote peace and solidarity between people in the same \u201ctribe\u201d.In contrast, stimming is an emblem attribute, the very archetypical sign of the autistic. It is pretty much a self-involved activity; one might stim upon something they\u2019re seeing or hearing, but it\u2019s not a social interaction per se.Of course, nearly all people gossip to some extent, and nearly all people stim in some manner or another. People are people, whether autistic or neurotypical, and it would be erroneous to assert otherwise.Nor am I asserting that gossiping and stimming are dichotomous states. Rather, that they are two activities that despite being other- or inner-directed, fulfill much the same psychosomatic benefits.What is also interesting is that both gossiping and stimming are activities with negative connotations assigned to them. Fox brushes away some stereotypes by asserting that men gossip as much as women, about much the same subjects, and as often as women do (albeit more often with work colleagues). It\u2019s not that men don\u2019t gossip, but rather that they don\u2019t like to own up to it because it seems trivial.Fox says, \u201cWhatever its moral status, there is certainly some evidence to suggest that gossip is a deep-seated human instinct \u2026 This would indicate that gossip, far from being a trivial pastime, actually performs a vital and socially therapeutic function.\u201dStereotypical stimming activities like hand-flapping, rocking or finger-flicking have historically been actively discouraged and \u201ctrained out\u201d because people don\u2019t want to own up to the fact that they are or someone else is autistic. I am willing to bet that a lot of stimming actually still goes on under private cover, or has been translated into more socially-acceptable fidgets. It is too essential to the human condition to do what one can to reduce stress, one way or another. As a cautionary note, when people cannot use benign ways of dealing with stresses, they will sometimes end up using other stress-releasers that can sometimes be ultimately addictive or self-destructive.In would be very interesting to run physiological testing to measure some of the state changes in stress levels that occur before, during and after someone engages in a bout of stimming. If we find that these activities do indeed aid people in reducing stress, we may then have further proof that attempting to stop or limit these behaviours is literally harmful to autistics (and others).Just as people with Tourette\u2019s should be able to function in everyday life without having to spend great amounts of energy trying to suppress their tics in order to pass for normal, autistics should likewise be able to function in everyday life without having to spend great amounts of energy trying to suppress their stims. (Of course, I\u2019m not purporting that highly disruptive tics are going to be acceptable everywhere, nor that injurious stims are a good thing. Such blanket, extreme statements are merely strawman arguments.) As long as the tics or the stims are not going beyond someone else\u2019s personal boundaries, then they ought to be considered acceptable.Common, polite society needs to realise that not everyone moves, talks, interacts or waits in the same standardised manner. Spending enormous efforts to pretend that one is the same as everyone else does nothing to advocate for diversity and does nothing for one\u2019s health.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t24 November 2006", "body": "While washing dishes I started off thinking about the things I was thankful for (the usual census: family, health, good weather, employment and so on), and then by the drying stage my thoughts had wandered off (as they are wont to do), and I realised that I had some things that were more on the Relief side of the bookkeeping, such as \u201cI\u2019m so relieved that my life isn\u2019t full of bitter, angry, crazy-making people.\u201d  That wasn\u2019t a very cheerful sort of relief, because it meant that my life used to be.   There is also a sort of spiritual weariness that comes from being thankful for the bad things that aren\u2019t happening to you.Trying to figure out, \u201cHow does one get into those kinds of situations?\u201d isn\u2019t hard, because unfortunately, the world is chock-full of them.   The blogoshere is rife with weary stories about people\u2019s struggles.  But later on while soaking in the philosophical font that is the bathtub, I realised once again that so many of these struggles revolve around the same faulty premises.There is a pervasive myth of scarcity in our society.  I\u2019m not talking about physical resources, even though some of those truly are physically scarce, and many are actually badly shared.  Rather, I\u2019m talking about the myth of social scarcity.  The fabric of the story line has these warp threads running through it, and given how obnoxious they are, we might call them Warped Threads:There\u2019s not enough caring to go around \u2014 if you get what you need, then I can\u2019t get what I need.\nEveryone is being judged, and if I can \u201cprove\u201d that my problems are \u201cworse\u201d than yours, then I win and will get the caring I need, and you lose and won\u2019t get it.\nIf I don\u2019t get the caring I need, then I can\u2019t be held responsible for being upset, and acting out my frustrations by punishing others.\nIf I feel slighted because others won the contest, then I\u2019m justified in doing what I feel I \u201chave to\u201d to get substitute needs met.These lines are getting very childish sounding, aren\u2019t they?   And yet they form the foundation to a tremendous amount of infighting for resources or services, and blaming others for creating problems so they can be charged for restitution, and excusing abusive or murderous actions against innocent people.Wow.   There is in fact a deep level of social immaturity, selfishness, lack of empathy and pettiness to the whole scenario.  I would call this a cultural immaturity, but it is hardly limited to one culture.Indeed, these scenarios are widespread and are seen in every bureaucratic, legal, scholastic, and economic system.  At these broad levels of pervasiveness, we don\u2019t even notice the underlying errors so that they seem to be the natural order of things.Underlying all of them is the wholly artificial concept of scarcity:  There\u2019s not enough to go around \u2014 it\u2019s you or me.This perceived scarcity even extends to assisting others.  A strange virtue is sometimes seen in \u201cguarding\u201d the services-as-scarce-resources from people who would use them.You\u2019re not fit to judge what services you need, or whether or not you need the services.\nWe can\u2019t give you these services because other people need them.\nYou\u2019re not the worst off, so you don\u2019t need them badly enough to get them.\nYou\u2019re so badly off that you wouldn\u2019t be able to really make good use of them, so they would be wasted on you.\nYou\u2019re just being greedy, going around asking for services.\nIf you\u2019re not failing, you\u2019re obviously getting by okay.\nAnyone who fails like that is just being lazy or noncompliant.  We\u2019re not giving you any services until we can see you putting forth enough effort.(Bang head here.)But it doesn\u2019t do any good to whine and complain about how \u201cunfair\u201d things are, and how you \u201cdeserve\u201d better.   I\u2019m not saying that you don\u2019t deserve better, but rather that we all deserve better.  The sad fact is that the people who are doing these things also deserve better.  They perpetuate the problem because they don\u2019t recognise the causes of it, and because they lack the tools to build something else.Most importantly, we don\u2019t want to punish people for having problems.  This screwed-up social paradigm is certainly a great problem that besets us all.   Instead of antagonism, we need to help each other.  We need to quit staking out lines between Us and Them.  We need to help by teaching each other how we can help each other.  After all, the reason that humans are social animals is because we can work together to create solutions for problems that we cannot solve as individuals.  We are all dependent upon each other for a multitude of things.We don\u2019t need better ways of \u201cbeating\u201d the system, because we are all part of the system, and the beatings must stop.   (They haven\u2019t improved morale yet.)  What we need are ways of overhauling the system by sidestepping these terrible games and introducing different ways of working together.\u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.

Not that I had really expected to find all of those books, but not that the gift certificate was that big anyway.After pausing to check out all the spiffy bookmarks (\u201cOoh, shiny!\u201d) I wandered over to the rack between sociology and history.\u201cWomen\u2019s studies, Men\u2019s studies,\u201d (small section, that) \u201cGay/Lesbian studies, African-American studies, Latino studies, Hawaiian Islander studies,\u201d (wow, we\u2019re no where near the Pacific) \u201cNative American studies \u2026 History of Ancient Egypt.\u201dWait a minute, missed it.  Given my profound ability to be \u201cnose-blind\u201d and miss seeing something right under my nose, I back-tracked and started over.  Nope. Okay, maybe the books I\u2019m looking for are filed under some other category.  Just because something makes sense to me doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true \u2013 after all, the grocery keeps the baked beans by the tins of luncheon meat rather than with the tins of vegetables where I would expect to find them \u2026After duly waiting in the Information queue, I hand my list to the clerk who patiently pecks the names through the store\u2019s search engine.  By the time she has reached the end of my list, she is frowning in sympathetic frustration, and informs me that they only have one of the books, which has to be ordered from some distant warehouse.  I politely decline, realizing that instant gratification is simply not going to be had, and decide to do my own search-engine pecking with the county library system.What I found odd was not that they did not have the particular books for which I was searching \u2013 I tend to read offbeat stuff, not the latest poolside romance.  Rather, what I found odd was that there were not any books on disability studies to be had at all.  The section simply did not exist anywhere in the store, not between sociology and history like the other group-studies, not in the psychology or the special education or the history sections.You want to hear some interesting numbers?In the United Kingdom there are 9.8 million people with some sort of disability, about 1 in 7.\nIn Canada there are 3.6 million people with some sort of disability, about 1 in 8.\nIn the United States there are 49.7 million people with some sort of disability, about 1 in 5.\n(As with any epidemiological information, census definitions may differ slightly.)Either way, that\u2019s a LOT of people; the largest minority within most populations.  So how the hell do people go about referring to \u201cthem\u201d like they\u2019re rara avis, some minor, marginal sector of sub-humanity?  Everyone must know several people with disabilities, whether they realise it or not.So why are disabled people so invisible and neglected by history?  The answers are complex.  Part of this is due to the fact that the largest minority is also the most diverse: disabled people include babies, the elderly, people with sensory differences such as the Deaf or blind, people with learning disabilities, people with cognitive processing differences such as autistics or the faceblind, people with developmental or acquired physical differences such as cerebral palsy, people with chronic health problems \u2026  Some disabilities are highly visible, and many are invisible.Another part of the issue is that disability is something feared, shunned, and to be avoided.  It is seen as abnormal, defective, deviant and pathological.  Disabled people until very recently were shut away in institutions (and often still are), were not schooled (and often still are not) or were segregated in separate schools (and often still are), and no matter what the disability were seen as imbeciles and therefore not deserving or needing status as full citizens capable of making their own decisions (and often still are).  The disabled are considered only as, and are seen only as patients and clients.  They weren\u2019t people to be considered as a positive and common group, or a social force.But just as one can now find histories and university programs and shelves of books about Women\u2019s Studies, and find histories and university programs and shelves of books about Gay & Lesbian Studies, we can now find find histories and university programs and \u2013\u2013 well, histories and a few university programs about Disability Studies.I\u2019m going to buy myself another bookcase.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t2 December 2006 ", "body": "No one likes rush hour traffic.  But the reason it exists is because thousands of people feel that they have to take the same road at the same time.  Then they get upset because they can\u2019t all do it fast.Rush hour traffic is highly over-rated.  So are developmental time-tables.One of the important points is that a lot of the \u201cdevelopmental disorder\u201d end of things is developmental slowness or unevenness \u2013 it takes longer to get certain skills, and they may not necessarily be reached in the same manner as most. Comparing a child with such to the standard developmental timetables may only serve to increase stress at the seeming brokenness.So many schools are trying to fast-foward children, expecting kindergarten social, cognitive and physical skills from preschoolers, and gradeschool social, cognitive and physical skills from kindergarteners.Children between the ages of 2 and 6 are integrating a humongous amount of information in a variety of spheres, including receptive and expressive language, physical skills ranging from gross and fine motor to bodily functions, single-interpersonal skills, group interpersonal skills, acquiring subject knowledge in concrete things in their lives, cause-and-effect stuff, abstract stuff like numbers and reading and time (seasons, special events etc), and a bunch of other stuff that\u2019s not even coming to mind right now.Then we throw in things like developmental variability in sensory realms and proprioception and language processing and \u2026I couldn\u2019t tie my shoes until I was in 3rd grade. Bike riding was even later. I didn\u2019t know all of my multiplication tables until 8th grade. I required speech therapy in primary school, and that was back in the 60\u2019s when most kids didn\u2019t get anything.Sometimes I think that too many people turn all these developmental timetables into bare minimums, when in fact they are simply averages, which means that some kids do things sooner, and some kids do things later. Given how uneven our kids are, they think that everything should be as advanced as our kids\u2019 best skills. They also spend too much time evaluating how well children participate in herds, when in fact most toddlers and preschoolers really aren\u2019t so much herd animals yet.School is not about racing to the finish. Nor is it about everyone taking the same path to get there. Despite what people say.But people get Terribly Concerned because their children are not learning things at the proscribed rates.  They become afraid that their children won\u2019t learn at all, that somehow they will be \u201cstuck\u201d at whatever stage they are in.  So there are children who spend 40 hours a week in a variety of programs for speech, for movement, for scholastic tutoring, for mimicking social interaction \u2026Once upon a time, long ago in a galaxy far, far away \u2026 we didn\u2019t have all these \u201cprograms\u201d for things. Which is not to say that some kinds of programs might not have been helpful. It would have made 40+ years easier if people had known about my considerable Auditory Processing Disorder difficulties, instead of saying I \u201cwasn\u2019t paying attention\u201d or was lazy or whatever.But people get Terribly Concerned that their child \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to play\u201d. This boggles the mind \u2013 how can a child \u201cnot know how to play\u201d?  But what people are really meaning is that their child is not playing the way they expect them to, i.e., not the \u201cright way\u201d.  It\u2019s pretty sad when children are graded on whether or not they play correctly.  Play is a personal exploration of the world, for one\u2019s own learning and delight.One of the things commonly ascribed to autism is a \u201clack of imagination\u201d, because autistic children don\u2019t always play with the same toys that neurotypical children do, or don\u2019t engage in make-believe games the same way that neurotypical children do.  This is really ironic, because Hans Asperger himself said, \u201cIt seems that for success in science and art, a dash of autism is essential.\u201d  Hmn \u2026 And indeed, you\u2019ll find autistic people in most every sphere of endeavour.If the child doesn\u2019t show an interest in typical toys, then they are simply not interested in them. Let them be available \u2014 they may later, or they may end up using them in different ways than other children. (Toy cars are for lining up, right? <grin>) It may be also that other things not generally considered to be toys will be more interesting to them.For example most kids of all sorts find a manual eggbeater to be fascinating. But an eggbeater is not considered to be a \u201ctoy\u201d. Nor is graph paper or a weight scale or a Latin dictionary or an Army Corps of Engineers building manual for national parks structures, although I found all of these fascinating as a child. I still do, and they gave me background useful for my degree in horticulture \u2014 you never know how those particular fascinations can be useful.You may not see the same style of role-playing activities as more socially-oriented children engage in. Those are called \u201cimaginative\u201d play, and many people assume that a lack of engaging in them is a lack of imagination. Rather, it\u2019s a lack of role-playing, and imagination can take many other forms. I played with dollhouses \u2014 but spent hours arranging the furniture, not acting out stories with the dolls themselves. To this day I can remember what the furniture looked like, but not the dolls that were supposed to go with it. I have a superlative mental \u201cCAD\u201d type program in my head for arranging and manipulating elements in space, and if I tell my husband that the sofa is six inches longer than the wall, by gum it is six inches longer than the wall. I can re-arrange stuff and pack more into a dishwasher or suitcase or packing box than anyone else.Let your children have time to explore their worlds by giving them a wide range of experiences, and letting him take those in, in their own manner. Give them what they need by way of therapies to help him deal with things that make their lives difficult, but please, don\u2019t fill their days with them.  Children do develop, and some of them do so on different time tables.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/12/02/rush-hour-traffic/", "title": "Rush Hour Traffic"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t26 November 2006 ", "body": "Much of the pain we find in situations is what we bring from our own suffering, and we keep re-projecting that suffering into the situations.  We carry with us the compilations of confusions like luggage, and masses of delusion like garb that fill the luggage.  These weigh us down and weary us.  Yet we are convinced that we must have some luggage, and that the luggage we have is supposed to be good luggage, or luggage that we are supposed to improve or trade for better luggage.  We feel \u201ceternally cheated\u201d because we aren\u2019t carrying the kind of luggage that we thought we wanted, or that were told was the best kind of luggage.  But the luggage and everything in it is the actual problem, not the kind of confusion-suitcases we have, nor the kind of delusion-garb in the suitcases.The reason we are dragging all this luggage is because it is meant to distract from our own power.  Surprisingly, because autistics and other people who are atypical already work outside the social paradigms, they have a certain access to power.  It is for this that there is so much fear of the differences \u2013 the ability to see the artificiality of the social norms and to work outside of the normalizing influences.  But as long as we are unaware of this, we will be stuck where we are.~//~\u201cWhen I dare to be powerful \u2013 to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important, whether I am afraid.\u201d\n~ Audre Lorde\u201cPower\u201d has many meanings.  I consider power to be ability, strength, and creativity.  Power as ability allows you to do things to take care of your needs (or the needs of those whom you are responsible for, such as children).  Power is also strength, not in the sense of force, but as potential and endurance.  The potential comes from the ability to avoid being \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d existing ideas (and expending great energy either way), but from simply stepping outside them and transforming energy.  Companion to (but not opposite to) strength is gentleness, an acceptance of energy.  Creativity is the experience of personal power when forming or transforming new understandings/ visions/ feelings, and often shaping those into a transmissible or translatable form to share and change others\u2019 experiences. Personal power comes from the eternal change of the person.  Like love, power is inexhaustible.  Power can be shared, rather than just given/taken.Power is an understanding that every organism must by necessity, be self-centered and care for itself, without the assignment of value judgements that self-care is \u201cselfishness\u201d.  One must self-care before being able to care for others, literally or in the positive emotional sense. \u201cPoverty\u201d results from powerlessness, when you (for whatever reason) do not have the options in life that allow you to meet your needs.Popular conceptions of power (such as one finds in dictionaries or history stories) include an authority (in the sense of both the judging-deciding and the expert-wisdom source), that is able to control-command what others do, and is able to control-command what others can have, by influence and/or force.  Power is often considered to be a \u201cright\u201d, meaning the accepted covenant that gives collective individuals powers to a person or position.  The word \u201cright\u201d in itself has a messy complexitude of meanings, including privilege, propriety, and correctness.You can see there is an essential difference here.  The popular conception of power usually include assumptions about top-down regulation as an inherent, unavoidable, required and necessary form of power, with the assumptions about the inevitability of that process, the necessity of power-by-a-few, and the inherent correctness of that situation. Power is seen as an inevitable form of giving and taking, with inherent weakness on the part of the individuals.  It assumes that there is a scarcity of power, and that everyone selfishly competes for power.  Political systems are officially designed to structure those interactions, and implicitly to maintain a status quo of the power paradigms.  Government and education (and education about what government \u201cis\u201d) are not the only sources of power regulation; there are also strong nets of inter-related cultural memes that actively work to enforce the status quo.This concept of power seeks to prevent change; it wants things to \u201cbe\u201d a certain way, and thus like a bridge trestle in the middle of a river, is always working against the flow.  It takes great energy to work at resisting change, and that energy is drawn from the multitudes of individuals.  They must be convinced to give away part of their own power to this futile effort.Within that conceptual framework, personal power is seen as personal ability (usually requiring competency that is assigned by authority) and strength (force of will or body \u2013 an ability to resist something).  Personal power is rarely understood as ability from the ease of self-authority, strength from potential and endurance, and the experiential transformation of creation. Therefore, most people are quite unaware of the powers that they naturally have.  Many of the power paradigms work to maintain that lack of awareness, by limiting people\u2019s understandings of how power works, and by meting out the \u201cpunishment of reward\u201d to those who are willing to (or unwittingly) perpetuate more of the same system.Power can only be given, not taken.  Many people do not realize that they have any inherent power or that they can create power.  Instead, they are taught to think rather that power is given to them.  (Two-year old children are an exception; because they are still in the process of being \u201csocialized\u201d, they are fully aware of their own power when they demonstrate that well-known response, \u201cNO!\u201d)The transfer or giving up of power requires that one accepts or believes that others\u2019 purposes/ goals/ methods are more important that one\u2019s own.   Doing this diminishes and defers one\u2019s own needs (our needs are \u201cselfish\u201d), and also devalues or denies one\u2019s own sense of wisdom that is one\u2019s perceptual forms and understandings of the world.  Institutions of many sorts teach these assumptions to guarantee their own persistence.When we ignore these givens, we become agents in the system that are untouched by the cultural covenants.  When we express our abilities that rise from ease of self-authority, we create puddles of null-effect in the power paradigms. The \u201caberrant\u201d individuals fail to comply by deferring their time and efforts to \u201cselfish\u201d works, instead giving their energy to others.Focus is a power, and one that is rarely considered as such.  Focus is the ability to maintain the strength of one\u2019s drive. Part of the power of strength is endurance, the ability to follow the unique concepts by perseverating upon them.  Many autistics naturally do this, and a system that seeks to Normalise everything is therefore threatened.  This is because focus creates \u201chot spots\u201d of power in a system that seeks homeostasis by minimising the power apportionment to individuals.Disregard for Normalising influences (e.g., peer pressure) is a power.  The power game only works if we play it; \u2018nuf said.  Those who recognize their personal power ignore the requirements for requesting recognition of expertise.  They follow their own strengths and wisdom.  Indeed, what else can a person really do?  How one perceives and understands the world is unique.The person whose perceptions and interactions with the world are skewed from the norm will never be able to completely fit within the accepted parameters.  We have seen that trying to fit into some of those required perceptions repeatedly ends in failures, and censure.  Trying instead to assert our different perceptions can result in others\u2019 denial that things could possibly that way, or results in others\u2019 assertions that these things are done \u201cwrong\u201d. Being expected to \u201cknow\u201d what is correct and then demonstrating that in social interactions, without necessarily having the ability to discern those messages or those rules is the illogical \u201ccatch-22\u201d that makes us insane or depressed.Wisdom is impossible to gain if so much energy is expended trying to reconcile what we know intuitively to be true from our perceptions of the world, with what others (stuck in their dichotomous view of the universe) insist is the only correct understanding.  Instead, we regain personal power when we can realize that we need neither accept nor deny these social constructs, but rather to ignore them and instead work with our personal strengths.  Strength creates potential, the ability to not be constrained by customary thought.This is not to say that we cannot suffer consequences from refusal to play the social games.  This is due to the fact that a variety of people will be made very uncomfortable by those who \u201cought\u201d to know what the rules are, but don\u2019t follow them.  They try to \u201cfix\u201d those who disregard this paradigm, for a variety of reasons.  A variety of reasons are assigned to all this fixing: helpful, caring, altruistic, or corrective (sometimes punitively so).  But frequently those care-giving reasons are nothing more than covert expressions of the need to maintain the power paradigm.Bullies do not work within the power system(s), but with it; they recognize how it really works, and how manipulate it to their own ends.  Those who are outside the power system but do not realize it, are then targets for bullies because the bullies can often make the rules selectively work for them.  Those who are outside the power system and DO realize it confuse the hell out of bullies, sometimes resulting in the antagonistic fear-from-ignorance reaction.  The problem of course is that many autistics are in the former, rather than the latter group.~//~Once we quit dragging around this luggage and everything in it, we can finally stand aright and see the joy that is the real world.  But when we\u2019re dragging luggage, all we can see is a world that is an endless luggage-carousel of pain.We have neither succeeded because of the system, nor despite it.  When we have succeeded, it is because we have found ways by learning paths that worked for each of us. How can we help others until we can find our own healing?  This is not a problem, but an opportunity.Our strengths are our assets.\nUsed properly, our weaknesses are our assets as well.Too many people assume that to have any power, they have to have the ability to force others to do what they want to do.  This is a grossly distorted vision, and one that is perpetuated by the system that relies on keeping people ignorant about their own generative and co\u00f6perative powers by convincing them that force is the only system.In truth, divisiveness and scarcity and differences are artificial constructs meant to confuse the issues.  People who continue to believe in such are letting themselves be kept \u201cin their place\u201d.  It is when we realise our abilities and commonalities, and can show others that they share those as well, that we are able to do what we need to do to help each other.\u201cIf you think you are too small to be effective, you have never been in bed with a mosquito.\u201d   ~Betty Reese", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/11/26/our-hidden-power/", "title": "Our Hidden Power"},

You\u2019d better stop it right now or else!\u201dIf I had a dollar for every time my mother had told me, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to do that,\u201d I could buy a plane ticket to Helsinki.  Mind you, she never asked why I wanted to do whatever the particular \u201cthat\u201d was at the time.  If it wasn\u2019t important to her, then it wasn\u2019t important at all.  (This is so selfish and one-sided it slides into the realm of the pathological.)All behaviour provides some kind of communicated message.  The onus of burden on communication does not belong to either the autistic or to the people interacting with them.  Rather, it belongs to both.  Communication is a result.  It takes two to tango, sender and receiver each way.  Communication can happen in many ways.  But unless both parties can find a way to share the message, and are willing to try, it won\u2019t happen.To make communication happen, we must be able to think outside of the usual verbal box.  We have to really observe what is going on, and figure out why someone is doing what they are doing.  A lot of people seem to have difficulty understanding the concept of cause and effect \u2013 they want to react to the effects, rather than figuring out the causes.  It\u2019s easier that way, I suppose; it doesn\u2019t require any thinking.Let me tell you a garden story as an analogy.  In entomology we have a concept called the \u201cpesticide treadmill,\u201d where people find it easier to either spray pesticides on a calendar basis, rather than assessing the actual need for such and what is causing problems, or they wait until problems reach catastrophic levels and then spray.  Both of these approaches are both a waste of time and money.  Regularly scheduled \u201ccalendar spraying\u201d increases pollution, and only pushes for greater pesticide resistance in the pest populations.  Not surprisingly, waiting until the pest population blows out of proportion does not yield effective results either, either in terms of pest control or in benefit to the crop.Sometimes people go around spraying insecticides on their plants, when what they really have is a fungus problem, or a nutrient problem, or an insufficiency of light.  Amazingly, the insecticide doesn\u2019t solve the problem!  So, they keep on spraying \u2026 why?  Because the first dose didn\u2019t work.  So they think they need more doses, and it should work if you keep giving enough doses.  Hmn\u2026In much the same manner, some people want to do the equivalent thing with their clients or family members \u2014 treat symptoms with treatments, instead of figuring out what is causing the problem.  Give them tranquilisers, or neuroleptics, or megadoses of vitamins, or chelation, whatever \u2014 some \u201ctreatments\u201d are far worse than others, but it\u2019s still trying to treat the symptoms rather than figuring out what is causing difficulty.  (Amazingly, more doses don\u2019t solve the problem!)Or indeed, sometimes it\u2019s easier to give \u201ctreatments\u201d than to determine if there truly is a difficulty \u2013 not all different behaviours are problem behaviours.\u201cHelp!\u201d says a gardening class student, \u201cmy plant has yellow leaves!  What\u2019s wrong with it?  Does it have bugs?  Should I give it some Miracle Grower drops?\u201d\n\u201cUm, ma\u2019am, this is a variegated ginger.  It has green and gold leaves.  That\u2019s the way it grows.  It\u2019s okay \u2013 it\u2019s supposed to be like that.\u201d  Student looks dubious.  \u201cYour plant is just fine.  Really.  Enjoy it.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with it \u2013 it\u2019s naturally variegated from its genes, and that\u2019s what makes it different.\u201d\nStudent still looks dubious, and says, \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2026 it looks sick to me.  It\u2019s just too weird \u2013 I want my plants to all look nice and green.\u201d\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, then take it to the office, or to church, or whatever.  There are plenty of people who love special plants like this.\u201dBut it takes extra time and effort to observe, monitor, and assess your plants for pest problems.  A good IPM (Integrated Pest Management) program will save money in both reduced applications of pesticides, and increased value of your plants.  But all this takes learning, observing, and thinking.  Likewise, it takes learning, observing, and thinking to analyse the functional cause and effect of various behaviours.Too often the child (or even adult) is perceived as being a problem, rather than as having a problem.  Instead of figuring out what is causing the problem, the reaction is focused upon the effect that is the child\u2019s behaviour.  This has to be stopped right now; the child is being bad, children should not talk back, and children should not win arguments!   (There\u2019s a recipe for disaster; simply give orders without listening to others and taking their concerns seriously.)Punishing the child for misbehaving should stop the behaviour, right?  Possibly.  Unless the child perceives that the punishment (such as an out-of-school suspension) is better than the problem that is distressing them (being bullied).  Punishment can sometimes stop a behaviour (depending upon what\u2019s going on), but it doesn\u2019t often change the behaviour because it does not teach a person what to do instead.  As long as the behaviour gains something for the person, it won\u2019t go away.  That \u201csomething\u201d doesn\u2019t always have to be an optimal result, merely a less-bad result.  In other words, the behaviour serves some kind of function.  When we\u2019re untangling the problem, determining what that function is will be very important, because that\u2019s the key to figuring out what is needed in the way of determining the true problem and a better solution.\u00a0\u00a0", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/11/29/its-not-easy-being-variegated/", "title": "It\u2019s Not Easy Being\u00a0Variegated"},

It\u2019s quite the ADHD ramble, pulling together all sorts of odd bits and bobs and things that tickled my brain this morning.  After this I\u2019ll return you to the regularly-scheduled blog posts.~~//~~Did you know that honeybees can learn to identify pictures of human faces?  Some researchers, Adrian G. Dyer, Christa Neumeyer, and Lars Chittka, were able to train honeybees to cue to photographs of specific people as sources for nectar rewards.For someone who has studied insect behavior and who has prosopagnosia (face-blindness, or the inability to recognise people just from facial features), this is fascinating. The bees could learn with better than 80% accuracy, which is more than I can do (described here). That is rather humbling.  Of course, we might point out that the bees were only learning to cue to repeated flat pictures \u2013 in real life, humans are trying to cue to moving humans seen from a variety of perspectives.  ::sigh::There\u2019s not tons of research done on insect cognition, unlike cognition in large mammals including elephants, chimpanzees and dolphins.  Smear a bit of paint on one of those mammals, show them their reflection in a mirror, and the critter will stop, look, and then use their reflection to inspect their bodies, including touching the paint if they can reach it (as Larry Niven has pointed out in his science fiction stories, dolphins are notoriously handicapped by having short limbs \u2013 which similar problem Mat Fraser has humorously described in Ouch! podcasts; we all have issues).I understand that when I look in a mirror and see a face, that it\u2019s probably my face. But if cues like hair and glasses are removed from photos, I probably could not pick out my own face from a set of photos of other humans.  In fact, I have been known to catch sight of myself in an unexpected mirror (such as wall tiles at a mall) and have not recognised that I was indeed seeing myself \u2013 I thought that someone was wearing clothes similar to mine.  I am however, self-aware, although you may have to take my assertion of that as proof that I am aware of both the concept of self-awareness and of my own identity. (grin)Bees probably aren\u2019t self-aware, but if they were, it would not be self-awareness of the same scale as that of a mammal \u2013 even thought they can learn and can communicate, the brains of bees just aren\u2019t that complex, and are mostly devoted to sensory processing.  They are very tiny animals after all.So here we have these self-aware animals: Mat Fraser, elephants et al.  Then over on another part of the planet we have Deepak Chopra, who is also a self-aware animal, but seems to be in over his head, cognitively speaking:\u201cThe entire universe is experienced only through consciousness, and even though consciousness is invisible and non-material, it\u2019s the elephant in the room so far as evolutionary theory is concerned.\u201dBoy howdy.  Chopra, in his masses of abstruse nonsensical verbiage, is anti-evolutionary and asserting that only metaphysical explanations could bring about the universe.  I\u2019d hate to be the one to break it to him (the ensuing argument would likely be so absurd that I\u2019d want to again take up banging my head on the wall in frustration) but the universe is NOT \u201cexperienced only through consciousness\u201d.Animals, whether or not they are self-aware, are all conscious of their individual Umwelts, or subjective sensory worlds.  So too are plants, which respond to sensory inputs of light, gravity, and touch-pressure, but plants are not conscious organisms \u2013 they do not really respond to music etc. Plants experience the universe, but not through consciousness.  Chopra\u2019s figurative elephant needs to give him a good whack with an evolutionary biology textbook.If you want something of which to be aware, then don\u2019t believe everything you read, even if there are lots of important-sounding buzzwords.Meanwhile, if you\u2019re looking for some evolution humor that\u2019s better written than Chopra, check out this satirical piece at the Onion: \u201cKansas Outlaws Practice Of Evolution\u201d", "outgoing_links": ["http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/208/24/4709", "http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/061030_elephant_mirror.html", "http://www.releasechimps.org/chimpanzees/our-primate-family/", "http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0002433B-A643-1C5E-B882809EC588ED9F", "http://www.amazon.com/Three-Books-Known-Space-Larry/dp/0345404483/sr=8-2/qid=1165072408/ref=sr_1_2/102-2756417-6345768?ie=UTF8&s=books", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/podcast/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/the-god-delusion-part-6_b_35339.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt", "www.puyallup.wsu.edu/~Linda%20Chalker-Scott/Horticultural%20Myths_files/Myths/Bad%20science.pdf", "http://www.theonion.com/content/node/55807"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/12/02/things-of-which-to-be-aware/", "title": "Things Of Which To Be\u00a0Aware"},

We were stopped for a lunch break during our eleven-hour drive back from holidays.  I don\u2019t remember what I was talking about, but it likely involved far more vocabulary exhibition and details than anyone else felt was warranted.Daughter said to her brother, \u201cDon\u2019t you think Mom is being overly pedantic?\u201dI am otherwise occupied with my salad and asked, \u201cHow could someone be underly pedantic?\u201dDaughter rolled her eyes and added to her brother, \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d~//~While I was still at university, hubby and son came to visit me overnight at my campus apartment.

Opened up the clothes dryer and find two towels, a pair of boy\u2019s boxers, a tee shirt, and a pair of socks.  Obviously not a full load.  Mental gears turn, and I hollered over the foyer railing to my son in the office/computer area, \u201cHey!\u201d\u201cYah?\u201d\u201cAre you washing your clothes and then just pulling out the pieces as you need them?\u201d\u201cYeah.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t7 December 2006", "body": "Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I\u2019ve actually had good results with most of the professionals whom I have seen.  It would be rather a fallacy to broadwash a whole bunch of specialists on account of a few fools.  But boy, when you run into an fool, it\u2019s usually a doozy!It\u2019s been a long few years getting various difficulties sorted out and identified.  Over a year ago I saw someone who was touted at being an expert on learning disabilities, to investigate ongoing scholastic difficulties and possible auditory processing difficulties.Well, I saw Dr S. (a PhD, not physician) when I was otherwise free from the bulk of my work and school activities, as at the time I\u2019d been having a number of health problems, including insomnia, migraines, worse tics and stuttering, hyperacusis & tinnitus et cetera.I brought in with me documentation including previous test results, transcripts, and descriptions of my difficulties.  This was because I can often get tangled up and forget stuff when trying to explain things, especially to doctors.  (Hey, I\u2019m an organism capable of learning \u2014 over time I\u2019ve realised that remembering stuff is a problem, so now I take in a list or hand over a page of notes. My new primary physician does great with this, because in the couple of minutes it takes her to read a few paragraphs, we can fast-forward through a lot of rote questions, without omissions.)Dr S. had me fill out a couple of online tests, and then had someone else administer some more tests to me.  Oddly, one of the tests he gave me was for ADHD, for which a co\u00f6perating team of a psychologist and psychiatrist had already evaluated me.  In fact, he said I had no ADHD and no real problems, except a little figure-ground discrimination hearing things in noisy environments.  He had no recommendations, except that I needed to see a psychiatrist for psychosomative disorder.Well, hell.  Was I bordering on depression?  Yes, and I knew that and was working actively against that \u2014 half a year of chronic sleep-deprivation and pain will do that to a person.  Was I having difficulties with my husband?  Yes, my health problems were requiring me to take a semester off school and work, and he was wanting to know \u201cwhen I was going to be a productive member of society\u201d.  I already knew about these things, and had explained to Dr S. that I was working to deal with them.  But that wasn\u2019t why I was seeing Dr S. \u2014 I was trying to address learning and hearing comprehension problems.  I even paid a few hundred dollars out of pocket for all that.There\u2019s a big problem here, and it\u2019s not mine.  Nor am I the only one with it.The word \u201cpsychosomatic\u201d has gotten warped or twisted.  It literally acknowledges the interdependency and functionality of brain/mind and body, but now has come to mean that problems are \u201call in your head\u201d, as in imaginary and/ or self-inflicted.They used to call women \u201chysterical\u201d and thought it due to having a uterus that \u201cwandered around the body\u201d.  Holy cows.  Obviously I\u2019m not hysterical.  (Hell, I don\u2019t even have my uterus or ovaries any more, due to cysts and endometriosis.)   So now they say that women who have problems have \u201cpsychosomative disorders\u201d.The issues with my husband were not seen as his difficulties in accepting my disabilities, but as evidence of my mental disorder.The near-depression I was facing was not from months of chronic insomnia and pain, but rather caused by my mental illness.The documentation I had brought with me to aid the man in his understanding of my problems was not data, but symptoms of my mental illness.I was seen as \u201cattention-seeking\u201d rather than as solution-seeking.Shit like that can drive a person nutz.The good news from all that was that I got a referral to a CAPD specialist who said that Yes, I definitely do have such problems, and could even recommend some concrete ways of dealing with the problem and gave me documentation for such.   But it makes me wonder, if Dr S. couldn\u2019t really diagnose such, why did he put me through tests for APD, and tests I didn\u2019t need for ADHD?Has it ever occurred to clinicians that many of their clients don\u2019t exhibit stress symptoms due to having psychosomative disorders, but rather than having various (unacknowledged) disabilities will make a person stressed?It\u2019s all ass-backwards.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t14 December 2006", "body": "One of the \u201csoft signs\u201d for identifying autistics is the predilection for lining things up.  Like anything else, this isn\u2019t an exclusive activity, but rather something that is done in more pronounced frequency than the average population.  Meaning, it\u2019s not that neurotypical people don\u2019t line things up, but rather, don\u2019t do so with such intensity or such relish.  What\u2019s the big deal (the fascination) with lining things up, anyway?  Why line things up?There are a variety of inter-related reasons.  For one, it makes it easier to find things without the \u201cmental speedbumps\u201d so I don\u2019t get distracted and forget what I was doing in an ADHD moment.  When pulling out four spice jars from the fifty others lined up on the pantry door racks I don\u2019t even have to read the labels, just because the alphabetisation helps maintain the intrinsic order:  cardamom is between caraway seed and cayenne pepper.  This is good because quite a few of my (recycled) jars don\u2019t even have labels.Lining things up gives the hands something to do that isn\u2019t mentally demanding, so the brain is free to relax and think about other stuff (some people describe knitting as being like that). This is like walking a labyrinth or meditating in its focused, relaxing qualities. Think of it as meditation for the ADHD person who can\u2019t sit still!Lining things up is not unlike ironing out wrinkles; the symmetry gets rid of the unevenness in the universe and gives one a happy, settled feeling. Objects seem relaxed and more likely to stay where they belong when they are comfortable \u2013 they won\u2019t unfathomably \u201cdisappear\u201d from where they were last left!  All is right in the world because they are where they are supposed to be, like when jigsaw pieces are fitted together. There\u2019s a happy \u201czip\u201d feeling from running the fingers along the picket-fence effect of objects in a perfect row.  Lining things up makes the world less of a jumble \u2013 there\u2019s a visual appeal to the evenness.It can also be fun to manipulate the patterns and constantly be creating new ones, this being a process-oriented task rather than a results-oriented task because it\u2019s the doing that is pleasing, rather than the finished product.When I had more room (in another house), I lined up cans and boxes in the pantry, creating neat files of canned fruits and different tomato sauces that made preparing grocery lists easier. I got particular satisfaction pegging diapers on the clothes line in neat arrays, and also hanging up the clothes to dry with all the shirts in rainbow order. I\u2019m constantly fixing the alignment of the houses on the Monopoly board, or facing and centering the chess pieces. If I pause in front of a library bookshelf for more than a minute, I leave behind me a section of books lined up along the shelf edge. (No, it\u2019s not quite at the level of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; I don\u2019t do it to ward off Bad Things from happening, and it doesn\u2019t create problems for me.) I keep my hangers sorted by style; crayons in rainbow order; reference books on shelves by category and novels by author; music CDs neatly lined up alphabetic within genre; positively relished organising my collections of stamps sorted by country, rocks by type, and insects by family; and tidy my wrapped tea bags or seed packets in neat horizontal stacks.  I have been doing these things all my life, and in my mid-forties am not likely to change \u2014 there\u2019s really no need to!So, why not?

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t23 December 2006 ", "body": "\u201cIf a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk?\u201d ~ Albert EinsteinNot all kinds of \u201cmessiness\u201d are the same.Some kinds of mess are the healthy, happy exuvia of just living and doing lots of things.  It\u2019s the pieces of the ongoing sewing project, stacks of references for a writing assignment, travel guides and ephemera to trips past and future, and lines of shoes and piles of jackets ready by the front door.The surfaces are visual storage and reminder areas, helping us organise what we are thinking and working on.  They are ergonomically useful both cognitively and physically (think of all the time and effort that would be wasted repeated putting things away and taking them right back out again hours later). If I can find things on my over-full tabletop that serves as my desk, that means it is a workable working-system.The surfaces are also visual synthesis areas \u2013 having a variety of things out helps jog the creative process.  There\u2019s a reason why the blank white page or canvas is so daunting!  Clutter can incubate creativity; it\u2019s a serendipitous substrate.  One of my favorite microbiology stories is how Alexander Fleming discovered the antibiotic properties of Penicillium notatum because he\u2019d left culture plates sitting around, and a spore had floating in through the window, set up housekeeping, and was doing battle against the previously-colonized bacteria. Winnie-the-Pooh author A. A. Milne noted that, \u201cOne of the advantages of being disorderly is that one is constantly making exciting discoveries.\u201dSome kinds of mess is just overflow.  It\u2019s sports equipment dumped in a box because the coat closet is full of coats, books piled on floors and random surfaces because the bookcases are full of books, cooking equipment sitting clean-and-ready on counters because the cabinets are full of ingredients and less-frequently-used equipment, and the bottles of lotions and magazines and library books and the bottles of medicine that clutter my bedside because I\u2019ve neither a bedside cabinet to put them in nor space to put that piece of furniture.Some kinds of mess is just hyperconnectivity.  It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t a perfectly rational place to put something away, but that some things don\u2019t easily resolve to single locations.  Does my book on growing and cooking ethnic vegetables belong upstairs with the gardening books or down in the kitchen with the cookery books?  Do I keep this roll of string with the office supplies, the cooking gear, the gardening equipment, the craft materials or the cat stuff?Some kinds of mess is just hyperactivity.  There are crocks of cooking utensils and chopsticks on the kitchen counter, a test tube rack of markers on my desk, and a jelly jar of pens and scissors on the kitchen table because we use these things all the time and putting them away somewhere would slow down productivity.  It really is impossible to play with Lego blocks without dumping the bin to see all the pieces (we have a floor cloth for dumping the Legos onto to facilitate picking them back up again, so the vacuum sweeper doesn\u2019t eat them).Speaking of bins, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate good storage concepts.  I love big plastic bins for storing flower pots, Christmas tree ornaments, train set pieces, sorted quiltmaking scraps, camping gear et cetera.  In fact I\u2019ve decided that clear bins are far superior to opaque ones because you don\u2019t have to go digging through the bin to see what\u2019s in it, and also because this bit of visual contact with materials helps remind me that I already own it, so I will be sure to use it again.  (They\u2019re also fabulous when moving house because a bin of stuff is pre-packed.)These are good messes, the stuff that distinguish real homes from unrealistic designer showcases and sterile hotel rooms.Some kinds of messiness is just clutter, the leftover bits of things since forgotten.  It\u2019s out-of-date phone books, pieces to broken things that someone meant to fix months ago and never will, snow mitts scattered about in summer and the bathing trunks left out in winter, decorative holiday tchotchkes that weren\u2019t packed away and have since become part of the scenery, and hobby materials left in desuetude. These are the sorts of useless messes that interfere with good messes because they get in the way and thus use up functional spaces.Other sorts of messiness are just sloth, and have no redeeming qualities.Some kinds of messiness is just trash. It\u2019s junk mail and newspapers and adverts and magazines that everyone is done reading, empty shopping bags and packaging materials, expired coupons and old fliers.  It makes it hard to find the useful things for which one is looking, and it makes it hard to clean surfaces.Some kinds of messiness is just dirt.  It\u2019s crumbs on tables, and crud on carpeting, toothpaste slugs dried on the sink basin and loose hair around the bathroom, \u201csquissues\u201d (used, squished-up tissues) strewn about, snack wrappers and used dishes piling up, dirty socks and bath towels dropped about, and expired food in the fridge and on the counters. It\u2019s very bad mess, and not only from a health standpoint, but also because it creates and aggravates the despondency and inertia.The important thing to remember is that it is entirely possible to clean up the clutter, trash and dirt and leave intact the creative messes.  In fact, it is important to do so for mental well-being, especially if some residents are prone to depression.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/12/23/the-taxonomy-of-mess/", "title": "The Taxonomy of\u00a0Mess"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t21 December 2006", "body": "Students will fail to succeed, or outright fail a subject, for a variety of reasons.  Sometimes they have learning disabilities, sometimes they have health issues, sometimes their underachievement results from motivational issues.  Oft times there are sticky combinations of these causes.  In any regard, there\u2019s a long and sadly-familiar road trod by the triad of parents, student and school staff in the effort to rectify the situation.Unless the underlying causes are obvious (such as health issues), the common cause assigned to the student\u2019s underachievement is usually motivational problems.  This is especially true if the student did okay in the earlier grades, but their marks gradually slip lower with succeeding years, or their marks are irregular within the same subject.  Which is not to say that there might not also be various learning difficulties that are exacerbating the student\u2019s motivational issues \u2013 it\u2019s hard to keep applying yourself when you can\u2019t understand why your results are so erratic.  When students can\u2019t understand the cause and effect, they tend to assign difficulties to external forces, and feel they they have little power over the results of their efforts.Unfortunately, the first impulses of the dyad of adults in these situations, those solutions for tracking the student\u2019s progress and ensuring their successful completion of school work, can often end up making the situation worse. Alas, in the end, everyone ends up more stressed than before.  The solutions create more problems instead of rectifying them \u2026Although assignment books or pages are meant to enhance communication between school and home about what the student needs to do, they often end up creating an even tenser situation.  (Here we are talking about those that are ongoing missives between the adults, not simply a resource for the student.)   These are theoretically carried to and fro by the student, keeping everyone apprised of what has been assigned and has been completed.  Unfortunately, the focus of this exercise frequently turns to what the adults need to \u201cmake\u201d the student do, and upon what the student has not done.  (Note:  it\u2019s nearly impossible to \u201cmake\u201d someone do something; you cannot \u201cmake\u201d a child fall asleep or eat or learn.)  The frustrated adults become angry at the student, repeatedly reminding the child of how they have failed yet again.  Blame-assigning sets in, and each half of the adult dyad accuses the other of \u201cnot doing their part\u201d because obviously, were the other set of adults doing their job, the student would be getting the work done and turn in promptly!Amazingly, all this tension and attention does not improve the student\u2019s performance.  Indeed, the student now feels pitted between two large forces, wanting to please everyone but instead having their incompetence repeatedly confirmed.  Instead of empowering everyone to help the student, everyone has instead become disempowered, frustrated, and adversarial.Sometimes the adult dyad will resort to behavioral report or the daily or weekly progress reports for the student.  These can suffer many of the same issues as the assignment book, by focusing entirely upon negatives.  When poorly structured, the reports end up being little more than tallies of daily sins.  It is very disconcerting for anyone to be under the microscope all the time; slight transgressions and ordinary human weaknesses become quantified and magnified.  The child become identified with a bad score, even the hollow nothingness of \u201cbeing a zero\u201d. The student may also end up in the trap of false dichotomies, seeking to be perfect, and failing that, falling to utter failure. Here the student is expected to take responsibility for their behavior, but then simultaneous loses more of the control and personal power of the situation.Focusing only on a student\u2019s weaknesses creates a heavily biased view of the student.  Everyone has weaknesses, but successful students learn how to lead with their strengths and how to accommodate or compensate for their weaknesses. A good plan needs to focus upon how the student is improving.  The student needs help to learn how to plan ahead and effectively deal with inconsistencies in achievement that are simply part of the human condition.  They also need to learn how their successes are derived from what they have done, rather than from random outside forces, and how they are not only responsible for their behavior (in the sense of receiving its consequences) but also capable of effective positive changes in it as well.When many people are faced with noncompliant underlings (students, children or anyone lesser in the hierarchy), their first impulse is to punish them:   \u201cWhen people are bad, they deserve to be punished.  When people are good, they deserve to be rewarded.\u201d  Rewards in such cases are simply the flip side of punishments.  The problems with punishments are complex and not immediately apparent, because the system of punishment and reward (including the heavily-marketed \u201clogical consequences\u201d) is so heavily entrenched in our culture.The problem with punishments is that they change the focus from the activity itself to those punishments and rewards.  They also change the focus from a person\u2019s internal, intrinsic pleasure at doing something, to something extrinsic: the avoidance of pain or the attainment of pleasure.  Any activity (even one that is naturally interesting to a person) can lose its natural appeal under such conditions, and people do not work as effectively or as imaginatively.  Instead of improving work ability, such external systems actually end up reducing it.Furthermore, placing punishments and rewards into the situation takes the responsibility from the person doing the work, and places it in the hands of the people handing out the punishments and rewards.  It\u2019s no surprise that students end up focused on what they will get for doing something, rather than simply doing it because it needs to be done.  Success thus requires an outside system to ensure that the jobs are done.  Sometimes the rewards are so far in the future (a month or a semester away) that the cause and effect linkage cannot be made at the simple behavioral level \u2013 there\u2019s no relevance to what is happening today, and how the student feels at the moment.  Reward inflation also occurs, where ongoing jobs or more complex jobs need bigger and bigger rewards to ensure their completion.  Punishment inflation can also occur, because the student may decide that the punishment is not nearly as bad as the fear of failure or other dismotivating state.  Ultimatums like being grounded for a month (the parental version of house-arrest) or sending children away also do not work.  Either the child knows that the parent won\u2019t follow through, or if they do send the child off to someplace dreadful, the child learns that their scholastic achievements are more important to the parent than their love for the child as a person.Assignment books, progress reports, or punishments and rewards rarely have good long-term benefits because they are poor teaching tools.  They work on the assumption that fear or bribery are good teachers.  Not only do they teach the wrong things (fearing and hating authority, or needing to be bribed to do things), they also do not teach the right things.They don\u2019t teach the person how to persevere when frustrated, or how to solve their own inner difficulties, or how to monitor their own efforts, and how to adapt to new situations. As a result, they don\u2019t help a student become a more independent learner and worker, or how to think critically and problem-solve.  In short, they leave students very poorly equipped to be independent adults.  (Guess what happens when the student then goes to university \u2026)We don\u2019t want to assign blame to various people, or to punish our children and students for having problems.  Instead, we want to help them learn to problem-solve, and acquire the skills they need so they can figure out how to solve future problems.This means stepping outside of these established defensive and offensive modes of interaction.  It means listening to the student\u2019s frustrations without denying the validity of the feelings (even though the premises upon which they are based may be faulty).  It means demonstrating how to break down overwhelming jobs into smaller tasks, and how to create organisational structures that are self-enabling.  It means initiating work by starting from a place of competency and asking the student what they do know, rather than telling them what they ought to know.  It\u2019s not something that is accomplished quickly, especially when the poor mental habits have taken a long time to become established.  It takes a while for the student to re-frame their self-perception, and to install more effective work habits.Parents and school staff also assign blame on each other, and get defensive when one side asserts that the reason for the student\u2019s difficulties lies in the other\u2019s incompetence.  This ends up putting the adult dyad into offensive-defensive modes as well, thus blocking positive change.We don\u2019t need parents who are better warriors at IEP meetings, when in fact they really want to be helping the teachers understand how neat their children are, and sharing their insights about the child\u2019s strengths and interests.We don\u2019t need school staff who are better at defending the Local Education Authority\u2019s policies, when in fact what they really want to be doing is sharing their enthusiasm for various subjects with the students, but in fact end up cornered by employers that create systems that interfere with imaginative teaching.We do need team members who can collaborate with each other and with the student, and who can teach the knowledge and tools they will need to be better masters of their own destinies.  That is what education should ultimately be about, rather than about creating more compliant student masses.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2006/12/21/problems-with-solutions/", "title": "Problems With Solutions"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t1 February 2010", "body": "This is a continuation on my previous post, \u201cAttention, grocery shoppers!\u201dSo the other night my daughter was complaining of her ingrown toenail that\u2019s been bothering her for the past month.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you soak your foot in Epsom Salts?\u201d I suggested.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she asked.\u201cSee that blue milk carton atop the fridge?\u201d (That\u2019s where we keep our first-aid/pharmacopeia.)\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s magnesium sulfate*.\u00a0 Bath salts. It\u2019ll help draw out the inflammation and such.\u201d\u201cSalt?!\u201d She winced\u201cMineral salt, not sodium chloride table salt,\u201d I added, while refraining from explaining about ionic bonds.\u00a0 Her hubby the medic prepared her a foot soak and explained that magnesium sulfate is a natural mineral salt that\u2019s mined and used for all sorts of things.While she soothed her cold, sore feet in warm water, I had a mental chuckle over \u201cnatural chemical\u201d.\u00a0 To many people, the two words are antonyms \u2014 and very distant opposites at that.\u00a0 As I\u2019ve said before, a \u201cchemical\u201d is simply a substance with a defined composition.\u00a0 Minerals are chemicals.\u00a0 So are sugar, water, caffeine, theobromine (mn chocolate), baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), all the ingredients in your can of soda, and so on.Natural means that something is found in nature, with or without some processing.\u00a0 Apple juice and olive oil are natural because they squeeze the bejeezus out of those fruits.\u00a0 (Botanically, fruits are the parts of the plants with the seeds inside; olives and tomatoes are vegetables insofar as cookery and taxation are concerned.)\u00a0 Vanilla extract is a natural flavor because vanilla beans are used.\u00a0 Other natural flavors use plant and animal products.Artificial, which is what many people really mean by the word \u201cchemical\u201d, means a substance produced synthetically.\u00a0 In my organic chemistry lab, we made (minute) quantities of isopentyl acetate, which most of us are familiar with as artificial banana flavor used in candies or instant puddings. Imitation banana flavor is obviously pretty fake!\u00a0 But imitation wintergreen is not so readily identifiable, nor is it dissimilar from naturally-distilled wintergreen essence, aside from the fact that the natural distillation will have additional \u201cimpurities\u201d that add more depth to the flavor.The divisions between natural and artificial are fairly straight-forward.\u00a0 But the definitions of \u201corganic\u201d aren\u2019t!\u00a0 That\u2019s because we have different meanings for the word organic in different contexts.Once Upon A Time, O Best Beloved, there was just chemistry, that field of natural philosophy that the scientific method dragged out of the abyss of alchemy.\u00a0 Organic materials were those which came from natural sources, and were deemed special and beyond the production of the laboratory; they were somehow still deemed to have a \u201cvital force\u201d.\u00a0 However, in the early 19th century, urea (yes, the stuff of urine) was artificially synthesized, thus dispelling that last thread of medievalism.Nowadays, organic chemistry occupies itself with materials composed of hydrocarbons, that is, molecules with both Carbon and Hydrogen atoms.\u00a0 So instead of natural materials, there are a lot of well, unnatural materials involved, such as plastics, drugs, fertilizers, house paints \u2026 ordinary everyday stuff, most of which we wouldn\u2019t want to live without.In addition to the chemistry definition of organic, we have a couple of other usages.\u00a0 When I\u2019m teaching about composting, we use the term organic in its original sense of \u201cfrom something living\u201d.\u00a0 If it used to be alive, you can compost it and create lovely humus (although fatty things will smell, so we leave meats & dairy items out).Organic gardening and farming is yet another story.\u00a0 Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides cannot be used, and transgenic plants are most always frowned upon as well.\u00a0 (I have mixed feelings about transgenics; not about the processes, which are simply more specific means of breeding, but about other economic and agro-ecological issues.)Unfortunately, the history of organic growing is fraught with heavy doses of woo, including planting by moon-signs, astrology, companion planting, and whatnot.\u00a0 Fortunately, the professional realm has abandoned these, because professional growers have a lot of energy, money, time and effort invested (and of course, documentation work, because nothing officially exists without documentation).\u00a0 They can\u2019t afford to waste time on nonsense.\u00a0 Unfortunately for the gardening end, lots of this woo still propagates through the vacuum of teh interwebs.Last on my list of definitions is the oft-misapplied sense that anything \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d must therefore be safe.\u00a0 This is bullshit.\u00a0 There are lots of natural poisons!Conversely, artificial does not automatically mean dangerous. For example we\u2019ve been using synthetic acetylsalicylic acid (commonly known as aspirin) for decades, instead of the salicylic acid derived from willow bark that was painful to swallow and digest.\u00a0 The name salicylic acid comes from the genus Salix, in reference to the willow.  (Interestingly, wintergreen flavoring can be made from \u2026 aspirin!)There are many organic materials that can be derived both naturally or artificially, and the molecules have no magical memory about where they came from previously.\u00a0 A nitrate is a nitrate is a plant fertilizer, and a pan\u2019s a pan for all that.Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m off to nom on some banana Laffy Taffy.* Technically magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, for chemists and those who actually care \u2014 you know who you are.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2010/02/01/naturally-i-love-chemicals/", "title": "Naturally, I love\u00a0chemicals!"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t19 October 2009 ", "body": "I still feel queasy when I remember the words.Children have a certain disempowerment simply because they are young \u2014 they are na\u00efve, less learned, and lack perspective. But this transcended childhood.\u00a0 It sank past the boundaries of adult to child, or parent to child, and trampled my self-identity and self-determination.My mom had found a way to get past what some would have called the \u201cfortress\u201d that isolated me, that natural preoccupation with whatever I was doing and na\u00efve self-centeredness, that self-ism or autism that was greater in me than most anyone else.\u201cOh, you don\u2019t want to get grilled cheese again!\u201d she chided me, but her sharp glance to me denied the lightness in her tone.\u00a0 Her expression would then change, as it so often did when she spoke to other adults, with the swiftness of flipping a social light-switch, and she turned to pleasantly address the waitress \u201cShe wants the ham sandwich.\u201dOr: \u201cYou don\u2019t either, have a headache.\u00a0 You\u2019re just fine.\u00a0 Now go get your work done.\u201dAnd in 9th grade, in a dizzying double-bind: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a park ranger; quit flapping that survey!\u00a0 You\u2019re going to sign up for bookkeeping and typing, and you\u2019re going to start getting good grades in math class, too.\u201dIncreasingly, I was told how I \u201creally\u201d felt emotionally or physically, or told me that I could not possibly be feeling something, that indeed I actually was feeling.\u00a0 Invalidation is when an emotionally abusive person distorts someone\u2019s perception of the world, or when the abuser undermines their factual processing by casting doubt upon the facts of the events.\u00a0 Denying what happened or the analysis of what happened, minimizing the importance of abusive statements or trivializing the recipient\u2019s responses are also means of invalidation.Over the years, my inertia increased. \u00a0 I could never tell when I was expected to have a preference, or rather, to just to express a preference, since apparently I wasn\u2019t really allowed to have them.\u00a0 When it wasn\u2019t convenient to others for me to express a preference (to speed up shopping, or to allow my mom to appear generous), I was soundly rebuked and told what I \u201creally wanted\u201d.My stress and depression increased throughout my teen years.\u00a0 When I should have been learning independence and skills and decision-making, I was thwarted, and then paradoxically, received further insults because of my lack of independence.\u00a0 Never knowing when I was supposed to express an opinion, or what my opinion was \u201csupposed\u201d to be, I frequently gave up and just shrugged, unable to verbally express the \u201cappropriate response\u201d. I frequently did not know what that \u201cappropriate response\u201d was.Worse, with my lack of being able to perceive all those subtle social cues that pervaded both my warped home environment, and even the subtle social cues that comprise such an overwhelming part of interactions in the \u201cnormal\u201d world, I was becoming increasingly fatigued with the burden of shamefully lacking in whatever psychic means would have informed me.\u00a0 It was of course, all my fault, as so many people were quickly willing to inform me.My mom had found a way to get past my natural self-centeredness, not by inviting me to understand others\u2019 worlds, but by trampling my personal boundaries of selfhood.\u00a0 Although children have a certain disempowerment simply because they are young, they, like all self-conscious organisms, are entitled to \u2014 nay, required \u2014 that their selfhood be respected.\u00a0 Denying that someone else might have opinions worth considering, much less that they are even allowed to even have opinions, violates that central inalienable right.~#~Years later as an adult, I was still running into much the same problem of \u201creality shifting\u201d (being told by others what my personal reality and preferences were \u201csupposed\u201d to be), even if it wasn\u2019t expressed as blatantly or as frequently.\u00a0 One such event became (in retrospect) a tipping point \u2014 not in events, but in perceptual clarity.\u00a0 I finally realized that such events were equally disrespectful, even if they lacked the overt denial and double-binds.My (now ex-) husband was telling me that I shouldn\u2019t want to do jury duty because it might interfere with my vacation schedule or my work schedule.\u00a0 I shouldn\u2019t want to do jury duty because it didn\u2019t pay as much as my job did.But I realised in confusion, that this wasn\u2019t about what I wanted to do, to participate as a citizen, to help make a positive difference in justice, and to be able to observe another facet of social functioning.Ostensibly, it was about what he wanted from me, in terms of convenience in the family schedule, and what he wanted from me in terms of my earnings. (Unbeknownst to me at the time, we were horribly, deeply in debt.)\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t denying that it could make these differences in scheduling and earnings \u2014 but really, that wasn\u2019t the issue here.\u00a0 Those \u201creasons\u201d were just distractors.Rather, he was trying to enforce my actions based upon his wants, and dismissing my wants as being unimportant.\u00a0 He was trying to convince me that his wants were my wants.\u00a0 We all have wants, but I didn\u2019t think that mine should have been dismissed as being unimportant.The solutions he proposed were ones compromises between the requirements of the law, and what he said I wanted.\u00a0 But effectively, I was the one being compromised, because his announcement denied my interests and enabled him to get what he wanted, rather than what would have enabled both of us.I got tired of being told what I should want. I got tired of being told how I should feel.\u00a0 I was suffering from a chronic case of spiritual fatigue. Constantly negotiating to be taken seriously was an exhausting way to live.I don\u2019t miss those aspects of my life; my whole system twitches when I perceive someone telling me what I \u201cshould be feeling\u201d or \u201creally want to do\u201d.Now if only I could get out of some of these other double binds that infest my work life \u2026", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu/?page_id=168&print=1"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/10/19/what-you-want/", "title": "What you want"},

You just have trouble remembering the names that go with those faces.I never do.\u00a0 And except for the couple-dozen very morphologically distinctive customers, I\u2019m not likely to remember any of them.Silly people, they keep changing their physical characteristics, wearing different clothes through the seasons, changing their hairstyles, their purses, their hats or glasses, and so on.\u00a0 Sometimes they have family members with them, and sometimes not.\u00a0 Their children have this incredible ability to grow and morph dramatically.\u00a0 And of course, the customers keep changing the details of how they interact with me, and will need my help finding something in one aisle or another, or check out at different times of day, or whatever.\u00a0 Good heavens, sometimes people whom I know from other parts of my life will come through \u2014 the pharmacist will be shopping in their street clothes instead of standing behind their counter in a lab coat, my neighbor, or a former student will greet me, and they usually expect me to know them when they are out of their usual environments.\u00a0 (At least my ophthalmologist understands that I\u2019ve hardly ever seen him with my glasses on.)Alas, the world is too full of generic people seen on an intermittent basis.\u00a0 Once in a great while, somebody comes by to ask me a question, and it isn\u2019t until they begin to speak to me that everything clicks, and I realize this is my daughter or son-in-law!I\u2019m really quite helpful to customers, am conscientious about getting the stock rotated and shelved with the right price tag, do a great job of setting up displays, make a point to be sure that the back stock is checked so it gets on the floor, am careful when bagging so the cold items are together and the eggs are all okay and the bread and produce doesn\u2019t get squished, and so on.It\u2019s just that I will never be able to learn very many customers, or even all the employees.\u00a0 And much as I would like to have this magical skill that 98% of the rest of the population has, my disability is far outweighed by all the other things that I can do well.\u00a0 I\u2019m not lazy or stupid.\u00a0 It\u2019s just that I have an invisible disability.", "outgoing_links": ["http://blobolobolob.blogspot.com/2010/05/blogging-against-disablism-day-2010.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2010/05/02/i-need-to-write-a-letter-to-my-boss/", "title": "I need to write a letter to my\u00a0boss*"},

My son is really into super-heroes, and in case you don\u2019t know, the X-Men are mutant super-heroes.My daughter asks me, \u201cWhat\u2019s a mutant?\u201d I take a deep breath, trying to figure out how to explain genetic mutation to a six-year old. Thankfully, with my children this wasn\u2019t too difficult.\u201cRemember the other week when I told you what DNA is? The instructions that tell the different parts of your body how to grow?\u201d She remembers. \u201cSometimes the DNA changes, and that\u2019s called a mutation. A Monoceratops changing into a Triceratops s a mutation.\u201d* We watch some more of the cartoon.She asks me, \u201cAre all mutants weird like the X-Men, and have super powers?\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s just the cartoon part. If you always have yellow flowers and suddenly get a red flower, that\u2019s a mutation. In fact, everything in the world started out as a mutation, or else there would be nothing but itty-bitty plants floating in the ocean.\u201dShe decides that would be boring.\u201cWhy do those people hate the X-Men? The X-Men are good guys.\u201d\u201cThey hate them because they\u2019re bigots. \u2018Bigots\u2019 means when people hate other people because of something like what church they go to, or where they\u2019re from, or how they look. The people hate the X-Men because they look different, and can do different things, and they\u2019re scared of them.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s not fair,\u201d she complains, \u201cThe X-Men are nice.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.

She has loved dinosaurs since she was a mere tot of two. We read two chapters into the book. She read a few paragraphs, sounding out new words, and then realised, \u201cThe chicken laid a mutant egg!\u201dThis is why you should watch television with your children.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t7 December 2011", "body": "This was a major WTF moment when listening to the news today [transcript this link]: the Chick-fil-A chain is suing a Vermont tee shirt maker for copyright infringement. Their slogan is, \u201cEat Mor Chikin\u201d and his is \u201cEat More Kale\u201d.Now, Bo Muller-Moore\u2019s design\u00a0uses:\na different font,\ncorrect spelling,\na vegetable instead of an animal,\nand no cows in his design.\nObviously, the design on his tees is nearly identical to the fast food chain\u2019s! </snark>The Vermont state Governor, Peter Shumlin, formed \u201cTeam Kale\u201d as a fundraiser for legal fees to fight this absurd suit. After all, the Vermonter has been making these (and other) tee shirts for ten years, and this is how he makes a chunk of his living. \u00a0(Progress on the individually hand silk-screened tees is apparently getting a bit behind due to sudden demand, but there are also big green stickers for a 50-cent donation.)The phrase \u201cEat More ____\u201d sounded vaguely familiar, and some googling around quickly showed that it has been used throughout history!vintage \"EAT MORE MILK\" advert for Cadbury's Dairy Milk chocolateWWI Canada Food Board poster, \"Eat more Vegetables! SAVE Meat and Wheat for our SOLDIERS and ALLIES\"\"Eat MORE FRUIT\" poster, Victorian Railways, AustraliaWWI poster, U.S. Dept. Agriculture: \"Eat More Cottage Cheese...You'll Need Less Meat...A Postal Card Will Bring Recipes...Cottage Cheese or Meat? Ask Your Pocketbook!\"There are other current usages of the phrasing, such as\u201dStay Healthy. Eat More Bacteria\u201d for a dietary supplement. (After all, one shouldn\u2019t discriminate between biological Kingdoms!)If you do a visual google search, you can find an antique billboard on Route 66 that says, \u201cWatch Your Curves. Eat More Beef.\u201d from the Beef Industry Council. Apparently, in an earlier incarnation it was the Texas Beef Council, which also offered up quite an absurd pin-up girl (she\u2019s ostensibly changing a tire, but without any cattle in the picture whatsoever). I mention these simply because they are the humorous antithesis of the \u201cEat Mor Chikin\u201d cows.BTW, kale is really tasty lightly braised (PLEASE, don\u2019t cook the hell out of it \u2014 that just makes it bitter and stringy). Take your gently-wilted kale and sprinkle with some balsamic vinaigrette, or chop and mix into mashed potatoes (with bacon and onions, if you like), or add bite-size pieces in soups (miso soup with udon and kale sounds REALLY good this time of year).What makes kale so great is that not only will it over-winter (meaning, you can get it from local farmer\u2019s markets or CSA just about year-round, or else grow your own), but also that it has lots of iron, Vitamins A & C, calcium, and fiber.Tasty Kale 'Curly Leaf'Many kales are also quite ornamental as well \u2014 not just the frilly pink sort (grown for pretty more than nutrition), but also the tall green or purple-tinged sorts, which are often used for cold-weather plants in outdoor container arrangements.The ornamental Kale 'Redbor Hybrid'", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.npr.org/2011/12/06/143195033/chicken-vs-kale-vt-artist-fights-chick-fil-a-suit", "http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=143195033", "http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=143146625", "http://www.eatmorekale.com/stickers.php", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/eat-more-vegetables-canada-food-board-wwi.jpeg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/eat-more-fruit-victorian-railways-australia1.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/eat-more-cottage-cheese.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/brassica-oleracea-acephala-group-curly-leaf.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/brassica-oleracea-acephala-group-kale-redbor-hy.jpg"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2011/12/07/speak-more-kale/", "title": "Speak More Kale"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t3 December 2011", "body": "Here\u2019s a riddle: \u00a0how is a broken foot like being pregnant?\u00a0(No, it has nothing to do with wait times.)Mid-October I entirely missed the last two steps of the stairs to the basement floor and BLAM! Didn\u2019t even experience the slip and fall. Hurt so much I didn\u2019t even cuss, and only OW\u2019d so folks would know I\u2019d been hurt. My ankle really hurt, so I limped to my bedroom and pulled on an ankle elastic (which I keep in my purse because being hypermobile means easily spraining things). Hobbled around the rest of the day, giving\u00a0it the usual Rest-Ice-Compression-Elevation between doing stuff. That was a Friday.The next day it was really swollen, with a purple bruise covering the entire upper surface, but it wasn\u2019t horribly painful like a migraine. I called out from stocking work at the grocery, rested more, and tied on a foot brace. My son-in-law said it might be broken (it\u2019s good to have a medic in the house).Guess what? Broken bones are not always screamingly painful. Whoda thunk?Sunday I went to the walk-in clinic, and yeup, two of my metatarsals were broken, in a displacement fracture, no less. (Meaning, the bones weren\u2019t even lined up, but were slightly ajar.) They put on a splint. The next day I went to an orthopedist, and after due examination of the clinic\u2019s radiographs, the doc sent me to get a boot-type cast, and make follow-up appointments. On my end, I remembered to get a \u2018script for a temporary Disabled Parking permit. Whee.That was the easy part. But OMG the annoying part is not the broken foot itself.The annoying part is dealing with the public,\nthose discourteous, \u201cwell-intended\u201d, damnably useless interactions!Because you see, when you have a physically-apparent injury, one\u2019s body suddenly becomes part of the public\u2019s purview; they are free to make enquiries, \u201cdo help to you\u201d, \u201ccharmingly\u201d engage in the social distancing of pity, and\u00a0give\u00a0malcommendations.(Hopefully I won\u2019t use up my month\u2019s share of sarcasm quote marks, but one must hazards risk.)It\u2019s intrusive.\u00a0Being visibly disabled [sometimes] means losing status to where anyone can ask most anything of you.I don\u2019t mind answering questions from family, coworkers, and friends about the event and my recuperative status. But seriously, why should every random stranger feel privileged to details? Were the issue nephrological, nobody would want to know what was wrong with my bladder, or why I had to make so many bathroom trips, about the thrills of contrast dye, or what my urologist recommended. Yet like when bearing a belly bump, it\u2019s open season. WTF?It\u2019s unaccommodating disaccommodating.\u00a0I had not even left the orthopedists office when I was first treated to un-wanted, un-needed, un-help. I had used crutches before (decades ago when I stepped into a rabbit hole, and you can imagine all the er, lame jokes that transpired), and it took but a couple of days to re-acquire my expertise.\u00a0When I\u2019m using crutches and opening a push-door, the dance goes as follows: swing my body around to back into the door and push against the bar with my buttocks, then after creating the useful gap, balance on the strong foot to turn again, and swing the crutch on my working side around to prop open the door with the rubber foot. Well, the doctors had removed the splint and were sending me down the hall to get the boot. So with my fractured foot all bare, I approached the door to the waiting room and had gotten as far as butting open the door when \u2014\u2014 some idjit hanging around the waiting room decided to be \u201chelpful\u201d and without saying anything, bounded over and\u00a0suddenly yanked the door open! Mind you, I was balanced on one foot and leaning backwards against the door, so guess what?!\u00a0Well, I may be clumsy (it comes with the large territory of hypermobility) but thankfully I also have lightning-fast reflexes, and was able to crash to the floor safely. (Dancers and gymnasts know whereof I speak.) That\u2019s not helpful!And then we have the other unwanted bits of the social model of disability.It\u2019s \u2026 infantilising.\u00a0Such as when I\u2019m doing something totally mundane, just minding my own beeswax and swinging through a store to get to the restrooms, when some complete stranger feels the need to comment upon my mobility,\u201cYou\u2019re really good at that!\u201dExcept it doesn\u2019t sound at all like admiration at my ability to execute stunning pivots around pyramids of produce, but rather like praising a school child who had colored between the lines on a Kindergarten worksheet.It\u2019s\u00a0patronising. When I took advantage of the store\u2019s motorcart to shop for groceries and am cruising at a whopping three miles per hour  in a straight line down the middle\u00a0of the bread-and-jam aisle, and receive a smarmy,\u201cWow, look at you go!\u201dAnd of course, it\u2019s pitying.\u00a0\u201cOh, you poor thing!\u201dThere is the assumption of Injury As Tragedy; they have to know when it\u2019s going to be better. Well, what if it\u2019s never going to get \u201cbetter\u201d? What if it\u2019s permanent, or chronic and intermittent? \u00a0It\u2019s the sort of pity where people can\u2019t see past the \u201cbroken\u201d part and are uncomfortable; they\u2019re full of Schadenfreude, relieved that the Bad Thing didn\u2019t happen to them. Sometimes the coin of pity they pass along is a kind of magical thinking, token payment to Fate to avert similar disaster.That\u2019s not helpful.And let us not forget the malcommendations, a subject of such amazing WhatTheFuckery that it deserved its own post. To wit:You can tell that you\u2019re running into the lousy end of helpers when the need for social recognition outweighs and over-rules the negative feedback from the recipients. You can tell when they lose the \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d perspective and insist that what you need is what\u00a0they\u00a0have to offer. Protesting the inappropriateness of their pet form of aid is often useless; you get condescending responses about how they are \u201cspecially\u201d qualified, and how you are being unappreciative, and cannot know what is best for you simply because you are of the recipient class.Such dread Helpers and Fixers want not just the ego-boost and recognition; they want status, and will even sometimes create their own imaginary status markers as proof of why others should recognise their special knowledge and munificent public service. At worst they are narcissistic, at best, merely clueless.One of the oddest things I have run into with such types is not just the insistence that their pet solution is what is needed, but that\u00a0any\u00a0solution they have heard of should be helpful and tried. The advice is coming from\u00a0them\u00a0and they want what\u2019s best for you, therefor it\u2019s automatically good advice. I have at times been left so amazed that someone could suggest doing something so far off base with my needs, so profoundly inappropriate, that I was all but sputtering. It wasn\u2019t just an off-target bit of advice, an unhelpful recommendation. It was, I decided later, a\u00a0malcommendation, a bad recommendation (usually inadvertent) but still bad advice nonetheless.To take that abstract description to a real-life example, I offer this:I was at one of my jobs, and a coworker said she would do thus-and-such for me. \u201cOh, no-no, that\u2019s okay; I\u2019m fine,\u201d I politely dismissed, because I had already sussed out how I was going to perform my duties with my own modifications. But no, she was insistent; after all, she was (at her other job) a medical assistant of some sort,\u201cNo no \u2014 I know all about that,\u201d she asserted, her smugness wafting over in a perfumed cloud.::CRINGE::Look, as a medical assistant or what-have-you, you don\u2019t know \u201call about that\u201d; it\u2019s obvious that the doctors know LOTS more.Secondly, you\u2019re presuming that you\u00a0know what is best to do TO me, or to do FOR me. Apparently you\u2019ve not realised that I don\u2019t want to be a passive recipient of your \u201cexpertise\u201d.Seriously, when doctors-medics-aides-ancillary-healthcare-professionals know things I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s great! That\u2019s why I\u2019m here visiting your officies. But please, presume some self-awareness of my actual needs, and competency on my part.

But for the pollen to get moved/bumped from the pistils to the stigma there still needs to be some kind of wind or other vibration.There\u2019s not enough wind for this to naturally happen (or rather, efficiently happen) in a greenhouse, especially when the panes are shut to the weather. So it used to be that the operators would equip their greenhouse workers with *little vibrating wands* (oh yes), which they used to buzz-pollinate Every. Single. Fresh. Flower. (Insert inevitable sniggers from the undergrads.) Of course, that\u2019s a lot of paid worker hours.Nowadays the thrifty Dutch use bumblebees, who work for much cheaper wages of cardboard nesting boxes and some supplemental nectar. The big, gentle bees still visit all the flowers for the pollen, and resultant heavy buzzing results in flower fertilization for good crops.\u00a0[N.B.\u00a0 Derf; \u201ccucumbers in the title is incorrect \u2013 they DO need to be insect pollinated!

The list is also great at the end of my shift, for when I leave a note to my boss telling what usual things I\u2019d done, and also what extra tasks I had tended. Plus, there is the external randomness that happens all night long: periodic calls to cashier during a sudden influx of customers*, and sporadic customer queries that result in my taking them to the item location.And then \u2014 oh bother!\u00a0 Where DID I park my cart?Because of course, if it\u2019s a Truck day, I\u2019m stocking dozens of cases of candy or baby formula or soap, then the cart stays put in the aisle. I remove each case of new stock to set, and then return the flattened cardboard to the cart.That\u2019s fine.\u00a0 But other days there is no Truck of new stock to set, and I am simply filling in various shelves with Back Stock (B/S, not to be confused with BS).And right now I can\u2019t find my cart. I try to \u201cretrace my steps\u201d, which more resembles surveying the aisles I usually frequent, because nothing this evening was particularly memorable to imprint itself on my memory.\u00a0 All too often, my memory is topical, not sequential.No, it\u2019s not around anywhere; which discounts the \u201cdistracted by sequential customer queries\u201d process that results in me being far from my original departure point.Another hypothesis is that since it\u2019s neither in the usual aisles, nor by Register 1, maybe someone decided to take it to the back stock room.I pace to the back room, thankfully uninterrupted by a customer, whose query would have restarted this whole recursive process all over again.Hmn \u2026 there\u2019s my cart and equipment, but not the case I was going to stock.\u00a0 I guess one of the managers decided to do something with it.\u00a0 Maybe it was one of those new items for which we do not yet have a shelf tag, and they needed to enter the item into the inventory system. Thank goodness; mystery solved.So I wheel down to the stock bay where the B/S bird seed and dog chews are kept, to fetch more cases.\u00a0 After loading my cart again, I realize that it\u2019s time to take my Break \u2014 some food and water would probably help the whole tired brain thing.\u00a0 And if I leave a full cart, no one is likely to unintentionally \u201cgaslight\u201d me by changing my surroundings and leaving me to wonder if I\u2019ve lost track of my stuff or my mind altogether.* Why \u201ceveryone\u201d wants to check out at once \u2014 no matter when they came in \u2014 is one of the mysteries of retail.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/adhd-gaslight/", "title": "AD/HD Gaslight"},

But last year I found a wonderful tool, not just the OXO brand, but their locking Good Grips version.\u00a0 The locking part means that once you\u2019ve clinched the opener onto your can, it hangs onto it, like a Scottish Terrier with a tug-toy.\u00a0 When the can\u2019s open, push down on the little button and it releases the can.\u00a0 It\u2019s easy for arthritic grandma (me) to use, it\u2019s easy for my son with the giant hands to use, and it\u2019s easy for my daughter with the small hands to use.\u00a0 Hooray!can opener with comfy thick handles and a wide half-moon turnkeyI like my futon bed because it provides excellently firm support, but on the other hand, a futon is so firm that I felt like an even more arthritic \u201cbag o\u2019 bones\u201d trying to sleep on it; no position was comfortable, and sleeping on my side was worst of all, as my shoulder and hip bones pressed against the mattress.\u00a0 So I finally got a memory foam mattress topper.\u00a0 After unwrapping and unrolling, it took a couple of days to off-gas and expand all the wrinkles out before I dragged it atop my bed and popped on the mattress cover that came with it before remaking my bed.\u00a0 But the foam \u201cbreathes\u201d well so you don\u2019t get sweaty, and has such small pores that it doesn\u2019t feel like lying on a sponge. And heavens, it\u2019s amazing how much more restful my bed is now!Once I finally ooze out of bed between the cats, it\u2019s time to get dressed.\u00a0 Half the year I start with a base layer of thin silk long underwear.\u00a0 Silk is amazing\u00a0 stuff; it helps you stay warm yet doesn\u2019t get too warm.\u00a0 Plus, the material is so thin and slick that my outer clothes are neither tight nor bunch up.Often I\u2019ll also end up wearing my gloves.\u00a0 Our classroom has always been the coldest, but even at the grocery my hands will be cold.\u00a0 After examining a number of styles, I finally settled on some Thermoskin arthritis gloves.fish-scale patterned black stretch gloves without finger tipsThe neoprene-like material helps trap body heat, which keeps my hands warmer despite the Raynaud\u2019s, and that plus the compression reduces the arthritis pain.\u00a0 The gloves are also covered with grippy-nubbins, so it\u2019s easier to hold onto things.\u00a0 Most arthritis gloves are that ugly medical-beige color, but I think this black color is a bit more stylish; one of my students said they look like \u201cSpiderman gloves\u201d which is probably as much of a compliment as one is going to get on a medical aid.Now there\u2019s a gripe \u2013 why IS it that anything in the \u201cmedical aid\u201d category is nearly always ugly and over-priced?After a couple of months of coping with the sudden attacks of vertigo, I finally realized that I wasn\u2019t getting to work quite as well-groomed as I used to.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t gross, just not getting my hair washed daily.\u00a0 Eventually I figured out that when I don\u2019t have time for a bath in the morning, I was skipping a quick shower because I don\u2019t have good balance when my eyes are closed or when I\u2019m looking upwards, both of which apply to standing in the shower and shampooing!\u00a0 Okay, I decided to get a shower seat, to sit safely in the shower without feeling like I was going to fall and crack my head.\u00a0 So I bop on down to the store, and within the hour emerged with a box of parts to assemble.\u00a0 The assembly was simple enough, but I was slightly miffed.\u00a0 Thirty-five bucks for an ugly plastic thing!\u00a0 Granted, the new piece of furniture cluttering up our small bathroom is not just a shower seat \u2014 we all love the fact that it makes a great book or laptop bench when one is parked in the bathroom.\u00a0 But holy cows, can\u2019t someone design something useful that doesn\u2019t look like it came home from the hospital?Plastic white seat with drainage holes, on tubular metal legsI haven\u2019t used a cane often enough to warrant getting a fancy one, or to become a connoisseur of the various features.  But when I do have a badly-twisted ankle, I\u2019ve come to appreciate how a cane helps ease my gait.  It also made a dandy pointer when I taught horticulture classes.  It even gives you something to lean upon when waiting on a bench.  But as everyone who\u2019s ever used a cane knows, canes are annoying when you\u2019re not using them.  They\u2019re hard to park securely when you\u2019re dining, and they\u2019re damn awkward if you\u2019re traveling, especially on airplanes.  That\u2019s why I got a folding cane.  I can just stretch the ends a bit and pop it out of joint, and fold it up to store in my carry-on bag.  It\u2019s also pretty fun to pull out and give it a little flick and click-click-click everything snaps into place.  (I find this feature terribly amusing.)  Currently, it lives on the floor of my car, out of the way behind the driver\u2019s seat, waiting for the next time I need it.What\u2019s your favorite thing for making your life easier?", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2010/01/18/some-more-of-my-favorite-things/", "title": "Some more of my favorite\u00a0things"},

Hell if I know.\u00a0 As for me, the canned music just adds unnecessary background noise, aggravating my Auditory Processing Disorder.\u00a0 Did someone just page Manager to the Customer Service Desk or Andrea to the Customer Service Desk?\u00a0 Did my boss just page me to dial 14 or aisle 14?\u00a0 \u201cOops, sorry, mis-heard you with all the background noise,\u201d I apologise to an older gentleman, as I lead him away from the [recycled paper] brown plates to the bran flakes.Sometimes a customer will ask for something not on the shelf, so I helpfully zip down to the back room to see if there\u2019s any in backstock. Usually, there isn\u2019t, because by definition, backstock is the overflow that won\u2019t fit on the shelves.\u00a0 Alas, if I\u2019m in a distracted mood, I will forget to make a mental note of what the customer is wearing, and upon my return, will have that panicked second when I realise that they have moved onto another aisle, and I am supposed to find them.\u00a0 Oh, the perils of being faceblind: I can\u2019t remember people!\u00a0 Were they alone, or with another adult, or children?\u00a0 Did they have a large or small cart?\u00a0 Do I have any idea of whether they were male, female, or some overbundled or indeterminately-coiffed gender?\u00a0 Were they were pink- or brown-skinned?\u00a0 Hat? Fancy purse?\u00a0 Team jacket?\u00a0 Why can\u2019t everyone be as distinctive as the fellow who dressed like Eddie Izzard\u2019s less-chic sibling?My other problem of course, is that I actually answer the questions about the things we sell.\u00a0 Some day, someone is going to get annoyed.Once in a while I stock groceries over in the natural foods section.\u00a0 It\u2019s pretty much like stocking groceries over in the unnatural foods section, except that omitting artificial coloring makes food more expensive.\u00a0 That and the aisles are narrower, so I have to park the flatbed down at the ends of the aisles and lug more cases.\u00a0 One day I forgot my knee pads, and realised with a heavy note of irony that stocking all the arthritis treatments was making my knees ache.\u201cUm, where do you sell the sugar?\u201d\u201cThe sugar?\u201d I repeat, buying a moment\u2019s time while I re-engage my customer-conversation scripts, and activate my mental map of the store.\u201cYes, I want the sugar without any chemicals.\u201dOmigod.\u00a0 Aside from bottled water, the bags of sugar are probably one of the purest chemical resources in the entire store.\u201cBut sugar is just sucrose; it doesn\u2019t have any added chemicals,\u201d\u00a0 I manage to shut my mouth before going onto explain that sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose.\u00a0 Nobody cares \u2026 \u201cHere are our organically-grown sugars on this shelf.\u00a0 And we also have sucanat and turbinado, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\u00a0 (These latter two are less-processed forms of cane sugar; they have varying amounts of tasty molasses impurities that also make them brown.)Honestly, a \u201cchemical\u201d is simply a substance with a defined composition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You already know what H2O is.\u00a0 Sucrose is C12H22O11 \u2013 there are 12 Carbon molecules, 22 Hydrogen molecules and 11 Oxygen molecules.\u00a0 Of course, just knowing how many atoms of each element isn\u2019t enough \u2013 other sugars such as lactose and maltose also have the same formula.\u00a0 The differences are in how those atoms are arranged.And if you\u2019re shopping for plant fertilizer, a nitrate is a nitrate is a nitrate, and they\u2019re all NO3-. The plant doesn\u2019t care where the molecules came from, nor can it tell the difference if the nitrate came from an organic (naturally-derived) source or an artificially-manufactured source.\u00a0 That said, organic fertilizers are more expensive and less concentrated, but are less likely to result in a build-up of salts atop the potting soil.But please, don\u2019t ask me for anything \u201cchemical-free\u201d; the only thing that is \u201cchemical free\u201d is an absolute vacuum.I retrieve random things left on the shelves, where someone has left a box of Big Name mac & cheese amongst the organic mac & cheese, a shopping list, a wee sample cup given out by the guy flogging new flavors of hummus, and a box of Airborne.\u201cWhat does that do?\u201d asks the other grocery stocker, gesturing at the colorful box that proclaimed, \u201cCreated by a school teacher!\u201d\u201cNothing.\u00a0 There\u2019s no research evidence to support it at all.\u00a0 A grade-school teacher is not the same thing as a compounding pharmacologist.\u201d\u00a0 Were I in charge of ordering, we wouldn\u2019t waste shelf space for nonsense like that, or for things like Bragg vinegar that is supposed to \u201chelp remove body sludge toxins\u201d.\u00a0 Body sludge toxins, what nonsense!\u00a0 (I suppose it\u2019d help the lime buildup in my sink drain.)\u201cExcuse me, where are your all-natural gummy candies?\u201dBecause you know, gummy candies are so natural. Wow, I\u2019d love to have a shrub that produced gummies, especially the cherry and liquorice sorts.\u00a0 Does the soil have to be aerated by gummy worms?\u00a0 I hope it\u2019s not thorny \u2026\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re over here, on the top shelf.\u00a0 Is there anything else for which you\u2019re looking?\u201d\u201cAttention grocery shoppers!\u00a0 Are you looking for holiday candy and merchandise?\u00a0 You can find it all over in aisle 14, where we have a wide selection of holiday candies in Fun Sizes, all your same favorites as the last holiday, but wrapped in this holiday\u2019s color themes!\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to get some holiday-themed merchandise for your loved ones, and holiday-themed party goods as well.

(Although I will be quick to point out that only 1 % of the insects are pests.)\u00a0 I do find grasshoppers to be kind of gross, especially after scrubbing their encrusted remains off my automobile windshield, and spending hours driving a riding mower and having them bounce off my face.\u00a0 Blech.Q.: What trivia challenge do people pose when they hear about what you do for a living?A.:\u00a0 \u201cWow, I bet you know all the bugs!\u201d\u00a0 No.\u00a0 There are over one million species, mostly beetles, and I\u2019m more familiar with butterflies.Q.: What basic fact about your job/occupation do people rarely understand?A.:\u00a0 That insects are animals.\u00a0 \u201cYes, they are.\u00a0 They\u2019re not plants, not fungi, not single-cell organisms.\u00a0 They have organ systems and behaviors, and are not photosynthetic.\u201dQ.: Did you always want to be a/n\u00a0 ___?A.:\u00a0 \u201cHuh?\u00a0 Sorry, distracted watching this bug.\u00a0 Look here at what it\u2019s doing\u2013\u201cQ.: You musta been a weird kid, huh?\nA.:\u00a0 Yeah, but now I get paid to teach the other weird kids.Q.: How did some totally unrelated previous job prepare you for your current occupation?A.:\u00a0 I went from doing behavioral observations of insects to behavioral observations of students with severe emotional and behavioral problems.\u00a0 There are more similarities than you\u2019d imagine.Q.: So what do you do for a living?A.: Do you mean my daytime, evening, or weekend job?I would love to hear the answers from Dave Hingsburger, Bug Girl, Dean Dad, Wheelchair Dancer, and YOU.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/12/27/occupational-hazards/", "title": "Occupational Hazards"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t7 February 2010 ", "body": "Dear Diary,Wait a minute, this is a migraine diary; useful and important, but not such a \u201cdear\u201d topic.Dear Diary,Today I had another migraine.\u00a0 The symptoms included:As mentioned, I\u2019m putting together a diary of migraine details for an upcoming appointment with a specialist. The other week I had one so bad that my son had to take me to my GP for a Toradol injection, to be taken with a fresh dose of Imitrex \u2014 \u201cfresh\u201d in both meanings, because earlier I had taken my last and slightly-expired pill.\u00a0 I\u2019d planned on asking the pharmacist to order a refill, but of course, had been unable to go into work at the grocery!\u00a0 (The irony.)\u201cHave you made an appointment with a neurologist?\u201d asked my doc.\u201cHeadache speshlist; don\u2019 remember whom.\u201d\u00a0 I held my wallet in front of my nose and squinched one eye open a millimeter to pull out the correct business card.\u201cOh good, that\u2019s just the person I wanted you to see.\u00a0 Takes forever to get an appointment, though.\u201d\u201cIn April,\u201d I mumbled.\u201cYeup; takes forever.\u00a0 Okay, I\u2019ll have the nurse come in with the injection, and I\u2019m writing you a \u2018script for some more Imitrex.\u201d\u201d \u2018Ank-you.\u201dWhen I do get to see this new specialist, I want to be armed with a good data set so we can maximise the efficacy of our first appointment.\u00a0 But to do that, I had to figure out what kinds of data would be needed.\u00a0 This in turn meant researching the various types of headaches, migraines, and symptoms.\u00a0 I got to learn lots of great new words!If the headache is bilateral (both sides of the head), then it\u2019s a regular tension-type headache.\u00a0 I\u2019ve had some intractable ones that linger for a couple-three days, despite various medications.Unilateral headaches (just one side of the head) are the migraine sort.There are the icepick migraines that feel like someone just stabbed you in the head.\u00a0 Although intense, they are mercifully brief \u2014 just a minute, though there can be several repeats throughout the day.Migraines can be temporally divided into three stages:\u00a0 the prodrome or early-warning symptoms, the migraine itself, and the postdromal after-effects.\u00a0 If I wake up with a migraine, then I don\u2019t have the benefit of prodromal symptoms to alert me to take some medication and stave off the worst effects.\u00a0 However, one of the benefits to keeping data sheets is the ability to suss out what sorts of symptoms are prodromal, so I can have better self-awareness.A persistent tension headache can turn into a migraine (ugh).\u00a0 Eating much wheat also seems to be a trigger for me; a small cooky isn\u2019t bad, but a couple slices of pizza will do me in later (not to mention digestive hoo-hahs as the gluten works through my kishkas).\u00a0 Barometric pressure drops \u2014 especially those that bounce back up from a swiftly-passing storm \u2014 are notorious for making my ears and head hurt.The cognitive and mood factors can be less obviously related to migraine prodrome: brain fog, depressive state, insomnia, or light sensitivity.\u00a0 You might think these would be pretty obvious, but the problem with chronic pain (from hypermobility+osteoarthritis+TMJ, especially combined with 11-13 hour work days) is that one gets into those viscous circles of pain-sleep problems-depressive states.\u00a0 Throw in everyday hyperacussis and UV-sensitivity, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to sort out what is which.\u00a0 \u201cAin\u2019t we got fun.\u201dOnce I started researching various migraine symptoms, I had a much better means of both identifying and describing the various symptoms I experience.One thing that quickly became apparent was that like snowflakes, no two migraines were precisely the same.\u00a0 This is interesting from an objective point of view, but it also means that I have to spend a bit of effort to verbally identify the symptoms I experience during each migraine, and then shortly thereafter note them.\u00a0 Although a cognitive task that I cannot always perform throughout the entirety of the experience, it does afford me the opportunity to detach part of my consciousness to that objective state, which gives me one step of remove from the intensity of the experience.\u00a0 (My research background is useful in so many ways.)An Aura can include visual disturbances such as:\nScintillating scotoma the classic flickering/shimmering/sparkling arc, zig-zag or castle crenelation effect;\nDrifting phosphenes phosphenes are \u201cstars\u201d you see if you stand up too quickly or sneeze; phosphenes can also refer to the geometric patterns that happen when you press on your closed eyes;\nDiplopia just the fancy word for double vision;\nOscillopsia when objects appear to oscillate, vibrate or bounce;\nPhotophobia \u201cthe light, augh! too bright!\u201d\nAllodynia pain from nothing in particular, or something that wouldn\u2019t normally cause pain, \u201caugh the sheet\u2019s touching my arm!\u201d;\nOsmophobia  \u201cthe smells, augh! too overpowering!\u201d\nOlfactory hallucinations smelling things that aren\u2019t really there;\nPhonophobia  when even the clattering of dust particles falling is too loud;\nHyperacussis I startle overmuch at sudden or sharp noises \u2014 well, even more so than usual;\nAuditory hallucinations hearing things that aren\u2019t there, nor are related to my tinnitus;\nSyn\u00e6sthesia Feeling sounds, and other odd cross-sensory effects;\nParesthesias tingling or numb feeling like \u201cpins and needles\u201d, or like someone is yanking on my kneecaps or tendons;\nVertigo, nausea, vomiting, chills or clamminess;\nAtaxia a \u201clack of order\u201d or bad muscle coordination;\nDisarthria / aphasia  disarthria is trouble speaking clearly, and aphasia is problems with speaking and understanding, or making sense of reading things.Once all that is over, there is the postdrome, or \u201cmigraine hangover\u201d.  I\u2019ve no idea how one compares to a drinking hangover \u2014 I\u2019ve never drunk that much!  But it is something like having the flu: weakness, generalized muscle aches, laterality confusion (right v left), fine-motor difficulties, exhaustion, lack of appetite, intense thirst, intermittent strabismus (wandering eye), temporary dyslexia / reading comprehension, auditory processing lags, concentration problems, or once in a while, feeling energetic \u2014 \u201cwow, I\u2019m no longer in pain!\u201dThen of course, the was the issue of creating a useful data sheet, one that was both complete and easily used \u2014 and this is where my dual backgrounds in behavioral research and typography+layout blend well.As with any sort of biological data, it is important to note the frequency, intensity and duration.\u00a0 In addition to those classic factors, there are also the sorts of factors that one more often considers in ecology: the type, season (if any \u2013 only a data set of more than a year can determine that), and the extent, in this case, the extent of the disability that results from migraines.I\u2019m sorted the pain and disablement into three levels:\n1 annoying pain, workable\n2 moderate pain, reduced work\n3 severe pain, incapacitating.With the diary, I can then sort out the frequency, intensity and duration of the issues.  So far I\u2019m relizing that it\u2019s much more of a problem than I had realized.  It\u2019s not so much that one gets used to pain, but that one gets used to being in pain, to headaches as a way of life.Damn, but April\u2019s a long ways off.", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2010/02/07/distress-data-diary/", "title": "Distress Data Diary"},

I tried to explain they\u2019re not even the same kinds of yeast, and it\u2019d be dead after the bread\u2019s baked anyway, but NO-O-O-O\u2026\n[facepalm]Yeasts are a kind of fungus: yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae is necessary for yeast-breads, beer and wine fermentation.\u00a0 For sourdough breads, a variety of wild yeast Candida milleri plus acid-producing bacteria Lactobacillus sanfrancisco that gives the dough the distinctive \u201ctang\u201d.For our confused customer, the yeast infection [mouth, digestive tract, vagina] is from an entirely different fungus, Candida albicans.If you\u2019re curious, the fuzzy black stuff that grows on bread is a mold,\u00a0Rhizopus nigricans.\u00a0Molds are another kind of fungus. Yummy blue cheeses [Maytag blue, Dana-blu, Gorgonzola, Roquefort, Stilton] are made possible from the mold Penicillium roqueforti or Penicillium glaucum that were naturally present in the [naturally cool] caves where the cheeses were made & aged. (Nowadays the cheese wheels are injected with the appropriate mold). A few people with Penicillin antibiotic allergy may have a reaction to blue cheeses, but the quantity of the material is so much smaller in the cheese, it is rarely a problem.I almost mentioned yogurt as a source of probiotics \u00a0\u2014 I was \u201cthis close\u201d \u2014 but refrained. Trying to add bacteria to her mental mix of Bad Things We Can\u2019t Pronounce & Must Avoid would have been too much for the both of us.Related to fungi (well, related just in the sense of small organisms helpful to food), are bacteria.\u00a0Most of the bacteria that exist in the world are neutral to humans, and many are beneficial.\u00a0 Only a relatively small number are responsible for bacterial infections.\u00a0 Truth be told, we NEED bacteria, because they are responsible for the fermentation processes that turn raw food items into different, processed food items that have better/different flavor, are more digestible, and store for long periods of time.\u00a0 Some examples of these great bacteria include:Yogurt is made possible with Lactobacillus bulgaricus or Streptococcus thermophilus.\u00a0Bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus are also used as \u201cprobiotics\u201d to improve the health of the natural gut flora/fauna.Beneficial bacteria such as Pseudomonas putida are \u201cbiorational\u201d micro-organisms used to fight phytopathonic [plant disease causing] fungi on a variety of plants, and can help reduce the amount of fungicides used on apple trees, etc. Is that just so cool or what?!Another helpful bacterial byproduct we have is over in the gluten-free aisle: xanthan gum. The powder is added to baked goods as a binding agent and to provide elasticity, both qualities that would otherwise be missing because that\u2019s what gluten proteins give to breads and baked goods.\u00a0Xanthan gum is a long chain of sugar molecules (a polysaccharide) produced from the fermentation of carbohydrates by a yellow bacteria by the name of Xanthomonas campestris. \u00a0Xanthos is Greek for \u201cyellow\u201d; you may remember the xanthophylls or yellow pigments inside tree leaves, that are visible in the autumn after the green chlorophyll is gone.(Sometimes people call these binomial names for organisms their \u201cLatin names\u201d but they really are their \u201cscientific names\u201d, because there\u2019s quite a bit of Greek in them as well as Latin.)Sauerkraut and pickles are made possible by Leuconostoc mesenteroides bacteria.\u00a0 Other kinds of bacteria are responsible for the production of our favorite brined olives.\u00a0 Bacteria are also involved in the fermentation of cocoa beans [for cocoa powder, cocoa butter, chocolate], the seed pods of vanilla orchids, and coffee beans.\u00a0A variety of useful foodstuffs are made possible by the fermentation of soybeans, such as soy sauce and tamari.\u00a0Propionibacteriaceae is responsible for the holes of Swiss cheeses, \u00a0Emmenthaler and Gruy\u00e8re. \u00a0Acetobacter bacteria produce vinegars (table vinegar is 3-5% acetic acid; cleaning or weed-control vinegars about 10%).\u00a0 And of course, we must make mention of the fact that bacteria are responsible for the brewing/fermentation of beer & ale, wine, and alcohol.If we had no bacteria or yeast, we\u2019d have no baguette chunks to dip into our cheese fondue, or coffee with our chocolate desserts.

I so wanted to explain, and having to force myself to stop in mid-sentence (hell, mid-mini-monologue) is hardly my style. But I diligently keep practicing social skills, including noticing when others have quit a topic.Having already clocked out, I gave up, left the building, and even waited to get into my car before expressing my complaints aloud to no one \u2014 except a fruit fly uselessly orbiting the fragrant-but-empty lunch bag I had just tossed onto the floor.And a fruit fly doesn\u2019t give a gnat\u2019s ass about the seemingly subtle difference between\u00a0reason\u00a0and\u00a0cause. No, it is not mere semantics, and they are not exact synonyms.\u201cSo how was your trip?\u201d she had asked as we met in the hallway. We had not yet crossed paths that day, delaying the obligatory Monday morning chit-chat.\u201cOh it was lovely, except for missing a connecting flight, so I was only there two days,\u201d I began. And I was proud that I had even mindfully planned ahead to next ask her if she\u2019d ever been to Boston, thus fulfilling my offering volley in the chit-chat process \u2014 when she gave me that totally unexpected, inexplicable response:\u201cWell you know, \u2018Everything happens for a Reason\u2019 !\u201d She chirped, nodding sagely.\u201cYou mean a cause,\u201d I began.\u201cSame thing,\u201d she said, waving off the comment and walking off toward the time-clock to punch out.\u201cBut\u2013 no, it\u2019s not \u2026\u201d I protested.*Things happen from causes, but claiming there was some cosmic \u201creason\u201d for me to just-miss my connecting flight was way too teleological.Being slowed by a tender foot and heavy luggage, plus the inevitable need to find a bathroom (because of course you can\u2019t go pee during that last stage of a flight, especially when it\u2019s turbulent), and then getting to the gate at the other end of the airport just a few minutes too late, all of those are what caused me to miss my flight. (It was likely over-booked as well, so they may not have \u201cmissed\u201d an extra passenger.)And there was certainly no divinely-inspired, soul-improving plan for my boyfriend to be left standing patiently but futilely at the other airport, or for me to be spending a night without my luggage, in a crummy hotel room without a working tub-stopper, and getting up a few hours later to schlep back through the airport and the TSA pat-down all over again.(Yes, in the grand scheme of things, that all was just a major inconvenience. But you know, I\u2019m 50 years old; I\u2019ve had my share of both inconveniences and actual crises. I already know the difference. It wasn\u2019t an educational experience, just a major bummer and an annoying pain in the arse.)You know what really irks me about the whole divine-plan \u201cthings happen for a Reason\u201d nonsense? When there is a catastrophe, and people go around saying things like, \u201cGod saved him/her for a Reason.\u201d Wait, what about the people who didn\u2019t survive? Why not? Now that\u2019s just beyond capricious. How can a rationale like that be comforting? Frankly, your idea of divine intervention sucks.No thanks. Really, I am much more comfortable knowing that I live in a universe where there are causes and effects. Yes, there is plenty of random chance, and once in a very great while you get the big wins from incredibly small odds, but those aren\u2019t miracles. Sometimes you get the big losses too, and that\u2019s because shit just happens.But it\u2019s not personal! It\u2019s not that the universe doesn\u2019t care about you;\u00a0rather, there is no special \u201cit\u201d to care.As a gal in the Entomology department used to say, \u201cSometimes you\u2019re the bug, and sometimes you\u2019re the windshield\u201d.**_________* I gave up pursuing that topic after a second try the following day.

Unlike most of the snakes whom I have encountered in my gardens, this one was much more amenable to being held, and didn\u2019t thrash about, pee, or exude stink from its postanal gland. We decided to adopt him. (I think it\u2019s a him; the tail after the vent is slender and shortish. Also, males emerge from hibernation first.)Isn\u2019t he just the cutest thing?3/4 profile portrait shot of a Garter snakeDespite what pet stores may tell you (or told me), garter snakes are not insectivorous. So In his roomy terrarium/herpetarium, I ended up with a bunch of crickets (and some cricket feed cubes). The crickets will end up as chow for Rosie, my tarantula. Meanwhile though, the male crickets serenade the females, as well as Nandi and Rosie and me. Chirp, chirp, chirp! It\u2019s the cricket equivalent of, \u201cHey, ba-by! Ooh, sexy!\u201dA pile of randy crickets hanging out atop the rock under the heat lampAnd as you can tell from this picture, Nandi is not a threat to them. In fact, he seems a trifle annoyed at times, and\u00a0a few days ago\u00a0after I fed him a hyuge earthworm, he burrowed into the soft plant substrate to digest, unmolested by the jumping jiminies.At about 22 in. / 56 cm., Long Snake Is Long. Well, not really; that\u2019s about an average size for an adult, although he could grow longer.Nandi warming atop his cave, crickets all around and even atop him.In the picture below, you can see him sniffing around. Snakes smell with their tongues, flicking them out to catch odor molecules, and then tasting the smells with their Jacobson\u2019s Organ, AKA the Vomeronasal Organ (VMO), which is at the bottom of the nasal cavity. (Humans have VMO during fetal development, but there\u2019s debate on whether it remains in [some] adults.) Smelling with your tongue may sound funny, until you remember how hard it is to taste food when you\u2019re too stuffy to smell it.Nandi sniffing the air with his tongue flicked out\u201cDang, all I smell are crickets!\u201dToday I was pulling some weeds, and found a nice long earthworm. Garter snakes eat other small herps (frogs and such), fish, and earthworms (but not red wrigglers, such as are used in composting, because those make the garter snakes vomitously ill). Happily, garter snakes also eat slugs and small rodents, which may well be one reason why they\u2019re sometimes affectionately called \u201cgarden snakes\u201d. But alas, they don\u2019t eat snails, those \u201cslugs-with-motor-homes\u201d.Nandi is a daytime critter (diurnal), out and about in the morning and late afternoon. I was glad I\u2019d found him that worm today, because I noticed him wandering about again, after I\u2019d eaten dinner.My daughter was thrilled to have the opportunity to feed Nandi. Here\u2019s another reason why this particular individual makes a good pet: he\u2019ll actually take food offered to him. Garter snakes locate their food visually, too, so all it took was dangling the wiggly worm in front of him and \u2014 GLOMP!Nandi grabbing one end of an earthworm being held above him\u201cUm, you can let go of the worm now.

If so, today\u2019s post is for YOU!I enjoy words.\u00a0I love learning new words, and now and then feel the need to make nifty neologisms. I take pleasure in playing word games and punning around. I\u00a0use a vigorous vocabulary for producing prose and programming.\u00a0I revel in vicious verbiage when needing venomous invective.Weird words are wonderful. Exceptions excite intrigue.\u00a0Luckily for us, the English language (in its multitudinous international forms) is known for being an absolute mish-mosh of exceptions to dang near every orthographic rule that has been imposed upon it over the centuries. This is not surprising considering how many other languages have been sources for our vocabulary!Being familiar with many of those weirdnesses is great when one is an editor, writer or proofreader. (Alas, not everyone shares such passions, so we logophiles must sometimes refrain from exercising too much pedantry.*) It also gives me a number of opportunities for musing \u2026Today I ran some errands on the way home, which caused me to take a different pathway. En route, I espied a\u00a0cellular antennae tower array (mobile phone mast), one of those tall poles with transceivers and other prickly bits plated upon them.\u00a0Several of those tower arrays or television UHF/VHF (Yagi-Uda)\u00a0sets atop houses are called antennas. But \u2014 insects sniff their environments with antennae.Some words are the same whether you have one or more; not just the same spelling in singular and plural, but also the same pronunciation:Fish (As children, many of us learned this from Dr Seuss, \u201cOne Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish\u201d). Ditto salmon and trout. (I bet readers can inform me of other species of fish.)Thrips (A small\u00a0insect that often infests flowers and spreads diseases; especially problematic in greenhouses.)Sheep, deer, moose.Bison \u2013 pedantic technical note: the North American animal is a bison, not a buffalo, but buffalo is so entrenched in history (i.e. Buffalo Soldiers, buffalo nickel) that the term \u201cbison\u201d seems reserved for ecological/zoological discussions.The American buffalo has just one\u00a0species: Bison bison.\u00a0A single category of interbreeding organism is a\u00a0species, several are different kinds are also\u00a0species.\u00a0\u201cSpecie\u201d refers to coins, such as our buffalo nickel. If I recall correctly, one of the new coins the U.S. mint has released in their recent series is a nickel with a bison on one side. Series is another word that is the same in both singular and plural.Swine (unlike pig -> pigs or hog -> hogs)Complaint: \u00a0people calling plural bovine animals \u201ccows\u201d; the cow is a female that has calved. Call them a herd of\u00a0cattle. Of course, then one has the problem of knowing if the single animal is a calf, cow, [castrated] steer, or bull.\u00a0Then again, depending upon where you are, most of the cattle one passes might be breeding or milking cows, or maybe young steers shortly destined to be burgers and roast-beast. But like \u201cbuffalo\u201d, \u201ccows\u201d seems to be a common-usage term.(Except, of course, amongst small children, who invariably call them \u201cmoo-cows\u201d, which is odd because I\u2019ve never heard any preschoolers saying \u201cquack-ducks\u201d, \u201cneigh-horses\u201d, \u201cbaa-sheep\u201d or \u201cmeow-cats\u201d; go figure.)Interestingly, draft bovine (used for ploughing) are ox ->\u00a0oxen.\u00a0There are few words that retain this archaic plural: child -> children, one brother -> several brethren,\u00a0and hose -> hosen\u00a0(from when one tied their individual hose onto the hem of a garment). Clothes is one of those words that just comes in single form, except it is by default plural.When I teach gardening classes, I add a couple seconds pause after explaining, \u201cIf you\u2019re making a new garden bed, you can either kill what\u2019s there with glyphosate, or slice off the pieces of turf and re-use them, or compost the turves.\u201d Turves is the correct plural for pieces of turf, but we don\u2019t use the term much, so there\u2019s a bit of a mental speed-bump.Did you know that J.R.R. Tolkien invented dwarves\u00a0as the plural for his Middle-Earth race? All other sorts (cutesy fantasy beings, or small-growing forms of plants or animals) are dwarfs.In Zoology class we learned that the plural of penis is\u00a0penes. Common usage (when not using one of the many silly slang terms) is penises. But if you are needing to talk discretely over the heads of younger folk, penes will likely be off their radar.Right now I\u2019m listening to Etta James singing\u00a0the blues; no one ever sings \u201ca blue\u201d (tho\u2019 you can blow a blue note).Then there are the pluralisation questions about which only geeks worry: one\u00a0Mus musculus\u00a0is a mouse, and several are\u00a0mice.\u00a0But what about the computer accessory (um,\u00a0Mus digitus ?) \u2013 computer mouses or computer mice?One datum, a bunch of\u00a0data. But when or how the hell does a person have just ONE datum? A single point? \u00a0I suppose that\u2019s possible, unlike news. Good or bad, there\u2019s never just one news. A \u201cnew\u201d? I tend to get out of the news loop when on holiday; but invariably when I catch up, I find that the news seems more like recycled \u201colds\u201d!One spectrum, a wide spectra, as in \u201cspectral analysis\u201d \u2013 unless of course, one is doing a bunch of analyses on your spectra data.How about one index -> two\u00a0indices.\u00a0Indexes is a verb: \u201cMy program indexes everything for me!\u201d Then of course, it turns around and creates\u00a0indexes\u00a0to hold that data. Hmn. Meanwhile, we still have\u00a0one\u00a0index\u00a0-> two\u00a0indices\u00a0in science, and on the radio news\u00a0I hear indices used as indicators of how the world is going.In geometry, our geometric shapes have sides (planes).

(Meaning, microfine silver dust suspended in water or another carrier.)I was baffled; she explained that \u201cDr Oz\u201d suggested it for sore throats.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we carry that,\u201d I answered, somewhat stunned. \u201cI\u2019ve only used it in a research lab.\u201d (In the teensiest of microdabs, to glue ultra-fine gold wire electrodes to insects.)\u201cOh, it\u2019s all-natural!\u201d she asserted cheerfully.Giant mental sigh and cringe on my end; lots of \u201call-natural\u201d stuff can be all-naturally\u00a0poisonous.The guy with her added something to the effect of, \u201cI bet you all don\u2019t like Dr Oz.\u201dEr, I\u2019m wary and alarmed by media personalities who promote misleading, useless and/or dangerous medical information. (Last year this celebrity was the recipient of the\u00a0James Randi Educational Foundation\u2019s Media Pigasus Award.)But I\u2019m guessing the customer was assuming that if people use bizarre \u201call-natural\u201d remedies, then stores would not sell as many manufactured remedies. Hey, if I want salicylic acid (the stuff in willow bark and spirea that acts as a pain-reliever, fever-reducer and anti-inflammatory), then I will buy it as acetylsalicylic acid, AKA aspirin, because that formulation is less harsh on the digestive system, and you know how much active ingredient you\u2019re getting.When one of the pharmacists was no longer directly busy with [other] customers, I went up and told him about the customer enquiry. His eyebrows danced a bit at this latest oddity.\u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve heard about taking colloidal silver,\u201d I began, and then the pharmacy intern nearby then chorused with me, \u201cWas about the guy who turned blue!\u201d\u201cIt bio-accumulates, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I asked, and the pharmacist nodded. That of course, was why I was careful to not let any dots of the lab stuff stick to me. Plus, any clean crumbs re-deposited could be re-used, especially if I held the bottle to the vibrating vortex mixer.Note: there are antibacterial uses for various ionic silver (Ag+) compounds, such as silver nitrate (AgNO3), but the colloidal stuff is non-ionized metallic form, which has a different biological effect. Of course, poison is always in the dosage \u2014 too much silver nitrate can be equally bad.\u00a0You can read about the hazards of argyria here at the Quackwatch site.Oh by the way \u2014 if you want an \u201call-natural\u201d remedy for the ordinary sore throat, may I recommend some strong mint tea with honey?", "outgoing_links": ["http://articles.latimes.com/print/2011/apr/01/news/la-heb-dr-oz-andrew-wakefield-james-randi-awards-20110401", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Argyria_2.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_mixer", "http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/PhonyAds/silverad.html"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2012/02/11/the-silver-smoke-screen/", "title": "The Silver (Smoke-)\u00a0Screen"},

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t6 October 2012 ", "body": "Now, I am a mint-chip ice cream (-loving) person myself, and dismiss vanilla* for being merely useful as an ingredient base for other treats. And of course, I\u2019m entitled to my opinion. In turn, you all are free to express your own opinions about flavours of ice cream, including your total disinterest in eating ice cream.(* It may be that I lack some kind of flavour receptor[s] to fully perceive vanilla/vanillin, because no matter what sort of sweet or quality of material, vanilla has never seemed to be particularly interesting or tasty to me.)But there are opinions and there are other opinions, and\u00a0Patrick Stokes, Lecturer in Philosophy at Deakin University, teaches his students that they are not entitled to have their opinions.In a recent article, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not entitled to your opinion\u201d he immediately acknowledges this sounds a bit harsh, but explains that the point of a philosophy class \u00a0is learning how to create sound arguments, instead of leaning on beliefs, emotions, and misconceptions of what we think we know. Although opinions may be owned or expressed, not all opinions are equally valid.Stokes skillfully distinguishes between the different things that fall under the vast umbrella of opinion:But \u201copinion\u201d ranges from tastes or preferences, through views about questions that concern most people such as prudence or politics, to views grounded in technical expertise, such as legal or scientific opinions.It\u2019s the conflating of being able to express one\u2019s tastes, preferences, and beliefs \u2014 and then expecting those statements to be taken as seriously as fact-based, logically-sound argument \u2014 that is the major problem.It is a major problem in everyday discourse, and in heated debates within and between countries, and it is an especially prevalent problem in various media. There\u2019s the tired trope* of \u201cgetting balance\u201d by interviewing \u201cboth sides\u201d even though there are often more than just two sides (life is messy that way), and the problem that the opinions of both \u201csides\u201d do not necessarily carry the same factual value (life is reality-based that way).(* More on the problems with the news media and \u201cbalance\u201d in my earlier post, \u201cBoth Sides Now\u201d.)Not all the information one finds or hears is equally valid. As Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, \u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts.\u201dStokes further explains:The problem with \u201cI\u2019m entitled to my opinion\u201d is that, all too often, it\u2019s used to shelter beliefs that should have been abandoned. It becomes shorthand for \u201cI can say or think whatever I like\u201d \u2013 and by extension, continuing to argue is somehow disrespectful. And this attitude feeds, I suggest, into the false equivalence between experts and non-experts that is an increasingly pernicious feature of our public discourse.Wait a minute \u2014 can\u2019t anyone have an opinion about anything? Of course!Can\u2019t anyone express their opinion about anything? Of course!*(* Although it really helps if people take the time to ensure their protest signs are properly spelled and punctuated. Otherwise much hilarity ensues and one ends up with derisive and/or dismissive infamy rather than being taken seriously.)But what unfounded opinion cannot do is carry equal weight when discussions require expertise.Back to our ice cream opinions: \u00a0I know that vanilla bean pods come from a variety of orchid, because that\u2019s a tidbit of horticultural knowledge and I am a horticulturalist. Being a foodie, I have long known that vanillin was synthesized as a less-expensive alternative for use in commercial products, and that it is the primary ingredient in the artificially-flavoured vanilla extract sold at the market.BUT, I cannot be an expert witness or speaker on vanilla.Likely, neither can the majority of you.Not on the cultivars, growing, agri-ecology, processing from raw material to diverse flavouring forms, business economics, grower\u2019s social justice issues, distribution and packaging, artificial synthesis of vanillin, culinary chemistry, historical usage, future trends of natural versus artificial flavouring \u2026 none of that stuff. Nor anything else that didn\u2019t come to mind, albeit I was able to come up with a longish list just because I have that horticultural background and was able to extrapolate what accessory topics could be included.You are entitled to have and to express your opinion, but that does not mean it must to be taken as serious fact; pointing that out is not being disrespectful to you as a person \u2014 it means that your opinion is insufficient to the case.\u2018Personal Opinion\u2019 is not some cloak of factual immunity that one can wear to suddenly become a creditable expert.(Oh, and speaking of public persons with opinions but who are not experts, guess who came along to comment upon Stokes\u2019 article \u2026)", "outgoing_links": ["http://theconversation.edu.au/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978", "http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/bl-misspelled-signs.htm?PS=40%3A65", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanillin"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/its-not-all-strawberry-versus-chocolate-ice-cream/", "title": "It\u2019s not all strawberry versus chocolate ice\u00a0cream!"},

I had trouble with the maths in school, too! I didn\u2019t even learn all my multiplication tables until 8th grade. You know what? It\u2019s not fatal; I slowly went through some pre-College Algebra classes at my local community (junior) college, and filled in the confused bits, gained confidence, and eventually went on to introductory Calculus.And I still have to pause and think on some of my multiplication facts, and still have days when I\u2019m prone to reversing numbers. But those difficulties don\u2019t detract from the fact that I am able to learn math, and they don\u2019t mean I\u2019m stupid. (\u201cTake THAT, \u2018Mr. Dull\u2019!\u201d she says, shaking her fist at a middle-school algebra teacher.)But now I work with students in 7th \u2013 12th grade math, and you know what?\u00a0Good news! It makes a lot more sense when you go back and review it as an adult! You can fill in the parts you missed or didn\u2019t understand, and get a better idea of how it all fits together. Honestly.Math no longer terrifies me, even though my brain still has that glitch that prevents me from memorising the quadratic formula. But I never use the quadratic formula in real life.I DO use ratios in real life, for example, adjusting a recipe, figuring how much stuff to put on my garden, planning travel time\u2026 And I\u2019ll show you how to do those really easily, without getting all tangled up in multiple steps, and you don\u2019t need some mysterious \u201cintuitive feel for how to set the problem up\u201d..~#~.MEANWHILE,\u00a0In our problem above we use Order of Operations.\u00a0I tell my students, \u201cYou use Order of Operations every day! You put your tee on before you put on your shirt, and you put on your jacket last.\u201dThe problem above is solved like this:90 \u2013 100 ( 6 + 3 ) = ?6 + 3 = 9100 ( 9 ) = 90090 \u2013 900 = -810The abbreviation for remembering the order of operations is known to many as PEMDAS, one mnemonic being, \u201cPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally\u201d.Or as Randall Munroe suggest in his XKCD comic, \u201cPlease Email My Dad A Shark\u201d or \u201cPeople Expect More Drugs And Sex\u201d (er, won\u2019t share the latter in school). See the bottom of the post for the cartoon.PEMDAS stands for:\n1. Parentheses\n2. Exponents\n3. Multiplication & Division\n4. Addition & Subtraction\nYou do operations in that order, and left to right.So, you add the stuff in Parentheses first ( 6 + 3 = 9 ),\nwhen you have something outside the parentheses and there\u2019s no other sign, that means Multiply 100 ( 9 ) = 900,\nthen Subtract 90 \u2013 100 = -810.\u201cMn, beer\u2026\u201dHere\u2019s another problem, hopefully something that\u2019s easier to relate to. Now, if maths makes you anxious, you might usually just grab a spare piece of scrap paper and start counting on your fingers and writing down columns of numbers to add up. But frankly, it\u2019s easy to lose track of who you have counted.So. \u201cB\u201d is for Beers, and \u201cC\u201d is for Cases \u2014 there are 12 bottles in a case.How many cases of beer will we need if your friends (the 4 gamers, and the 6 historical re-enactors with their assorted significant others), and my family (my 3 relatives, and my kids with their peeps, that\u2019s, :: counts fingers :: 8 of them) all come over?

(When I\u2019ve used up all the curved parentheses and have nothing but square brackets left, I like to write the brackets as curved parentheses because they are easier to write, and it helps me remember, \u201cOh yeah, multiply what\u2019s by the parentheses\u201d.

ExponentsGee, we don\u2019t have any! That was easy. Move along, move along.3. Multiply and DivideWe do this from left to right.Now, this particular problem has a big line of stuff on the top and a number on the bottom. It\u2019s a division problem, which is the same thing as a fraction.(Seriously, 1/2 means 1 \u00f7 2. 10/8 means 8 pieces of an 8-slice pizza and 2 slices left over from another; you have 1 2/8 pizzas, or 1 1/4 pizzas. I like pizza analogies better than pie \u2014 do you know what a blueberry pie looks like if you try to cut it into eight pieces and eat two? You don\u2019t have 6/8 or 3/4 left, you have a mess left!)The problem can also be written like this, using a forward-slash instead of a division underline, and it will mean to do the same thing:( 48B + 22B + 4B ) / 12 \u00a0 = COR, just write a division sign already:( 48B + 22B + 4B ) \u00f7 12 \u00a0 = CWHAT THE HECK?! Where did she get those parentheses from?Because when we re-write the whole problem on a single line (instead of as a fraction-like division problem), we have to explain that we are doing everything that was on top first, and then dividing by 12.Why? This is because the 12 helps us figure out how many cases, and we can\u2019t do that until we know the total number of beers!That may be obvious here, but it\u2019s easy to forget in other situations, especially when you\u2019re just working abstract problems that are all numbers and variable letters, with no connection to reality.Parentheses: \u00a0( 48B + 22B + 4B ) =(Um, 48 + 22 is8 + 2 is 10, 40 + 20 is 60 + 10 is 70, 70B, don\u2019t forget that B, Andrea!and 70 + 4 is 74, so 74B. Wow, 74 beers.)Divide:\u00a074B \u00f7 12 = CUm, 5 * 12 = 60, so 6 * 12 is 60 + 12 that\u2019s \u2026 72, and 74 \u2013 2 = 2.That means we have 6 with 2 left over.NOW LISTEN UP, FOLKS!This isn\u2019t some silly problem in your maths book. You are NOT going into the liquor store and asking for \u201cSix cases of beer with a remainder of 2\u201d. Do you want to buy 6 cases and be short 2 beers? Of course not! You\u2019re gonna buy 7 cases of beer so you have enough, and because leftover beer is not a problem.Of course, trying to figure out what kinds of beers to get is your problem. (I\u2019m not even going to touch the \u201cwhat kinds of pizza toppings\u201d issue.)Amazingly, there are some math assessment tests that have a similar question, and students can get the WRONG ANSWER. Why? \u00a0Because they\u2019re too used to doing just \u201cbook\u201d math, not real-world math.For example: A school bus can carry 52 students. How many busses do you need to take 130 students* on a field trip?An answer of \u201c2 with a remainder of 26\u201d is silly, what are you going to do, leave people standing on the sidewalk? You need 3 busses!I tell my students, \u201cAlways put your answer into a sentence \u2014 it should make sense!\u201d No, I don\u2019t make them write out the sentence, just explain it to me if we\u2019re practicing, or tell it to themselves.(* Funny, they don\u2019t include all the adults chaperoning those students on the field trip in that number\u2026)FEELING SHARP? TRY THIS PUZZLER:Grab a piece of paper and pencil.EXPONENTS: If you haven\u2019t done Exponents in \u00e6ons, then remember that 5^2 means \u201cfive squared\u201d or \u201cfive times five\u201d: \u00a05 * 5 = 25.(It does not mean five times two! It\u2019s easy for students to get confused when they have 2^2, because that\u2019s 4, just like 2*2 = 4.)The first number is the \u201cbase\u201d or the amount you\u2019re using. The second number is the \u201cpower\u201d or how many times you multiply the base times itself.4^3 means 4 * 4 * 4, which is 4 * 4 = 16, and 16 * 4 is \u2026 64.(Um, 16 + 16 = 32, and 32 + 32 = 64. Or, you could multiply, 16 * 4 : 4 * 6 = 24, and 4 * 10 = 40, 24 + 40 = 64. Whatever. There\u2019s often more than one way to do things, so use whatever method is easiest for you!)Remember, PEMDAS.I\u2019m filling up some raised garden beds with soil. How many cubic feet of soil, S, do I need?One bed is a large L shape (we\u2019ll turn it into a 4\u00d78 rectangle plus a 4\u00d73 rectangle), and there are four smaller beds, including two 4\u00d76 beds, and a square 3\u00d73 bed. One of those small beds is a\u00a0right triangle with two sides the same length, so the area = length squared, divided by 2.The sides are 8\u2033 high, but I\u2019m only filling them 6\u2033 deep. Normally the volume would be length * width * depth, but the length and width are in feet, and the depth is only half a foot. So that\u2019s the total area times 1/2, or area / 2.Worked-out solution is at the very end.[ ( 4 * 8 ) + ( 4 * 3 ) ] + 2 ( 4 * 6) + 3^2 + (4^2)/2\u00a0 = S2______The whole reason we have Order of Operations is because if we don\u2019t all do the operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) in the same order, then we will all get different answers!\u00a0Remember all those incorrect answers to the problem my friend posted? Confusion on the Order of Operations is why folks ended up with different answers.90 \u2013 100 ( 6 + 3 ) = ?If you ignore \u00a0the Parentheses first, you get:\n90 \u2013 100 = -10 \u00a0and\u00a0-10 * 6 = -60 \u00a0and \u00a0-60 + 3 = -63.\nWhich, nobody messed up.

Obviously, we need to add the stuff on top first, and if we want, can re-write this:(44 + 48 + 9 + 8) / 2 = S44 + 48 = 92 \u00a0and 9 + 8 = 17 \u00a0and 92 + 17 = 109109 / 2 = S54 1/2 = S, or we need 54 1/2 cubic feet of soil (or you can write that as 54.5 ft^3).If you\u2019re buying compost or potting soil in bags, it\u2019s 2 cu. ft/bag, so you would need 26 bags, and be just a wee bit short. Or, you could buy 27 and have extra.What if we\u2019re ordering it delivered by bulk? Well, smart gardener suggests putting tarps on the driveway (to keep it clean) and having another one to keep the soil dry because wet soil weights a mucking ton!A yard is 3 feet, so a cubic yard is 3^3 or 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 ft^3.Amazingly, 27 + 27 = 54, which wasn\u2019t planned, but is nice.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t23 November 2012", "body": "Yeah, you\u2019ve seen them: old ladies wearing Old-Lady Shoes.Dowdy footwear that inextricably time-travelled from some economically-depressed post-war period.Or low-heeled, lace-up shoes resembling dull leather sneakers, that shuffled in from the land that fashion forgot.Practical shoes. Hopefully, comfortable shoes, given the tired way those old ladies are getting around. But damn, I mean dayam, if not quite ugly shoes, then definitely shoes without style.And, as you may have guessed, suddenly, here\u00a0I am, too.\u00a0Last fall I broke my foot. The displacement fractures in the metatarsals (the long bones over the arch) mended, albeit crookedly, with offset mends that make them look like rivers with meanders.\u00a0(Don\u2019t fall over in shock when I say that my hypermobility includes rather low arches, too.)This past spring my foot started hurting again, as my second job stocking groceries involved walking around concrete floors and stocking heavy cases \u2014 not good for the osteoarthritis or the broken bones.\u00a0So I got orthotics to provide more support for my poor ravaged feet.But now my foot is constantly aching, and I\u2019m limping, and am getting what I\u2019m assuming are referred pains in my knee and hip. And when I saw the orthopedist earlier last week for chronic foot pain, he disapproved of my buckled Mary Janes I\u2019d worn to my first job, and told me I need to wear shoes that lace up.I\u2019m not much of a fashionista, but I can\u2019t picture wearing either hiking boots or my rumpled black sneakers with skirts, suits or dresses. So that means I need to get a new pair of shoes. Or maybe a pair of knee-high boots.) But, I can\u2019t wear polyurethane (PU), PVC or silicone, which limits me to fabric or leather footwear, which is of course, more expensive.Great! I need to find:\nslightly-dressy,\nlow-heeled (no more than 1.25\u2033 / 5 cm),\nlace-up,\nleather shoes,\nwith removable insoles (so I can replace them with my orthotics),\nin a size US womens 10.5 \u00a0(UK 8, EUR 42),\nwide toe ( C ),\npreferably brown.\nIf you\u2019re laughing and/or groaning, you probably have some idea of the magnitude of that request. I mean, that is pretty specific!\u00a0Not being fond of shopping, I did some quick noodling around online, and discovered that the lower-end department stores don\u2019t carry leather shoes (boo!), and that many of the online sites don\u2019t mention whether or not the insoles can be removed. (I\u2019e also become quite the connoisseur of Web sites with numerous lists of ways to filter search requests.)I also noticed a general lack of lace-up shoes, aside from \u201cgranny boots\u201d with 2.5\u2033 heels. So I looked up the current addresses to the store with a huge, self-serve selection of shoes, and stopped by there en route home one day.They had nifty boots full of brass buttons, sharp-looking tweedy\u00a0spectator pumps [court shoes], loafers and flats with all kinds of fun hardware \u2026 but an absolute dearth of lace-up shoes. (Since I have wide feet anyway, I checked out the men\u2019s section, but was dismayed to find walking shoes with\u00a0heavy\u00a0lug soles, or stiff wingtips so stylishly long that it seemed my feet would look like aircraft carriers, down to the brogues resembling rows of rivets.)I finally asked a sales clerk for assistance, just in case I\u2019d missed something. She was understanding of my requirements, even letting me slip out some insoles to test my orthotics on a couple of pairs \u2014 only to find that the toe boxes were too low-profiled. She too, was surprised to realise that there were so few lace-up shoes. What few they had were made with the insoles sewn down, or were fashioned of (sweat-inducing) imitation leather. And, apparently this year\u2019s crop of sneakers [trainers] comes in neon colors. Naturally, chef\u2019s or medic\u2019s clogs won\u2019t work either.Le sigh. And this is why I hate shopping for wardrobe items (in addition to the noisy lighting fixtures that drill into my head.); it seems that no matter what I\u2019m looking for, it\u2019s not to be had. The year I wanted khaki shorts, I couldn\u2019t find khaki shorts \u2014 yes, khaki shorts! Ditto denim overalls. Or a long-sleeve white blouse with sleeves to fit my arms, and tails long enough to stay tucked in. Or, good grief, cufflinks to go with a French-cuff blouse I found at the thrift store.And so it goes.I already have a pair of black sneakers that I wear (with black trousers) at my grocery job.\u00a0Sorry, but unless I\u2019m evacuating in an emergency, I can\u2019t imagine wearing either hiking boots or my rumpled black sneakers with skirts, suits or nice dresses.All I need to find is a pair of slightly-dressy, low-heeled, lace-up leather shoes, with removable insoles, in a size 10.5 wide, preferably brown. No, I\u2019m not being picky, I\u2019m being particular.The \u201cslightly-dressy\u201d and \u201cpreferably brown\u201d are what I want, but the rest are what I need.\u00a0(And unlike a coworker who has diabetes, neither my orthotics nor my footwear are covered as a necessary medical expense. Those orthotic insoles I had to get cost me half of what I pay for my monthly mortgage!)Even worse, a lot of those \u201ccomfort\u201d shoes don\u2019t lace up or come in 10.5 wide.Or, I can find lace-up \u201cgranny\u201d ankle boots or knee-high boots,\u00a0but the heels are too high, or they are made of some sweat-inducing synthetic.Or, I can find oxfords with the right heel height and made of leather, but not in a\u00a010.5 wide.Or, I can find cute, low-heeled, leather lace-up shoes, but either the insoles are sewn in so I can\u2019t use my orthotics, or else they\u2019re so cheaply made there isn\u2019t any arch support.And so on, and so on.So now I have joined the ranks of older women looking for supportive, sensible shoes that don\u2019t look too dowdy.

In the background are containers of cream-cheese & olive spread , pimento-cheese spread, and a container of Dutch rusks.\u00a0\u201cSalad olives\u201d is the common labeling (in the US) of jars of sliced green Spanish olives stuffed with pimentos.These olives are great for adding to potato salad, and of course, making cream cheese & olive sandwiches.CREAM CHEESE & OLIVE SANDWICH FILLINGScoop some cream cheese or Neufchatel into the mixer bowl, and add half that quantity of well-drained salad olives. Blend well, and spread on bread or crackers.It\u2019s kind of a given that as a result from the slicing during processing, one ends up with a whole bunch of pimentos that have escaped their green olive rings.

{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t7 May 2013", "body": "\u201cWhat are they?\u201d asked my son\u00a0en passant.\u00a0 \u201cScallion pancakes; they\u2019re a kind of fry bread.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t go wrong with fry bread!\u201d he replied, and snatched one to eat before mowing.Yes, Spring is here (again), and we\u2019ve gone through our usual winter-spring-winter-summer-winter-spring nonsense. The daffodils are blooming, the grass needs mowing, and the scallions are up. Scallions are the same thing as green onions, meaning ordinary yellow or white onions harvested when young. I have some volunteer onions in the former vegetable patch (soon to be lawn again), and because they grew from rogue seeds last year, and as onions are biennials, this year they will in turn go to seed if not harvested before that point. I woke up the other morning thinking, \u201cBoy, some Scallion Pancakes sound\u00a0really\u00a0good!\u201d A dim sum from Shanghai, these fry breads are some of the simplest of the tea-house treats to make. If you don\u2019t have any scallions on hand (or found them withered away in the back of the crisper drawer), you can use Chinese chives (AKA garlic chives or Chinese leeks).PREPARING THE DOUGH AND SCALLIONSIn a large mixing bowl, blend together:\n1 1/2 cups (150 g) all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup (125 mL) hot water \u2014 \u00a0plus a tablespoon more, if needed\nOnce the dough is rough and clumpy, liberally sprinkle flour on a clean counter, and knead the dough for a few minutes until it\u2019s smooth and workable. Wrap the dough in a damp cloth or plastic bag and set it aside to rest for 30 minutes (set a timer). TIP: Set the mixing bowl in the sink, and fill with hot sudsy water to soak off the sticky bits. Then I go out to harvest my scallions. When pulling up scallions, knock off the extra soil from the roots, and also strip off the outermost leaf. When onions grow, each onion layer is formed from a leaf; stripping off the outermost leaf removes the thin, dried, dirty layer. In the kitchen, rinse off the scallions (including any soil hiding in-between the leaves), and trim off the roots and brown leaf tips. This recipe only calls for the green parts, so you can set aside the white stalks for a stir-fry or omelette. In a 2-cup (1/2 L) measure, blend together:\n1 1/2 cups (325 mL) scallions, chopped small\n1 teaspoon (5 g) sugar\n1 teaspoon (5 g) salt\nTIP: I wear safety / laboratory goggles when chopping onions, as they keep the fumes from my eyes. Yes, it looks doofy, but it\u2019s the best method I have yet to find to prevent the watering-eyes problem.A pair of safety goggles set atop a pile of scallionsThe scallions need to macerate in the sugar and salt to get soft and tasty, so meanwhile we\u2019re going to do some cleaning up. Remove any clumps of dough from the counter; I use the edge of my square-bladed metal spatula / turner, as I\u2019m too cheap to spend money on an official dough scraper when something else works just fine. TIP: To remove gummy dough bits from the mixing bowl, pour out the suds and use a rubber spatula to scrape off the lumps. Wash the mixing bowl and rubber spatula, plus wash and dry your knife and cutting board, as you\u2019ll need the latter again.ASSEMBLING THE PANCAKESFlour the counter, and cut the dough into two even lumps. Take one lump, and roll / squeeze it into a log 12 1/2\u2033 (35 cm) long.\u00a0Cut the log into five, 2 1/2\u2033 (6.5 cm) long sections. Move four sections aside, and roll out the remaining piece very thin, into a rectangle 10\u2033 x 4\u2033 (25 x 10 cm).(Yes, these conversions aren\u2019t exact, and that\u2019s okay as we\u2019re going to be further mashing up the dough anyway.)Cut log of dough into five evenly-sized sections.TIP:\u00a0It\u2019s hard to use a rolling pin to stretch the dough by just rolling it. So after the initial bout of rolling the dough flat, I use the rolling pin to anchor one end and gently pull, then\u00a0without lifting the rolling pin, lay down the stretched dough and roll the pin over the dough to secure the stretching and flatten it more. Then I roll the other direction to broaden the piece.Hold down one end of the dough with a rolling pin and gently pull on the other end to stretch it out.Now it\u2019s time to fill that piece of dough! Take a tablespoon of scallions and distribute them along the center of the strip, but stop half an inch (1 cm) before each end. (Resist the urge to \u201csupersize\u201d your load; you\u2019ll find out why.)A very thin rectangle of dough with a line of chopped scallions going down the middle.Fold over each of the short ends, and then fold over the top to cover the scallions, and the bottom to cover the top. I\u2019ve never seen any recipe source mention folding in the short ends, but I have found from making burritos and such that tucking in the short end first helps prevent the filling from falling out. Take one end and fold the whole thing over lengthwise (doubled).Filled dough showing one short end folded in first, and the bottom and top lengths folded over each other.Lift from the counter and gently smuush it along its length to make it thinner and longer. Take the end with the original ends, and fold it over a bit.An inch of the open end of the doubled, filled dough has been folded over to begin the coiling process.Then coil up the roll, tucking the outside end between adjoining parts of the ring.The filled roll coiled up, with the end tucked into the next loop.TIP:\u00a0Don\u2019t even\u00a0think\u00a0of trying to use a rolling pin to flatten the coil into a pancake; even using your palm to flatten it onto the countertop doesn\u2019t work well. Instead, dust it well with flour, and use your fingers to palpate the dough, pressing it as thin as possible, all over.Pressing the coil thin between fingers to flatten it. In real life, I generally use two hands; here I was taking the picture with the other hand.Note that some scallions\u00a0wil\u00a0pop out of the dough and create a juicy mess here and there. That always happens. Tuck them in, or just use them in the next pancake.\u00a0Don\u2019t worry your early pancakes aren\u2019t terribly round; they will still taste good.Repeat the rolling, filling, coiling and flattening process with the other pancakes.You might ask, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it just be easier to flatten and fill one of those two big lumps of dough, and then cut it into five pieces, instead of doing each piece separately?\u201d Being an efficient sort, I wondered that myself, and tested my dough with both methods. The fill-then-cut pancakes ended up\u00a0much\u00a0messier, with scallions popping out everywhere. You can see the results here, with the fill-then-cut on the left, and the make-five-individually on the right:Comparing two methods: five of the the messy fill-then-cut pancakes on the left, and five of the tidy make-five-individually on the right.TIP: To easily remove the dough and scallion gunk off your hands, use warm running water and a rubber spatula to scrape off the dough; be sure any dough bits aren\u2019t left stuck on the sink where they might harden.Likewise, scrape off your counter, and put your utensils to soak in warm, soapy water. The washing up will be easy to do by the time you\u2019ve cooked and eaten your scallion pancakes.LAST STEPS: COOK AND ENJOY!Get a large iron or non-stick skillet and heat up a thin layer of oil for frying your pancakes. (On my electric stove, the ideal setting is somewhere between Medium and Medium-hot, but stoves vary.) Do not crowd the pan with too many. The pancakes are ready to turn over for frying on the second side when lightly browned, and the dough looks mostly white instead of translucent. Once fried on both sides, remove to blotting paper.TIP:\u00a0I drape a couple of paper napkins over the pages of an old phone book; the napkins keep the ink off, and the phone book pages provide plenty of blotting ability. Once the cooking is over, I rip those pages from the book and toss them.No sauce is needed for this dim sum; just let the Scallion Pancakes cool enough to eat!", "outgoing_links": ["https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/20130506_220424.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130428_123214.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130428_114756.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130428_115925.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130428_114946.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130428_115018.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130428_113845.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130428_113930.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130428_115848.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/20130428_120522.jpg", "https://qw88nb88.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/20130506_220424.jpg"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/tastes-like-spring-a-recipe-for-scallion-pancakes/", "title": "Tastes Like Spring \u2014 A recipe for Scallion\u00a0Pancakes"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t13 April 2013 ", "body": "Outbreaks of \u00a0fully-preventable diseases are increasingAs reported on Thursday, April 11th in the UK paper\u00a0The Independent, \u201cSwansea measles outbreak: Confirmed cases rise to nearly 700\u2033, which is worse than than last year\u2019s outbreak in Merseyside, England.Over 2,600 MMR vaccines were given last week, but are still insufficient to counteract the number of unvaccinated people, or those who lack the full number of necessary dosages. Public health officials explained that the outbreak will continue to grow. (This is what is meant by \u201cherd immunity\u201d: there needs to be a sufficient percentage of people who are immune to prevent the spread of infection.)And as the article\u00a0reminds us,Before the introduction of the MMR jab in 1988, about half a million children caught measles each year in the UK. Approximately 100 of those died.But for reasons I don\u2019t understand, Andrew Wakefield (who\u00a0apparently suffers from \u2018Center of Attention Deficit Disorder\u2019*), was not just mentioned as a historical reference, due to being a pivotal figure in the paranoia that led to the drastic drop in immunisations. The front page of\u00a0The Independent\u2019s\u00a0online edition for Saturday, 13 April 2013, has in its top, featured article a large\u00a0photograph of him,\u00a0\u201cStruck off MMR scare doctor: Welsh measles outbreak proves I was right\u201c.\u00a0What in the world for?!Why the concern over Wakefield\u2019s opinions being published, with a newspaper\u2019s front-page lead?Andrew Wakefield should not be a featured person of interest for opinions. He is no longer a licensed doctor in either the UK or the US. In 2011, Medscape designated him \u201cWorst Physician of the Year\u201d\u00a0and in 2012,\u00a0Time listed him in, \u201cGreat Science Frauds\u201d. \u00a0There is also a good editorial in the same edition of The Independent,\u00a0\u201cAndrew Wakefield\u2019s baleful legacy\u201d.Wakefield\u2019s unprofessional behavior as a researcher and\u00a0false assertions that MMR vaccines can lead to autism (in a 1998 article in The Lancet, later withdrawn by the journal)\u00a0are \u00a0a bunch of frass (insect dung). Plus, his ongoing media attention and involvement with what initially were fringe groups, inflated such \u2018antivax\u2019 sentiments to mainstream popularity.Vaccination rates dropped drastically, from 92% to as low as 50% in some areas. Measles outbreaks began occurring across Britain, and in 2006 for the first time in 14 years,\u00a0someone died of this preventable disease.(Similar outbreaks happened in the US as well, including mumps. In 2006 got an MMR vaccine then because I had never had mumps, nor been vaccinated for it. Even if I had, the old killed-virus mumps vaccine used when I was a child was found to be ineffective.)Included in\u00a0The Independent\u2019s\u00a0series of articles is the useful,\u00a0\u201cTimeline: How the MMR scare story spread\u201d\u00a0\u00a0by Jeremy Laurance.The feature article: the good, the bad, and the problematicThe front-page feature by Jeremy Laurance is titled,\u00a0\u201cStruck off MMR scare doctor: Welsh measles outbreak proves I was right\u201d.\u00a0Which of course, is not true; Wakefield is just bloviating again**. As the front-page\u00a0subhead reads, \u201cExperts condemn discredited doctor\u2019s outburst pinning the blame for the outbreak of measles in Wales on the Government as cases in the Swansea area rises\u201d.The linked article posted in the Health News section has a different title, \u201cMMR scare doctor Andrew Wakefield breaks his silence: Measles outbreak in Wales proves I was right\u201d (subhead: \u201cAs measles cases rise, experts condemn Wakefield\u2019s outburst\u201d), which begins with with six paragraphs of current events, then describes Wakefield\u2019s assertions in the next eight paragraphs.BUT, the factual counterpoints to the nonsense, clearly stated by, Adam Finn, paediatrics professor at University of Bristol, and childhood vaccines expert, are not given\u00a0until afterwords, in the next nine paragraphs of the article.Unfortunately, not everyone is going to read that far, nor stop to digest the complete refutation of all the idiocy that Wakefield said.I think Finn\u2019s factual material would have been more useful if presented earlier, such as a point-by-point dismissal of nonsense, e.g. \u2018Wakefield claims \u2026 but Professor Flinn refutes \u2026\u2019Alas, perhaps due to following the common news formula of, So-where\u2019s-he-working-now, included this last paragraph, which unfortunately lends him what some might perceive as professional credibility:\u201cDr Wakefield moved to Texas, US, in 2001 where he is director of Medical Interventions for Autism and in January was promoting a reality TV series on autism.\u201dRemember, Andrew Wakefield uses the title \u201cDoctor\u201d because he earned a degree in medicine;\u00a0he is not licensed to practice medicine in either the UK or the US.As I said, Wakefield should remain a historical warning, rather than a featured person of interest for opinions. Adding on the reasons why his comments are harmful nonsense at the end of an article are not enough to detract from the fact that all this frass is featured for free!_____* I didn\u2019t make up the (fictional) COADD \u2014 \u2018Center of Attention Deficit Disorder\u2019, but I sure see a lot of it in our problem students (as opposed to the students with problems, who generally want to avoid being in class).** Bloviating: a lesser-known, but useful addition to one\u2019s vocabulary: to speak boastingly, pompously, aimlessly; as the OED says, \u201ctalk at length, especially in an inflated or empty way\u201d", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/swansea-measles-outbreak-confirmed-cases-rise-to-nearly-700-8568896.html", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/swansea-measles-outbreak-confirmed-cases-rise-to-nearly-700-8568896.html", "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/mmr-scare-doctor-andrew-wakefield-breaks-his-silence-measles-outbreak-in-wales-proves-i-was-right-8570594.html", "http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/physicians-of-the-year/2011", "http://healthland.time.com/2012/01/13/great-science-frauds/slide/andrew-wakefield/", "http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/andrew-wakefields-baleful-legacy-8570168.html", "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/timeline-how-the-mmr-scare-story-spread-8570591.html", "http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/mmr-scare-doctor-andrew-wakefield-breaks-his-silence-measles-outbreak-in-wales-proves-i-was-right-8570594.html", "http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=center+of+attention+deficit+disorder", "http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bloviating", "http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/bloviate"], "link": "https://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2013/04/13/more-bloviating-by-discredited-dr-wakefield/", "title": "More bloviating by discredited Dr\u00a0Wakefield"},
{"date": "\n\t\t\t\t8 July 2012", "body": "Oh, boy howdy! This article by Laura Hibbard,\u00a0\u201cTexas Republican Party Calls For Abstinence Only Sex Ed, Corporal Punishment In Schools\u201d\u00a0nearly made me choke on my cuppa tea. She described just a few of the details the 2012 Republican Party of Texas wants for their state schools. (The article also includes a nicely scrollable copy of their entire Platform Report.)You know me, I\u2019m a science person, with keen interests in education and social justice. \u00a0And I was flabbergasted. It\u2019s like a car crash \u2014 you can\u2019t help but gawp in horrified fascination.\u00a0Well, I had the day off work, so after a house-painting break, scanned through most of the document. It\u2019s one thing to hear soundbites on the radio or in video, but quite another to actually be able to\u00a0read an entire position. For one thing, it gives a person the chance to notice internal inconsistencies, and look things up.In addition to the aforementioned items listed in the title of Hibbard\u2019s article, the Texas GOP\u2019s document lists a lot more in their \u201cEducating Our Children\u201d section. For example, they also want to eliminate preschool and kindergarten, and require daily pledges of allegiance to the US & Texas flags (because that somehow makes one patriotic).Ooh, get this:\u201cClassroom Expenditures for Staff \u2013 We support having 80% of school district payroll expenses of professional staff of a school district be full-time classroom teachers.\u201dYou realize that means giving the ability to hire a number of part-time classroom teachers (and paraprofessionals if they opt to include some) who can be paid WAY less, which will keep a district\u2019s budget way down. \u201cFiscal responsibility\u201d as a loophole for loading up on part-time staff. Who of course often don\u2019t get benefits \u2014 unfortunately, a common practice in education and other industries. (Yes, I\u2019m calling education an industry.)And of course, this next incredible ::head-desk:: concept that (for me) underpins a great deal of their platform:\u201cKnowledge-Based Education \u2013 We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student\u2019s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority.\u201dBecause you know, mastering the subject material and learning how to think critically will undermine the GOP\u2019s fixed beliefs and enable challenging authority. Any challenges to authority will be dealt with accordingly:\u201cClassroom Discipline \u2013We recommend that local school boards and classroom teachers be given more authority to deal with disciplinary problems. Corporal punishment is effective and legal in Texas.\u201dUnder the \u201cPromoting Individual Freedom and Personal Safety\u201d section, this concept continues as,\u201cChild Abuse \u2013 We recognize the family as a sovereign authority over which the state has no right to intervene, unless a parent or legal guardian has committed criminal abuse. Child abusers should be severely prosecuted. We oppose actions of social agencies to\u00a0classify traditional methods of discipline, including corporal punishment, as child abuse. As a condition of funding, publicly funded agencies are to report all instances of\u00a0abuse.\u201dI guess that means starving or raping your children is still criminal, but beating them up is just fine.As noted in a previous section, \u201cStrengthening Families, Protecting Life And Promoting Health\u201d the Texas GOP wants to eliminate the need for anyone to be vaccinated unless they or their parents want them to be. Yeup, reducing herd immunity through vaccination is great for protecting people\u2019s lives and promoting health. [/snark] And naturally, they oppose sex education, except in the form of abstinence until marriage (because that\u2019s SO helpful at preventing those unwanted pregnancies).Here\u2019s a kicker; they also assert,\u201cHealth care decisions should be between a patient and health care professional and should be protected from government intrusion.\u201dEr, except earlier when it says,\u201cWe insist that the U.S.\u00a0Department of Justice needs to prosecute hospitals or abortion clinics for committing induced labor (live birth) abortion.\u201dLet\u2019s get back to the school stuff, how about that topic dear to me, science? Yeah, no surprise there:\u201cControversial Theories \u2013 We support objective teaching and equal treatment of all sides of scientific theories. We believe theories such as life origins and environmental change should be taught as challengeable scientific theories subject to change as new data is produced. Teachers and students should be able to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these theories openly and without fear of retribution or discrimination of any kind.\u201dHmn, does that mean the teacher can say, \u201cCreationism is a load of nonsense and isn\u2019t science any more than other creation myths\u201d?Speaking of religion:\u201cReligious Freedom in Public Schools\u00a0\u2013 We urge school administrators and\u00a0officials to inform Texas school students specifically of their First Amendment rights to pray\u00a0and engage in religious\u00a0speech, individually or in groups, on school property without government interference. We urge the Legislature to end censorship of\u00a0discussion of religion in our\u00a0founding documents and encourage discussing those documents.\u201d(Praying in school is not banned; millions of students to it daily, especially when faced with an exam for which they did not study. What\u2019s banned is requiring everyone to participate in the same prayers and religious observances. You want to \u201csay grace\u201d before eating lunch? Fine. But don\u2019t make everyone in the cafeteria stop and observe the same.)A few paragraphs later religion in public schools\u00a0is explained to *really* mean:\u201cTraditional Principles in Education \u2013\u00a0We support school subjects with emphasis on\u00a0the Judeo-Christian principles upon which America was founded and which form the basis of America\u2019s legal, political and economic systems. We support curricula that are heavily weighted\u00a0on original founding documents, including the Declaration of Independence, the US Constitution, and\u00a0Founders\u2019 writings.\u201dExcept maybe Thomas Jefferson\u2019s version of the Bible that left out Jesus\u2019 miracles and resurrection, as well as other inconvenient points of view by likewise famous figures.Back in that \u201cPromoting Individual Freedom and Personal Safety\u201d it says,\u201cWe pledge our influence toward a return to the original intent of the First Amendment\u00a0and toward dispelling the myth of\u00a0separation of church and state.\u201dBut, that Constitution thing? It says\u00a0(emphasis mine):\u201cArticle. VI.\u2026 Clause 3: The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.\u201dAnd that First Amendment of the ten original that compose the Bill of Rights, written by *ahem* Founder James Madison and ratified in 1791:\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201dYeup, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s your separation of church and state.Of course, originally the Bill of Rights was about the rights of \u00a0White Men, not women, or African-Americans.\u00a0 Surely they don\u2019t mean that when they say, \u201cWe pledge our influence toward a return to the original intent of the First Amendment\u201d? Umm\u2026Whoops, I wandered off school stuff again. \u00a0But then, the whole thing is rife with religion, a particularly narrow sort that seeks to squelch critical thinking, fill student\u2019s heads with pseudoscience, and create a theocratic state and nation.Cartoon by Stanfill.

This isn\u2019t about some stranger, or Those Other People, or \u201cThat Kind\u201d.Children with disabilities or other differences are not diseased or broken. The same is true for adults. Yes, those \u201cpoor, little disabled children\u201d grow up into disabled adults. Gee, so where\u2019s the concern now? It sure isn\u2019t at work; in the U.S. general unemployment is at 5.3%, but for disabled adults it\u2019s twice that at 10.8%.Nor are autistic or ADHD children some kind of modern mystery; millions of such adults have been around for decades, just unrecognized for lack of diagnostics. Most of us are profoundly relieved to find out Why. We still have to deal with the details, but that\u2019s easier when you know that not all your difficulties are from some kind of moral failing, or from a lack of trying (and trying, and trying).WHAT, YOU NEVER HAD KIDS LIKE \u201cTHAT KIND\u201d IN YOUR CLASSES? YOU KNOW WHY?Some were kept at home, because until passage of the IDEA in 1975, US law did not require public schools to teach everyone.Some were warehoused in institutions, badly treated, undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, and oft uneducated.But many of us were there; how we struggled through school and life, without accommodations or understanding, and often the target of bullying by peers and even school officials.Untold numbers of women and men just knew themselves inexplicably \u201ca bit odd\u201d, and did best they could; some succeeding, others not so well.At worst are those who not only lacked resources, but were shunned by society\u2019s classism, ableism, racism and sexism, and (if still alive) are found among the imprisoned, derelicts, addicts, abused and enslaved populations.YOUR CHILDREN AND EVEN COLLEGE STUDENTS WILL LEARN DIFFERENTLY, SO YOU MUST ADJUSTWe are neither inherently stupid nor incapable of learning. Learning differently means teaching differently. Find what works. Everyone has limits, but a consistent lack of success means you should use another method, as well as more time. Sometimes the learning is highly irregular in pace. Tie learning to interests to motivate your children and students.Also, be aware that sometimes the \u201csimple basics\u201d may be entirely bypassed by some students who leap to master higher concepts, albeit often forever struggling with those seemingly \u201csimple basics\u201d. People are humans, not robots. Learning is not always linear.COMMUNICATION IS NOT JUST SPEAKINGNever assume that just because someone is nonverbal they cannot communicate. If you\u2019re not getting their messages, then *you* are doing something wrong. Nor should you assume that because someone is nonverbal that they cannot understand what people say (though the processing may sometimes be delayed). Nor assume that because someone has been nonverbal for years that they\u2019ll never speak. And damn, will you get an earful.INCONSISTENCY IN DAY-TO-DAY ABILITIES IS FRUSTRATING FOR ALL, AND NOT A CHOICEImportantly, just because someone is able to speak or do a task one day, that does not guarantee consistent results. It\u2019s the nature of disabilities \u2014 regardless whether considered mental or physical \u2013 all involve the brain. Brains are funny things, and many of us have a few buggy Beta-version programs in our wetware. It\u2019s frustrating as hell for all involved.But don\u2019t assume the \u201ccould-then-can\u2019t-now\u201d is intentional. \u201cOh, he can hear me when he wants.\u201d \u201cWell, you could solve those equations just fine yesterday.\u201d I can guarantee that after a lifetime of such, ridiculing people and punishing them for things they cannot help only increases performance stress.While that stress might increase focus from sheer terror, it often squelches overall functioning. (Do you want me to listen to you, or try to recall yesterday\u2019s process, or slowly figure it out on my own? I can only do one \u2014 if my stomach will stay down.)TRAMPLE THE TROPESIgnore the media tropes and centuries of religious hype: disabled people are neither inherently amoral, soulless and evil, nor are they infinitely happy, friendly and angelic. People are people. A few will be nasty bits, some will be profoundly good sorts, and the rest are just ordinary folks who get mad, sad and glad, who screw things up sometimes, and who will also serve others selflessly despite bearing more abuse than anyone should.We are definitely not incomprehensible, incomplete, little autism-puzzle-pieces, unloving, unlovable, or uncaring.We are whole people with all the same cares, needs and wants as all humans. Beware \u2014 disability happens to anyone at any time. We aren\u2019t a Them, and YOU can be among the world\u2019s 15% in just one day. We are all Us.STOP \u201cTEACHING TOLERANCE\u201dBecause tolerance means putting up with something one doesn\u2019t really like, or that doesn\u2019t really belong. We want full-fledged ACCEPTANCE.Nor should we only be acceptable if we can somehow \u201covercome\u201d our differences enough to pass for Normal Real People. Trying to \u201cpass\u201d all the time is exhausting, and invariably breaks down, oft resulting in the [supposed] Normal Real People assuming that one is lazy, stupid, crazy, all the above, or worse.Training children for hours a day how to artificially perform \u201cacting normal\u201d does not serve to help them learn how to function best in the world. Yes, of course teach good manners, social and work skills. But suppressing every twitch of one\u2019s natural being adds to stress, making everything else yet more difficult. This is especially when performing like a \u201cnormal person\u201d means not doing the harmless things that reduce stresses.STOP THE BLAMEI must call out the terrifying, unaddressed assumption which underlies so much daily trauma: \u201cThe reason the disabled [children] are targeted by bullies is because they are perceived as being weird\u201d. Despite the pervasiveness of this social theme in society, most people are functionally unaware of it, all the while instilling in their Normal People children the same message. Normal People children need to act normal, and not act like That Kind. After all, that\u2019s how the Normal People know the others are That Kind, who\u2019s Us and who\u2019s Them.But it\u2019s the disabled and different who are taught, over-and-over-and-over that not only is it their fault for behaving or looking weird, BUT ALSO if they weren\u2019t so weird, well then they wouldn\u2019t be bullied. \u201cQuit being so weird! Just say No! Just say Stop.\u201dJust say BULLSHIT. Because this is blaming the victim. The problem is not that everyone isn\u2019t the same, the problem is that there are bullies.Even worse, blaming the targets actually empowers the bullies, because the social story says it\u2019s the victim is the one who is acting wrong, so it\u2019s not really the bully who is to blame.Let\u2019s just top off all that existing anxiety and depression with the trauma of trying to seek justice, but being told again that, \u201cWell it\u2019s your fault, you know. Attracting attention by being weird, and bugging people. You need to quit making trouble now. You already take up too much of our time with all of your \u201cspecial\u201d needs. Quit whining and go deal with it. \u2014 But no fighting, because we\u2019ll know it was you who started it.\u201dBy the way, it\u2019s not \u201cjust a kids at school\u201d thing that everyone will \u201cgrown out of\u201d. It continues on through college, and happens at work, too.YOU CAN\u2019T WALK IN THE LITTLE BOY\u2019S SHOES; THEY\u2019RE FLOATING DOWN-RIVERIt is NEVER acceptable to murder disabled children. Nor should these repeated, horrifying events be considered \u201cunderstandable\u201d or \u201cexcusable\u201d, with the murderers being pardoned just because their son or daughter had a disability.Increasingly more prevalent in social media, the crime becomes insidiously deemed more and more acceptable. Murderers re-cast themselves as martyrs, acquiring champions to their cause. Throughout repeated blog posts and news stories, they bemoan how taking care of disabled children is just too unbearable, they had to take care of them every day of the week, there was never any relief or help. (Even though there was.) Cue the groupies\u2019 hand-wringing and protests upon the villains\u2019 behalf: \u201cOh but won\u2019t you walk in their shoes, how they\u2019ve given up their lives, this wasn\u2019t at all what they wanted.\u201dFor in true sociopathic fashion, the poor, long-suffering parents revel in the attention, announcing to the world \u2013 sometimes ahead of time \u2014 what they have done, and all the while describing themselves as the victims. The dead children (young or adult) are unwanted, and deemed unwantable, less than human just because they couldn\u2019t speak, or needed medical treatments, or used a power chair, or didn\u2019t play with their toys the \u201cright way\u201d, or wore adult diapers \u2026 No one would want to live like that; the thing\u2019s better off dead. And what of the groupies? Well, where do you think people get such terrible ideas that it\u2019s okay to kill one\u2019s own children?ENOUGH WITH THE \u201cDISABILITY INSPIRATION PORN\u201d.Quit using those heart-tugging videos, walk-a-thons, telethons, and other grand-society functions to win your supposed Cosmic Brownie Points for giving us your pity. Please stop dumping upon us the largesse of your unwanted rags (so Victorian, so pass\u00e9), or creating useless functions requiring us to serve as targets of unwanted helpful-helper-helpiness for your ego-boo.Get disabled people out of \u201csheltered workshops\u201d. Yes, people need work they are suited to. But the segregation and token sweatshop \u201cwages\u201d are an embarrassment and humiliation to all.YES, CHILDREN GROW UP. YEP, STILL DISABLED, BUT NOW ADULTSDo not assume your children will remain permanently childish and incapable \u2014 they mature on their own timelines. Allow adults to be adults. Support their needs and interests, but neither dress them like children, nor expect them to live their lives in na\u00efve pre-puberty stasis, without adult desires for socializing with adult peers, life-long learning, mastering skills for some kind of job (even if that job is \u201cjust socially productive work\u201d rather than traditional work), and yes, having a love life, however that may be expressed.YES, PEOPLE ALSO NEED ACCOMMODATIONS; THAT DOESN\u2019T MEAN \u201cCURE\u201dMost disabled or different people are not looking for cures to magically change them into someone else, some kind of fantasy Normal Real person that their families wanted instead. Our differences may result from physical events, by random mutation, and / or genetics. Your genetics. We are family. I\u2019m Me, and I like being Me. If you somehow changed all the differences in my brain, I wouldn\u2019t be Me anymore, with all my quirks and abilities.Of course it will be great to find a means for preventing migraines, epilepsy, fatal medical conditions, et cetera. But it\u2019s also a sad fact that some people have been so convinced of their undesirability as disabled human beings that they can only see \u201ccure\u201d as a means to being an acceptable Normal Real Person. (Worst of all, some people commit suicide because they\u2019ve been taught to hate themselves, as useless and unwanted.)But what\u2019s really alarming is all the fund-raising, talk, research, and work going on today to eliminate entire kinds of peoples. I\u2019m talking about the thousands of selfish individuals and sociopaths who believe that anyone with neurological or morphological differences should not exist at all, because That Kind takes up too much time, money, and resources.That\u2019s not \u201clooking for a cure\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s eugenics and euthanasia, the same ideas that led to the Nazi Aktion T4 program and other horrors. (In my youth, the state hospital was still in the regular habit of sterilizing people. Had I been institutionalized, I might well not have had my lovely children and grandchildren.)Yes, we want assistance, we want things that help us achieve what we want in life. Getting the things one needs to learn effectively, to move about, attend to their own needs, to work, to play, to be a part of the community, to have lovers or families. These things should not be seen as extraordinary, special, absurd, or a waste of money, just because they aren\u2019t the same kinds of things used by other people. 15% of the people in the world have disabilities. That is a lot of humanity, and many are uneducated, abused, neglected, avoided, or shut away, depriving the world of incredible amounts of untapped abilities and talents.CALL OUT BULLSHIT.
