That\u2019s my wife and my daughter (15) taking a walk. Oh, and our dog, Roxie. Do you know why I\u2019m posting this picture? Not because I love these two (which, of course, I do), but because of how proud I am of my little girl. The fact that she is out on a walk shows how courageous she is. \n \n \n \nYou see, about four weeks ago, my daughter had a seizure. It was her first. Not a little tremor\u2014a grand mal. You know, the kind where you\u2019ve fallen to the floor convulsing, with your eyes wide open but seeing nothing. The kind where you can\u2019t remember anything about it. The kind where you wake up as the paramedics are gently placing you on a stretcher and wheeling you into an ambulance. Terrifying stuff. \n \n \n \nThen, ten days later, she had another one. The first one was in our house, but this one was out in public, at a food court. Again, it was a grand mal, and it lasted longer than the first one. Fortunately, I was there with her, so I knew to roll her onto her side, cradle her head, and wait it out. Again, she woke up, disoriented, to emergency personnel hovering around her. \n \n \n \nSo what does this have to do with the picture up there? Everything.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Overcoming \u201cWhat If.\u201d \n \n \n \nEvents like these would be traumatic for any adolescent girl; they can be positively paralyzing for a girl with ASD and anxiety disorder. The randomness of the seizures, the lack of memory, the waking up surrounded by strangers\u2014it\u2019s all so upsetting. The largest question that looms in her mind now is \u201cWhat if?\u201d What if I have another one? What if Mom and Dad aren\u2019t around? What if it happens in front of my friends? \n \n \n \nShe\u2019s on anticonvulsants now, and she hasn\u2019t had a seizure in two weeks, but that doesn\u2019t matter. The anxiety is so big, and the autistic tendency to perseverate is so strong, that the mere possibility of another event has kept her pretty much homebound ever since. She even missed an appointment with her counselor, whom she really likes. \n \n \n \nNow do you see why this picture is so precious to me? Katie and I have convinced her that she needs to start getting out. We\u2019re starting slowly, having her join us as we walk the dog in the mornings. And she\u2019s doing it! She\u2019s walking, she\u2019s talking about everyday stuff, and she\u2019s not perseverating over the seizures.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n(The walking stick? That\u2019s because she has mild scoliosis, and it helps her posture.) \n \n \n \n Different Drums. \n \n \n \n \nNow take a look at this picture: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDo you see that plush doll in her right hand? That\u2019s Phantump, one of her favorite Pok\u00e9mon characters. She is rarely separated from this creature, and when she is, she\u2019s holding another one of the more than 100 she has collected over the years. They are her security blanket. They bring her comfort. They help her bridge the gap between the fantasy world she so enjoys and the real world, which is fraught with challenges and dangers. \n \n \n \nSo there\u2019s my daughter, out in public with a walking stick and a plush Pok\u00e9mon. While most girls her age are swooning over boys, preparing for their learner\u2019s permit, and paying close attention to their appearance, here is my girl, walking to the beat of her own drum. She\u2019s fighting her fears. She\u2019s facing down her anxieties. She\u2019s pushing through some things no fifteen-year-old should have to face. And she\u2019s still standing. \n \n \n \nThere was a time when I\u2019d object to the plush doll. \u201cYou\u2019re a young woman now. For God\u2019s sake, leave that thing behind!\u201d There was a time when I\u2019d try to force her to push through her fears more quickly than she was ready to do\u2014usually to disastrous results. There was a time when I knew pretty much what I wanted her (and all my kids) to be, without paying too close attention to her unique personality. But if walking this autism path with my kids has taught me anything, it\u2019s to throw away all of my expectations and to not care about how other people look at them. Those concerns were more about me than the kids, anyway.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo march on, girl! I don\u2019t care if you need to take five Pok\u00e9mon with you. I don\u2019t care if you choose one of the most ornate, obvious, obnoxious walking sticks possible. Do whatever you need to do. Just keep moving forward. Today, it\u2019s a walk with Mom, Dad, and Roxie. Next Sunday, it may be joining the whole family at Mass. Or maybe not. It doesn\u2019t matter. Take it one step at a time, and we\u2019ll be right there with you. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese pictures, and this story, have been posted with the kind permission of my daughter (and, of course, my beautiful wife, Katie). \n \n \n \n Leo is one of my favorite autism dads. He also runs a blog and a Facebook Community called  \"Autism Blues\" .\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Leo and his wife Katie live in Maryland with their six children, ages 7 to 16, all of whom are on the autism spectrum. \u00a0Yes. You read that right! Six children on the spectrum! I am truly inspired by their humor and grace as they parent their six children. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qLL82Rkd7sU/V3wz9acATlI/AAAAAAAAE_Y/LShG7Ohyf_wBuwl0t6WauYd6g_QKRlA6ACLcB/s1600/image1.jpeg", "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZDXVDsb4aCk/V3w0LgNjF6I/AAAAAAAAE_c/zxsxwZRjElEnJ4s-33m6VphnKSiagPQjACLcB/s1600/image2.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/autismblues?__mref=message_bubble%22"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2016/07/shaken-not-deterred.html", "title": "\nShaken, Not Deterred \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 3, 2010", "body": "\n Last night I wrote out a contract for Red -my 15 year old to get his blu-ray drive installed.\u00a0 There are four objectives: \n 1) Be ready for school on time. 2) Use respectful language to your family 3) No purposeful teasing of your brother 4) Take showers without talking back \n He booed, hissed and screamed unfair. He said I was asking him to be perfect. I actually gave him some room for imperfection.\u00a0 Out of 5 possible tokens for the day, if he gets 4, he will meet his objective.\u00a0 So far, he is having an awesome day.\u00a0\u00a0 \n Unfortunately for me, today was early release day in our school district.\u00a0 I'm sure the teachers were thrilled.\u00a0 I however was not.\u00a0 This is the day I usually take my mom to get her hair done, followed by lunch with a cocktail.\u00a0 I can taste the margarita I missed right now -damn it!\u00a0 \n So the boys come home hungry. Blue -starts to make his Stouffers chicken and mashed potatoes.\u00a0 Red -grabs a box of cereal.\u00a0 Blue goes ballistic!\u00a0 \n \"You can't eat now! Get out of here!\" He can not stand the sounds his brother makes when eating.\u00a0 He wants to control when, where and how much he eats.\u00a0 Of course he can't do that, but I do whatever I can to keep the peace around here.  \n Blue proceeds to grab the cereal box from Red, and ads a few kicks and punches for good measure.\u00a0 Mind you -he is 100 pounds lighter than the big brother he is hitting.\u00a0 I get that it bothers him to hear the sounds of his brother chewing.\u00a0 I get that he is upset because it's raining today.\u00a0 That always puts him on edge to say the least.\u00a0 It has gotten better.\u00a0 At least he's not hiding in the bathroom when it's just drizzling thanks to the new medicine. I was just telling my friend that it seems like I have my sweet son back...well not today.\u00a0 I guess I can't expect perfection. \u00a0 \n I separate the boys -had Blue retreat to his room while Red smacked on his cereal downstairs.\u00a0 I'm running up and down trying to keep them apart.\u00a0 When Blue is angry -the mere sight or sound of his brother sends him into a tailspin.\u00a0\u00a0 \n After things died down Blue passes me a note.\u00a0 We write back and forth:  \n \"Do you hate me?\" \"I don't hate anyone.\" \"Are you mad at me?\"\u00a0 \"No.\u00a0 I'm just tired.\" \"Why can't you give Red away to the state?\"\u00a0 \"This time he didn't do anything wrong.\u00a0 He just wanted to have a snack -just like you.\" \"Was it my fault?\" \"You could have let me handle it and just removed yourself like I was asking?\" \"I know that, but why didn't it happen?\" \"Because you were really angry. You can't help that. I just wish you would realize that I am trying to HELP you.\" \"I'm sorry.\"\u00a0 \"Me too.\"  \n By the time everyone was quiet...mommy was exhausted! I sat down and tried to soothe myself by doing some online browsing.\u00a0 My eye lids were like heavy blankets.\u00a0 I could hardly keep them open.\u00a0 These episodes just zap me. I left Craigslist and Soma Intimates behind, went upstairs and took an afternoon nap. The cold and rain may not do much for Blues mood...but it's some kind of wonderful to crawl underneath the covers and sleep my blues away.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/11/perfection.html", "title": "\nPerfection\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, November 4, 2010", "body": "\nAt 4 a.m. I hear a loud determined knock at my bedroom door.\u00a0 It's Blue. \"I need a breathing treatment,\" he says.

Sure -but there is no thought of anyone other than himself. \n \n\"I don't know what time you fell asleep.\u00a0 It really doesn't matter right now.\u00a0 Why are you waking me up?\" \n\"I just want to know what time I went to sleep.\" \n \nCut to breakfast.\u00a0 It's a cold morning, I want to make a hot breakfast for both boys.\u00a0 Blue comes down to eat first.\u00a0 He eats his waffles and I make him an egg over easy. \n \n\"Thank you for breakfast mom,\" he says. \n\"You are so welcome son,\" I respond. \n \nRed fell asleep last night without eating a real dinner.\u00a0 I prepared hot waffles and scrambled eggs for him as well. I wanted him to have a solid breakfast before he took his medicine and went out into the cold morning.  \n \nHis response:\u00a0 \"I don't want those waffles.\u00a0 I want cereal.\" \n \nI made this boy hot waffles and eggs, which he likes.\u00a0 Does he show any appreciation? NO! There is no thank you. It just doesn't occur to him, unless he is prompted.\u00a0 He says exactly what's on his mind despite how it comes across or how it makes someone feel. \n \nHe ate the waffles and eggs and of course was too full for any yucky old cereal. He enjoyed it, but didn't say so.\u00a0  \n \nThis goes to show us all just how autism (more specifically Aspergers) can show up differently in each individual.\u00a0 Just look at the contrast between these two brothers. \n \nSome people with Aspergers can come across as real jerks.\u00a0 It's not intentional.\u00a0 It's just how they think.\u00a0 Can they be taught to think differently, to say please and thank you? Sure...will they actually mean it? Maybe...maybe not.\u00a0 I wish my son good luck getting and maintaining a relationship with a wife someday if he doesn't learn how to be appreciative.\u00a0 Of course, I'm just his mother, the one who gave birth to him and spends every waking moment thinking about his well being.\u00a0 Why do I deserve any gratitude? \n \nThankfully, I love these two brothers unconditionally -even if one of them makes me want to slap him into next week!\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/11/tail-of-two-brothers.html", "title": "\nTale of Two Brothers\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, December 28, 2010", "body": "\nThis year was a different kind of Christmas for our family. \u00a0We've taken strange to a whole new level, but strange can be a good thing when you have a family like ours. We celebrated Christmas on Christmas Eve this year. \u00a0Everyone was pleased with their gifts. \u00a0Blue did not get his IPad, but he did get the Apple T.V. and a new television for his room. \u00a0The one he had was more than 25 years old. He was happy. \u00a0Red, got gift cards galore which along with money he has earned doing chores, will put him close to scoring that camcorder he wants. \n \nOur eldest son and his girl came to the house. \u00a0We shared a meal together, which I ordered. \u00a0That's right I did not cook! Blue and I did bake Toll House and sugar cookies for dessert. \u00a0We all exchanged gifts. \u00a0I couldn't believe they brought Blue a turtle (which of course, I will end up being responsible for). \u00a0In fact, since Blue was leaving the very next day, guess who's been feeding it while he's gone?! \n \nWe celebrated Christmas Eve because half of our crew (Dad and Blue) were leaving on Christmas morning to go to North Carolina and Georgia to visit with my husband's brothers and their kids.  \n \nIt may seem a bit odd that our whole family isn't spending the holiday together. \u00a0But you see, we don't have one of those conventional kind of families, where everyone sits around the fire singing Christmas carols while \u00a0eating milk and cookies. \u00a0The truth of the matter is that the boys are quirky, anxious and they fight quite a bit which takes away from the \"fun\" of it all.  \n \nNow last year we all went away together to visit my husband's parents. \u00a0Parts of the trip were fun...but overall, it was exhausting! \u00a0I spent most of the time trying to keep meltdowns from happening. All of the cousins were together at Grandpa's house. \u00a0They played, made videos, opened presents, etc. \u00a0Blue didn't sleep well most of this time because he likes to sleep alone, with no sounds to disturb him. \u00a0This is a little difficult to accomplish when the house is overflowing with family. \n \nAfter Christmas, we all headed to Florida to go to Universal Studios. \u00a0 Red was under a great deal of pressure to be well behaved around his grandparents, so as soon as they were out of sight, he'd have these horrible melt-downs, which we would try to keep as quiet as possible so that the grandparents wouldn't feel the need to get involved, which of course would make matters worse.  \n \nThe truth of the matter is...it was a very expensive, exhausting trip. \u00a0Most of our family vacations leave me thinking, \"Why did we do that? \u00a0That wasn't fun!\" \n \nSo this year we decided to break up the party a little bit. \u00a0And the truth is, yes, I confess..I couldn't be happier! \n \nRed took a trip earlier this summer with his Dad, were he was very well behaved (because I wasn't around). \u00a0He also took a trip by himself to see my family in California, where he had a complete blast. \u00a0Blue had a trip alone with me and Dad to Sea World this summer (that one wasn't so fun). \u00a0He was still pretty anxious during that time. \n \nBlue has calmed down quite a bit, so he and his dad are off visiting his uncles and cousins. There are no moms involved on this trip and the boys are having a great time. \u00a0They had a white Christmas where he got to play in the snow. \u00a0He has slept pretty well, except the first night that he shared a hotel room with his dad (the snore monster). \u00a0After that night he shared a room with his cousin and slept much better. \n\u00a0 \nSo this Mom spent Christmas day sitting on her butt by the fire...eating cookies for breakfast, drinking wine and eating leftovers for dinner. \u00a0Red went to have dinner and play video games with a friend while I flipped from one Christmas movie to the next. \u00a0My Mom went off to California to visit my brother for the holidays, so I was literally all alone on Christmas.  \n \nDon't tell anyone...but this may very well be the best Christmas ever! \n \n \n Red, Harry and Blue, December 2010 Happy Holidays to you and Yours!\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TRopDx89FpI/AAAAAAAAAEk/yCC7DsUBwR8/s1600/look%2540harry.JPG"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/12/unconventional-christmas.html", "title": "\nUnconventional Christmas\n"},

There he is!  \u00a0He literally stops in his tracks, does a u-turn and gets behind me. \u00a0This dog loves and licks everyone. \u00a0Why don't you get that? \u00a0Why do you seem to thrive on annoying others? \n \nI don't understand complaining about the way you look, being upset that you've gained weight, yet refusing to swim or go to the gym with regularity and refusing to change your diet to include more protein instead of just carbohydrates. \n \n \n Why is it that both boys have Aspergers....but they are so completely different? \u00a0So different in fact, I almost question that they both have the same disability. \u00a0 Blue can be so thoughtful, protective and helpful. \u00a0He is truly a joy to be around. \u00a0Why is it that one medication has done wonders for him? \u00a0Yet, Red takes several medications and his behaviors are still pretty horrible. \u00a0 \n So the doctors say that you also have Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Attention Deficit Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, BiPolar NOS. \u00a0All of these conditions are subsequent to your Aspergers. What does that mean really? \u00a0Does it really just mean that your symptoms of Aspergers are severe? \u00a0Your outburst of anger and depression come from frustration of feeling different, and not connecting with peers the way you would like to? \u00a0I don't really see any mania -any massive feelings of euphoria...ever. \u00a0Unless the mania is when you're talking non-stop and not really making any sense. \u00a0Is your lack of focus because you simply have no interest in the subject that's being taught? \u00a0You certainly can focus when it comes to something you actually WANT to do. \u00a0Why have you always been an intricate, complicated puzzle that I don't know how to solve? \n Why is their no miracle med that does wonders for your disposition? \u00a0Why are you still so unhappy and you seem to work so hard to make others around you just as miserable? \u00a0I love you, but why is it so hard to be around you? \u00a0Why do you engulf our home in your misery when we are your safe haven? \u00a0We are the ones who love you and do everything within out power to make things better for you. \u00a0 \n Why do you thrive on arguing with me more than anyone? \u00a0Why do my feelings not seem to matter to you?\u00a0Why is it that everything I do for you is never enough? \u00a0 \n I have a zillion more questions about your future? \u00a0Will you be able to live on your own?

It's a very simple process. \u00a0They give us this little blue pass that allows him to go through the exit and give this pass to the operator, who will let them on the ride . \u00a0I go through this process with him for several rides, walking across the sauna like park . \u00a0He gets the swing of things. \u00a0I then find a comfortable cool seat where I play word games on my Kindle as I sit in the shade. \u00a0We are in touch with each other via cell phone. \u00a0He checks in with me periodically.  \n \nHe finishes up his day of riding and video taping. \u00a0We have dinner at his favorite restaurant BJ's and then we hightail it to our hotel. \u00a0It's a 90 minute drive back home. \u00a0However, I knew after a day at the park, I wouldn't feel up to driving back home. \u00a0We used points to book a hotel suite so that I could drive 10 minutes to go pass out afterward. \n \nOne may wonder...why are you going by yourself? \u00a0What about your husband, your other kids? Yes...I have three children and a husband. \u00a0My eldest atypical son (age 23) I don't talk about much here. He is off living his life without much regard to the family who raised him, including his teenage brother who could really use a big brother. \u00a0 Well, we are not your typical family who can go off for a day of family fun and actually enjoy it.  \n \nBlue got to spend the day with his dad -alone! \u00a0Breakfast at I-Hop followed by going to the movies to see \"Fast Five.\" \u00a0They went to the mall and then bowling. \u00a0They had a fun-filled day together. \n \n \n \n Just the 2 of Us!\u00a0 \n This option kept the day simple. \u00a0I didn't have to be pulled in 2 directions as one child wants to go one way and the other child wants to go another. \u00a0I didn't have to deal with my husband's complaining about his bad knee.\u00a0We could listen to Linken Park in the car without anyone complaining.  \nI had the flexibility to march to Red's beat for the day -to only have one high maintenance being to deal with. \n \nI am proud to say...I survived without incident. \u00a0He was cooperative. \u00a0He didn't complain (much) about anything. \u00a0For the day, he was able to have things  HIS WAY .  \n \nThe following morning I listen as Red is singing in the shower. \u00a0Blue hates when his brother sings. \u00a0He would have been having a fit if he were there. \u00a0I smile as I hear him singing. \u00a0The boy who usually talks about how horrible his life is...is singing. \u00a0Singing ='s happiness...at least for the moment!. \n \nHere is the video that he made: \n \n \n \nPlease help keep my self-esteem in place...Click below! \"You like me!

{"date": "Wednesday, May 4, 2011", "body": "\n It's that time of the year when we are reaching for any excuse to be angry and not have to go to school. \u00a0Red's World Geography teacher was gracious enough to allow him to show the Six Flags video that he made over the weekend. \u00a0He didn't get the response he wanted or expected. \n \nThere were a couple of students who asked, \"Why are we watching this? I hate Roller Coasters!\" At least that is Red's interpretation of events. \u00a0This may or may not be what actually happened. \u00a0According to him, \u00a0there were other students who were on their phones texting, and not paying attention. \u00a0This is typical behavior for a group of teenagers. In fact not all that long ago we went to a film event after he completed a film camp last summer. \u00a0They were playing all of the short movies the students made in camp. \u00a0Red complained the whole time. \u00a0\"This is boring! \u00a0When can we leave?\" \u00a0He asked over and over again, only wanting to stay long enough to see the film that HE made. \u00a0I remind him of this. \u00a0\"That was different. \u00a0I was tired,\" he says. \u00a0\"Well, maybe the students in that class were tired.\"  \n \nI wasn't there, so I couldn't tell you from his report whether or not anyone had anything positive to say. \u00a0He chose to focus on the negative. \u00a0He comes home upset, yelling, with the angry face. \u00a0I am able to redirect him pretty quickly. \u00a0I tell him that all my readers on the blog loved his video! \u00a0(Yes...I stretched the truth.) But that was enough to get him off the negative trip...that is until this morning, when it was time to get on that bus to go to school.  \n \nHe attempts flipping over the coffee table and bangs on a few doors and walls. \u00a0We have the run-of-the-mill screaming to the top of his lungs. \u00a0He throws a fit like that of your average toddler...only he's 15 years old and nearly 200 pounds. \u00a0He refuses to brush his teeth and get on the bus when it arrives. \u00a0 Once his meds kicked in fully, he calms down, cleans up the mess, brushes his teeth and I take him to school. \n \nSuddenly, he can't handle his classes. \u00a0\"People in my classes are out of control,\" \u00a0he says. \u00a0\"They are loud. I can't handle it.\" \u00a0All of his teachers are mean ...they're not supportive. \u00a0It's so hard to figure out what is Live and what is Memorex. \u00a0What is real vs. what is imagined, magnified, exaggerated and plain old untrue.  \n \nHis teachers paint a different picture. \u00a0He is passing all classes. \u00a0He is doing his work. \u00a0He is talking to peers in his classes. \u00a0He has a group to eat with at lunch. \u00a0Peers are talking to him. \u00a0He gets lots of high-fives and hellos in the hallways. \u00a0I witnessed a few \"What's up man?\" greetings this morning when I took him to school and walked him to his BASE class. \n \nHe's tired of school!??? \u00a0Well guess what?? \u00a0So am I!  \n \n My Facebook status today: \n \n\"I dreamed of a white padded room last night.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Show me some love!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BQ_cHJkUITY/TcFxh4JX5BI/AAAAAAAAANA/VFvE3pesw0g/s1600/images-20.jpeg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QJxVsUtG_Bw/TcFutEF2LII/AAAAAAAAAM8/zswQOjRI3Ug/s1600/Unknown-2.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/05/last-month-of-school-blues.html", "title": "\nLast Month of School Blues\n"},

I am NOT a BAD Person! I come from a good family! \u00a0We don't have any money to pay any damn tickets!\" \n \nI kindly ask him to remove himself from my room until he can have a civilized, respectful conversation. \u00a0He is spinning things and what he is saying does not add up. \u00a0He is not making much sense. \u00a0It's crazy talk. \u00a0I can't figure out exactly what happened. \u00a0I ask him to leave my room until he calms down. He refuses. \"But I NEED TO TALK to you!\"  \n\"I will be glad to talk to you once you have calmed down.\" \u00a0After much coaxing...and by coaxing I mean, \u00a0\"If you don't leave my room now...I'm going to start swinging this belt! \u00a0If you happen to be in the way of it's landing...then so be it!\" \nThis boy is twice my size...I can not physically remove him, but he has to go! \u00a0I can see that he is not completely out of control...just angry.  \n \nAn hour later we have a more lucid conversation. \u00a0It's beginning to sound like it was a good conversation with the Campus Resource Officer. \u00a0 The officer was just walking through the class saying hello to one of the teachers. \u00a0He is a very friendly guy. \u00a0Red walked in to the class, saw him, and they start talking. \u00a0It was kind of a mentoring session...and yes, they do talk about the incident with the friend in the hallway the week before. \u00a0He explains the law about following people, and making them feel \"uncomfortable\" and what the results of that can be. \u00a0They go on talking for over an hour about a variety of subjects.  \n \nHowever, by the time he gets home, he has it turned it all around in his mind. \u00a0His irrational fear of being arrested like they do on \"Cops\", pepper spray, beating the suspect, etc. \u00a0settles in to his mind. \u00a0What is coming out of his mouth does not have anything to do with what actually happened.  \n \nLucky for me, I have leave to go leave to go to Open House at Blue's school. When I come into Red's room before bedtime we have this very lucid conversation where he tells me, that everyone at the high school is just trying to do their job. \u00a0\"You don't understand mom. \u00a0They are all trying to help me. \u00a0I have to take responsibility for my actions. \u00a0I am a good person. \u00a0I have a good heart and I come from a good family. \u00a0There are no criminals in our family. \u00a0No one is in jail...and I won't be either.\"  \n \nHe goes on to say, \"Mrs. Blank (his special ed. teacher) helps me a lot! \u00a0I can't leave to go to a private school. \u00a0I really need her to help me. \u00a0No one else is going to help me like she does. I can't leave all of my friends there. \u00a0I'm starting to make friends there. \u00a0I'm not kidding Mom! \u00a0I am not going to that private school!\" \u00a0He takes it a step further, \u00a0and has the same basic conversation with his dad the following morning before school. \u00a0NOTE: In his \"responsible\" state of mind he actually gets up ON TIME..on HIS OWN, and is ready BEFORE the bus comes. \u00a0 So it is possible!   \n \n20 minutes later...he arrives at school. \u00a0Suddenly, the irrationality reappears. \u00a0He walks into the classroom where his loving, helpful, teacher is and starts, \"Why the HECK DID YOU MAKE ME TALK TO THAT OFFICER YESTERDAY!?\" \u00a0He goes on and on and on all day long...refusing to do any work. \u00a0Mind you...she had nothing to do with his talking to the officer. \n \nBy the time he gets home yesterday, \"Mrs. Blank is a liar! She's the worst person I've ever met! I can't go to that freakin' school anymore! Mrs. Blank just wants me to go to jail! \u00a0That's all she ever talks about. \u00a0She lies to you! \u00a0She talks badly about you!

{"date": "Thursday, September 1, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nThe question that has been floating through my mind for the past few days is this: Is my son failing at school or is the school failing my son?  \n \nHe's not your average -cookie cutter kid. \u00a0He is a puzzle with ever changing pieces...what fits one day may not fit the next. \u00a0Yet, he is in a school that is pretty much designed for cookies...plain sugar cookies with the round shape that all fit together nicely in the package. \u00a0The world will never revolve around him...he will have to adapt to the world. \u00a0The difference is...once he is an adult, HE can decide where he wants to make his place in the world.  \n \nIf he is uncomfortable being around hundreds of people at one time, he can find a job in a small company. Or perhaps he can work for himself. \u00a0If he doesn't want to or is unable to go to a large university, he can choose a small technical school, or community college, or art school. \u00a0He can take classes online. \u00a0He does not have to choose to be in a large environment with multiple distractions that leave him in sensory overload. \u00a0Right now, that is what he is being forced to do. \n \nSo we're at the beginning of the school year and we are back to the same issues that we were having last year. \u00a0He has already been in trouble for yelling in the hallways at another student. \u00a0He is trying to befriend someone who does not want to be bothered. \u00a0He is being ignored...he gets angry. \u00a0He yells \"You don't have to run away from me. \u00a0I'm not a monster.\" It is not in his thought process that he is making the student uncomfortable. \u00a0 I just want to be a friend . \u00a0He has no concept that it's kind of creepy. \u00a0He does not  naturally  read or have a concept of other peoples feelings. \u00a0 This is called mind-blindness, an Aspergers trait.  \n \nHe acts impulsively without thought of the results of his actions. \u00a0 Do you really think that yelling and bringing negative attention to yourself is going to bring you what you want...more friends? \u00a0Or will that make people have \"weird thoughts\" about you? \u00a0Will it bring you a reputation of an angry person that people should stay away from?  You have to walk through this thought process with him after the damage has already been done. \n \nThe thing is...the school is aware of this behavior issue, he did this a couple of times last year. \u00a0Yet, they allow him in the hallways, unsupervised during the first week. \u00a0I guess they were giving him the benefit of the doubt. \u00a0Obviously, he didn't get the memo. \u00a0He didn't understand that he was being given an opportunity to make the right choices. \u00a0He acted on impulse, out of desperation and anger. He did not past the test. \u00a0He did not gain a friend. \u00a0What he got instead was an Administrative Directive...a black and white, concrete direction that says, \"THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR. \u00a0THIS IS NOT ALLOWED! \u00a0YOU CAN NOT BEHAVE IN THIS MANNER. \u00a0If YOU DO THERE WILL BE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.\" \u00a0If you go out into the world and behave this way...you will not fair well. \u00a0You can not yell at your peers. \u00a0You are intimidating them! THIS IS WRONG! \n \nOf course...at the same time what he does not realize is that the school has to COVER THEIR ASS! \u00a0For liability purposes, \u00a0they have to have a documented trail that says, they are doing something about this behavior. \u00a0Although, it was  their  decision to put him out there...hoping that he would swim and not sink. \u00a0You see, the school is designed for the masses, for the cookies that are all the same shape and size. \u00a0Who march in a row...doing what they are told...doing what is expected. \u00a0It is not really designed for those who don't fit the mold. \u00a0I can be upset about that...and intense desire to pull him out of the fire before he gets burned. \u00a0The thing is...the world is not designed that way either. \n \nHe is swimming upstream...against the tide. \u00a0Except, public school is not really a river or a stream...it's more like a vast ocean. \u00a0He is a big fish on the outside, but on the inside...he's a guppy. \u00a0He does not naturally have what it takes to make it. \u00a0He needs a great deal of guidance and supervision. \u00a0 He should not be put out there to sink or swim without having some intense swimming lessons. \u00a0Even then, there are no guarantees when you are dealing with mental illness (bi-polar NOS) Aspergers and impulsive behavior, that he will be willing and able to do the right thing. \n \nHe does have an intensive support system at this public school. \u00a0He has a special education program and teacher who are working very hard to support him. \u00a0Do I always agree with the decisions they make? \u00a0No...I do not. \u00a0The thing is...he is nearly 16 years old, ultimately HE needs to make some good decisions and be responsible. \u00a0There will not always be someone there to coddle him and hold his hand. \u00a0 His head is thick! \u00a0It takes a lot to penetrate...to get through to him and then he has all of these lovely road blocks and filters that cloud his judgement. \u00a0Ultimately, that's what we are all trying to teach him independence and self-responsibility. \u00a0It's a painful process. \u00a0It's going to take a lot of work from all sides...school, us and most importantly from him. \n \nThis is an ongoing saga that I can not complete in one writing session. \u00a0One thing I know for sure...is that there will be more episodes to follow in this mini-series called life with Aspergers. \n \nI love to hear your thoughts! \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nTK2oatL32o/Tl-q8uso-YI/AAAAAAAAATc/47ED5EAcTEQ/s1600/images-3.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/09/school-failing.html", "title": "\nSchool Failing?\n"},

I got to take a 30 minute flight, instead of a nearly 3 hour drive. \u00a0What a luxury! \u00a0Well, except for the going through security where I had the pleasure of having my first body scan and pat down. \u00a0Woo hoo! \n \n \n \nThis time her tween girls were at home instead of at their Dad's for the weekend. \u00a0One of the girls graciously gives up her room for me to sleep in. \u00a0She has a very comfortable king-size bed. \u00a0They allow me to shut the door and take naps if I want to. \u00a0My friend's husband is also so gracious to me. \u00a0You would think he hates to see his wife's gabbing best friend coming through the door...again! \u00a0Nope...he is great! \u00a0He knows me well, so he makes sure there is always plenty of wine and champagne in the house. \u00a0Therefore, the need for naps. \u00a0This time he even drove to take us shopping!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is a new addition in their family. \u00a0I not only have my lovely niece/godchild to hug, kiss and play with. \u00a0I also get lots of cuddle time with my new nephew! \u00a0He is 2 months old. \u00a0I get to feed him, and change him. \u00a0I think that is the entire reason I was put on this earth...to love and take care of babies. \u00a0It's just too bad, they have to grow into teenagers! :-D \n \n \n \nOn Saturday evening the family included me in their annual Christmas tradition of going to see The Nutcracker. \u00a0As you know, I have boys who have no interest in seeing a ballet. \u00a0Although, suddenly they had curiosity about it because I was going...without them. \n \n \n \nLet me just say...it was a magical evening. \u00a0I am always so impressed by what dancers can do with their bodies. \u00a0I don't have the body frame to be a ballerina, but I certainly wish I could spend hours a day working on my body's strength and toning. \u00a0A girl can dream right? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I have known these little girls since they were toddling around! \nLook at them now! \n \n \n \nThe entire family is loving, generous and gracious the entire time I am there. \u00a0I hate to say it, but it's true. \u00a0It's such a stark contrast to my life at home. \u00a0Where everything is tense, argumentative, and I am constantly avoiding land-mines. \u00a0The respite that they provide for me is invaluable and one of the biggest blessings in my life. \u00a0I am eternally grateful for their love and friendship. \u00a0They are my other family...and yes, my husband is jealous! \n \nThis weekend that I am writing about happened a couple of weeks ago. \u00a0I'm already ready to go back! \u00a0Thank you sister-friend. \u00a0I love you.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Re5_KuW6hMY/Tv30ZHvCT_I/AAAAAAAAAkY/MSbu47RXQ4k/s1600/BellaPlay.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jzIJ-4_a49Q/Tv3u0T8i3fI/AAAAAAAAAj4/8qPkSznkcQ4/s1600/corvinhat.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5OZW3AOesOw/Tv3vKO4aZZI/AAAAAAAAAkM/F6wOdTdiJpU/s1600/meandgirls.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/12/my-respite.html", "title": "\nMy Respite\n"},

I feel that it is always me who has to talk to them. Why is it always me that has to talk first? I give them plenty of time to speak. It really makes me frustrated when friends do that. And I don't even know if these people are my friend. That's why I don't add everybody on Facebook. Because not everyone is your friend.\" \n \nHe got good feedback from a few friends (typical teens I might add). \u00a0They told him the same thing that I always do, \"Join a club where you can find people with mutual interest. \u00a0Friendships take time. \u00a0Don't worry things will work out.\" \u00a0Hopefully, he will believe them. \u00a0He certainly doesn't believe me. \n \nIn some ways, he is wise beyond his years, \"Everyone is not your friend.\" \u00a0On the other hand, his feelings break my heart. \u00a0He has come so far in a years time. \u00a0He has more friends than he had a year ago. \u00a0He is now in a much more supportive school environment. But he is still reaching for the stars...he wants to be friends with THOSE people over there!  \n \n \n\"I want to be friends with normal kids!\"\u00a0 \n \n\"Why do all of my friends have to have special needs?\" \n \n\"Why do I have to have this stupid Aspergers?! \u00a0It's not fair!\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHow about be happy that you don't have to eat lunch alone...that there are people who seek you out and want to be your friend? \u00a0That's not good enough. \u00a0He wants to reconnect with peers from his elementary school that he hasn't seen in 4 years. \u00a0He is back in our home-school where he knows more people from the past. \u00a0He wants to go into the loud cafeteria and sit with them. \u00a0Although, they have probably already formulated groups that will be difficult to break into, which will really make him angry when they don't all turn around and make him the center of attention. \u00a0 He has no idea how to have idle chit-chat about the non-sensical things that typical teens talk about. \u00a0He is not seeing things the way they are...or the way they will be. \u00a0He sees them in this fantasy medium...the way he WANTS them to be. \u00a0I can't tell him that though. \u00a0He doesn't believe me.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSome people with Aspergers can't stand being around a lot of people and the energy that it takes to maintain conversations, much less friendships with people who really don't \"get\" them. \u00a0Not my boy...he is longing to be a part of the popular crowd. \u00a0Well...I want to be skinny and have smooth, silky clear skin like the airbrushed models in magazines. \u00a0Anyone have any miracles for sale...cheap? \n \nHe's right about one thing...you shouldn't have to work so hard for friendships. \u00a0You shouldn't have to always be the person who speaks first, or who calls more. \u00a0A real friend will seek YOU out as much as you seek them. \u00a0Friendship should be mutual...it should develop naturally out of mutual interest, common ground and genuine feelings for one another. \u00a0Red wants the average, typical teenager to understand his Aspergers and how he see's the world. \u00a0 It will be a miracle if this happens in the large group of typical teens that he wants to be a part of. \u00a0Most teenagers are innately self-centered and into themselves...especially the popular ones. \u00a0Unfortunately, they are not trying to take the time out to understand themselves...much less, understand someone complicated, mopey, and moody with special needs. \n \n \n \n \nWe are lucky if we find a handful of true friends over a lifetime. \u00a0I have been truly blessed in that department. \u00a0The thing is...I'm not picky. \u00a0I love people who love me despite my high-maintenance craziness. \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VvI07xrT5zA/TtZYd9gVwoI/AAAAAAAAAhc/7K5mU4-2gCE/s1600/Twins+.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/11/not-everyone-is-your-friend.html", "title": "\nNot Everyone is Your Friend\n"},

We are not where I want to be, but I continue to be grateful for small blessings.\u00a0 \n \nDear God, \n \nI wrote you not to long ago asking the question, \"Seriously? You think I can handle this?\" \u00a0Well...obviously you were listening. \u00a0I was so stressed out then. \u00a0Red was extremely depressed and already having issues at school. \u00a0Being around all of that negative energy was weighing on me heavily, zapping my energy and bringing me down...way down.  \n \nSo Lord, I want you to know that I appreciate all of the blessings you have given me in the past few weeks. \u00a0We tweaked Red's meds again...a process I find extremely excruciating. \u00a0I just loathe the fact that he has to take these medications. \u00a0However...things are so much better! \u00a0Thank you for giving me the strength to hang in there and not give up on the process. \u00a0Thank you for helping him to feel better. \u00a0Thank you for turning him back into the boy that I always knew was in there somewhere.  \n \n Thank you for his new school and all of the staff that work tirelessly to help him, even when he acts like he doesn't want any help. \u00a0Thank you especially for his social skills class and teacher who he relates to and actually listens to. \u00a0 \n \nHe still has his rough moments, but he reigns it back in quickly, seeing the error of his ways. \u00a0He is taking responsibility for himself...getting up with his alarm clock ( mostly ),taking his showers daily (without argument) getting ready for school on time every day ( most days ), doing homework on his own, attempting to change his diet. \u00a0Last night for dinner he ate chicken breast, wild rice, and corn. \u00a0He asked for seconds! \u00a0He's eating spinach salad. \u00a0I don't take these things for granted. \u00a0I am thankful.  \n \nHe had a successful birthday party, where he socialized and really enjoyed himself...WITH FRIENDS. \u00a0A year ago I asked you to send him just one good friend. \u00a0You did that. \u00a0He is still working on the friendships at school, and even that is in the works. \u00a0I ask you to continue to work with him on that. \u00a0He is trying to join the wrestling team...I pray that works out for him. \u00a0I pray that will give him some connection at school...something to be happy about. \u00a0I pray that it will help him to look better, feel better and get healthier, physically and mentally. \n \nI am thankful that both boys can now sit down to the table together and have breakfast and dinner without constantly picking at each other ( most days) . \u00a0A year ago, even a few months ago...this simple thing was not possible. \u00a0I am thankful that both boys, now pray, with regularity and without prompting. \u00a0Red is going to church with a friend, un-prompted by us.  \n \nI am thankful for how well Blue is continues to develop friendships, that he is conquering the overwhelming homework and making excellent grades. \u00a0Middle school is no longer a place that causes him grief...but he loves to be there ( most days ). \u00a0He loves learning and the routine of it all. \u00a0He is already thinking about college and what it will take to get there. \u00a0That is a HUGE blessing! I am thankful that his pallet continues to grow and that he is so adventurous with food, vegetables and fruit!  \n \nWe still have lots of areas to work on and continued blessings to ask for. \u00a0Today, there are just so many baby blessings in our lives, I will reserve\u00a0requests for more blessings for later...knowing that in your time...you will give them to us. \n \nYou may not come exactly when I call...but you always show up on time. \u00a0Thank you... \n \np.s. \u00a0I take that back...I will ask that you bless all of my autism moms, dads and their children. \u00a0Give them hope. \u00a0Things will never be perfect, but they will get better. \u00a0I am thankful for everyone of them who reads this blog and participates in my\u00a0 \"Confessions\" Facebook community . \u00a0They bless me daily... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yhg2oGN5Qbs/TntNW1CoOwI/AAAAAAAAAVI/cVrdIBm0qjs/s1600/images-5.jpeg", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/09/dear-god-thank-you.html", "title": "\nDear God, Thank You (redeaux)\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 15, 2009", "body": "\n This was a stress that I didn't want or need.  The situation would be comical if it weren't so sad.  He is so naive, and lacks so much common sense.  I keep wondering how he had a 4.0 through out high school.  Did they give him the grades because he was a football player?  We've all been 21 and made mistakes...but this boy takes the cake! I mean you spend your whole life raising him, trying to give him the best possible environment, the best schools, a full-time mother, a hard working, ethical, honest father.  Yet makes choices like he was raised by village idiots!  I hoped that the majority of our parenting was done -but it never ends unless you cut it short.  We have stop helping him so that he can bite his nose to spite his face,  and then pray that it hurts bad enough to teach him some difficult life lessons.  So I'm at the climax of my yoga class in down dog,  hopefully the last one before  savasana  (meditation where you clear your mind and take in all of the poses that you've just completed).  The door opens and somehow I know.  \"Is there a Karen W- in this class? Her husband is on the phone -he says it's an emergency.\"  Shit! Did one of the kids get hurt? I hope it's not anything serious.  I get up from down dog and answer the phone.   My friends are all concerned when I return for my mat and blanket.  \"Is there anything we can do?\" I'm touched by this.  Of course the answer is, \"No -I'll be fine.\" I hall ass over to the pool to pick up my children and their friends who have been kicked out of the facility because Kendal was using curse words at a couple of young ladies.   Wonderful .  Isn't my life just  freakin  wonderful?  When I arrive which is literally five minutes later.  The boys run towards the car screaming and upset that they were all kicked out when they didn't do anything.  Of course Kendal claims it wasn't his fault.  The girls dropped the F-bomb on him first. I verify the story with the head life-guard.  It's true the girls did curse at him first, but he over reacted and his volume was turned on loudspeaker.  I can only imagine the whole scene as other parents of small children nearby are horrified by his behavior.   A few of them chime in their two cents, which is like  adding  fire-crackers to a smoldering flame.  The  crescendo  was being  disrespectful  to any adult who crossed his path.  Once you set off a kid with  Asperger's ...it takes time and patience to rain him back in.  He has to get away from the situation, calm down.  Then of course he is apologetic for his behavior, angry and self loathing because of his lack of control.  The natural consequence is that he is suspended from city pools for one week.  I added that he will not attend a public pool with out my presence until I can be assured of self-control, which is never.  From now on he will swim at our local pool or another pool where we have membership and I will be present.  So much for inner-peace. BTW -one might ask, \"Why didn't your husband go and handle the situation instead of calling you out of your class?  What was he doing was he too far away?\"  When we got home -he was laying across the bed watching the All-star game.  His reason for not going was that he was too stressed out after dealing with \"21\" earlier in the day.  Mind you...he made one phone call to our son.  I talked to him,  texted  him half a dozen times then followed up with the creditor.  This is why I don't work outside of home.  These boys -even the one that's out of the house, are more than a full-time job.

{"date": "Monday, July 13, 2009", "body": "\n I found myself craving alcohol yesterday. Poured myself what was left of a bottle of wine at exactly 5:04 p.m.  I was so proud of myself that I actually made it till 5:00 since it was a particularly lonely day.  Alan got on a plane to New York around 10 a.m.  I wasn't motivated to much of anything.  It's so freakin' hot outside in this miserable Texas summer heat.  I feel like a prisoner in my own home at least during the day. I spent the majority of the day drawing with pastels.  I find that putting my anxiety into a creative project helps quite a bit.  Not that I'm some great artist or anything.  I just love working with colors.  I do best with kind of abstract pieces.  There is no right or wrong when you work in abstract.  In fact, I textured the entire downstairs of my house with glaze. What I loved most about doing it, was that there is no wrong way, no mistakes.  It would be great if life worked that way. I called my dad yesterday, which is an exercise in hilarity.  It takes a lot of strength lately to pick up the phone and call him.  You have to prepare yourself for a certain amount of bullshit. I have to admit that he does always make me laugh.  He finds a way to put in these digs about my brothers and sisters and how he never hears from any of them.  He make outrageous accusations about their personal lives, which you have to take with a grain of salt and just laugh.  Then you wonder what he is saying about you when he's talking to them. We will be going home to L.A.  for a visit soon.  My boys can't wait to see him.  They love him unconditionally, without judgment.  I love him because he is my father and he did contribute directly and indirectly to the person that I have become.  I tribute my love of music, my sense of humor, the calm and outrageous sides of my personality to him.  I will allow the boys to spend time with him with mixed emotions and angst over what he will say to confuse and damage them.  Some of my siblings have given up on allowing their children to spend time alone with him.  I figure the boys don't get to see him often, and as he is 80 years old, we never how much longer they will have him in their lives.  Besides they get a kick out of all of his cursing.  They don't get to here it much at home. My second drink was an unsatisfying margarita, which made me think I should stick with wine.  The high is much more mellow.  So I went to the store (to get eggs)  and bought another bottle.  It was a leisurely Sunday after all.  Besides, it would go great with the pizza I picked up.  I refused to cook for my little ungrateful heathens.  Unfortunately, the bottle wasn't cold enough so it went unopened last night.  I was actually proud of myself for going to bed without it.  I confess...I did however make and partake of a lemon ice-box pie (my grandmothers recipe) that I don't plan on sharing with anyone if I can help it. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/07/cravings.html", "title": "\nCravings\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 21, 2009", "body": "\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fourteen years ago on September 18th, I delivered my first child.\u00a0 My son has grown from 5 pounds 13 ounces, 20 inches, into a young man who stands 5 feet and 8 inches and over 180 pounds.  When he hugs me he swallows me up, his arms feeling like sandbags. I believe that I am the one person in the world who knows and understands him like no one else. I am his mother, my blood runs through his veins and he will always be a part of me.\u00a0 I feel every bit of pain and whatever little joys that he feels.\u00a0 I am in many ways his voice, his advocate, the one who fights the battles that he has not learned how to fight for himself.\u00a0 I am the one who nurtures him and loves him -even when he isn't very lovable, which is often. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course his father knows, loves and understands him, but fathers are not the same as mothers.\u00a0 His father has the task of showing him ow to be a man and how to survive in the cold harsh world -a job that I could never do.\u00a0 However crazy it may be, I feel inclined to try to protect him from the harshness of the world, even if that doesn't make any sense or isn't based in reality.\u00a0 As we have seen with our older child, you can only raise them up and show them the way.\u00a0 Once they grow up they have to make their own decisions, even if often they are the wrong ones. He has to make his own way.\u00a0 We can only pray that some day they will finally stop and read the map that you have spent your life drawing for them. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On his birthday, in true Asperger's form, Kendal opens his gifts from us and shows very little expression other than perhaps -confusion.\u00a0 I had wrapped up this software program we bought him, in a new t-shirt and pair of jeans.\u00a0 It wasn't the exact version that one he actually asked for. He asked for the 'professional' version to the tune of $600, which was  so  not happening.\u00a0 We bought the consumer version of the video editing program for less than $100, which is more than what he needs to upload his movies to YouTube. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 He gave us a half-assed smile and thank you, but he had to play it all out in his mind and get the facts before he gave the appropriate thankful response.\u00a0 He had to investigate to see if the program would actually do -what he wanted it to do.\u00a0 Once he figured that out, he gave us words of thanks and gratitude -but it was a little to late for his dad.\u00a0 He saw it as being ungrateful -not as being a socially immature, inappropriate, Asperger's response.\u00a0 When I remind dad of this, he tells me that I am making excuses for him (like I always do) -setting him up to be just as ungrateful and spoiled as the one that has already left the nest.\u00a0 The 21 year old who continually makes selfish, stupid decisions, such as throwing away his first year of college and our fourteen thousand dollars of tuition right along with it. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The way '21' has turned out so far, makes us both question the parenting decisions that we made when raising him.\u00a0 Should we have bought him that car when he was sixteen? Did we give him too much? Sure -we probably made some mistakes, but I don't think our mistakes are the reason our eldest continues to make dumb choices.\u00a0 God gave us all free will and his adult life so far is a series of\u00a0 bad choices that he has made. They have absolutely nothing to do with our parenting.\u00a0 There is something to be said about nature versus nurture.\u00a0 We gave him our love, support, a safe home, a good education and opportunities that we never had. It was his choice to squander them. \u00a0 Unfortunately, there isn't a lot we can do about that. That doesn't stop our hearts from aching or our heads from throbbing every time we find out that he has done something else completely assinine.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the two children we have left at home, we have to try to find balance in the way that we raise them.\u00a0 We have to consciously make them aware of how cruel the world is, and stress to them how hard they will have to work in order to make their lives a success.\u00a0 We have to meet the challenges that they face head on as African-American boys who have Asperger's Syndrome.\u00a0 The world will not be kind to them.\u00a0 But does that mean that we can't be? We have to teach them and process through to show  them the appropriate response when someone goes out of their way to do something nice for them.\u00a0 We also have to understand that they are who they are, although that may not be who we want them to be.\u00a0 14 is an infuriating age for most teens, even more so for one who is socially clueless.\u00a0 Both of our boys do however, have special gifts, talents and abilities.\u00a0 We have to try to hone those gifts and turn them into skills that will create a career whereby they can share those gifts with the rest of the world, while creating, financial and personal independence for themselves.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We put a lot of energy into  raising our children, including the one who has left the nest.\u00a0 And although he has disappointed us so far, we have to remember that his life is just beginning.\u00a0 We have to cut the strings and ties and allow him to make his mistakes -pray that he learns from them and that in a few years we will look back on his knucklehead years and laugh.\u00a0 Right now, we have to laugh to keep ourselves from crying.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 15, 2009", "body": "\n For the first time in over a week -I made it to an exercise class.  For the first time since the beginning of the summer,  I attended Yoga.  My schedule has been so screwed up with  the boys out of school.  Their appointments, camps and play-dates that often interfere with my early morning Yoga class.  Not to mention that my favorite yoga instructor quit because of being mistreated by management, but that's a whole other story. Even though it's been well over 100 degrees for the past few weeks here in central Texas, this instructor had the bright idea of making it a heated yoga class.  The heat is supposed to help us sweat out the toxins and help our muscles relax.  Meanwhile,  the rest of you is swelling from the heat, especially those of us who eat too much salt and don't drink enough water. How did I manage to get away at 6:30 on a Tuesday evening? I dropped the boys and a couple of their friends off at one of  the city pools nearby, as I have done many times this summer. I confess -I feel this deep sense of elation whenever  I drive away without my children.   This time however, I notice that I did not have my cell phone in my purse (slight panic).  I left it charging at the house (what else is new?).   \"I'll only be gone for an hour,\" I rationalize.   Hubby is at home and they can call him if anything comes up.   \"I deserve this hour,\" I tell myself.   He's been off duty on a business trip for the past couple of days. I've been with them 24/7 well 24/2 anyway. Did I mention that my day started off  with another headache.  I spent the better part of the day on the phone with our eldest son (lets just call him \"21\" in order to protect the innocent or not so innocent).  I received a phone call from a creditor with whom \"21\"-allegedly signed some idiotic contract with, and has not been able to pay since he lost his job a couple of months ago.  (Another long story).  Let's just say I spent a lot of time trying to get him to face up to his responsibility. Why do I even care?  I don't want him to ruin his life with stupid, avoidable mistakes! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/07/down-dog.html", "title": "\nDown Dog\n"},

My 10 year old son comes home with the flu!\u00a0 I'm like -great! When he woke up yesterday appearing to feel a little better I asked, \"How are you feeling this morning?\" \n \u00a0\u00a0 He replied,  \"I feel like my brain wants to be left alone.\"  He went on to explain that he still feels achy and his eyes hurt. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His regular doctor is  a very tall, handsome, well dressed guy, a fellow democrat I found out when I took my \"Dreams of my Father\" by Barack Obama into his office one day.\u00a0 He's an extra 15 minutes away, but I've stuck with him partially because he's a really good, understanding and informative doctor and partially because he's really good to look at. Well he was all booked up, so I took him in to the more local clinic to see another pediatrician who's schedule was wide open. So he runs a lab to find out that he does indeed have strain A of the flu. Then he's like \"Well, I could subscribe Tamiflu.\u00a0 It could cut the illness by 24 or 48 hours, but it may not. A lot of people complain about it bothering their stomach and then they stop taking it.\u00a0 Also, it's kind of expensive.\"\u00a0 I'm like - well could you be anymore on the fence about it? I mean your just so definitive.\u00a0 I really know what to do based on your recommendation . Geez!\u00a0 I go on to ask him about the flu shots and the swine flu coming this fall and winter.\u00a0 He's like, \"Yeah you can get the shot.\u00a0 He may or may not still get the flu. We're not really sure if the vaccine will cover the strain that's coming.\" I'm like,  Wow! If feel so reassured!\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I left there a little pissed at the whole situation.\u00a0  I confess  -when I got home I called the school nurse and told her that Cole definitely has the flu.\u00a0 I also told her that in hindsight -I was disturbed the other day when I was sitting in the cafeteria watching the teachers instruct the students to take their dirty trays and pass them down the center of the table. These are trays, that they have all touched with their hands and put their hands in their mouths to eat.! Gross! I don't think that is the best way to pick up the dirty trays.\u00a0 Someone should be wearing latex gloves as they pick them up,\u00a0 and then wash their hands afterward! No wonder he has the freakin flu a week after school started!  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have to admit -this was one of those days when I feel blessed to be at home to take care of my sick child, to take him to the doctor.\u00a0 On this day, I am happy that I don't have a job to feel guilty about calling in to because I have something more important to do. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/Sp6Zfryo3_I/AAAAAAAAAA4/PjAvY1BSreU/s1600-h/dadandcole+069.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/09/quote-of-day.html", "title": "\nQuote of the Day\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 1, 2009", "body": "\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I confess that I am horrible at being consistent.\u00a0 The only thing I do consistently is take care of my children, my husband, my dog, my plants and my home. Well, I guess I am also a consistent daughter who calls her mother on a regular basis.\u00a0 She is my reality check, my friend, and the person in the world who knows me best.\u00a0 What would I do without her? Now that I think about it, I am also a consistent sister and friend to the people in the world that I truly connect with, so I guess I should stop beating myself up.\u00a0 I suppose these are fairly admirable traits.  \n \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I must also admit that I am not always  consistent with disciplining my children.\u00a0 I have many excuses for this.\u00a0 For one,  I often find myself trying to balance out their father who I think is a harsh disciplinarian. He says he's just being a \"man\".\u00a0 The way males think is so weird...but whatever.\u00a0 I am often too sympathetic to their plight. I remember when I did the same sort of things when I was a child. So when my son comes to me and says, \"I'm sorry mom I broke your mirror,\"\u00a0 I remember my mom going ballistic when I broke something, or spilled a drink on the table. Therefore, I simply accept his apology and tell him to stay out of my bathroom or just have him make his best attempt at cleaning up the mess.\u00a0 Sometimes, a spill is just a spill...a simple accident, other times it's not paying attention.\u00a0 But  is either of them a crime that calls for making them feel like a complete idiot.\u00a0 They get enough of that from strangers, mean kids at school, and yes...often from teachers.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0 Speaking of teachers -I confess that I almost told my son that one of his teachers could kiss my...(yes I left the a word out).\u00a0 I don't care for her style.\u00a0 I don't like the way she treats my son. Furthermore, I don't trust her and I really don't want her having any influence over him.\u00a0 Teachers are not absolved from being abusive.  I had him removed from her class.\u00a0 Unfortunately, he sometimes has to deal with her at lunch or on the playground.\u00a0 She's probably one of those conservative, far right-wing Republicans who wants to teach everyone about 'self responsibility' which is not completely a bad idea.\u00a0 However, most extremist come to the table with a skewed point of view.\u00a0 They often can not see beyond the perfect world they live in.  They don't realize that everyone doesn't come from the same place, or have the same experiences...that the playing field is not always balanced.\u00a0 My son comes from a place of being a black child in a white world and to ice the cake, he has a disability that some people can not see, and  others wish not to recognize.\u00a0 Asperger's syndrome is high functioning form of autism.\u00a0 Just like God, just because you can't see it,  doe not  mean it doesn't exist. (But that's a whole other rant  for another day.) \n \n \n   \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am also extremely inconsistent with taking care of myself. I continually put my self on the back burner.\u00a0 I'll get to me later.\u00a0 I must take care of everyone else first.\u00a0 Often, there just isn't anything left for me.\u00a0 This would include my writing career or lack thereof.\u00a0 One of the most pertinent facets of being a writer is doing it everyday or at least several days a week.\u00a0 I will let laundry, cooking, husband, children and my dog call my name, when I should be listening to the little voice inside of me that says, \"You should be writing right now.\" Even as I write this I am fighting the urge to get up and curl my hair, and wash my face to be ready for a meeting I have at my son's school.\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"Dear lord, I thank you for the blessings of this and everyday.\u00a0 Thank you for the things that I am good at and help strengthen me in my areas of weakness, for there are many.\u00a0 Help me use my life in your divine order to help others. May your will be done -I hope that includes helping me to be more consistent with my writing\u00a0 where I can  share my experiences with the world, in hopes that my words can touch a life, make it better, make someone laugh or at least let them  know that they are not alone.\" \n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 -Amen\u00a0  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/10/confessions.html", "title": "\nConfessions\n"},

I did have leisurely coffee, while doing internet shoe shopping and a little reading. In between refereeing the havoc that is my home-life.\u00a0  \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I wanted to go see my friend in Houston, but escaping requires a get-away plan and my plan had too many roadblocks.\u00a0 The first road block was needing to get my oil changed at the dealer and having them look at my 'service required' light.\u00a0 There was a block of cars in the express line, too long to service before the work day ended.\u00a0 Then there was all of the fighting that went on Saturday night.\u00a0 No...I'm not talking about the siblings fighting.\u00a0 This time it was father and son.\u00a0 Son's computer was screwed up and father blamed said screw up on son.\u00a0 Son rather loudly disagreed and tried his level best to wake me up while I was napping in an attempt to get rid of my headache. Son was at the point of wanting to move out of the house by the time I got up.\u00a0 Of course, he has no clue, or no place to go.\u00a0 Who would put up with him without killing him besides his family?  \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"That's not fair!\" I hear him yelling to the top of his lungs. \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"If you wake up your mother I'm gonna knock you in the mouth,\" says dad.\u00a0 (Too late...I'm already awake from all the freakin' screaming. How valiant, I think to myself while laying in the darkness of my room where I am hiding, but not sleeping.\u00a0 He's trying to protect me.\u00a0 He's trying to allow me to rest.\u00a0 Whereas son, could care less that I am resting.\u00a0 He only cares that Dad is being unfair and mean!\u00a0 Dad really doesn't have much patience when it comes to his son.\u00a0 His son drives him crazy with all of his white noise, constant complaining, repeating himself, teasing his brother and constantly asking for more.\u00a0 No matter what we give him, he hardly misses a beat before he is asking for something else. \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bottom line is...I don't want to take both boys with me because it will not be relaxing at all.\u00a0 I feel too guilty to leave the one at home who is the biggest pain in the ass, because Dad just may \"knock him in the mouth\".\u00a0 He won't really, but it will not be fun for either of them.\u00a0 How can I leave them both in misery together and go gallivanting off to Houston to have fun with his younger brother.\u00a0 Younger brother can behave himself well enough when he is alone.\u00a0 He also gets along famously with my girlfriend's children. \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I try in futility to get Dad to promise me that he will speak softly and carry a big stick, if I go.\u00a0 He can't make me any promises,  at least not any promises that will remove the guilt from my leaving.\u00a0 I know that if I leave, I will get countless phone calls.\u00a0 \"Mom...Dad's being mean! Mom -when are you coming home?\u00a0 It's not fair? Why didn't I get to go?\u00a0 I want to see the girls too!\" \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The truth is, he would be bored after he showed them his videos on YouTube.\u00a0 He would be teasing and taunting his brother like he does every day.\u00a0 He would get off on some tangent about how unfair it is that he doesn't have everything in the world that some other kid has! \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When I woke up Sunday morning to the rain I settled on that being the  final roadblock of my trip that wasn't meant to be.\u00a0 I wish that I was one of those Mom's who could walk out the door and not look back, and not pick up the phone.\u00a0 Sometimes I am that mom.\u00a0 On this day, I was not.  \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/10/rainy-days-and-roadblocks.html", "title": "\nRainy Days and Roadblocks\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, August 25, 2009", "body": "\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What a shame that I haven't been able to write for weeks now.  It's hard to have a complete thought or time to yourself when the kids are at home.  They find hours to play on their computers but somehow -as soon as I sit down to write they come barging in wanting something. We spent two weeks in California which was a welcome reprieve from the heat of Austin.  We are on day 64 or something like that of 100+ degree temperatures.  I can't tell you how much I hate it! The average temp in L.A. was around 75-80.  That alone, made it worth the trip.  The other saving grace was that we spent half the time away from the kids. Yay! They spent time with their uncles, cousins and grandparents which gave me time to spend with my friends and time alone with Alan once he joined us.  The first week it was just the boys and I.  Alan followed us out the second week.  \n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I spent a day of leisure with my Mom having lunch at the Grove, a lovely outdoor mall. We dined casually, had cocktails, went shopping at Nordstrom's and Chicos, and then had more cocktails.  It was great! The weather was perfect and it was so nice not to have a deadline or the phone ringing with a child or a husband asking, \"Where are you? When are you coming home?\" My old friend and roommate Rebecca hosted me at her home for a night, followed by a day at Burke Williams the Spa in Pasadena. I was pampered from head to toe.\u00a0 After which we enjoyed a yummy lunch, cocktails and conversation.\u00a0 I spent a day at the beach with my friends Jenny and Mary, my girls from \"back in the days\" of being single and free. We went to Zuma in Malibu where I sat all day and marveled at the fact that my phone was not ringing.  Jenny's children were at the beach, but thankfully, mine were not! I valued every moment of freedom and wished that I could have more like them.  What a precious commodity -invaluable. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Alan and I spent a weekend alone reconnecting in Long Beach, where we had casual lunches and dinners, attended the Long Beach Jazz Festival like we used to do in the days when we were dating.  We had long conversations that did not involve any stressful deliberations over the care and rearing of our children.  He told me all of the reasons why he loves and appreciates me and what we have together.  We talked about what we've been through over the years, high points and low ones.  It made me appreciate what we have together and what we often take for granted.  We have a very strong bond that can get us through our stresses, differences and difficult times.  It may not be all butterflies and sunshine, but what we have is really good even if we do drive each other nuts at times. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We had several family parties to celebrate our being home.  There was plenty of good food, old friends, cousins laughing and playing together.  My heart blossomed as I watched my kids enjoying their family, having that sense of comfort and belonging.  Everyone was so gracious in spending time with them showing them much needed love and attention.  It was also good to see how well behaved they were with their relatives, which is much more than I can say about the time they spend with us -their parents.  Kendal says, \"that's because I feel more comfortable with you.\" Wow! Lucky me! I get to see the worst of him, because he knows that I love him unconditionally.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My brother and his wife were gracious hosts, allowing us to stay in their home on and off for two weeks.  My brother has grown and matured into an exceptional, hands-on father.  He openly shows love and affection and care to his children.  I couldn't be more proud of him, especially because he didn't really have a role-model who took an active roll in our lives as we grew up.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overall it was an amazing trip.  Of course it wasn't perfect.  Whenever you're around family, there has to be some controversy.  I was surprised and disappointed by what happened the day before we left, but that's a story within itself.  One that I'll have to tell another day... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/08/days-of-summer.html", "title": "\nDays of Summer\n"},

So what\u2019s the problem?\u00a0 \n \n \nWhen you have autism often makes your mind wander. This is probably in part a defense mechanism when you need to shut the overstimulating world out. \u00a0So if there are a bunch of things going on in the classroom that you would not prefer to be a part of, or that are bothering you, every once in a while you will need a break.

An Aspergers child is very literal. \u00a0Once the rule is written in his mind, he follows it.  \n \nI think the teacher was a little unhappy that he really did not appear to be paying attention before he left the room. \n \nThis education system of expecting everyone to be the same and follow all of the idiotic rules just kills me. \u00a0Ever heard the term, \"Don't sweat the small stuff?\" Save your disciplinary measures for things that really matter.  \n \nWhy does it chap my hide every time someone other than myself disciplines my children? I know it's a necessary evil. I can't be there all the time. I can't save them every time they fall. I just wish that sometimes they would cut them a break when they are doing something related to their disability. A kid starts to feel bad about himself when he's in trouble all of the freakin' time! I fully realize that if I intervene every time the teachers do something stupid, my voice will not be heard when it really counts.  \n \nSo for today, I will have to take the advice that I always give my children, \"Just let it go.\" At least for today.  \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/10/so-whats-problem.html", "title": "\nSo What's the Problem?\n"},

We watch a movie in silence, with the exception of the sound of our own laughter. \n\u00a0 \nWhere were the kids? \u00a0God blessed us. \u00a0Blue went out to spend time with his friend and his family...you know, people he can actually get along with. \u00a0They had a blast! Dinner, bowling, games at his friend's house. \u00a0His friend J's mom sends me pictures of him smiling...an expression I haven't seen since early Christmas morning. \n \nRed...went off to a church function with his Pastor and family. \u00a0Everything is all good until 10 p.m., when Red came home and started ranting about who knows what. \u00a0Scratch!!!! Party's over! \u00a0At least we had 3 hours of peace. \n \nNew Years Day, the anxiety about starting school sets in and Red is hell bent on fixating about it until the point of meltdown by the evening. \u00a0We try to mitigate the situation by taking the family out to one of their favorite places, \"Fry's Electronics\" for a little shopping. \u00a0Then off to Red's favorite restaurant for dinner, \"BJ's\". \u00a0He sits at the table with the ugliest mug he could possibly put on his face...as if he was being water-boarded and tortured there at his favorite place. \u00a0This was enough to make hubby want to walk out after we got our drinks. \u00a0After dad threatens to walk out...he changes his attitude long enough to eat and order dessert. \u00a0After that...it's on! \u00a0Full steam ahead towards meltdown!  \n \n \n \nHis mind is on school that would start the following day. \u00a0 \n \n \n\"I'm not going to school tomorrow! \u00a0I hate that school! \u00a0I hate my teachers! \u00a0They treat me like I'm a baby!

But it was a dumb move! \u00a0No time for transitioning from the holidays. \u00a0Families are traveling, etc. \u00a0Every other school in the area and across the country, starts on the 3rd or after. \u00a0I was really annoyed. \u00a0Me not being a rule follower and all...I had half a mind to keep them out for the day. \u00a0 \u00a0In truth, it doesn't matter when they start...Red and most teens with Aspergers, would have a hard time transitioning back to the school schedule. \u00a0Besides, I'd had about enough of both of both of them and could use the break. \u00a0You know what they say, \"Absence makes the heart grow fonder!\" \n \nNow Blue...is pretty happy to be back to his school routine. \u00a0However, what we used to think was a miracle in the form of Abilify...has now become a bad dream. \u00a0It's not working for him anymore. \u00a0We have increased it, added to it, and still he is a ticking time bomb...ready to explode at any given moment. \u00a0It probably has something to do with hormones. \u00a0The loose schedule and the anxiety of Christmas doesn't help...but geez! \u00a0My \"easy\" child has turned into...I don't know what. \u00a0He's almost unrecognizable...at least here at home with his family.  \n \nAfter a long first day back at school, Blue has a D.I. (Destination Imagination) meeting. \u00a0He comes home and goes bananas on his brother who is \"Not playing the game right!\" \u00a0\"I'm just trying to help him...but he's such an idiot! \u00a0He won't listen to me!\" \n \nI feed him and get him out the door because he insists that he has to do his homework at the library. \u00a0He gets home at 9 p.m. \u00a0I ask him to take a shower. \u00a0He goes ballistic! \u00a0\"I'm not doing it! \u00a0It's too late! \u00a0I have to go to bed early! \u00a0Did you think of that?!\" \u00a0He argues a good 15 minutes...in which time, the shower could have been taken already. \u00a0He finally gets in, but he's banging on the walls. \u00a0In hindsight...I probably could have let this one go. \u00a0But it was just the belligerent tone, and disrespect that made me stick to my guns. \u00a0I felt like...if I start letting him get away with talking to me like shit and refusing to do things...it will only get worse. \n \nHe has worked himself up so much...that he is now too angry to go to sleep. \u00a0The easy answer here is that he hasn't had any downtime. \u00a0It's been an excruciatingly long day. \u00a0But these kind of meltdowns were not happening a year ago. \u00a0And even with the tweaks and additions to medication, they are happening more frequently. \u00a0He becomes frustrated with himself. \u00a0He hates feeling so out of control and angry. \n \n\"I hate being a teenager!\" he says. \u00a0 I don't think I like all that much myself.  \n \nOh yeah...Happy New Year! I don't know about that. \u00a0Perhaps it will be...but not yet.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6iHOK--Yp-o/TwMf7YloOlI/AAAAAAAAAkk/xRUSPsWYxbU/s1600/images-4.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/01/happy-new-year.html", "title": "\nHappy New Year?\n"},

I've gone the nice Mom rout of bating him with a hot breakfast.\u00a0 I've tried the mean mom route of waking him with cold water sprinkled every so gently on his face.\u00a0 I've gone somewhere in-between having the dog to kiss him awake.\u00a0 \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He is 14 but I swear in some ways, taking care of him is harder than  the 10 year old.\u00a0 His behavior is often mirrors the behavior of a toddler.\u00a0 I mean I have to damn near walk him through every step of getting ready daily.\u00a0 If I don't pay attention, he'll go climb back in bed instead of getting dressed and brushing his teeth after breakfast.\u00a0 I swear he does it just to get my blood flowing! He wants me to blow a fuse, a gasket, something! He loves to see me react...or rather overreact.\u00a0 At least it's attention right?\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 There is also the \"it's time for bed routine\" that we have to go through every night.\u00a0 Bedtime never changes on school nights, yet he acts like he's totally surprised and generally pissed off that we have the audacity to tell him it's time for bed.\u00a0 \"I don't see the point in going to bed at 10 o'clock! I'll be fine in the morning.\u00a0 Why can't you just let me go to bed at midnight?\" Now he knows damn well this is not going to happen, but we have to hear the nonsense every night.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Don't let him be seriously into something on his computer.\u00a0 Then it's World War III when we tell him to shut it down.\u00a0 Now all of the Asperger's books and his therapist says, \"Give him a warning thirty minutes before bed that he will have to finish up what he's doing.\"\u00a0 It doesn't matter.\u00a0 We still have to go through the screaming tantrums at 10 o'clock. \u00a0 \n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 So I'm tired of it! I tell him he's going to loose 15 minutes of time every time I have to repeat myself when telling him to get ready in the morning, or to go to bed at night.\u00a0 I give him plenty of warning, but he will still start a project at 9:30, and then tell me, \"I can't save right now.\"\u00a0 He acts totally pissed when we tell him time is up.\u00a0 The result --he ends up loosing an hour of time the following day.\u00a0 When we follow through on this...there is of course a battle.\u00a0 He's bigger than me and outweighs me by oh 60 pounds or so.\u00a0 Therefore, I have to send in the reinforcement troops (Big Bad Dad).\u00a0 He goes through his motions as usual, yelling, screaming, \"It's not FAIR! I don't want to go to bed!\"\u00a0 He says everything he can short of cursing us out, which his dad says he can't wait for him to actually do it so he can show him exactly who the alpha male is in our house! \n \n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I am pleased to report however, the next day, he got his ass up and out of the house on time, without incident and has continued to do so for the rest of\u00a0 the week.\u00a0 He has also gone to bed on time, still grumbling, but doing it nonetheless. \n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Positive reinforcement is all well and good, but sometimes when dealing with the negative, you have to resort to the negative.\u00a0 Remember in school, a negative plus a negative equals a positive? \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I must say, that as a reward for being ready for school on time, I have allowed him to check his YouTube account in the morning once he is fully dressed and ready to walk out the door.\u00a0 This is  positive reinforcement or bribery (you choose).\u00a0 Now I can look forward to the next battle --not wanting to get off of the computer when the bus arrives.\u00a0 \n \u00a0\u00a0 Life is grand at the Weaver House! \u00a0  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/10/bedtime-blues-morning-fuse.html", "title": "\nBedtime Blues -Morning Fuse\n"},

{"date": "Monday, January 9, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nThere are no secrets in our house. \u00a0Even things that are supposed to be kept secret sooner or later come out. \u00a0Why? Well number one, I live with some very nosey people (including my mother). \u00a0Two, because no one can hold water! \u00a0With the boys, and most of the time with my husband, if it comes to mind they say it or ask it. \u00a0Somethings...I really don't want to know. \n \nFor instance, \"I really want to make out with a girl!\" Red \n\"I never...ever want to have sex!\" Blue \n\"Mom, why are you putting on that makeup? No one looks at you.\" -Slim (my oldest) Yeah...lovely! \n \nRed also asks me the funniest questions, \"Mom...Why do you think I'm so lazy?\" Wow! He actually admits to being lazy. \u00a0Part of it is just being a teenage boy. \u00a0He doesn't want to do chores. \u00a0Doesn't want to do homework. \u00a0Barely wants to take a shower. \u00a0Yet, he wants us to give the best of everything. \u00a0Boy is he going to be in for a rude awakening when real adult life sneaks up and slaps him in the face! \n \nI do think he's lazy. \u00a0However, I don't want him to know that. \u00a0Unfortunately, I can see my lack of follow-thru in him. \u00a0At his age, I only wanted to do enough to get by, especially if it wasn't a subject I was thrilled about i.e. Algebra or History. \u00a0However, if I loved the subject I would give it my all 110% i.e. English, Composition and Yearbook. \u00a0I did what I had to do to pass, but I certainly did not enjoy it or try to excel in it. \u00a0I do however, give my all to any job I have now, especially motherhood. \u00a0His dad and his brother are two of the hardest working people I know, so I can't blame this one on Dad. \n \nThis was my response to the lazy question. \"You're not lazy. \u00a0You only what to do what YOU WANT to do. \u00a0If it's not fun...or interesting to you, you don't want to do it. \u00a0It's all about MOTIVATION.\" (Of which he has very little.) I pray that it will show itself in him eventually. \u00a0I still thought it was pretty funny that he actually asked the question. \n \nHis eyes barely open this morning, as I try to wake him he asks, \"Why do I have to be forced to go to school? And why does America care about it?\" \u00a0Obviously, he either went to sleep thinking about this or he dreamed about it. \u00a0He wasn't even fully awake. \n\"You have to go to school because America doesn't want a bunch of criminals who have no education or jobs running around the streets. \u00a0The government doesn't want to take care of people with no education...and neither do I. \u00a0So get up!\" \n \n******* \n \nYesterday Blue, comes to me and says, \"I have autism right? \u00a0Autism is a neurological condition, so why don't I see a Neurologist?\" \n \nWow! \u00a0I'm blown away by this one. \u00a0 It turns out he was talking to a friend who is also on the spectrum, who does see a Neurologist. \u00a0I received Blue's diagnoses after getting Red's. \u00a0I realized that they have many of \u00a0same traits, although in many ways they are very different. \u00a0We see a Psychologist and a Psychiatrist, but it's been difficult to get into to see a pediatric Neurologist. \u00a0I finally have an appointment coming up this month. \u00a0I made this appointment 6 months ago. \u00a0 \n \nI want a second opinion with regards to treatment for the boys. \u00a0The trial and error process of medications to \"help\" with depression and outbursts is frustrating. \u00a0I am hoping to get some new insight and suggestions on ways to help them manage. I guess Blue wants to make sure I'm on the job. \n \nMy kids may asks a lot of questions and say a lot of unexpected things. \u00a0One thing for sure...they keep me on my toes. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cNRbOuCtbhc/TwtfsCB1GcI/AAAAAAAAAlE/2qvNovr_raw/s1600/images-5.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/01/silly-rabbittrix-are-for-kids.html", "title": "\nSilly Rabbit...Trix are for Kids!\n"},

You think I can handle this!? Come on now! You can't be serious.\" \n \nI write most often about Red. \u00a0He has always been a complete puzzle...a real piece of work since he was a baby. \u00a0He showed up to the party early...an emergency C-section. \u00a0He was the baby who cried and cried every evening for hours on end. \u00a0He screamed every time the car stopped. \u00a0One time my husband had to pull over into a Mc Donald's parking lot and walk with him until he calmed down. \u00a0He said, \"People were looking at me like I had kidnapped him or something.\" \u00a0Even though, they couldn't look any more alike.  \n \nRed was hospitalized @ 17 months with Kawasaki's Disease. \u00a0This strange high fever came over him for days while we tried to figure out what the hell was going on. \u00a0Finally the 3rd day, he woke up swollen all over, eyes, lips, face, fingers. \u00a0I rushed straight to the Pediatrician's office where they sent me directly to the hospital and he was admitted. \n \nHe was speech delayed, with his own garbled language. \u00a0As his mother, I knew something was off, but the Pediatrician dismissed my feelings. \u00a0Finally, at age 3 after having his hearing tested by an Audiologist...I had him tested and put into Speech Therapy and Pre-school for Children with Disabilities. \u00a0In 1st grade we got the ADHD diagnosis, which did not fully describe him. \u00a0In 4th grade he was pretty severely depressed and finally in 6th grade we figured it out! \u00a0He has Aspergers! \u00a0A huge light-bulb moment! \u00a0It explained so much! \n \nAs he storms through the teen years, we have also been given a mood-disorder diagnosis, subsequent to \u00a0Aspergers. \u00a0In other words, his depression and rages come as a result of his Aspergers. \u00a0He can really lose control when he's in his worst depressed state of mind. \u00a0When you're 5' 10 and 200 pounds, \u00a0the meltdowns are not so cute! \u00a0In fact, they look pretty darn scary. \u00a0Therefore he takes medication to keep those rages under raps. \u00a0I am hopeful that as he matures, and his hormones balance out...he will be able to control his moods a little better. \u00a0Key word here is \"Hopeful.\" \n \nIf you've read my blog, you know that Red is hell on wheels! \u00a0He is a real-hand full to say the least. Therefore, he requires a great deal of my time and attention.  \n \nI started out writing this post not about him. \u00a0It's about my \"Easy\" child. \u00a0My Angel... Little Boy Blue. \u00a0Who since adolescence began is no longer such an Angel, and is definitely not little! \u00a0 I think I've scared some of my readers of younger children with my exploits with Red. \u00a0Every child with Aspergers is different. \u00a0This includes Red's brother...my youngest son, Blue. \n \nBlue was diagnosed with Aspergers shortly after we discovered Red's diagnosis. \u00a0There were eery similarities between them, although, they are very different! \u00a0Blue's Aspergers is very much anxiety based. \u00a0He also misreads social cues, and has very rigid, black and white thinking. \u00a0He is however, an excellent student, a very-hard worker and wants to be perfect at EVERYTHING! \u00a0He wants to be a good son. \u00a0He wants to please his parents and teachers, whereas Red couldn't care less. \u00a0 At least all of this was true until recently.  \n \nPuberty hits...hormones kick in and now...watch out world! \u00a0I have hell on wheels number 2! Still he is not like his brother. \u00a0He has a number of friends, most of whom are on the spectrum or have ADHD. \u00a0He is still an excellent student with an A average. \u00a0He is a leader and an a compassionate friend. \u00a0In fact, in some ways he is very typical. \u00a0He would definitely rather be around his friends and their families than be around us. \u00a0Yesterday, I took him and his friends to the mall and they pretended not to know me. That was pretty funny and kind of cool at the same time. \n \nAs the hormones kick in...I no longer know anything! \u00a0He knows everything. \u00a0When the anxiety and fatigue kick in...I am the ball he kicks around in frustration. \u00a0When the meltdowns come...everything is all my fault. \u00a0I am the worst mom ever!  \n \n\"I hate this family!\" he screams.  \n\"I'd rather be at school where people appreciate me!\" he hollers! \n\"Oh great...schools out today, I have to be around YOU PEOPLE.\" \n \nHe thrives on the schedule and dare I say, pressure of school. \u00a0He is very independent and would really like to do his own thing most of the time. \u00a0He always plans his social calendar, so that he doesn't have to sit around spending time with us...especially with his brother, with whom he fights like cats and dogs, oil and water, fire and ice! \n \nOur new routine is that he goes to the public library most evenings after school for a couple of hours to get his home work done. \u00a0He just can't work with the distractions here at home. \u00a0Of course, he refuses to close his door and work. \u00a0It's almost like if he has an audience, he will perform. \u00a0\"Oh my God! This is so hard! \u00a0I'm so tired! \u00a0This is ridiculous! Why do they give me so much homework? \u00a0This is really cutting in on my free-time!\" \n \nIf he's on his own...he just gets it done. \n \nOne night last week, Hubby calls him and says, \"Are you almost finished? I need to pick you up around 8 o' clock.\" \n\"I can't make you any promises, \" he says.  \n \nOver the Christmas break...he really put me through hell. \u00a0He hated all of that free time. \u00a0It was just more time to think and be anxious about what he was going to get for Christmas. \u00a0He revised his Christmas list after doing detailed research about 8 times! \u00a0I couldn't wait for the so-called break to be over! \n \nAs they say, \"If you've met one child with Aspegers...you've met one child with Aspergers.\" \u00a0They are all very different and special in their own ways.  \n \nWhere I worry non-stop about Red...as I wrote\u00a0 here, \"Dear Worry\" \nWill he ever be able to make it in the world out there on his own?  \nWill he ever be truly happy? \nWill he take his special interest and turn it into a career and be able to take care of himself? \nI have many doubts and fears....yet, I remain hopeful.  \n \nWith Blue...I know. \n \nAlthough this adolescent phase where hormones rage, there for he rages, explodes and generally drives me to drink... \nI have no doubt that his future is bright.  \nIn fact it's so bright...it burns my eyes. \nWhere are my shades?\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a3gvxV5Q_9g/TxRymMBsV3I/AAAAAAAAAlc/OKliyDV_STo/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/01/his-future-is-bright.html", "title": "\nHis Future is Bright\n"},

(This one from Red...What the hell does he know about manning up?)\u00a0 \n \nThe truth is they both stay in each other's business. \u00a0They both try to tell the other what to do and we can't seem to shut either one of them up. \u00a0Their Aspergery quirks and tendencies feed off of each other.  \n \nBlue is sensitive to sound. \nRed makes annoying sounds (nail biting, singing). \n \nBlue can not tune out ANYTHING. \u00a0He has to respond to EVERYTHING. \nRed does things to make Blue respond. \u00a0He gets a charge out of seeing him lose it! \n Of course we tell Blue you would win if you just walk away and not respond. \u00a0Most of the time he just can't do it!\u00a0 \n \nBlue is very rule following, rule enforcing.  \nHe tries to parent and enforce said rules with his older brother. \nRed is very anti-rule following. \nHe refuses and gets angry because his little brother is telling him what to do or what NOT to do. \n \nThey get mad when the other one has a meltdown and yells at me. \u00a0Yet they both do it! \n \nThey have very little sympathy or empathy for one another. \nRed takes out his anger and depression on Blue.  \nBlue feels like a target. \nRed does and says really mean things and a few minutes later, he's forgotten about it.  \nBlue is still angry about what Red has said or done. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n ( You can't really blame him.)\u00a0 \nThen Red is mad that Blue is mad.  \nIt's a vicious circle! \nGet the picture?? \n \nI am not looking forward to traveling with these two. \u00a0Travel and change is hard enough because of Blue's anxiety. \u00a0Red...is in many ways just a teenager, who doesn't really want to be around his family especially 24/7 like we will have to be on this trip. \u00a0This is intensified by Aspergers. \u00a0Lately, his social anxiety is kicked up a notch. \u00a0When we go into a restaurant he gets this mean scowl on his face.  \n \n\"I hate being around all of these HAPPY people!\" \n\"Everyone is looking at me.\" \u00a0 They're not looking at him, but if they were, could it possibly be the scowl on his face or that he's putting his head down on the table in a restaurant? \u00a0I mean this kid has a million dollar smile...when he uses it, but this face that he puts on is really unattractive, to say the least. \u00a0He looks like Anakin from Star Wars.\u00a0 \n \nIt's really a shame that what could be a fun, family getaway feels more like an exercise in torture. \u00a0My husband is actually mad at me for not looking forward to it. \u00a0I think he sees it as a personal affront to his Dad who is coming all this way to see us. \u00a0It is so not about that! \u00a0I would love to see them and hang out with them...if it were really going to be fun! \u00a0The truth of the matter is...there will be a degree of anguish for us. \u00a0For Red because he really feels uncomfortable. \u00a0For Blue, because he hates being the target of his brother's anger.  \n \nWe can hope that having the grandparents there will mitigate their behaviors. \u00a0But that only means as soon as we get behind closed doors...Red will probably blow a gasket! \n \nAm I being negative here...expecting the worst? \u00a0Or is this just the reality? \n \nAnyone have any sibling fighting advice? \n \nWish I could say I have all the answers here...but I don't. \u00a0I would really love some feedback on this one...HELP!!! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qOtp1uPfCLk/TxhAAKPRLFI/AAAAAAAAAls/ZYSBKaDQoUE/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/01/weekend-torture.html", "title": "\nWeekend Torture\n"},

He is my father and I love him simply because of that fact. He brought fun, laughter and music to my life as a child.\u00a0 He was fun dad on every other weekend or whenever.\u00a0 There were times when he moved away when that wasn't even possible.\u00a0 True he was only a phone call away.\u00a0 But now that I'm a parent, I know what kind of sacrifice it takes to raise a child and I know that he did not make those sacrifices.\u00a0 My mother did.\u00a0 I watched her depressed and crying herself to sleep as she tried to figure out how to make ends meet.\u00a0 I know that he did not contribute financially or otherwise on a regular basis.\u00a0 He did what he could when he could.\u00a0 Yes -I could call him for a new pair of shoes or to pay for senior pictures but he wasn't there for the everyday things.\u00a0 And that's o.k. We got by.\u00a0 I never had a hungry day. But to now have this expectation like I owe you my life really just gets underneath my skin. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well apparently he wasn't done yet.\u00a0 When I got home there was an e-mail, basically cursing me out and calling my mother outside of he name.\u00a0 I don't know what she had to do with his birthday card, but she became a target of his disgust. Could he be jealous of the close relationship I have with her? Well, in the years when my children were young and we didn't have a lot of money...she would send me money or a gift card every year for my birthday.\u00a0 She knew it may be the only chance I had to shop.\u00a0 Where as for him, there have been times, when my birthday came and went and he didn't even call. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 He's 80 years old and has diabetes.\u00a0 Who knows how much longer he will be with us.\u00a0 I can chalk this up to his age, perhaps senility.\u00a0 I can try to forgive him but can I forget? Can I continue to allow him to totally disrespect my mother? Can I sit and listen when he continually trashes the men in our family -his sons? I don't think so. Where do we go from here? Today -I don't know.\u00a0  \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/08/all-good-things.html", "title": "\nAll Good Things...\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 4, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n\"Clearly you have to drink in order to live with these people.\" -My Facebook quote from Saturday night. \n \nWell this has been a fun weekend...NOT! We got a new big screen T.V. for our living room. \u00a0My chairs are falling apart, but we have a new 55 inch T.V.! \u00a0No...it wasn't completely my husband's idea. \u00a0We've been talking about it for a while. \u00a0We've also been talking about the chairs for a while, but he beat me to the punch, I guess. You know, we've got to keep up with those Joneses (whoever they are).  \n \nSince we have a flat screen upstairs...we have all gotten a little spoiled and don't want to watch movies as much in our living room with the older projection t.v.\u00a0Our extra visual boys of course like the best of all things technical. \u00a0They have been watching t.v. and movies more in our room because we have the Blu-Ray player up here. \u00a0My husband hates when the 16 year-old lays in our bed to watch a movie. \u00a0That was also part of the reason for buying the new t.v. for downstairs. \u00a0Hubby can be very territorial when it comes to our private space.  \n \nWe also thought getting the new t.v. would be a great early Christmas present for the family and that the boys would love it! \u00a0Surprise! They do love it. \u00a0Initially, they were so excited when they saw it. \u00a0Unfortunately, it's been mostly down hill from there. \u00a0Red thinks we bought this say...um...just for him. \u00a0He's obsessed with it. \u00a0He wants to completely control it. \u00a0He wants to blast the sound of his movies through the house, with no consideration for others who are not watching said movie.  \n \nThe underlying trigger is he had kind of a rough day at school on Thursday because of an unexpected fire-drill. \u00a0An alarm went off because of some kind of smoke detector defect. \u00a0The result? \u00a0Students were stuck outside for well over an hour. \u00a0He was not with his Special Ed. tracking teacher at the time. \u00a0He ended up getting kind of displaced. \u00a0Mind you...this is what he's been wanting. \u00a0He wants to be with all of the \"normal\" kids (as if there is such a thing). \u00a0The kids end up all getting into a big huddle. \u00a0There was some improvisational rapping. \u00a0He hates rap! \u00a0He hates crowds really. \u00a0He hates when teens are loud, cursing and wild...you know being teens. \u00a0But for some reason, he  thinks  he wants to be a part of it. \u00a0 That is until he actually  is  a part of it, \u00a0and he doesn't know what to do.  \n \nHe starts to get extremely agitated. \u00a0Luckily, a few teachers recognize this and they escort him to his tracking teacher. \u00a0By this time he is loud, agitated, looking angry, pacing and complaining non-stop. \u00a0He is deeply disturbed by his not being able to handle the situation. \u00a0He is disturbed because he saw a few friends and talked to them for a while, but somehow they ended up disappearing and he had no idea what to do. \u00a0He couldn't find anyone he knew. \n \nThe agitation was mitigated the when he saw the new t.v. \u00a0But the anger, and depression is still boiling beneath the surface. \u00a0So when Dad comes in and turns the sound down on the movie, because it is vibrating through the whole house...Red goes ballistic! \u00a0Everything he felt the day before at school erupted right here at home, where he is most comfortable. \u00a0Lucky us! I guess we should be happy that it didn't happen at school.  \n \nIt got really...really ugly. \u00a0He basically attacked his father, physically. \u00a0This has only happened once before. \u00a0He was completely out of body...like another person. \u00a0We gave him something to calm himself down, but when these things happen, there is collateral damage. \u00a0Blue witnessed it...it made him completely anxious. \u00a0My mom instinctively reacts...not really helpful. \u00a0It completely sucks the life out of the entire family. \u00a0Everyone is left feeling...sad, drained, defeated and exhausted.  \n \nThe following day, he is full of apologies that sound sincere but what do they really mean? \u00a0Will his actions change in the future? \u00a0Will he ever get to the point where he can control these outbursts? \u00a0How will he make it in the world with this kind of behavior? \u00a0Do we need to adjust medicine again???? Ugh! \n \nRed is always looking for the next big thing that will suddenly make his life better. \u00a0That elusive thing over THERE...will finally make him happy. \u00a0That new TV, \u00a0THOSE new friends, a girlfriend, the new technical gadget, or program for his computer. \u00a0That has to be it! \u00a0That has to be the trick to solving all of my problems. \u00a0It's too hard for me to fix myself. \u00a0In fact...it's impossible, in his eyes. \u00a0So if I just do this, if I just get that...suddenly my life will be better.  \n \nIf I could give him happiness in a box...I certainly would. \u00a0In fact, it would solve a lot of my problems, because I'd be rich! Instead, I am left feeling depleted. \u00a0What else can I do to help this boy be a little happier? \u00a0I need to find him a new therapist. \u00a0That's it! \u00a0I'll take him to a new doctor. \u00a0Maybe that will do it. \u00a0I will help him find some new friends. \u00a0That has to work! \n \nThe truth is that there are days when I feel like nothing that I do will actually work. \u00a0It doesn't keep me from continuously trying. \u00a0At times, I feel like giving up. \u00a0I certainly had a few of those moments on this crazy, funky, dreary weekend. \n \nOn Sunday morning, I felt like escaping into my writing instead of listening to a sermon at church. \u00a0I forced myself to listen anyway. \u00a0The message I received from the Pastor was, \"Never give up. \u00a0God is there for you. \u00a0The next good thing may be just around the corner.\" \n \nAnd there you have it...the answer I needed to hear. \u00a0It may not be the magic answer, but it will help me to keep looking. \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sXBGF4gN8BA/TtzpRz-7LhI/AAAAAAAAAh4/5AtOMUI0t4Y/s1600/crazy+funky.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/12/crazy-funky-dreary.html", "title": "\nCrazy Funky Dreary\n"},

He's kind of like the trail mix my husband buys. \u00a0I'd like to pick out the M&M's, the sweet part, take a little of the peanuts, and raisins and throw out the rest of the crap!\u00a0 \n \n \nMy husband is so excited about seeing his dad. \u00a0His dad drives all the way from Savannah, Georgia with his wife, to San Antonio, TX to spend the week in a time-share. \u00a0We live 90 minutes from San Antonio. \u00a0So the plan is to come down and spend a long weekend with them. \u00a0Of course, his dad would like to see his son AND his grandsons. \u00a0I mean he drove all this way...right??\u00a0 \n \n \n \nRed is on the fence about going. \u00a0His social anxiety has been a little high lately. \u00a0He knows if he comes with us, he will have to be on his best behavior because quite frankly,\"Big Grandad\" doesn't take any crap. \u00a0Big Grandad stands at around 6 foot 3 or 4. (which is much taller than the other grandads in our family). \u00a0 He is a lovely man...really. \u00a0He is funny, and sweet, but he is also no-nonsense. \u00a0His wife, is no shorty like me. \u00a0I'm sure she stands around 5'ft 10 or 11. \u00a0She also is no-nonsense. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nNot to mention, if he comes he will have to be around us 24/7. \u00a0He will be on our schedule....not his. \u00a0There will be no sitting in front of a computer, hiding out in his room for hours on end. \u00a0There will be restaurants, people, activities that may actually require getting of your butt! \u00a0Who needs all that right? \u00a0Also, you will have to refrain from constantly harassing your little brother because Granddad just might knock you in to next week. \u00a0(Grandpa will not actually do this...but Red thinks he might...which is a good thing.)\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAspergers Dad says, \"We\u00a0are leaving at 11:30 a.m. \u00a0If you are going...be ready! \u00a0We are not waiting for you!\" \u00a0He is very clear and repeats this several times...stressing how important this is to him. \u00a0Aspergers Dad is really anxious to see his father. \u00a0He is also very thankful that his dad drove all this way to see us. \u00a0He is not going to be late! \n \n \n \nRed packs his clothes but then farts around, talking on the phone to a friend. \u00a0Then he crawls back in bed and says, \"I'm tired.

{"date": "Friday, December 2, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nI have already raised 2 boys through the 7th grade. \u00a0One is now 23, typical and thank God...out of my house. \u00a0The other is 16,\u00a0with Aspergers. and in the 10th grade. \u00a0So you would think I have a few things figured out by now. \u00a0Both of these boys have been through Sex Education presentations without even a blip on the radar. \u00a0In fact, they probably enjoyed it immensely. \u00a0Red, the 16 year-old has loved girls since before he could talk. \u00a0My 23-year old became a lover of the ladies in middle school. \u00a0Fortunately, none of them loved him back until about the 2nd year of high school. I could write a whole book on his misadventures with girls...but I won't go there. \n \n \n \nWell...each and every child is different. \u00a0Just like each person with Aspergers, although they may have similar traits ...Aspergers shows itself differently in each individual. \u00a0So every once in a while...these boys still stump me. \u00a0Blue has always said, \"I'm never getting married. I don't want any kids. They cost too much money, and I never...ever want to have sex!\" (I know...famous last words.) \u00a0 \n \n \n \nComing out of 6th grade last year, there was a girl who caught his eye. \u00a0\"She's really nice to me. \u00a0It's like she gets me,\" he says to me. \u00a0 \n \n\"But I just want to be like her really good friend.\"\u00a0 \n \nThis year...there is another girl, but he won't talk about it much. \u00a0Whatever the attraction is...it's not too serious. \u00a0There have been no phone numbers exchanged...no e-mailing or texting. \u00a0Probably just the occasional glance and exchange of pleasantries.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen the permission slip comes home for the 7th grade Sex Education presentation...he is quite adamant that he wants no parts of it. \u00a0I had exempted him from it last year. \u00a0This year, I forgot to sign the exemption. \u00a0His special education tracking teacher calls me yesterday and assures me that it is important from an educational stance. \u00a0She reminds me of how adamant he was that he could not deal with the biology, and human body sections of 7th grade Science, and so far he has done great with that. \u00a0 \n \nAnother friend of ours had previewed the presentation for her boys who also have autism. \u00a0Dad and I agree to have him go ahead to the presentation with supports in place if he gets overwhelmed. \u00a0I later receive a phone call that he did fine. \n \n \n \nWhen he comes home from school...he is livid! There is really no talking to or reasoning with him at this point. What does mommy do? \u00a0She takes him out for ice-cream. \u00a0Ice-cream makes everything better...at least temporarily. \u00a0Later that night...when dad comes home, the emotions flair again. \u00a0There are tears of frustration. \u00a0 \n \n\"Why? Why? Why? Why did you do it? \u00a0Why did you make me go? Why do I have to learn about this? \u00a0It was so disgusting! \u00a0I don't want to do any of that stuff!\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe try to explain it from an educational point of view. \u00a0\"You need to know these things so that when others give you false information...and inevitably they will, you will know the truth. \u00a0You will be able to help your friends if they come to you to talk about things like this.\" \u00a0He loves to educate his friends. . Of course we talk about STD's...the importance of knowing what is appropriate and what is inappropriate sexual behavior, etc. He isn't really buying any of our sales pitch. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI take to my fabulous  Facebook \"Confessions\" community \u00a0 for advice, support and hopefully some answers. \u00a0Everyone there is very supportive. \u00a0My favorite answer however, comes from someone who is an Aspie herself and also a mother of children on the spectrum. \u00a0 Inner-Aspie \u00a0had this to say: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"As a 33 yo married aspie woman with 3 kids, and a healthy sex life who STILL to this day is absolutely mortified if I even think I'm going to see someone on TV naked, I'd say let him have a pass on the video, but most definitely not on the education. He can learn the facts with someone he trusts, and not in a crowded room with his peers. Please listen to your kids when they say something is uncomfortable. Just because it seems inconsequential and not a big deal to you doesn't mean it's not to us. The reason we can get so upset so easily is because we feel not listened to. I'm not trying to judge any of you(so please don't take my words wrong), but just trying to give you a glimpse into what it feels like to be on the other side. I actually preview movies before watching with my husband to be sure there won't be any sex scenes. The feelings of embarrassment, and shame of seeing these sorts of things in front of anyone else is very strong to me and not something I'd appreciate mocked by anyone. I get upset (what you might see as angry and irrational) when I feel my opinion and feelings aren't valued and it makes me feel less of a human when people make jokes about it, or dismiss me because they don't understand my opinion.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI am so thankful for this insight and for the blessing of the community on Facebook and Twitter that I have connected with. \u00a0I immediately share this with my husband. \u00a0Lightbulbs are going off inside our heads. \u00a0Blues feelings deserve validation. \u00a0We need to find a more creative way to facilitate his education on this subject here at home. \u00a0That's it. Done deal.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThis morning I write a note and hand deliver it to his Special Ed. tracking teacher. \u00a0Blue comes into the room where the 3 of us have a private conversation about the whole matter. \u00a0It turns out, that a big part of the issue for him is that he made the error of talking to a peer about his feelings. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe peer asked him, \"So are you freaked out about the Sex Talk?\" Blue answers, \"What if the teachers take their clothes off to demonstrate?\" \u00a0Of course, the kid found this to be hilarious. \u00a0(Have to admit...I would have laughed too!) Unfortunately, this kid shared the sentiment with the young lady that Blue has a little crush on. \u00a0Yes...totally humiliating. \u00a0\"I don't want her to have weird thoughts about me,\" he says to us. \n \n \n \nAfter further discussion about the benefits of this knowledge, Blue decides that he will give it the college try this afternoon. \u00a0He will go...but he has the option to leave, if he gets too overwhelmed. \u00a0This was TOTALLY HIS DECISION. \u00a0I am really proud of him. \u00a0We'll see how it goes. \u00a0I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nThat boy just amazes me. \u00a0I never knew I could love like this.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nP.S.

{"date": "Thursday, January 26, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nFor months now I've had this gut feeling that Red's meds are not right. \u00a0Despite the meds, he is still very depressed and lethargic. \u00a0He's always complaining about being tired. \u00a0His social anxiety is still very much alive. \u00a0Sometimes, when a person is always complaining about something...it begins to fall on deaf ears. \u00a0But in the back of my mind...I know...something isn't right.  \n \nWe go in to see the Psychiatrist on a regular basis. \u00a0I voice my concerns and she slightly tweaks this or that, or adds this or that. \u00a0Things get a little better, or a little worse. \u00a0We go back and she changes things again. \u00a0This past week she finally kind of listened to the fact that he is lethargic...always complaining of being tired. \u00a0She orders blood work, which she hasn't done in I don't know...ever! \u00a0I'm not a doctor, but even I suspect that if you're taking several medications, sooner or later you should be evaluating the blood, doing weight and blood pressure with regularity. \u00a0This time she gives us lab orders to take blood to check his thyroid. \u00a0I have this little feeling that says, \"Thyroid? \u00a0It's not his freaking thyroid! \u00a0It's this got dammed medicine!\" But whatever... \n \nA little over a year ago, I try to get an appointment with this awesome Pediatric Neurologist. \u00a0The practice staff gives me the run around.  \n 'Since you used to see another one of the doctors in the practice...you have to wait so long and go through some shenanigans before you can get into see another doctor in our practice.' \n \nFinally, I get approval to make an appointment with the doctor, however it would be 6 months before we would actually get to see him. \u00a0Sounds ridiculous...right? \u00a0I go ahead and schedule the appointment. \u00a0I heard through the grapevine, that this doctor is not all about how many meds he can prescribe. \u00a0Sometimes he even goes with herbal remedies. \u00a0Sounds crazy...unheard of right? \u00a0When you're desperate to make things better for your child...you are willing to look under every rock until you find the answers.  \n \nAnother little tickle in the back of my mind has been Red's cognitive decline. \u00a0In elementary school, with hard work, Red was an A/B student. \u00a0There were not nearly as many accommodations like he has now. \u00a0At this point, his work has been cut down to a minimum. \u00a0He gets almost 1 on 1 instruction in math and language arts and he's still behind the curve. \u00a0His reading is way below grade level. \u00a0How can you at one time be commended on state testing, and now be so far behind? Something ain't right. \n \nI chalk this up to ...he's so depressed and fixated on social issues that he isn't focusing on his school work. \u00a0But still...I have that little feeling that something isn't right. \u00a0Could it be the medicine that's slowing him down? \u00a0The more meds he takes, the slower is his progress academically. \u00a0He is still passing every class, but he can not carry a regular work load. \u00a0His thinking is slower. \u00a0His processing speed has always been slow...but it barely has a pulse now.\u00a0What's really going on here? \n \nToday, we finally have our appointment to see the Neurologist. \u00a0I share my concerns. \u00a0He hears me. \u00a0He hears every-single-word I say. \u00a0He agrees that I should be concerned about cognitive decline. \u00a0He too is concerned. \u00a0He sees that Red is clearly still quite depressed. \n \nHe goes through every single medication that he is taking and tells me which are making him tired, which are redundant and unnecessary, and what will probably work better:  \n \nIntuniv 4 mg at night --is making him fatigued and makes if difficult for him to get up in the morning and truthfully is not helping him all that much with attention. \u00a0We will be cutting this down and eventually out. \u00a0 How can you pay attention if you're tired?\u00a0 \nFocalin -he is only on 5 mg in the a.m. \u00a0-we will be boosting it to 5 additional mg at noon. \nDepakote --is a really \"old-fashioned\" drug. \u00a0 He should be having blood-work done every 3 to 4 months while taking it. \u00a0There are other drugs you can take where you don't have to continually monitor blood (which hasn't been done any way). \nSeroquel --he is only taking this at night. \u00a0It only stays in your system for 6 hours. This drug can also add to fatigue. \u00a0It's good for sleep but isn't helping with mood during the day. \u00a0 He doesn't need help with sleep...so what's the point here?  We will be tapering off of it completely. \nProzac (Fluoxetine)\u00a0and Effexor\u00a0(Venlafaxine)\u00a0-the Psychiatrist just started him on the lowest dose of Effexor \u00a0...did not adjust or take down the Prozac. \u00a0This is redundant, and Effexor will work better. \u00a0The Neurologist adjusts the Prozac down...and eventually out. \u00a0He adjust the Effexor up to the correct dose for his weight. \n \nBefore we leave his office, he has the lab take blood for a full blood evaluation...not just checking his thyroid. \u00a0He will also be doing an EEG and an MRI to look at his brain to get a clear picture of what is going on with him. \u00a0He will be doing cognitive testing so that we have something to measure and watch. \u00a0(Even the school has not wanted to take the time to do that!) \n \nI leave his office almost dancing! \u00a0I am so happy that I followed my maternal instinct. \u00a0I am so happy that we are on our way to get a true picture of my son. \u00a0I am thrilled that I lifted those boulders so that we can see what is underneath, leaving no stone unturned until we have some answers. \n \nEditorial Note: All medications do different things for different people depending on your body's chemistry. \u00a0I am not an expert on medications (although I'm certainly gaining a lot of experience). \u00a0You may have very different results. When all else fails...follow your instinct.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iD5nQ5v9f8Q/TyGRhgnNtVI/AAAAAAAAAmA/kWRfO_ouOjk/s1600/images-2.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/01/under-rocks.html", "title": "\nUnder the Rocks\n"},

Cut that out!\" Totally...none of his business. \u00a0Yet, he really can not see that this plays any part in kids making him a target. \u00a0He just feels that it's unfair that they treat him this way. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI validate and understand his feelings. \u00a0I don't want these kids making him feel bad. \u00a0He says to me last night, \"I just need someone to help me. \u00a0I need someone to be on my side. \u00a0I just want to do my work without anyone bothering me.\" \u00a0All I could say is, \"I understand.\" \u00a0Whenever I try to address the issue of the role that he plays...he gets angry with me. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe does have a right to go to school and be comfortable and not have to worry about creepy kids coming up to him and saying irritating things. \u00a0I just don't know how much of that can actually be controlled. \u00a0They are not threatening him...or intimidating him, but they are still making him feel bad.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe made an incident report this morning about the identification theft. \u00a0He wrote an excellent review of the situation. \u00a0\"I've have various incidences with this student.\" \u00a0He's tired of it. \u00a0Quite frankly, so am I.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z7tqWoGpiqc/Tt-cHun-YOI/AAAAAAAAAiA/-oOH7RcHTjw/s1600/images-28.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/12/bullying-supercop.html", "title": "\nBullying the SuperCop\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 11, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nSaturday night I am totally buzzed from French Martinis, the drink of the night. \u00a0Hubby and I are back in the hotel room as we await late night room service. \u00a0I check out Facebook on my phone to see if there are any responses to the picture I posted at the Charity Ball we were attending. There are pleasant responses to the picture that bring a smile to my already happy face. \n \nI also note Red's Facebook status which reads something like this: \n\"I am so tired of seeing couples every where I look. \u00a0I am so jealous. \u00a0Because I have so many problems, I will probably never have a girlfriend or a wife. \u00a0My life sucks!\" \u00a0This is a kinder, gentler version of what he said.  \n \nHe is at home with my Mom in his room, obviously feeling a little lonely and bored. \u00a0I've told him a million times before, when you put these heavy messages on Facebook, you are not showing yourself in positive light. \u00a0If you want your friends to have \"good thoughts\" about you...you have to be more positive. I really think he believes this will make some girl feel sorry for him and go out with him because of being sympathetic. \u00a0That's not going to happen. \n \nI respond to his post, \"Go to bed Red.\" \u00a0That's all I can muster in my slightly inebriated state. \n \nWhen we get back into town the next day, the funky state of mind is still in full effect. \u00a0He is invited to a movie-birthday party that night. \u00a0When it's time to go...he crawls into bed to hide. \n\"I'm not going.\" \n\"Why?\" I ask \n\"I just don't want to go.\" \n\"You're really going to disappoint your friend, which is sad. \u00a0You always complain that you don't have any friends, yet, you're risking hurting your friend's feelings. \u00a0But hey...it's your life. \u00a0I can't live it for you. You have to call him to let him know you're not coming.\" \n\"I'm not doing that. You call him.\" \n\"Nope. \u00a0He's your friend.\" \n\"Besides...I don't know what movie they're going to watch. \u00a0Everyone will probably ignore me.\" Aah...there we go. \u00a0It's anxiety. \u00a0I may not have control over the situation. \u00a0That's why I don't want to go. \nLuckily a few minutes later, said friend calls. \u00a0They talk about the movie. \u00a0They agree to watch Harry Potter. \u00a0So off he goes. Yay! He reports having a great time...by the way. \n \nSunday the funky mood lingers. \u00a0By Sunday night we are adamant, \"I'm Not Going to school tomorrow. \u00a0I hate school!\" \nGreat here we go again. \u00a0 We went through this same time last year. \u00a0 Again he goes to post some negative diatribe on Facebook. \u00a0I tell him to take it down. \u00a0What does he do? \u00a0He un-friends me. \u00a0\"I'm tired of you baby-sitting me on Facebook!\" Not acceptable.  \n\"Either un-block me or shut down the account,\" I say.  \n\"Fine! I'll just delete it.\" \n \nMonday evening I get text from my son's girlfriend. \u00a0\"I'm really concerned about Red's status on Facebook.\" Apparently...he's back online. Before I can go talk to him about it...his phone rings. \u00a0It's Slim Shady (his older brother). \u00a0He wants to know what the heck is going on and why Red is posting such things.  \n \nHere's where Agent 007 Aspergers Mom goes to work... \n \nI go to his computer while he's on the phone. \u00a0I log into his Facebook account...luckily he has his password set on \"remember me\". \u00a0I add myself back as a friend. \u00a0And I read the status which basically says, \"I hate my life. \u00a0No one cares about me. \u00a0I should just commit suicide.\" \n \nWhat the heck is going on? \u00a0Why is he suddenly so animated and depressed? \u00a0My older son makes him take the message down. \u00a0Talks to him for a while. \u00a0It's apparently about not having any friends...although he does, and especially about not having a girlfriend. \u00a0Slim convinces him to shut the computer down and go to bed, which he was refusing to do for me. \n \n\u00a0I go back to my room and answer my \"friend request\" that I sent myself from his computer. \u00a0I get straight to my detective work. \u00a0Apparently, a young lady who he considers to be a good friend, posted on Saturday night that she is now \"In A Relationship\" along with a picture of her new guy.  \n \nRed's response on her post? \"What the heck???!!! That's not fair! Who the heck is this guy???\" \n \nSo here we go again. \u00a0All of this is about a girl. \u00a0He has no intention on harming himself. \u00a0This is all about attention. \u00a0What he doesn't realize is this is not the kind of attention that he wants. \u00a0Your average typical teen, can't deal with all of these heavy feelings. \u00a0The thing that's really scary, is that it seems we are right back to where we were last year when another female friend entered into a relationship. \u00a0That did not end well. \u00a0By the end of the school year, he was in the hospital. \u00a0I don't want to go back there. \u00a0I remind him of this fact. \u00a0He doesn't want to go there either. \n \nWe have a long conversation before he goes to bed that night. \u00a0I remind him of all the things that are good in his life and the things he has to look forward to including, a C-Squared club meeting the following day. \u00a0C-Squared is a \"No Place For Hate\" anti-bulllying club at school. \u00a0I encourage him to be positive so that he can attract the right girl at the right time. \u00a0(I know...Good luck with that one. )  \n \nHis Facebook status on Monday night reads, \"Much better day today.\" And the girl...the one in relationship, \"Liked\" his status. \u00a0Positive thinking works. \n \nAgent 007 Aspergers Mom is on the case! \u00a0Can you hear the music?\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2CjFRTf6BBk/Tw2_vpp4kII/AAAAAAAAAlM/SXDyNhRiC2c/s1600/Al-and-Karen.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/01/agent-007-aspergers-mom.html", "title": "\nAgent 007 -Aspergers Mom\n"},

Yet, suddenly she doesn't know how to shop for herself. \u00a0Thank God...she'll be there running his life for 2 weeks, \u00a0and not here chiming in on every meltdown in her attempt to \"help,\" which usually only makes matters worse.  \n \nSchool has been out for a week now...anxiety has risen to an all-time high. \u00a0So it's just been a barrel of fun around here. \u00a0I am so busy attending to the details of Christmas all while trying to prevent World War 3 right here in my own home. \u00a0It's been one meltdown after the next. \u00a0Thankfully, or sadly (I'm not sure) they are taking turns with their breakdowns. \u00a0It almost has a kind of musicality to it. \u00a0First one, then the other, over things that in the scheme of life, are not really important. \u00a0They want what they want, and they want it now. \u00a0 Of course to them, each issue is very serious.  \n \nThe thing is...the meltdown isn't really about the thing they are yelling about. \u00a0It's about the floating schedule, the unpredictability of each day, the change from the tight schedule of school to the loose schedule of vacation, the anxiety over all of the possibilities of Christmas and what they will be getting. And this year there are no trips scheduled. \u00a0Trips, are usually an added source of stress. \u00a0Who knew having no trips is ALSO an added source of stress. \u00a0Talk about irony! \n \nRed -the 16 year-old is consistently bored...though he's enjoying the benefit of our new television and Blue-Ray player. \u00a0He doesn't reach out to any friends to get together, but he is bitching and moaning because he's bored. \u00a0\"Everyday is the same he says.\" \u00a0Wait a minute...shouldn't that be a good thing? \n \n\"Are you in school?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Do you get to sleep in?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Do you get to relax and watch movies on our brand new television?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Have you gone out to eat a few times?\" \n\"Yeah\" \n\"Christmas is around the corner and you have gifts to look forward to right?\" \n\"Yeah\" \n\"Then it sounds to me that you have a few things to be grateful for. \u00a0Now if you choose not to realize that. \u00a0That's a choice.\" \n \nBlue is on the edge because of the change in schedule, and the anxiety over his Christmas list, which he continues to revise every, single, day! \u00a0He finds these inadvertent things that he needs me to help him with \"RIGHT AWAY\", when I'm on my way out the door to shop, or finally relaxing after a long day of his brother's meltdowns. \u00a0Last night, he actually threatened to run-away. \u00a0He says, \"I'd rather be homeless than live with this unhappy family!\" \u00a0Such lovely words to hear from your child 2 days before Christmas. \u00a0I went to bed feeling very sad and very exhausted. \n \nI have decided to cancel Christmas for next year. \u00a0At least...I am canceling the way we did it this year. \u00a0There will be no freakin' surprises. \u00a0They will name 3 gifts, within a budget. \u00a0If 1 of your gifts is large, that takes up your entire budget. \u00a0That's it! \u00a0Jesus got 3 gifts. \u00a0He didn't complain that they were too small, not the latest version or what everyone else has.  \n \nI would really like to replace Christmas with a vacation on the beach somewhere...just chillin. \u00a0In truth, that would probably cause more meltdowns than it's worth. \n \nOn Twitter the autism community has been posting these comments with the hashtag #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf. \u00a0One of my post was #YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf...you're trying to figure out how NOT to have so much family togetherness for the holidays.  \n \nWell...Cheers to Christmas day my peeps!

{"date": "Tuesday, December 13, 2011", "body": "\n \nDear Blog, \n \nI am missing you. \u00a0Haven't seen you for a few days. \u00a0When that happens...it makes me a little sad. \u00a0You are in many ways one of my closest friends. \u00a0The one I tell my secrets too...for all the world to see. \u00a0(Wait a minute...that's an oxymoron.) \n \nWhy have I been away you ask? \u00a0Well guess what? \u00a0I've had a few hellacious days with my lovely children. \u00a0I don't know if it's the full moon...the pull of the earth...anxiety flying around in the atmosphere? \u00a0Maybe it's the holidays approaching and all of the stress that comes along with this \"Most Wonderful Time of the Year?\" \n \nChristmas used to be my favorite season you know. \u00a0Two straight weeks of parties, events, dressing up, sleeping in. \u00a0Now it's a month's worth of work! \u00a0Preparation, shopping, decorating, sending cards, cooking, deescalating meltdowns, refereeing fights, cooling anxieties. \u00a0Oh and let's not forget pulling teeth to get my husband to help me with all of this. \u00a0He is the official Grinch who stole Christmas. \u00a0He's always a little bit grumpier around this time of year, because of the work that's involved and the money that we spend. \u00a0Bah Humbug! \u00a0For some mysterious reason, he always disappears for at least 2 business trips right before the holiday. \n \nSo Sunday was the biggest day from Hell that I've seen in quite sometime. \u00a0It started off with Red going off and being rude for no apparent reason, other than \"We all make him so mad!\" \u00a0This was by the way...during Church. \u00a0Isn't that lovely. \u00a0Hell...during church. \u00a0That is...church right here in our living room via internet. \u00a0He is usually gone to HIS church during this time, but he slept in today. \u00a0Lucky us! \u00a0So he decided to disrupt our service. \u00a0 \n \nHe finally pulled it together and actually reached out to his Pastor who invited him to come to a youth event at church that evening. \u00a0 He showered up and pulled out his video camera and off he went. \u00a0I believe they prayed with him while he was gone. \u00a0One issue down...check! \u00a0 \n \nOnce we get Red calm...Blue decides to have a meltdown or 2 or 3. \u00a0I'm not even sure what they were all about, but it went on and off all day long, no matter what I did to try to sooth him. \u00a0Warm baths, yoga, comedy shows on t.v., baking cookies. \n \nWe haven't seen him act like this since before he started taking any medication. \u00a0Actually, we were trying to make an adjustment to one of the meds. (Big Part of the Problem) \u00a0We tried reducing it, because it appeared to be making him tired. \u00a0Well he completely fell apart. \u00a0 Have I told you lately \u00a0how frustrating this freaking medication issue is? \u00a0I HATE IT! It makes you feel so completely helpless when things go wrong. \u00a0You question your decision to give it to them in the first place. \u00a0You blame yourself, and curse the fact that they actually need it...no matter how much you don't want them to. \n \nIt's so disheartening to watch your child go through such pain and frustration. \u00a0I have a tendency to get a side order of sympathy anxiety myself when one of them is so upset. \u00a0Why can't I just watch it like a bad movie and not actually feel every inch of their pain? \u00a0I guess that comes along with the package of being their mother.  \n \nAnyhoo...I'm glad to come back to see you dear Blog. \u00a0Not only are you a dear friend...you are my free therapist. \u00a0Thank you for being here when I need you. \u00a0You don't always solve my problems, but you are a wonderful release valve. \n \np.s. Readers...no time to edit this writing. \u00a0Hope you get the picture. Not much time available for beautiful writing during this lovely season.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/12/dear-blog.html", "title": "\nDear Blog...\n"},
{"date": "Friday, December 9, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nWe're driving past the local community college campus when Red asks, \"Is that the college I'll be going to?\"  \n\"I guess so...unless you live down in Austin and go to a campus near where you live?\" \n\"What do you mean? \u00a0I'm going to live with you...right?\" \n\"Maybe...maybe not.\"  If you can't be respectful of our home and our rules...you're out on your keester buddy!\u00a0 \nOf course, I'm not going to just kick him to the curb...but I want him to think that it's a possibility. \n \nHe is stunned...stumped...confused to say the least. \u00a0I am actually trying to shock him a little bit into reality. \u00a0I go on to explain that he could have his own apartment with a roommate. \u00a0He can't even imagine that. \u00a0He wants the best of everything...all of the comforts that will come along with living with us, instead of having to work hard to take care of himself. \u00a0He must have a big screen t.v. and a really nice computer. \u00a0He may not be able to afford all of that on his own. \n \n\"Community College only takes 2 years Mom. \u00a0I may not be ready to move by then.\"  \n\"It  could  take 2 years if you are carrying a full load, but since they don't make accommodations like you're getting now...it will probably take you longer because you will have to take less classes.\" \n\"What do you mean they don't make accommodations!?\" he asks incredulously. \n\"Going to college is a privilege not a right. \u00a0You have to study for test. \u00a0You have to do the assignments as given. \u00a0You will have to do homework and you will have to take some classes that you may not like if you want a Bachelor's degree. \u00a0They may assist you with some things, but there will be no modified curriculum and shortened assignments.\" \n \nHe looks at me like I'm from another planet. \u00a0He can't believe the audacity of these schools...making people do all of this work! Why should you have to take classes that you're not interested in? \u00a0Why should he have to do all of that reading and work on his own time...at home. \u00a0 That's ridiculous!  \u00a0You see Red really only wants to do what HE wants to do. \u00a0Anything that he doesn't really want to do seems overwhelming. \u00a0I really think that if he could just sit back and take handouts from us for the rest of his life...he would. \u00a0However, that offer is not on the table. \u00a0He is smart. \u00a0He is talented and he will have to use those talents and put them to work to pay for this grandiose life that he wants. \u00a0 \n \n\"You can do anything you want to do.\" I tell him. \u00a0\"If you don't want to go to college and take classes you don't like...that's fine. \u00a0You can into a technical program where you learn more about graphics and film editing. \u00a0You can still have a good life if you take your skills and make them better and be willing to work hard. \u00a0Laziness is not a part of your disability. \u00a0That is a choice you can make, but be prepared for a meager life.\" \nLater when we get home...the conversation continues. \n\"So If I don't go to college and get a Bachelor's degree, can I still be rich?\" Rich??? \u00a0 This kid wants to be rich without the work that's involved. \u00a0Now THAT's rich!\u00a0 \n\"I don't know if you'll be rich. \u00a0But if you work hard and focus on your talents...you will be able to take care of yourself and hopefully some day, be able to take care of your family. \u00a0Many people with Aspergers have good jobs. \u00a0It is not a sentence to a meager life. \u00a0It's all about choices. \u00a0And I can't make the choices for you. \u00a0You have to make them yourself.\" \n \nThis boy really scares me! \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gv9W3PtO4sk/TuI1pgT51fI/AAAAAAAAAi0/DGE2TrdLZbI/s1600/images-30.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/12/college.html", "title": "\nCollege?\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, December 14, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nI wrote yesterday about the just wonderful weekend from hell that we had  \"Dear Blog\" . \nToday, Red has an appointment scheduled with his Psychiatrist, which is right on time. \u00a0I decide to also sneak Blue in to see her as well. \u00a0We're driving down there on this soupy, gray, foggy morning during rush hour traffic. \u00a0Huh! \n\"Where are all of these people going?\" asks Blue. \n\"To work,\" I reply. \n\"Well...why did you schedule an appointment at this time?\" asks Red, as if the two of them actually have to navigate this traffic. \u00a0As if, they are both in a hurry to get where? Back to school?? \u00a0The place that they complain about 24/7? \n\"I scheduled the appointment at this time, because this is the time she had available. \u00a0She's a busy woman.\" \n \n \n Ups \u00a0 \nRed is actually on a real high note. \u00a0He's been smiling, being positive...showing affection and care for his brother's bad moods. \u00a0It's been a little eerie...good...but still, eerie. \u00a0It probably has something to do with the fact that a female friend gave him her number the other day. \u00a0\"I just want to be her friend. \u00a0I'm going to take things slow,\" he says. \u00a0I only pray that he is capable of doing that. \u00a0History says otherwise. I hate to be negative...but I am not looking forward to going down this road.  \n \nSo when we get to the doctors office...he presents as this happy-go-lucky kid that we don't recognize. \u00a0He has completely forgotten about fighting with his father a week ago and yelling at us because we all, \"make him so mad!\" this past weekend. \u00a0\"Everything is going great!\" he tells the doctor.  \n \n Downs\u00a0 \nBlue is honest in telling her about his spontaneous combustion and frustrations with home and school i.e., \u00a0his anxiety, inability to ask for and/or accept help from adults, his peers who seriously annoy him. \u00a0She adds Intuniv, 1mg. to his repertoire (fingers crossed along with eyes and toes). \u00a0Not to mention..cha ching! goes the wallet! \n \nLater, Red comes home from school with face hanging down. \u00a0He had a relatively good day I am told by the school Psychologist. \u00a0However, at the end of the day, he somehow started to get overwhelmed with emotion and actually got teary when talking with one of his teachers. \u00a0His mind is over-processing this new adventure into making friends with girls. \u00a0Then a friend of his told him that he was thinking of \"hurting himself\" because a girl is being mean to him. \u00a0All of this was just too much for Red to process.  \n \n Turn-Arounds \nI put on a funny t.v. show and leave him sitting in front of it, while I run out to take Blue to Art Lessons. By the time I get back home, Red is laughing at the t.v. and chatting on Facebook.  \n \nBlue comes home in a relatively good mood, but then it goes downhill when he asks me to read his memoir and I make the mistake of giving him a few grammatical corrections. \u00a0\"I didn't ask you to correct it! \u00a0I asked you to read it! You're too picky!\" \nWell...exCUUSE ME!! \u00a0I walk away without another word.  \nHe ends up apologizing before bed. \n\"I'm sorry that we just can't get along mom. \u00a0I really don't want to argue with you. \u00a0It's like...I just can't help it.\" \nUgh! Blow to the gut! Painfully sad, yet touching me deeply.  \n \nI remember working for a mental health agency in my 20's. \u00a0This time of year was always tough. \u00a0The clients would all be falling apart. \u00a0I thought it was because of baggage from their past, or something they felt was missing in their lives during the holidays. \u00a0Who knew someday...this would be my reality? \u00a0And there is really no rhyme or reason to it all. \u00a0I am praying that next two weeks will get better. \u00a0That they will relax and enjoy our downtime. \u00a0Yet, I am cautiously afraid that they won't. \n \nMy personal Facebook Status yesterday was this: \n \n\"I can't believe this is my life.\" \u00a0I'm not saying it's bad. I'm not saying it's good. \u00a0I'm just sayin... \n \nDespite it all...I try to keep my sense of humor. \u00a0Actually, if I didn't...I'd be in the nuthouse for sure! \u00a0So I will end this post on a funny note: \n \n \n \n \nThe other day, Red decides to look for something at the last minute, making himself miss the bus and making everyone late that day. \u00a0He shuts down...lays on the couch and refuses to move. \u00a0 \n \n\"I'm not going to school today! \u00a0I'm just too tired!\"\u00a0 \n \nNow recently he was baptized and told us that he is going to be trying his best to follow the example of Christ. \u00a0So I pull this question on him, \"Do you think Jesus Christ would be laying on the couch, yelling at his parents, refusing to go to school?\" \n \nHe replies swiftly in his matter-of-fact, flat, monotone voice, \"Jesus didn't have to go to school. \u00a0He already knew everything.\" \n \nHA! \"And how do you know that?\" I ask. \n \n\"Because he's God's son. \u00a0He knew everything when God sent him down here.\" \n \n\"Well...you don't know everything so you better get your but up and get ready to go to school!\" \n \n \n \nLife is just a bed of Roses...without the thorns removed.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1-tNFXX1Ca8/Tujp8N8LuDI/AAAAAAAAAjc/2RfoPQh5PZ8/s1600/images-31.jpeg", "ttp://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/12/dear-blog.html"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/12/ups-downs-turn-arounds.html", "title": "\nUps, Downs & Turn Arounds\n"},

He was only gone for 30 minutes. \u00a0My head was pounding so hard, I didn't even go an look for him. \u00a0He picked up a knife and threatened to hurt himself today. \u00a0Then he is remorseful yet, upset with himself for behaving this way. \u00a0 He says, he feels out of control and that his doctor is not helping him.  \n\"I HATE Dr. So and So! \u00a0She's not helping me! \u00a0This is her fault!\" He says irrationally.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe triggers??? \u00a0Well...let's see, \"Can you guys buy me a movie, because I can't spend  my  money on that. \u00a0I have to buy something else.\" Uh...No we can not. \u00a0We're all spent out. \u00a0Are you kidding me? \u00a0They have no idea that the bills from Christmas still have to be paid. \u00a0We did most of our shopping online...for convenience. \u00a0But when that credit card bill comes in...we plan on paying it...in full! \u00a0We are not buying another thing! \u00a0Especially when everything we've already bought has not caused happiness. \u00a0In fact, it's caused meltdowns. \n \n \n \nWhen Blue recovers from that meltdown. \u00a0I'm thinking...that's it for the day. \u00a0No! \u00a0I am wrong. \u00a0At 8:30 p.m. he asks can he have company. \u00a0Uh...No. \u00a0It's a little late to be asking a friend to come over. \u00a0Not to mention we are all recuperating from your last meltdown. \u00a0This brings on another rant. \u00a0This is unreal!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs I am sitting at the kitchen table...he sees me loosing it. \u00a0I believe this is a first. \u00a0I don't ever remember crying in front of him before. \u00a0I'm just so tired of doing anything and everything to hopefully produce an ounce of happiness from these kids. \u00a0From the things we buy them, to the places we take them, to the therapy and medication. \u00a0Nothing seems to be working right now! \u00a0I feel so helpless! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nDad escaped to the movies for a couple of hours, because he was about to loose it. \u00a0He doesn't have half the patience that I do. \u00a0That would not be pretty, so I sent him off for a few hours. \n \n \n \nThe boys, try to comfort me for all of 10 minutes. \u00a0Before they move on to making cookies. \u00a0(Hey...at least I didn't have to make them.) \u00a0I just couldn't pull myself together. \u00a0In a way, I think it's good for them to see the emotion....for them to know that they are not the only ones who can loose it. \u00a0I am human and not always a pillar of strength. \u00a0I have limits.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOf course...I will go on. \u00a0Tomorrow will hopefully be a better day. \u00a0Yada yada yada! \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThank you to my  Facebook Community \u00a0\u00a0friends for the prayers and positive thoughts. \u00a0I love you all. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/12/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-some-san-i.html", "title": "\nAll I Want for Christmas Is Some San-i-Ty\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, January 29, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nOne thing I love about the internet and autism community is the exchange of information that you may otherwise not get. \u00a0I wrote and shared this post,\u00a0 \"Under the Rocks\" \u00a0 about how happy I am with our visit to the Pediatric Neurologist. \u00a0I felt so good about following my instincts and mother's intuition when it comes to my boys and the medications they are taking. \n \nIn this post I mention specifics about medications which if I had been in my right mind, I may not have done. \u00a0I mean the detailed information is a little personal. \u00a0But then again, my life is an open book. \u00a0And this blog is based on our reality. \u00a0As it turns out...it was a good thing. \n \nMy friend\u00a0 John Scott Holman \u00a0an infamous Autism Writer, shared my post with his fans. \u00a0He also commented on my Facebook link after he read the post, \"Be Careful with Effexor. \u00a0Focalin dose is too low. \u00a0Depakote did nothing for me and is very toxic to the liver and sedating. \u00a0Seroquel is extremely sedating and caused me to become lethargic and depressed.\" \n \nOf course this gets me to thinking... WTH? I have not done my own due diligence by researching this medication myself. \u00a0Here I go...trusting the professionals.   \u00a0The Psychiatrist originally prescribed this medication. \u00a0The Neurologist followed her cue and wanted to increase the dosage to the appropriate level for his weight.  \n \nThe professionals don't live with my kid. \u00a0They won't have to deal with the fallout should this not go well. \u00a0So after John made this comment, I was all over it.  \n \n'Dear Google -what's up with this drug Effexor. \u00a0I need to know the good, the bad and the ugly?' \n \nI review several web-sites. \u00a0The one I find most interesting is this site called\u00a0 Crazymeds . \u00a0The site gives fact, opinion and reviews from those who have used these medications telling us how it effected them. \u00a0There is also a little humor used in the descriptions, which of course, I love. \u00a0People who have used Effexor have either loved it and hale it as a miracle, or they hated it. \u00a0Almost no one said it did not work, but what they did say freaked me out. \u00a0Several users said things like: \n \n\"Don't miss a dose! Or you'll be sorry!\" \n\"Coming off of this med is a nightmare!\" \n \nUnder the category of Cons it says: \n \n\"For many people Effexor XR has the absolute worst discontinuation syndrome of an an antidepressant. \u00a0It is a medication that people utterly loathe to have taken. It is not uncommon for someone to fire doctors during or immediately after they quit taking...\" \n \nI post on my  \"Confessions\" Facebook Page ,\u00a0I pose the question, \"Does anyone have experience with Effexor? \u00a0I get the similar comments.  \n \n\"It was effective, but don't miss a dose.\" \n\"...the biggest problems were if she missed a dose --she just fell apart and got paranoid and her school called me once because they thought she was suffering a psychotic break.\" \n \nAfter reading this I am done. \u00a0I didn't sleep that night. \u00a0The following morning, \u00a0I call the Neurologist office and tell them I don't want to continue use of Effexor. \u00a0This drug sounds like where you go as a last resort. \u00a0We have not exhausted all of the possibilities yet. \u00a0I am leaning towards Wellbutrin as a result of my research and feedback. \u00a0At this point, he is only 3 days in to Effexor...so the doctor says it is fine to discontinue usage. We will discuss what we want to replace it with next week. \n \nOh and by the way...the blood-work came back and his platelets are low. \u00a0So we need to also decrease that Depakote, which could be causing the low platelets. \u00a0 Not remembering what I learned way back in high-school and college about the human body I ask, \"And what exactly do the platelets do?\" \u00a0They apparently help with clotting. \u00a0If your platelets are low...you could bleed out from an injury.  Good thing we did that blood-work!\u00a0 \n \nAt the same time...I am already seeing more energy from him. \u00a0His moods are mostly good...but kind of all over the place like a roller coaster from moment to moment. \u00a0 I have seen some aggression and cursing like a sailor. \u00a0I believe that I am seeing more of his personality. \u00a0Don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. \n \nThe bottom line...adjusting medications is a real pain-in-the a**! \u00a0It helps, if you have a doctor who is listening to you. \u00a0But, there are no easy answers or quick fixes. \u00a0It is a painful, arduous process that requires a great deal of due diligence on the part of the patient, and in this case, the patient's mother. \n \nIf you haven't already...come and join me on\u00a0 Facebook . \u00a0The community we have is invaluable.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fOveaToIoyM/TyWBY1VknlI/AAAAAAAAAmI/AskmN8mUcfc/s1600/images-3.jpeg", "http://www.facebook.com/JScottHolman?ref=pb", "http://www.crazymeds.us/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Meds/Effexor#.TySzVZiLGlI", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=tn_tnmn"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/01/on-second-thought.html", "title": "\nOn Second Thought...\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, November 2, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n Editorial note: Today's post is dedicated to team 7R...Blue's awesome team of teachers. \u00a0Thank you all! \n \nHomework with Blue my Asperger tween,s has become this...thing...this major league, gigantic, anxiety-ridden, time-eating, monster-thing, which is starting to erode our quality of life after school. \u00a0There is hardly any time to play, relax, watch a movie, exercise or hang out with friends. \u00a0It's all about trying to slay this monster every night so that the teachers, \"won't be mad because I didn't finish it.\"  \n \nThis year he basically skipped a year of math and moved up into an advanced class which is on the 8th grade level instead of 7th. \u00a0Now don't get me wrong...his grades are all in the 90's, so he's doing fine. \u00a0But he comes home and acts like he is totally overwhelmed by the homework. \u00a0I'm not a math kind of girl...especially an advanced math kind of girl. \u00a0In a pinch, I can get on the internet and figure out the basics of a problem, but I'm not good at it by any stretch. \n \nDad does the helping out in the math department. \u00a0You didn't hear this from me, but he teaches everything the long way...and sometimes, the wrong way. \u00a0Which means, Blue actually ends up teaching him. \u00a0They do this Tango...and it takes them 2 hours to do an assignment that should take say...30 minutes. \u00a0Last week they actually worked on 10 word problems for well over 2 hours. \u00a0I had to leave the room and go have a drink to keep from pulling my hair out.  \n \nIn my mind, homework should be practice of what you have already learned at school. \u00a0If you don't know it...you should go back to school and have them teach it to you until YOU KNOW it. \u00a0It's not about what your PARENTS know...or in this case what they DON'T know. \n \nSo I call a meeting with his teachers to talk about the homework issue. \u00a0In his case...he is college bound, so he doesn't want his assignments cut. \u00a0But, we need to make things more manageable so that he isn't freaking out every night...better yet, so I'm not freaking out every night.  \n \nI am so delighted to walk into a room this morning with each and every one of his 7th grade teachers...i.e., Math, Science, Social Studies, Language Arts, APS (study skills), the 7th grade Principle and his Special Ed. Tracking Teacher. \u00a0Wow! \u00a0All of these adults in a room...just to help my kid! Thank you teachers! \n \nThey all say that he is doing great! \u00a0He is an awesome student, but get this...he hardly asks any questions. \u00a0Sometimes he does get preoccupied with thoughts. \u00a0He doesn't always move as quickly as he could, or should, \u00a0but basically he's doing great. \u00a0Even when he stays after school for tutorials, he doesn't really ask very many questions, he just does his work and he does it in a relatively short period of time. \n \nSo why are we getting the okie doke here at home? \u00a0Why is he suddenly so confused, needs so much help and takes so much time? \u00a0Could it be that he just wants our 1 on 1 attention? \u00a0Does he want to steal a little bit of Red's thunder (he who requires our attention in a very negative, all-consuming fashion)? \u00a0Is he just zonked at the end of the day? \u00a0Is it his anxiety? Is he distracted by thoughts of, \"I'd rather be on my computer than doing this freakin' homework?\" \u00a0Oh and lets not forget the almighty, energy consuming quest for perfection. \u00a0Having Aspergers gives you a healthy combination of all of the above...especially the anxiety and being tired at the end of the day. \u00a0It takes a lot to hold it together and be perfect all day at school. \u00a0There is no energy left for perfection here at home. \n \nI am so glad that we had this meeting because if I told him any of the things below...he would not believe or listen to me. \u00a0What the heck do I know? He got to hear it directly from the source (all of his teachers. \u00a0Here is what we came up with:  \n \n1) Blue...you are an awesome student! \u00a0We know you work hard and want to to things right. \n2) Do homework to the best of your ability. \u00a0Circle the problems you don't understand and bring them in the next day for reteaching, or clarification. It will not be considered late.  \n3) Do test corrections (with a teacher) at school...not here at home (YAY!) \n4) Work with Special Ed teacher to plan (stair step) larger projects. \n5) Come in for tutorials before and/or after school...ask questions if you need to.  \n6) Go to the public library if you need a quiet place to work. \n7) Leave your mom and dad out of doing homework with you...it's slowing you down! \u00a0WOO HOO!!! \n8) When you spend less time doing homework, you can have some downtime to spend 1 on 1 with your parents doing something fun. \n \nThe bottom line is this: \n \nStop freaking out about everything...your teachers care about you. \u00a0They think you're doing great and they are here to help! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xCJ0vEu_1uY/TrGuqRnkd4I/AAAAAAAAAa0/0RT_jYJVhtU/s1600/images-23.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/11/homework-help.html", "title": "\nHomework Help!!!\n"},

Then a little avatar of your body comes up on the screen. \u00a0It shows an overweight guy with a rather large torso area. \n \n\"I don't look like that!

I also enjoyed coddling and spoiling my 2 year-old niece. \u00a0We ate good food, drank good wine watched movies and played with my babies. \u00a0Baby C's personality seems very calm and introspective. \u00a0As I watch him I wonder what his personality will actually be. \u00a0His sister is a complete bundle of energy and entertainment. \u00a0She's talking up a storm, often uttering her favorite word that she says in the sweetest voice, \"no.\" \n \n \n \nMy boys do miss me, of course. \u00a0Before I left, Red announces that he is giving up on his hobby of flying via Flight Simulator in order to focus on his video editing business. \u00a0I tell him he can do both, \u00a0but he seems to be an all or nothing kind of guy.  \nSubsequently, he spends most of the weekend claiming boredom. \u00a0He does not actually work on any videos. \u00a0Instead, he spends a great deal of time and energy complaining about one thing or another. \u00a0What he wants is attention...and he will get it one way or another whether it's positive or negative. \u00a0Whatever positive attention he receives while I am away...is not enough. \u00a0The good things his father does with him have a short shelf life. \n \nLately, he doesn't do well with unstructured time here at home. \u00a0He feels like he has to be entertained in some way...that is, when he's not on his computer. \u00a0If not, he wants to talk non-stop about a subject of interest or about something he wants to do or buy. \u00a0He can talk himself into a stupor, when the answer to his request is not what he wants to hear, or if you just disagree with him or try to redirect him to do something that will change his negative thought pattern. \u00a0This eventually turns into a miniature meltdown, which he apologizes for an hour later. \u00a0It's big fun! \n \nHe finally admits on Sunday that he just misses me and is mad because I am away. \u00a0 This combined with his selective boredom presents quite a challenge for Dad. \u00a0Do I feel any guilt about this? Maybe a tinge. \u00a0But the bottom line is for MY sanity, I need time to decompress...to just think...to just be, without my every thought being interrupted...especially by negativity. \u00a0Dad gets this on a regular basis when he travels for business. \u00a0He doesn't want to count it as \"peace\" time, but the bottom line is that he closes the door to a hotel room at night and doesn't have to listen to any crazy talk for hours on end. \u00a0I don't care if he is working. \u00a0It's still a break from the insanity. \n \nWhen I get home Monday afternoon...I'm not in the door ten minutes before he is all over me, like white on rice!

Hubby leaves to go take eldest son to work. \u00a0Something is wrong with his car. \u00a0From there, he meets a friend to have lunch and go watch some football. \u00a0He is gone most of the day.  \n \nI enjoy a relatively quiet morning, watching church service on the internet, drinking coffee and playing Scrabble. \n \nRed comes home from church and within a half-hour another friend shows up at our house. \u00a0This is a NEW friend from school. \u00a0The two of them are going to build a computer together that they are donating to the CAMP area where they hang out @ lunch time. \u00a0Now wouldn't it have been nice if our resident computer expert (Dad) had been here to support this positive effort? \u00a0Sure...it would be, but that isn't on his priority list for the day. \u00a0Oh well...the boys do the best that they can. \u00a0They seem to get along well.  \n \nGod is answering  \"My Prayer\" \u00a0that I wrote last December. \u00a0Red has a new friend. \u00a0This delights him and makes me ecstatic. \n \nAfter several hours, Red's friend goes home. \u00a0A half-hour later, Blue has a friend over. \u00a0They play video games boisterously, and hang out being silly together. \u00a0He's happy...I'm happy right? \u00a0After I prepare and serve dinner, I take his friend home. \n \nDuring this time, that the boys have company, \u00a0my mother is more focused on the conversations between the boys in the next room, than she is on her own television shows that she's supposed to be watching. \u00a0She feels the need to make her own comments and interjections. \u00a0I want to tell her to watch her show and mind her own damn business. \u00a0I refrain.  \n \nHubby finally makes his way home just as all the activity is dying down. \u00a0Somehow, he always manages to get away when the boys have any company in the house. \u00a0We haven't had an outburst all day long. \u00a0He's in the door for 5 minutes and he and Red are going at it. \u00a0There I go into my referee job. \n \nBy the end of the night I'm zonked. \u00a0I just want to crawl into my room and hide under the covers. I want to disappear into my Word's with Friends games online. \u00a0It's a cool way to play with your friends from the convenience of your very own bed.  \n \nRed comes in and wants to \"talk\" around 9:30 p.m. \u00a0I just have nothing left. \u00a0I ask him to please leave my room. \u00a0I just don't want to \"talk\" anymore. \u00a0I don't want to here the repetitive dialog. \u00a0I'm just done. \u00a0I muster up the energy to meet him in his room for prayer before he goes to sleep. \n \nThis morning I take them both to school. \u00a0Both of them are giving me a driving lecture. \u00a0Do either of them have a driver's license? \u00a0NO! \u00a0I have been driving for 30 years! \u00a0I tell them both, \" If you don't like my driving...you can both can get out and walk!\"  \n \n\"Well...it's just that Dad drives so much better than you.\"  \n\"Then tell your Dad to take you to school and all of the other places I manage to get you to on a regular basis!\" \n\"Why are you getting so mad?\" They have the nerve to ask me.  \n\"I'm in a bad mood. \u00a0Have you ever been in a bad mood?\" I ask them. \n\"Well today is my turn.\" \n \nThey have all trampled all over my nerves. \u00a0I am thankful that today is Monday and they are at school trampling all over someone else's. \n \n If you haven't already, come join our\u00a0 \u00a0 Confessions Community on Facebook  .\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GIOlNHF30NM/TsFHlYbBIsI/AAAAAAAAAeE/vGkMneJu92Y/s1600/Dear+Diary.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/11/dear-diary-its-my-turn.html", "title": "\nDear Diary -It's My Turn\n"},

{"date": "Monday, November 21, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nAbout 3 years ago Red started going to church with his friend of. \u00a0Summer before last, they went to a christian sleep away  Summer Camp \u00a0(click to read that post).\u00a0\u00a0He comes home so excited about the experience of making new friends, being and being socially accepted. \u00a0He participated in the Follies, where he and his friend sang a rock song and everyone gave him a standing ovation. \u00a0He was hooked! In fact, his friend ended up having to leave camp because of some unacceptable behavior. \u00a0Red stayed on and had a good time anyway. \n \n \n \nHe mentioned wanting to be baptized back then, but I wasn't quite sure if he really connected with what it meant. \u00a0He has mentioned it from time to time, since then but he didn't seem all that serious about it. \u00a0He continued to attend church, without me, for which, I was happy. \u00a0There are so few things that he wants to do consistently without me. \u00a0I welcomed the fact that he was doing something positive on his own. \n \n \n \nThough, I am a follower of Christ...I do not actively practice organized religion. \u00a0Since the kids were born and we moved to Texas, we have attended various churches...some more regularly than others. \u00a0The boys never really liked any of the black, Baptist churches, with loud gospel music that I like. \u00a0We tried several more ethnically diverse christian churches. \u00a0These were better for the boys, \u00a0but boring for me. \u00a0Their attention spans are extremely short, so sitting and paying attention for any length of time, was impossible when they were younger. \u00a0Getting out the door on time...another extreme challenge. One that I fight so hard during the week, I have little energy for it on the weekends.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy serious one, \u00a0Blue, would sometimes hang on to part of the message, misinterpret it, and then be too freaked out to go back to that church. \u00a0Regular church attendance became to be less and less practical for our family. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe have been attending church service via the internet for the past year and a half. \u00a0It's the church that my brother-in-law and their family attends in Baltimore, Maryland. \u00a0We hook it up to the t.v. and the speakers and have worship right here in our living room, with gospel music that we can adjust the volume as needed. \u00a0While in Maryland this summer, we actually visited the church. \u00a0It was sO LOUD! Though, we enjoyed meeting the pastor...OMgoodness there is no way, we could do that every Sunday.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nPart of reason that I have not made going to church every Sunday a priority is by own religious background. \u00a0I was raised in a very strict, religious household. \u00a0We were Jehovah's witnesses, which was all encompassing part of our lives... services 3 times a week, and field service at least once. \u00a0I came to absolutely loathe it by the time I reached high school. \u00a0Others in the religion were very intrinsic in our lives. \u00a0I felt I had too many people to answer to...instead of just answering to God, as it should be. By the time I was 17...I was done with it. \u00a0I think subconsciously, I never wanted to make my children hate religion, church and me making them go. \u00a0I want their faith and their connection with God to come from within. \n \nLike many, I have doubts within my faith, but I very much believe in God and his son Jesus Christ and in following his example for my life. \u00a0I have always felt it important to teach my children biblical principals, especially the principals that Jesus lived by during his time here on earth. \u00a0Helping others in need, loving others...even our enemies. \u00a0Blue has a real hard time with that one. \"Why would we love our enemies?\"\u00a0asks my literal boy. \u00a0The importance of being honest and respectful is essential in our home. \u00a0I have taught them the sprit of giving and I try my best to teach them to be thankful for the blessings in their lives. \u00a0Prayer is a part of our daily lives. \u00a0We are however, imperfect sinners...constantly striving, but continually making human errors.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nDespite me, the boys faith in God is just incredible. \u00a0Blue has stopped us in the middle of a trip and said, lets hold hands and pray for our safety, and give thanks for this blessing. \u00a0He teaches his friends the things that I've taught him about kindness and not making fun of others. \u00a0And Red...he found his way to church without me. \u00a0He found himself a small church full of pure, accepting, Christians...where the music is quiet and doesn't bother his senses. \u00a0The environment is serene enough where he has been able to learn more biblical principals. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe comes to me last week and says, \"I want to be baptized next Sunday.\" \u00a0Memories flash through my mind of when my mom made me get baptized. \u00a0She thought it was time. \u00a0I felt forced. \u00a0When I asked him why, he was very clear. \u00a0\"I want to try to follow the example of Christ. \u00a0I know I won't be perfect, but I want to try. \u00a0I know I've done things that are wrong in the past. \u00a0And I just want to be a good person.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAnd so it came to be. \u00a0On Sunday, as I looked on with tears in my eyes, \u00a0my 16 year-old son testified as to his faith in the Lord in front of the entire congregation, which included our family. The congregation so small...that they all know and have come to love him. \u00a0He was held in a loving embrace and baptized... \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eSNuT7ojLH0/TsqektXj-1I/AAAAAAAAAhA/y4GI88iD4nE/s1600/familychurch.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pEwMq5rDeuI/TsqednDG43I/AAAAAAAAAg4/rkB2Rmn5Z3o/s1600/testimony+baptism.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/11/baptism-despite-me.html", "title": "\nBaptism Despite Me\n"},

(I say in my Sarah Jessica Parker voice to my blog) I've missed you so. \u00a0I haven't been able to write to you since school was out last week. \u00a0They kept me busy almost every waking moment. You are my therapy...so yes, I've been going a little nuts with out you...my stress reliever. \n \nThen there was the family vacation (an oxymoron) to visit our friends up in Dallas. \u00a0I spent the days beforehand freaking out about it. \u00a0 How can we make this as smooth as possible for the boys? \u00a0What kind of sleeping arrangement will work best? \u00a0How will we get along with all of us in the car for hours at at time? \u00a0Will all of that family togetherness send one of us over the edge?  \u00a0Surely it will! \u00a0It always does. \u00a0And this time we have my mom with us to boot! \u00a0Add a new player to the game and the dynamics of the game will change. \u00a0 How will the boys handle it all?  \u00a0It's almost enough to make me completely change my mind about traveling.  \n \n \n \n Picture Taken in 2005 One of the biggest accomplishments in my life... A 40-year friendship \n \nWe traveled to Dallas to spend Thanksgiving with my oldest, dearest friends. \u00a0These girls (sisters) I have known for nearly 40 years...I hate to say that out loud. \u00a0But then again, it is something to be proud of. \u00a0We have known each other since I was about 6 or 7 years old. \u00a0We were neighbors who shared a common wall for most of our childhood into young adulthood. \u00a0I spent more time sitting at their kitchen table than I did my own. \u00a0Their house was the place to hang out. \u00a0They were my sisters...their mother a second mom, who I could talk to about anything. \u00a0Every song from that era is a memory of us hanging out together, singing into hair-brushes in front of the living room window..our audience...the rest of the world. \u00a0From Earth, Wind and Fire to Natalee Cole, to The Emotions. \u00a0 Oh...Oh! \u00a0Am I telling my age here? \n \nWell of course we had a ball! \u00a0It's simply a miracle and a blessing that we all grew up in Los Angeles, and now we live 3 hours from each other all the way here in Texas! \u00a0Our mothers of course, also know and love each other. \u00a0It was lovely for them to visit together as well. \u00a0They had other family in from California, whom we all know and love. It was great to see them as well. \n \nMy husband, Big Papa rented an Escalade for us to drive up there in, so that we would have plenty of space to keep the boys apart, and all of the luxuries of satellite radio, and a DVD player to keep the kids occupied...hopefully. Was this enough to make Red happy? \u00a0Of course not. \u00a0When we got ready to leave home...he refused to get in the car. \u00a0\"I'm not going. \u00a0I just want to stay home by myself.\" \u00a0Anxiety kicking in as I knew that it would. \u00a0 What will it be like to spend all this time around my family? \u00a0I'm not going to know anyone there?  Although, we've spent time around these friends several times over the past 5 years since they lived up there.  \n \nThanks to a special holiday deal, we got 2 suites and had the boys sleep in separate rooms so that there would be a little less family togetherness for them. \u00a0They both got to sleep alone, on the let-out couches in each room. \u00a0This worked out great! The only weird thing is...I slept in the room with my Mom and Blue while hubby slept in the room with Red. \u00a0Of course, I did sneak over there to snuggle after everyone went to sleep.  \n \nThe Thanksgiving party itself was great for us (adults)...very difficult for our Aspergers boys. \u00a0The last time we spent Thanksgiving weekend with these friends, we actually stayed at their house. \u00a0The boys played so well with their children. \u00a0 Now that they are teenagers...with Aspergers and so socially awkward, they did not connect at all with the kids there. \u00a0And there were plenty of kids...cousins, friends from high-school and college who were dropping in and out. \u00a0My boys felt totally out of place. \u00a0It was actually pretty painful to watch.  \n \nThe adults all engaged them in conversations...the teens...not so much. \u00a0They were busy visiting with their cousins and friends. \u00a0Blue and Red had too much anxiety too try to break into the conversations. \u00a0Red especially, sits back and waits for people to engage him. \u00a0If that doesn't happen then he feels bad. \u00a0He has no idea what to do in these kind of situations. \u00a0Blue doesn't usually have this problem, but \u00a0because there were so many kids, I think that made it tough for him as well. \u00a0My friend has a daughter who is about the same age as Blue. \u00a0They really connected with in the past. \u00a0This time she was shy and \u00a0hardly had a word to say to him. \u00a0What can you do with that? \u00a0You can't make teenagers play together and engage each other.  \n \nLuckily for him, his best friends from school happened to also be in town. \u00a0The twins were celebrating their 13th birthday on Thanksgiving day. \u00a0Blue got to leave the uncomfortable situation and go to his friend's birthday party. \u00a0Red loosened up a bit as time went on. \u00a0He talked my friend's husband into paying him to complete a video project of the Thanksgiving party. \u00a0He used his video camera to film everyone. \u00a0Even that seemed to be slightly anxiety-ridden. \u00a0He kept coming to me asking what he should do. \u00a0He was especially anxious about filming the teenagers. \u00a0He took periodic sensory breaks...sitting in a quiet place alone, playing \"Angry Birds\". \u00a0Over and over again, as we are drinking and having fun he would come to me and say, \"I'm ready to leave.\" \u00a0I just ached for him, among all of these people who love and care about us and he just couldn't really enjoy it. \n \nWhy did I think that things would get easier for them as they got older? \u00a0Some of the social awkwardness seems to get worse instead of better. \u00a0It's funny though, no matter how much time passes between them seeing our extended family....the sense of comfort with their uncles, aunts and cousins seems to never go away.  \n \nI'll have to consider that when we finalize plans for Christmas...which will be here much faster than I would like for it to be. \n \nFunny though, the following day after all of the parties were over...we went back for one final visit. \u00a0It was much more comfortable and the boys didn't have to be there long. \u00a0As they received their hugs good-bye I implored Red to show them all his beautiful smile. \u00a0Everyone gave him a resounding applause and told him how handsome he is. \u00a0My friend's mother Ms. J -gave him a wonderful hug. \n \nIn the car he said...Ms. J is really special to me.

His cell number! \n \nThe school Psychologist is younger, with spiky hair, and plenty of self-assurance. \u00a0She appears knowledgeable, confident and direct. \u00a0She was able to give me the language to use to diffuse certain situations that I am dealing with here at home, letting me know... this girl knows her stuff!  \u00a0She assured and comforted me by telling me how they will handle this transition with Red...how they will ease him into it, in attempt to make it less stressful for him. \u00a0She tells me how they deal with kids having a bad day, cool-downs, natural consequences... not criminalizing behaviors related to their disability. Innately, I know...they are not bullshitting me! \u00a0This is not placation. \u00a0This is real...this is good. \u00a0His village is ready to get to work. \u00a0We are on our way... \n \n Please take a moment to click below to help spread the word about this blog. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9KpN1X-Anpc/To3GU3hJnTI/AAAAAAAAAWM/MYhxh1d53vQ/s1600/images-1.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/10/it-takes-village.html", "title": "\nIt Takes A Village\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 4, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nChange can be an intimidating, freaky thing for many people, myself included. \u00a0Fear of the unknown, driving without a map or a navigation system makes one wonder how and if you will ever get where you are supposed to be going. \u00a0A few days ago I wrote about Aspergers and \u00a0 \u00a0change...how anxious it can make you...and can lead to negative behaviors and even explosions. \u00a0Well...I put it in writing and \u00a0then God went and proved me wrong. \u00a0We have had a major change here in this house that Aspergers built. \u00a0The ARD/IEP recommendation was to change Red to his home high school campus. \u00a0When the possibility was put on the table he was adamant there was no freakin' way he would be changing schools again! \n \n\"That school is ghetto!\" he actually says in the ARD meeting. \u00a0My husband just about dives underneath his chair of shear embarrassment. \u00a0He was pissed all at the same time, \u00a0knowing that those were not his words...but words he had heard somewhere else. \u00a0Yet, here he was saying them in a room full of teachers and administrators with out the least bit of decorum. \u00a0I mean...what is that anyway? \u00a0Of course, he has never even seen a real ghetto school live and in person in his entire, suburban, over-protected, spoiled little life! \u00a0  \n \nThere is a rivalry between the crosstown school that he has been going to for the past year and his homeschool. \u00a0The kids at his homeschool are not as spoiled and preppy as the kids where he has been attending. \u00a0At this crosstown school ethnic diversity is sparse at best. \u00a0In other words...if you're a big, black kid who goes around not smiling most of the time, looking angry, you definitely stand out in the crowd of marshmallowy faces. \u00a0The home school has a much larger ethnic presence. \u00a0The kids are all colors and all variations of Austin weirdness. \u00a0He will not stand out quite as awkwardly in the crowd. \u00a0He will blend end not perfectly...but much easier. \u00a0He will know more kids from his elementary and first year of middle school days. \n \n \nAfter meeting the staff and hearing about exactly what the program could offer him...I decided to call a few friends of mine within the district to get their opinion of the program. \u00a0In particularly, I call a teacher friend of mine who has a son who is very much like Red, with Aspergers. \u00a0Her son is actually in this program. \u00a0When I say very much like Red, I mean very stubborn, smart but a little on the lazy side...wants to do what he wants to do, no more, no less. \u00a0 Although she is a teacher, she had very little luck in getting her child to perform in a typical school setting, until now. \u00a0When I call her, she has nothing but glowing things to say about the program and his reaction to it. \u00a0And just because she works in the district doesn't mean she's a push-over for what they have offered her child in the past. \u00a0The young man that she is describing to me, sounds nothing like the child I have known him to be. \u00a0He sounds like he is heading in the direction where I need Red to go.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI decide to try to cautiously\u00a0to sell it to him. \u00a0Hoping that he may buy some parts of it. \u00a0That he might take a sample and then love it so much, that he will actually buy the whole thing. \u00a0I want it to ultimately feel like his decision so that he can take ownership of it.\u00a0 \n \n \n\"You've been telling me that you work better in a smaller classroom. \u00a0They have multiple small classroom's with certified, generalist teachers who are qualified to teach each subject. \u00a0There are more peers there who carry the same or similar diagnosis that you do. \u00a0They have an actual social skills group where you can connect with peers who have similar issues and you all can help support each other. \u00a0They have a place where you can hang out during lunch, you can play pool and other games \u00a0if you don't want to be in the big, loud cafeteria. One of the classrooms is set up like a living room, with comfortable chairs and couches.\" \u00a0(Imagine that for the kid who loves to slouch! Hopefully, he won't end up napping there.)  \n \nCan you believe that for over a year I have not known that social skills for him meant working one on one with a teacher...and  no peers with Aspergers ? \u00a0He would say to me...\"We aren't doing any social skills.\" \u00a0And his teacher would assure me that they were. \u00a0She just never told me that it wasn't with a group of kids. \u00a0I find out now that supposedly there are no kids receiving services through that program who have high-functioning autism. \u00a0No wonder Red seemed like such an enigma to them. \u00a0This program was not even the beginning of the kind of support that he needs. \u00a0Is there any wonder that he was not successful there? \u00a0I feel like I put him through a year of torture while I was being sold a bag of goods about what kind of support he was actually getting. \n \n \nTo my surprise, he agrees with me so quickly I almost get whiplash!\u00a0 \n \nRed says to me, \"Fine...if you think it's going to be better for my education...let's do it!\"\u00a0 \n \nI am flabbergasted...floored, but I show very little emotion. \u00a0I am so ready for a fight and if I am lucky, a slow, arduous transition. \u00a0 \n \n\"Do I even have to go back? \u00a0I don't want to go back there,\" he says. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \nThe following day there is an awesome field trip planned and it is the last day of the 6 week grading period. \u00a0He needs to compete assignments and tests. \u00a0I send him to back to school, telling him that on Monday, we will \"Check out the new program.\" \u00a0 \n \nHe has a great time on the field trip. \u00a0He returns to school and mentally checks out... \"You people are not doing anything to help me! I'm done with this school,\" is his basic sentiment during a small tirade. \u00a0He refuses to do any work. \u00a0They call me. \u00a0I inform them that he has pretty much made the decision to make the change. \u00a0He is somewhat anxious about it and though he loves the staff there, but he is feeling some mixed emotions right now. \u00a0I talk to him on the phone and encourage him to finish his work and so that when he says his good-byes that he \u00a0will be remembered fondly. \u00a0He agrees. \u00a0At this point, I know there is no transition. \u00a0This is it! \n \nI am with him on the mixed emotions. \u00a0I feel like I've been duped. \u00a0This was never the place that he needed to be. \u00a0He should have gone to his home school directly from middle school since they have such an intensive program. \u00a0He demonstrated a need based on his behaviors in middle school. \u00a0I have no idea why it was suggested that he be transferred in the first place. \u00a0I am sure that everyone there did their best to help him with the resources they had available...but they NEVER had the resources that he needs. \u00a0If I had not told them that this is not working, and I am ready to pull him out and put him in private school, would I have ever found out about the program available at his homeschool?  \n \nFortunately, they have new blood on campus as their Special Education Lead and once I made this call, \u00a0she called the staff on the carpet and basically said...THIS IS NOT WORKING. \u00a0The really nice guy who was in her place last year was apparently just riding things out at the end of his career and definitely not thinking out of the box as to how to best serve my child. \u00a0There are plenty of places I could look in order to lay blame, or with whom I should be disappointed and upset. \u00a0I don't know how productive that would be. \n \nThe point is that God is in the works. \u00a0He helped me make that sales pitch and he helped Red to buy it. \u00a0He helped us to move forward. \u00a0 We are on a  new path.  \u00a0I believe it will be one that will help him to achieve some successes and to feel more confident as a student, and as a person. \u00a0It will not be simple. There will be curves, bumps and rocks along the path, but at least we are heading in the right direction. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9h7k-U1XND0/ToswtqeBPBI/AAAAAAAAAV0/Pdtg9Saubk4/s1600/images-8.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/10/new-path.html", "title": "\nA New Path\n"},
{"date": "Monday, October 10, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nI am always teaching gratitude to the boys. \u00a0I have the whole speech down to a science. \u00a0So believe me, I feel the extreme guilt when I'm complaining about my life and not being grateful. \u00a0I must make a precursory note of this whining rant. \u00a0I did spend Friday having a me day, getting a manicure and pedicure and having lunch out with my mom. \u00a0For this...I am grateful. \u00a0Still...I spend the rest of the weekend doing a bunch of things that I do not want to do. \u00a0I spend a great deal of my life doing this. \u00a0Sometimes it gets old. \u00a0Sometimes, I just want to be completely selfish. \u00a0But then again...I chose the wrong job if this was my goal. \n \nHere's the deal...when I was in the corporate world, when a job became boring, mundane, and unfulfilling, or I just plain old got sick of the people I worked with or for...I quit...moved on. \u00a0I moved on to something shinier, bigger, with better pay, different responsibilities, more challenges, a change of venue with more opportunity for growth, and nicer people who appreciated me for my talents. \u00a0When I got tired of that...I went to work for myself as a Realtor, where I could create my own schedule, destiny and earning potential.  \n \nLately, as I mill around the grocery store week after week, \u00a0run to the pharmacy, dispense meds, do the carpool run, referee fights, give advice that no-one appears to be listening to, kill spiders, cook dinner, clean dishes, floors and toilets...I can't help but think...This JOB Really SUCKS! \u00a0I quit! \n \nSunday morning starts off with Blue giving me major attitude because he wants to go out to breakfast. \u00a0We watch church services on the internet on Sunday mornings with a laptop hooked up to the big screen t.v. and music streaming through the speakers. \u00a0We do this every Sunday, but I guess we were supposed to drop everything because he wants to go out to eat. \u00a0This turns into a miniature meltdown. \u00a0Where I have to placate him and be all Zen about it. \u00a0I come up with an alternative plan, which includes me making him a major league breakfast, of sausage, eggs and pancakes.  \n \nRed is moaning and groaning because we won't allow him to spend $70.00 for add-on software to a game that he only spent $30.00 for in the first place. \u00a0He already bought a $30.00 add-on a few weeks ago, that he has yet to use. \u00a0Yet, he wants to spend $70.00 MORE when he hasn't even used what he has to full capacity. \u00a0He has this insatiable need to keep buying things that he THINKS will make him happy, of course this never works. \u00a0Now we are the bad guys because we are saving him...protecting him from himself. \u00a0We spend the ENTIRE weekend listening to him rant about this, becoming more belligerent with each passing moment. \u00a0Except for when he comes back with wanting to have a friend over. \u00a0Then, \u00a0he suddenly wants to turn everything around and start being respectful for all of 10 minutes so that he can get what he wants. \u00a0When this doesn't work...he goes back to being ugly again.  \n \nI spend most of the day making a nice Sunday dinner, because Blue, my Mom and my husband love a good Sunday dinner. \u00a0I'd rather be out at a yoga class, hiking, or going to see a chick flick. \u00a0But no...I spend Sunday doing my \"job\". \u00a0By the end of the day...I find myself feeling a little pissy because Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest. \u00a0I do anything, and everything but rest.  \n \nSometimes, I just get so tired of doing things to make everyone-else happy. \u00a0It's exhausting really. \u00a0After dinner, I am so tired. \u00a0Tired of the noise in the house...tired of the sibling arguments, tired of the disagreements between Dad and Red, tired of the lack of peace. \u00a0I come to my room and the three of them are there, Dad, Blue and Red. \u00a0They are discussing possibly watching a movie that I rented for them. \u00a0I actually agree to allow the boys to watch it in my room. \u00a0There I go again...peacemaker, to my own detriment. \u00a0My husband just looks at me like... Really? \u00a0You've been cooking all day and now you're going to let them take over your room?  \u00a0It was a reality check. \n \nI kick them all out, and lock the door for an hour of peace before I would drift off to sleep. \u00a0I pour myself a nice glass of wine and enjoy the quiet. \u00a0Until Red knocks on my door...\"MOM!\" \n \n \n \nSeriously???

The boy LOVES to eat! \u00a0It is a simple pleasure for him. \u00a0He thanks me over and over again with sincerity. \u00a0Afterwards, I convince him to go for a walk to help burn off the calories \n \nAt 3 p.m. \u00a0I leave Blue at home to finish homework. \u00a0(Juggle) While I take Red to go pick up the friend that he has been just dying to have over to hang out and watch his new Blu Ray movie \"Fast Five.\" \u00a0I take these boys to subway for an even later lunch so that I don't have to feed them at home...and clean up the mess. \u00a0I pay for the food and then go sit in my car to play \"Words With Friends\" on my phone, so that I don't have to listen to their ludicrous conversation and watch them scarf down the sandwiches like a couple of wild animals. \n \nI call Hubby to come to pick up Blue to take him to a Destination Imagination meeting. \u00a0D.I. is a team oriented, problem solving/leadership program of sorts. \u00a0(I volunteered hubby to be the Team Manager). \u00a0I think it will be a great bonding experience for them. \u00a0So as they are leaving...I pull up with Red and his friend.\u00a0\u00a0( Juggle Juggle ) \n \nNow Blue doesn't get along all that well with Red's friend and Hubby doesn't really like other people's kids all that much...at least not in our house. \u00a0He barely has the patience for his own kids, much less their friends. \u00a0I think this goes back to his childhood. \u00a0His mother hardly ever let them have friends over...only cousins. \u00a0In my house...there was always a house full of kids. \u00a0For me...this meant mostly boys. \u00a0For some reason most of my friends were boys. \u00a0Especially when I got to high school age. (Really...they were just friends!) \n \nAnyhoo...do you see the juggling trend here? \n \nRed and his friend start watching the movie until Red's friend starts falling asleep. \u00a0He no longer wants to watch the movie. \u00a0Red becomes agitated about this. \u00a0\"I mean...why is he falling asleep? \u00a0He doesn't want to watch the movie anymore ...and I don't want to do anything else...so maybe he should just go home.\" \u00a0Wow...lovely social skills there! I convince the two of \u00a0them to go get on YouTube or something. \u00a0Moments later, I hear \u00a0music and singing...loud, bad, singing along with laughter. (This is rare for Red.) \u00a0Finally...they are having fun. \u00a0Red has been dying to have this friend over. \u00a0Yet...I have to tell them how to have fun together. \n \nBTW...they borrow a chair from Blue's room (with my permission) so that his friend has a place to sit while they are on the computer, listening to music and singing loud and off key. \n \nWhen Blue and Dad come home...I take Red's friend home. \u00a0While driving, Blue calls me...\"WHY IS MY CHAIR IN REd's room!?\" \u00a0He's yelling at me on the phone. \u00a0First of all...this is MY chair that I let him borrow so long ago that apparently, he has forgotten that it's mine. \n\"Excuse me but you are yelling and I am driving. \u00a0This is not acceptable. Good-bye.\" \n \nI come home the rant continues. \u00a0Dad intervenes. \u00a0He is trying to rescue me..however, he does not give any empathy to Blue's feelings. \u00a0He tells him to go wipe the chair with a Lysol wipe if he thinks it's so full of germs. \u00a0This is not acceptable to Blue. \u00a0Dad has hurt his feelings. \u00a0No one understands him. \u00a0He decides he's going to runaway.  \n \nI am kind of glad that he is going to \"walk it off\" (or so I think). \u00a0The problem is it's near dusk. \u00a0 Moments pass and it's getting dark...he is nowhere in sight. \u00a0We are about to send out the search party...me in one car. \u00a0Dad in another. \u00a0Dad leaves first. \u00a0As I am pulling out of the driveway...he walks up. \u00a0Moments later, Dad pulls up to the house. \u00a0The two of them go inside for another chat. \u00a0I keep Red at bay...sitting out on the front porch. \n \nEveryone is so on edge around here. \u00a0It's like walking in a field of landmines. \u00a0This job is not for the weak at heart. \n \nPeace is made...I'm sorries, \u00a0hugs and I love you's are exchanged. \u00a0All is well in the world by the time I kiss them all goodnight. \n \nJust another day in the life... \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4HipFBMXLRw/TpXThE9W2PI/AAAAAAAAAWk/Amt90OggZL4/s1600/bubble.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d3VwAY_ZvGg/TpXY_fxQJBI/AAAAAAAAAWs/sDE9WXxbtvM/s1600/bubble2.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/10/runaway-blue.html", "title": "\nRunaway Blue\n"},

He's in every class and he is distracting me on purpose.\" \u00a0 Apparently, the young man really steps up the action at the end of the day. \u00a0Blue leaves that class upset quite often. \u00a0Then he starts saying \"I don't want to go to school. \u00a0The kids don't think I'm cool. \u00a0They think I'm weird.\" \u00a0When we start to talk about it, he tells me of a conversation about girls, where he tells people, who are not his friends that he thinks girls and their germs are gross. \u00a0He doesn't like kissing, etc. \u00a0Well this is just great ammunition for kids who don't have your best interest at heart.  \n \nI decide to have a conversation with the Counselor, his Special Education teacher and the school Psychologist so that they can assist with squashing some of this distracting behavior. \u00a0I also ask them to work with Blue on his reactions and over-sharing with peers who are not really his friends. \n \nSo far things are better. \u00a0But of course when I ask Blue, \"How was your day at school?\" He says,\u00a0\"Well...it was o.kay.\" \n\"Just o.k.?\" I ask. \n\"Yeah...things are better with the kid, but my Math teacher yelled at me.\" \n \nYou can't please all of the people all of the time...but you can not please the people in my house hardly ever. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iljyZXOedas/TqBMBl2xVAI/AAAAAAAAAXk/0aI_gnxlo_8/s1600/images-19.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/10/licking-shoes.html", "title": "\nLicking Shoes\n"},

What kind of behaviors are you seeing when he comes home from school? Etc.\" Huh??? What??? This is completely foreign to me. \u00a0I haven't received this kind of call since elementary school. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nBasically, I tell her things have been going relatively well on my end. \u00a0He has come home complaining a few days about \"people being rude\" and not making friends fast enough, \u00a0but he has also acknowledged the role that he plays, his lack of social skills, and the inability to not dominate conversations, which is huge for him. \u00a0At the same time, he has been on time everyday for the entire 3 weeks. \u00a0He takes his showers most every night. He actually seems a little, dare I say, motivated to get there everyday. \u00a0So I'm thinking for the most part, he is happy with where he is. \u00a0Although that is difficult to come out and just say...especially to me. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nShe tells me about their observations of him over the past 3 weeks. \u00a0She also sees that motivation and eagerness to learn. \u00a0For the first 2 weeks he was pretty close to perfect, trying so hard to show everyone the best side of himself. \u00a0He is very compliant and working diligently. \u00a0In the past week or so, he has let his hair down so to speak, allowing them to see that he indeed, is not perfect. \u00a0He has shown some frustrations...finally letting them see the real deal. \u00a0Well actually, this is a much milder version of the real deal. \u00a0At his worst, the real deal could be cursing teachers out, yelling at peers, and slamming fists on desks defiantly. \u00a0He is a living angel right now in comparison. \n \nHis work productivity is still excruciatingly slow, especially when it comes to writing. \u00a0His handwriting is so perfect, it's like a font. \u00a0The perfection on top of his processing speed has him moving like a snail. \u00a0He is learning and being productive in all environments with the exception of the regular ed IPC (a science class something to do with Physics and Chemistry). \u00a0Even I would be confused in this class! \u00a0He did however, advocate for himself letting them know that he really isn't \"getting it\" and needs some additional supports (HUGE)! \u00a0He has also advocated for himself with the Social Skills teacher, asking to speak with him directly about areas of concern and weakness that he would like to address during Social Skills class.  \n \nThe team has been brainstorming ideas to give him additional supports. \u00a0One of them being giving him a word processor to complete all writing assignments. \u00a0YAY! \u00a0There will also be some schedule tweaks and changes. \u00a0We will review all of the purposed changes in a miniature planning meeting next week.  \n \nWow! I am impressed all the way around! \u00a0The old school's policy was,  \"Don't call us...we will call you when there is a problem.\"  \u00a0This new school's policy seems to be,  \"You don't have to call us. \u00a0We will call you before a real problem develops.\"\u00a0 \n \n I think I'm in  love.... \n \n \n \n \n \nIt's the weekend so vote already! You've got time!

{"date": "Wednesday, October 19, 2011", "body": "\n \nNothing is smooth sailing when it comes to an Aspergers teen. \u00a0We had about a weeks worth of honeymoon period with Red and his new school situation. \u00a0He still likes it...but for some reason he is surprised that he still has a lot of work to do, both socially and academically. \u00a0So the past couple of days, he comes through the door with a look of fatigue and unhappiness on his face.  \n \n\"People are being rude to me! \u00a0I have the same problems everywhere! \u00a0People don't want to talk to me.\"  \n \n \n \nUnfortunately, with all of the medication changes, he isn't taking anything for focus right now. \u00a0Well, actually, he's taking Intuniv, a non-stimulant, but I really don't see how it is helping him. \u00a0The issue is he has a tendency to talk...non-stop, dominating the conversation. \u00a0Once he gets on a roll, he hardly takes a break for a deep breath, much less stopping long enough for others to actively participate in the conversation. \u00a0One of his teachers tells me, that one day he was so busy talking, he didn't even notice that people had actually walked away. \u00a0Of course, there is not a lot of eye-contact during his conversations. \u00a0Hence, the intense need for social skills training which, is not an overnight process. \n \nThen he drops this bit of wisdom down on me: \n\"I can't help that I talk so much. \u00a0It's a part of my Aspergers. \u00a0I can't help it. \u00a0If I could help it...I would stop doing it. People need to understand that it's a part of who I am. \u00a0They need to have patience. All I want is to have some friends who accept me for who I am. \u00a0I just want to be happy!\" \n \n\"You're right mom, \u00a0the reason I like to buy things all the time is because I'm just looking for a little bit of happiness, even though I know, things can't make you happy.\" \n \n\"Are you sure Dr. A knows what she's doing? \u00a0We've been trying all these different medicines and I still talk so much. \u00a0Maybe we need to change millograms or something. \u00a0I need some help with this so that people will like me.\" \n \nWow! \u00a0I tell him how proud I am that he can express these feelings to me so clearly.  \n\"This shows me that you are doing better. \u00a0Before, you were not able to express all of \u00a0that to me...so you are doing better. \u00a0And I'm proud of you. \u00a0You may not be where you want to me, but you are slowly making progress. \u00a0You are getting up in the mornings, getting ready on time. \u00a0You are taking your showers every night. \u00a0All of these things are progress.\" \n \nI am so impressed by his insightfulness. \u00a0He really does get it! \u00a0He does see himself and what he is doing, but he just can't resist some of the impulses.  \n \nI have been putting off going back to a low dosage of Focalin with him, afraid of what the side effects may be. \u00a0The doctor believes that with the other meds he has on board, and the lower dosage, he won't have these mad crashes in the afternoon. \u00a0He is so desperate to control the over-talking, \u00a0and lack of focus, that I am willing to go ahead and fill the prescription in hopes that it will help.  \n \nI am definitely fatigued by the incessant talking and I have a LOT OF PATIENCE. \u00a0 There have been times where I've had to tell him, \u00a0\"You've said that ninety-million times already! \u00a0I got it!\"  \n\"I didn't say it 90 million times. \u00a0That would take all day.\" \n\"Well, it feels like 90 million times!\" \nImagine how it feels for those people who don't love him as much as I do, nor do they have the social skills or patience to put up with it.  \n \nI'm really happy about what he said about \"buying things to find happiness.\" \u00a0That is until the end of our conversation when he says, \"So can I go to Walgreens now to buy those Amazon gift cards so I can order the Yoke for my Flight Simulator game?\" \n\"I thought we just agreed that buying things won't make you happy?\" \n\"I know that...but at least it will give me something to do.\" \n \nGuess I can't expect everything to happen overnight... \n \nDid you like this post?

He so reserved! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe funny thing is...or maybe it's not so funny. \u00a0He came straight home and told me, \"I cursed Mr. A. out today.\" Very matter-of-fact...not sounding upset or ashamed in anyway. \u00a0Back in the day, my parents would have had to find that one out on their own! \u00a0(Not that I would EVER curse a teacher out...but if I did anything close to that, they would have to get a phone call from the school before they would here about it from me!) \n \n \n \nI can only imagine that the guy is trying to keep him on task, just like I do in the mornings when he's spacing...time is elapsing and he doesn't realize it. \u00a0When I ever-so-gently remind him... he snaps! \"WHAT! I'm coming mom! \u00a0You don't have to keep reminding me! \u00a0I'm not going to be late!\" \u00a0Should I give him credit for not cursing at me? .... Nah!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nUnfortunately, he has a history with this Aid. \u00a0Back in 8th grade, he worked with him and found himself in a situation where he was physically restrained. \u00a0Again...I wasn't there, and can not say for sure exactly what happened. \u00a0But it was a traumatic event for Red. \u00a0In his mind...it was completely uncalled for. \u00a0 The story I got was that he was trying to leave the room in an attempt to confront another student. \u00a0Red does not remember it that way. \u00a0It's difficult to say what the truth is. The school could be covering their asses with their version of events. \u00a0Whatever the case may be, Red has never been violent and did not feel the restraint was called for. \u00a0Residual anger still lingers deep within him towards this Aid. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe two of them take their argument down to Red's tracking teacher, lets call him Mr. C., a very calm soft-spoken, \u00a0older gentleman. \u00a0He has years of experience working with kids like Red in different settings. \u00a0They talk it out and come to a resolution, which Red seems pleased with by the time he gets home in the afternoon. \u00a0Later in the evening...he goes back to being angry again. \u00a0He really does not want to have to work with this man..at all! \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI can't always fix things for him. \u00a0There are going to be authority figures in his life that he does not like. \u00a0There are going to be bosses and other employees who will be complete assholes or rub him the wrong way. \u00a0\"That doesn't mean you can blow up and curse them out. \u00a0\"You will be F-I-R-E-D!\" \u00a0I tell him. \u00a0You have to think about the long term goal. \u00a0In school, it is...\"I need to get my education and this guy is helping me, even though I don't like him.\" \u00a0At work it will be, \"I need my paycheck even though my boss is an ass.\" \u00a0You can't just bail or explode. \u00a0 \n \n\"How am I supposed to remember that?\" he asks me. I wish I had an answer. \u00a0I know this is so much easier said than done. \u00a0I have remember that a lot of these common sense theories are completely foreign to him. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nOf course, I worry that he will never get this. \u00a0I worry that he will never get beyond the anger and explosiveness. \u00a0Will it get better with time and maturity? \u00a0Whenever things get difficult...will he resort back to it? \u00a0How will he ever survive in this world that does not cater, crack and make exceptions for his disability. \u00a0There are no loving mother's arms to fall into...to come in and advocate for you out there in the cold, hard world that he will be entering into sometime in the not-so-distant-future. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nHow is he going to make it?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8JzZBPQlsm0/TqxMzauwwOI/AAAAAAAAAZI/tXpcOysaIxo/s1600/Unknown-2.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/10/hiccup.html", "title": "\nHiccup\n"},

I have just become a spoiled adult. \u00a0I am perfectly willing to stay with relatives and sleep where ever they can house me. \u00a0I may need a sleeping pill...but I can do it. \u00a0The other major difference between me and my children is...I do not have over the top anxiety and autism.  \n \nBlue likes to sleep alone in a very quiet, controlled environment. \u00a0He listens to soft music while he is sleeping, but he absolutely can not stand listening to someone snoring, or even breathing too heavy. \u00a0Forget about there being a chance of thunderstorms that could wake him up suddenly.  \n \nOnce we traveled to his grandparents home in Georgia for Christmas. \u00a0His anxiety wasn't as high then as it is now. \u00a0But, he still wanted to sleep by himself if at all possible. \u00a0We had three families in a small 3 bedroom house mind you. \u00a0He ended up sleeping on the floor in the office/laundry room. \u00a0He was perfectly content.  \n \nWhen he travels with us...we have to get a suite or 2 rooms. \u00a0There must be a door that he can close to block out the sound of his father snoring. \u00a0If he is going to have to sleep in a room WITH someone, he must be well prepared ahead of time and then decide weather or not he actually wants to take the trip. \u00a0Two years ago we went to Florida where we rented a townhouse with 3 levels that we shared with his grandparents. \u00a0He and his brother would have their own room directly across from the bedroom his dad and I shared. \u00a0Blue chose to sleep alone on the couch on the middle level, rather than sleep in a full-size bed next to his brother. \n \nOn our most recent trip, he starts off unhappy because we are leaving in the evening instead of the morning. \u00a0\"Why are we leaving so late? \u00a0This doesn't make any sense!\" \n\u00a0We were not scheduled to arrive at our final destination until 1 a.m. \u00a0Of course, the airline holds us hostage on the runway for awhile and then returns to the gate for mechanical issues, which delays us even further. \u00a0 There is fighting from across the isles because his brother is biting his nails. \u00a0Wouldn't it be easy to simply turn your head and not look at him? \u00a0No. \u00a0We need to control him. \u00a0We need to give him nasty glances and stares. \u00a0And he must return the favor by biting his nails even more and looking at his brother while doing so. \n \nBlue's anxiety is palpable. \u00a0It takes him a couple of days to get his bearings in our new location. \u00a0He gets angry with me for the smallest infraction  (and by infraction I mean everything that isn't perfect is my fault ). \u00a0 He wants to unpack and set up his space as soon as possible. \u00a0He is angry that there is no fan in the bathroom. This means there is no aeration in-between visitors who use it. \u00a0He must be well rested. \u00a0Changes in schedule, staying out and up late make him terribly cranky and on edge. \n \nWe venture to Washington D.C. \u00a0to visit a couple of the Smithsonian Museums. \u00a0We drive into Carollton, Maryland where we catch a train into D.C. just for the experience of riding a subway train. \u00a0When we arrive on the Smithsonian grounds, we are given a map of all of the sights that you can visit. \u00a0All along my intention is to first go to the museum of Natural History. \u00a0Of course, there is much discussion about why we should go there first.  \n \nWe go through the museum and see the amazing dinosaurs and such. \u00a0Feet are tired, thirst is never quite quenched the entire time we are in the humidity. \u00a0As we are winding down from our first museum, Blue becomes extremely frustrated with the map. \u00a0\"There is no list! \u00a0I just want a simple list that tells you about each museum!\"  Well I'm so sorry that I can not completely redesign the way they made this map. \u00a0 Frustration sets in. \u00a0He attempts to storm off into the crowd. \u00a0I stop him. \u00a0 Sorry dude...I can't allow you to get lost or stolen. \u00a0I am sorry you're so frustrated.   \n \nI ask Dad to take him away from the crowd where he can cool down. \u00a0I can't do it. \u00a0Nothing I say is right, it just makes him more angry. \u00a0Dad takes him out into the entry way, where they find a proper book that describes each of the museums. \u00a0Mind you -this changes nothing. \u00a0The plan all along is that we will move on to the Air and Space museum, because Red has a fixation on airplanes, flight and aviation right now. \u00a0This is exactly what we do once Blue gets his head together and calms down. \u00a0In his mind...the fact that he now has a proper list, changes everything. \u00a0He can now move on. \n \n This is an extremely long day of walking. \u00a0The most treacherous part is walking from one museum to the next in the heat and humidity. \u00a0We enjoy the air conditioned museums and the displays of our country's history, but it's exhausting. \u00a0I find myself constantly sneaking away, finding a seat, pulling out my phone to read Twitter updates  (pathetic...I know. \u00a0My name is Karen and I am a social network addict) . \u00a0I couldn't help but think, I'd rather be looking at art than airplanes, but that's a sacrifice you make for your male children who love technology and machinery. \u00a0If I want to do the art museums, I will have to go back another time either alone or with a more flexible entourage. \n \n After the last museum closes at 7:30 p.m., we venture out to find something to eat. \u00a0We take an open air pedi-taxi over to 7th Avenue where there are a number of eateries. \u00a0The pedi-taxi takes us right past the capital building, \u00a0down Pennsylvania Avenue...the same route I recognize from President Obama's Inauguration Day. \u00a0I remember he and Michelle getting out and walking and me thinking,  \"Are you kidding me? \u00a0Get your butts back in that car before someone shoots you!\"  \u00a0Of course, the Secret Service was way ahead of me.  \n \nWe exit the open air taxi's.\u00a0Where are we going to eat? Both boys, \u00a0though they are not paying, want to choose. \u00a0Their grandmother is with us on this journey. \u00a0She is the senior member of the family. \u00a0It will be her choice. \u00a0 When you are with a group, sometimes you have to go where the majority wants to go (or where your grandmother wants to go). \u00a0You have to be a little flexible.  Well...what's that to a kid with Aspergers and anxiety?  \u00a0Add together being, tired + hungry + off schedule...then throw in the variable of your mother saying, \"Neither of you is choosing the restaurant.\" \u00a0The sum? \u00a0I am met with growls, grunts and storming off into a sea of people on a busy street. \u00a0When I catch up with Blue he says, \"I am getting so tired of you!\" \u00a0Wow! \u00a0I guess he told me. \n \nWe get into the restaurant, he pouts and isn't willing to look at the menu. \u00a0He says, \"I need some time to be alone.\" \u00a0I gladly let him have it. \u00a0He returns, and orders a delectable meal that he fully enjoys, which includes a Cesar salad. \u00a0I am so excited that he now likes salad! \n \nOn our way back to the hotel that night, Blue mentions our friends who took the cross country trip on the train. \u00a0\"They are so lucky,\" he says.  \n\"Yes they are lucky and flexible. \u00a0It takes a lot of flexibility to sleep in various places, sit on a train for hours, and not always be on an exact schedule,\" I retort. \n \nI am hopeful that with time and maturity, we will get there. \u00a0Meanwhile, the next trip I take will be by myself! \u00a0I feel the need for a spiritual journey to recuperate from our family vacation. \n \n Please click below before you go!

This all sounds so relaxing to the naked ear, but not to the child with autism who actually thrives on a schedule of events. \u00a0All of this freedom gives him more time to worry about everything.  \n \nThere is a drought here in Texas. \"Next we will have a famine. \u00a0Is it my fault that it's not raining? \u00a0Is it because I'm scared of thunderstorms? \u00a0Why is God letting this happen? \u00a0Is he mad at us?\" \n \nFor two lovely weeks, there is no sibling to be annoyed by or to argue with. \u00a0Where will we put that negative energy? \u00a0It has to go somewhere. \u00a0The perfect solution? \u00a0I've got it. \u00a0I will argue and be angry with Mom. \u00a0She can be pretty annoying too. \u00a0She's always making these dumb jokes that SHE thinks are so funny. \u00a0She's always wants to hug and kiss me. \u00a0That is so embarrassing. \u00a0No -she doesn't do it in front of people, but it's still embarrassing! \u00a0She can't answer all of my questions. \u00a0Well...she can answer, but I don't LIKE any of her answers. \u00a0 She's nothing like dad. \u00a0See Dad and I -we're so much alike. \u00a0We \u00a0understand each other better. \u00a0We like the same things. \u00a0We can talk about anything. \u00a0Thank God I have him to talk to. \n \nMom? \u00a0I need her too. \u00a0She sure can cook. \u00a0When I'm hungry...she's my girl! \u00a0She should just wear a sign on her forehead that says, \"I am the food lady.\"  \n \nSchool will be starting in a few weeks. \u00a0Although I'm dying for school to start because I love the schedule. \u00a0I love being away from home for 8 hours a day. \u00a0I love the distance it gives me from my brother. \u00a0I love stimulating my mind and challenging teachers. \u00a0But I am really worried about having to take 7th grade science. \u00a0I have to study about the human body. \u00a0The human body absolutely freaks me out. \u00a0I don't want to learn about cells and what goes on inside my body. \u00a0It just really grosses me out. \u00a0\"What am I going to do? \u00a0I can't get out of it?\" \n \nWhat? \u00a0You want me to take advanced math? \u00a0I mean I know I did great on my state testing last year. \u00a0I know that my teachers recommended me for this class. \u00a0Yes -I passed the assessment exam, which determines that I have the skills necessary to take this class, but what if I don't know everything I need to know. \u00a0What if \u00a0I can't work fast enough? \u00a0I have accommodations? \u00a0Yeah right? \u00a0What does that really mean? \u00a0I bet they won't really give them to me. \n \nYes...I have friends that live nearby. \u00a0I usually get to hang out with them a few times a week. \u00a0But today, I called so and so and he didn't answer. \u00a0He didn't text me back. \u00a0\"Is he mad at me?\" \u00a0No -I didn't do anything to make him mad ...but he could still be mad at me. \u00a0Why is everyone mad at me? \n \nIs President Obama doing a good job? \u00a0Why is everyone so mad at him? \n \nWhy do I have to have autism? \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TLbnTAnBkYc/TkFW_sGftJI/AAAAAAAAASk/ClqfwkNbKSY/s1600/images-1.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/08/looking-for-target.html", "title": "\nLooking for a Target\n"},

I don't know what's happened to your manners? \u00a0You used to be so polite.\"\u00a0 \n \nHe says very matter-of-factly, \"Life has changed me...that's what happened.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOf course, Elena doesn't think this is very funny. \u00a0If they only knew how much life  will really  change them. \u00a0I believe G3 is pretty insightful...he is a deep thinker, like my son Blue. \u00a0He is also very funny!\u00a0 \n \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \n \nI take Blue and his friends to the YMCA this week so that they can swim and I can work out. \u00a0The boys (who also have autism) insist with their mother that they can not change at home. \u00a0They tell her, \"You're not allowed to walk through the Y with your swimming trunks on. \u00a0You have to change there,\" and they are quite adamant about it. \u00a0I don't know where they got this idea, but whatever...no big deal. \u00a0Blue has his trunks on. \u00a0Twin number 1 has his stuff in his back pack. \u00a0Twin number 2, is carrying his few garments in his hands. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThey change...I walk them over to the pool area and make sure they understand the pool rules at this particular Y. \u00a0They go off to swim. \u00a0I go off to run with the Black Eyed Peas. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAfter I catch my breath, I decide to go look for them. They are coming down the hallway also looking for me. \u00a0Twin 2 says, \"I can't find my underwear! \u00a0I can't find my underwear! Please help me find my underwear!\" \u00a0He is very loud. \u00a0Parents are sitting there watching their kids in gymnastics classes. \u00a0The other two boys, try to shush him. \u00a0They are mortified and snickering at\u00a0the same time. \u00a0The parents are all looking at me like WTH? \u00a0I could care less. \u00a0I don't even bother to explain. \u00a0The truth is...I can't stop laughing...very quietly laughing.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI encourage the boys to trace their steps. \u00a0They go back to the pool deck, where the underwear are laying on the ground. \u00a0\"Here they are! Here's my underwear!\" \u00a0He picks them up and twirls them around for all of the world to see. \u00a0Discretion? What's that?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI send them packing to the mens changing room so that he can change out of his wet swimming trunks into his dry underwear. \u00a0I tell the other boys to stay with him to make sure he doesn't loose anything else.\u00a0 \n \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \n \n \n \nMy friend Sharon from  Mama'sTurnNow \u00a0sent me this one: \n \n \n \nHer son Jay comes to her room and starts dancing. \u00a0\"What are you doing Jay?\" she asks. \u00a0\"Flash Mob,\" he says. \u00a0And then runs out. \u00a0(get it...he dances quickly and is gone in a flash). \u00a0Later she tells him. \u00a0\"A flash mob is a group of people dancing.\" \u00a0 Later he comes back, with his stuff animals. \u00a0Guess he found himself a group.\u00a0 \n \n \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \n \n \nHere's another one from Elena:\u00a0 \n \nG3 always refers to t.v. showtimes by saying 8...7 central. \u00a0He asks his mom to set the alarm for 8...7 central. \u00a0She says to him, \"G3, we live in eastern time. \u00a0You don't have to say 8...7 central. \u00a0It's just 8.\" \u00a0He just looks at her and says, \"O.K. mama...so did you set the alarm for 8...7 central?\" Mama says...(Sometimes he is so brilliant...other times, well...).\u00a0 \n \n \n \nBy the way....here in Texas (which is central time) they still refer to shows as 8...7 central. \u00a0Hopefully, you can figure out where you are so that you don't miss your show. \n \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \n\u00a0 \n \nBack to my boys. \u00a0I give Blue a few dollars at the pool to buy himself and the boys a snack. \u00a0He buys himself a hot dog and a power drink and Skittles. \u00a0He buys Twin 1  two  hotdogs and a  chocolate bar . \u00a0Twin two gets popcorn and a drink. \u00a0They have just finished their snacks. \u00a0I am rushing them home so that they can have dinner before their dad takes them to a baseball game. \u00a0Twin 1 turns to me and says, \"So...how about dessert?\" \u00a0 \n \n\"Dessert? \u00a0Didn't you just have a chocolate bar?\"\u00a0 \n \n\"Oh...yeah.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI love these boys. \u00a0We are so blessed by their presence in Blue's life and for the laughter that their pure honesty brings.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vLWD41146Rw/TkVWyB00WaI/AAAAAAAAASs/WQuXFLlRTH4/s1600/thepoolboys.jpg", "http://www.blog.mamasturnnow.com/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/08/funny-friday.html", "title": "\nFunny Friday\n"},

Our plates are covered with napkins to keep the flies away in-between bites. \u00a0This is not a 'happy meal'. \n \nAs we walk away, with sadness in his eyes Blue says, \"I thought this day was going to be perfect. \u00a0like it looked on the web site advertisements.)

It's not crazy expensive, but it's not something that's in our budget either. \u00a0With the economy sucking eggs and all...things have been kind of tight around here. \u00a0Feel free to send me a donation. \u00a0Make all checks payable to the, \"Keep Karen Sane Fund.\" \n \nI am excited at just the shear possibility of having him in an environment where they \"get him\" and he can work to his potential and at his own pace...which would be the pace of an elderly tortoise. \u00a0The curriculum is web based, and he can move things around however he needs to. \u00a0In public school, \u00a0he uses up so much of his energy on the social components, stress and anxiety. \u00a0How can he possibly focus on learning?\u00a0He was thoroughly fried by the end of school last year, hence the hospitalization.  \n \n \nHe has done so much better over the summer as far as real-deal ugly meltdowns are concerned. \u00a0Of course, his stress level has been very low. \u00a0He hasn't had those huge social issues to worry about. \u00a0In fact, he has made a new friend that he connects very well with and he has made some other connections through our Aspergers Meetup Group. \u00a0He hasn't felt that total isolation that he felt most of the school year. \u00a0This is a prayer answered. \n \nThis private school would work with him on life skills and becoming independent. \u00a0It may just very well be worth the investment if we can move towards getting him out of our house eventually. \u00a0I want my freedom back! I may never get it completely, but I want him to be an independent young man, living at his maximum potential.  \n \nI hope we can figure out a way to pay for it. \u00a0Maybe I can see if they will do a two for one. \u00a0I could work there to get him a tuition discount! \u00a0You never know... \n \nI've talked to Red on the phone the last two days. \u00a0He sounds so calm. \u00a0It's great to hear. \u00a0I pray that he comes home with that same degree of calmness. \u00a0Wouldn't that be great? \u00a0It will be a whirlwind of changing time zones and getting him reacclimated to going to bed and getting up early for school. \u00a0That should be fun. \n \nAnyway...a zillion thoughts and things to do. \u00a0None of them add up to writing a blog post that has much rhyme or reason. \u00a0Instead, you get to see the discombobulated thoughts that are rambling through the mind of a neurotic mom. \n \n Do you like me?

Once they were back in Maryland, she indulged him with multiple trips to the airport so that he could spot planes. On his last day, he got lucky, the rain stopped and grandma took a day off from work to take him to Six Flags, Great America! \u00a0He is a roller coaster enthusiast and was able to ride all of the coasters multiple times. \u00a0 \n \n \nHe spent time hanging out with his cousin. \u00a0They went to the beach together. \u00a0They stayed up late talking and playing games. \u00a0It can't get any better than that!\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0 \n \nThe only negative on this trip was his relationship with his grandpa. \u00a0Grandma's husband is 81 years old and totally old-school. \u00a0There were no special needs concessions from him. \u00a0He talked to Red just like he talks to all of the grandkids. \u00a0\"Boy...get over there and sit down! \u00a0Don't look at me like that! You better eat that food!\" \u00a0He doesn't mean any harm...that's just the way he is and at his age, he is not going to change. \u00a0He didn't talk to Red any differently than he does to his cousin who just about lives there. \u00a0That was hard for Red to take. \u00a0\"Why is grandpa so mean!?\" \u00a0He wants everyone to be all warm and fuzzy --to repeat themselves 39 times without loosing any patience. \u00a0 \n \n \nGrandma is the soft touch...the mediator between them --that is when she wasn't working. \u00a0Grandma is a petite woman like me standing about 5 ft. tall. \u00a0She too is no nonsense, but she can make her point without raising her voice. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nMissing his flight in Chicago turned out to be a blessing in disguise for him. \u00a0It's one of the busiest airports in the country...a great place for plane spotting. \u00a0In the unaccompanied minor lounge, there were windows so that he could watch airplanes, up close and personal. \u00a0They also gave him a voucher so that he could buy a meal at Mc Donald's. \u00a0Poor dude! \u00a0Mommy's all worried and he is living it up!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe is full of smiles and conversation once we get home until it gets late and he brings up the subject of school. \u00a0 \n \n\"I really don't want to go back to that school. \u00a0People make fun of me. \u00a0I have too many enemies. \u00a0I don't know how to do the work. \u00a0It's too hard. \u00a0 Those people don't understand me.

Can I have my computer back? Can I have my computer back? \" \u00a0I guess he thinks if he keeps asking the answer will suddenly change?! \n \n\"You get up and get out on time...so that the bus is not waiting for you, you get your computer back tomorrow. \u00a0You want to move your turn off time back to 9 o'clock, do it for 5 days in a row. \u00a0You want your new cellphone do it for 5 more days.\" \u00a0Sound fair??? \u00a0This is outrageous as far as he is concerned. \n \nSo here is the reality scene this morning: \n \nRed wakes up with his alarm clock...lays there for a few minutes. \u00a0I enter and tell him to get in the shower. \u00a0He lolly-gags a bit. \u00a0Finally gets in oh say...15 minutes later. \u00a0He starts singing at first, then moves on to repeating the dialog from a movie or t.v. show...LOUDLY! \nBlue burst through the door out of his room...\"He's singing!\"  \n\"Go back to your room. \u00a0Close your door...turn up your music and get dressed. \u00a0You won't here him.\" Blue looks at mom like she has a third eye. \nRed gets louder...not singing but talking...dialog. \nBlue busts out of his door and into the bathroom door! Screaming back and forth ensues. \u00a0I hate you's are tossed around like a frisbee. \u00a0Mom gets physically in-between them...sends them back into their corners. \u00a0(Referee).  \nDad hears screaming. \u00a0He gets up out of bed groggily and goes into Blues room to help calm him (Therapist). \u00a0Mom pushes Red along to put clothes on. \u00a0He's still naked with a towel rapped around him. \nMom moves downstairs to start coffee and breakfast (Cook). \u00a0Dad sends down Blue. \u00a0Mom sends Dad into Red's room to prompt him to keep it moving and stop staring into space. \u00a0A few minutes pass...no Red. \nMom yells upstairs, \"I really want you to get your computer back today. \u00a0Are you moving?\" \n\"I'm coming mom!\" \nMom gets Blue moving so that he can get up from the table before Red comes to the table. \u00a0She is trying to prevent The Color Purple (Blue + Red =Purple). \u00a0Red arrives...Mom sends Blue around the opposite way through Nana's room to head upstairs and finish getting ready.  \nRed eats breakfast...cereal, eggs, and toast. \u00a0Error...mom only makes one piece a toast. \n\"Are you kidding me?! \u00a0One piece???\"  \n\"Um...lets rephrase that son.\" \n\"Can you please make me another piece?\" \n\"Sure.\" \nMom gives meds with water (Nurse). \n\"Can I have Silk milk?\" says Red. \nAre you freaking kidding me??? Just take the meds already! Thinks Mom, but she does not say.  \nRed finally takes meds after asking over and over again about Silk milk. \"Why can't I take my meds with silk milk?\" \u00a0X's five. \u00a0He asks this question 5 times over and over again in a row. \u00a0The answer does not change. \nHe is finally putting on shoes...bus shows up 7 minutes EARLY! \nMom reassures, \"You're fine...just get your other shoe on.\" \nHe leaves!!!

Breathing? \u00a0Really? \u00a0Now you want to control how he breathes? \u00a0That's rich!\u00a0 \n Mama decides...that's enough with the game for today. \u00a0Luckily, he has an art lesson scheduled. \u00a0That should be soothing. \u00a0I ask him to take a nice, hot shower and get ready for his lesson...no more game! \u00a0While he's at art, I text the twin's mom. \"Can Blue come over to hang out with the boys?\"\u00a0 \"Sure...they're just here watching Star Wars,\" she replies. \u00a0Great! \u00a0 \n When Blue gets into the car I say, \"The boys want you to come hang out and watch Star Wars? \u00a0Is that cool?\" \u00a0He agrees, but says he is a little tired. \u00a0Mama knows once he sees his friends, he will be energized. \u00a0 When we arrive at the boy's house, Twin 1 comes to the door. \u00a0\"What are you guys doing here?\" I quickly gloss over the question with something silly. \n Sometimes...Mama has to pull a fast one. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gk8a2WEFXKE/ThSLgBImxOI/AAAAAAAAAQw/7itehegIoHg/s1600/friends4life.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/07/pulled-fast-one.html", "title": "\nPulled a Fast One\n"},

You will fall in love with both blogs, as I have. \u00a0I've told Tanya, \"I want to be just like you when I grow up.\" \u00a0The love of her children shines through in her writing, even when they are exasperating. Those of you who follow my writing probably thing I want to hang my children in a closet and leave them there. Please go visit both of her sights. Here you go: \n You\u2019ve already braced yourself. You know there\u2019s no way this will be easy. But what comes next? As your son or daughter on the autism spectrum enters his or her teen years, what should you expect? What should you be aware of? All of these things ran through my mind as my son, who is going to start his junior year of high school soon, entered teenhood almost four years ago. And although I was right about it not being easy, we\u2019re getting through it, learning as we go. Actually, several things have come up over the years that I hadn\u2019t thought of on my way in (including some positive points)! These, in addition to some things I had already considered (as you, no doubt, have as well), make up my list: \n 10 Things for Parents of ASD Kids to Keep in Mind about the Teen Years \n 1) Sensory issues (such as sound sensitivity) continue to abate, and it gets easier to stay longer in restaurants and stores and other public places that were previously disastrous. Can I get a Halleluiah? \n 2) Dealing with the hormones of puberty is  really hard  for ASD kids who had more severe sensory issues when they were younger. As they got older, they learned to filter the sounds, etc. that previously bombarded their bodies. Now, hormones are bombarding their bodies, and, as with past sensory issues, it will take several years for them to learn to \u201cfilter\u201d the hormones. (I also have a teenage son who does  not  have ASD, and puberty has been infinitely easier with that one.) \n 3) In addition to difficulty dealing with hormones, our ASD kids are still susceptible to other changes affecting their moods: time changes, seasonal changes, and schedule changes (especially when school is out), anxiety, behavioral issues, and OCD symptoms. A low dosage of medication can help immensely, and you can have them on it just for a limited time until they learn to self-regulate better. \n 4) As if they didn\u2019t already have enough affecting their moods, the possibility of developing seizure activity is also something that can affect mood and behavior. The unfortunate fact is that 25% of people with autism will develop epilepsy, compared to less than 1% of the general population! Also, most sleep-deprived EEGs are only half an hour long and not always reliable. A 24-hour ambulatory EEG (ambulatory means you can be at home with a small piece of equipment) produces much more data to evaluate, so you get a more accurate picture of what\u2019s going on.\u00a0 \n 5) Good news \u2013 language and social skills can and do improve, especially if your child continues to receive therapy. And don\u2019t give up, because even if you\u2019ve reminded your child to say \u201cthank you\u201d a bajillion times, their first unprompted thank you might come at the age of 15, as my son\u2019s did. \n 6) This next one\u2019s a big deal for some of us, and I didn\u2019t even know the terminology until two and a half years ago \u2013 executive function deficits. My son has severe problems with executive function \u2013 the ability to plan and organize school projects, work independently, etc. Not every ASD kid has this problem, but many do. If yours does, check this out: I\u2019m giving away a copy of  Late, Lost, and Unprepared: A Parents\u2019 Guide to Helping Children with Executive Functioning . Simply come over to my current blog,  www.tanyasavko.com , and leave a comment that you are interested in the book. On July 15 I\u2019ll draw a name and email the winner for their address. It\u2019s never too early to start helping kids with executive function issues, and I wish I had started sooner! \n 7) Along with executive function problems and emotional delay comes the possibility that your child might need a modified diploma. Remind yourself that this is not a reflection of your child\u2019s level of intelligence or ability to comprehend what is being taught, nor is it an indication of laziness (as perceived by some). It may just be too overwhelming for your child to handle the workload of a high school student if he or she is  emotionally  ten or eleven years old. \n 8) Despite emotional delays and possible problems handling the school workload, your child\u2019s need to assert some independence will increase. This is good news! It doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ll be able to drive any time soon (although some ASD teens do), but they might be ready to ride their bikes unaccompanied, and this, while scary, is still wonderful and amazing.\u00a0 \n 9)No matter what, even if your child develops epilepsy in his or her teens (as mine did), even if you come to decide, despite Herculean efforts, that he or she will need a modified diploma (as mine does),  things will get better . Ten \u2013 or even just five \u2013 years from now, your child will not be the same. In a good way. Read  \"If I Blogged 10 Years Ago\" \u00a0to see what I mean. \n 10) Remember that everyone is different. \u201cIf you\u2019ve met one person with autism, you\u2019ve met one person with autism.\u201d My son\u2019s experiences in the teen years will not necessarily be your child\u2019s. His challenges may not be yours, nor his abilities. But the topics listed here are the main things that, as a parent, I wish I had known about going in. And I hope that knowing about them is helpful to you.\u00a0 \n I wish you all the best on your journey. \n Tanya \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://teenautism.com/", "http://tanyasavko.com/", "http://www.tanyasavko.com/", "http://teenautism.com/2009/02/20/if-i-blogged-10-years-ago/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/07/10-things-by-tanya-savko.html", "title": "\n10 Things  -By Tanya Savko\n"},

Yes. \u00a0Of course, we don't have the stress of school do deal with yet. \u00a0We still get the annoying others, the occasional screaming because we don't get what we want, and of course the non-stop talking and asking obvious, obscure, crazy questions.  \n \nSo what are we doing about the weight gain? \u00a0Trying to change the diet of a 15 year-old Aspie is next to impossible. \u00a0Does that stop me from trying? NO. \u00a0I fight the battle everyday of making him add the protein foods that he likes into his diet, instead of allowing him to go the easy route i.e. pouring a bowl of cereal, or popping 4 Eggos into the toaster. \u00a0He now has to make a couple of eggs and take away some of the waffles or the cereal. \u00a0I am now buying high protein \"Mootopia\" and higher protein, \u00a0low fat vanilla soymilk. \u00a0He tried this at my brother's house and liked it. \u00a0We added a mulit-vitamin so that his body isn't craving nutrients that he is not receiving. \u00a0He hasn't seen a fast-food burger in over a month. \u00a0If we stop on the go now -it's a turkey sandwich from Subway, no fries! \u00a0 \n \nWe also added in a large dose of exercise. \u00a0We've been going to the YMCA several times a week. \u00a0We start out on the treadmill, move on to the elliptical machine, the bike and then weights. \u00a0After that we may go for a swim. \u00a0Some days we just go straight for the swim. \u00a0He balks at first when it's time to go. \u00a0Sooner or later we make it there and he really seems to enjoy it once we get into the groove. \u00a0He's been kind of fixated on \"Karate Kid\" the movie. \u00a0I think he feels like Jaden Smith when he starts working out. \n \nI think it looks a little strange to have a teenage boy as big as my son, working out with his mother. \u00a0I can't help but long for his older brother to be the one who is doing this with him. \u00a0He played football all through high-school and his first year of college. \u00a0He's also been through basic training with the Army. \u00a0he would be the ideal work-out partner and mentor for his nearly 16-year old brother. \u00a0Unfortunately, right now, he is too self-absorbed in his own life to take any time for his family.  \n \nMy husband is working like crazy and doesn't take the time to work out himself, much less take the time to work out with Red, who can be a real pain in the arse! \u00a0I am contemplating signing him up for a few sessions with a trainer. \u00a0But for now, it's me taking the bull by the horns, doing everything within my power to help him look good and feel good. \u00a0With Red, nothing is simple and easy, but I think we're off to a good start. \n \n Don't forget to click one of the TOP Mommy Links before you go. \u00a0Just once Click per visit...thanks!\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uu4uTmidHdg/ThsLyRCWVXI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/zLarlhKBFpw/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/07/lifting-weight.html", "title": "\nLifting Weight\n"},

Now I'm feeling like crap...stressed, can't sleep, anxious, like my body is conspiring against me somehow.  \n \n I've been working out more in the past week which is good. \u00a0I feel really good afterwards -a high kind of euphoria. \u00a0I take Red with me to work out, because I'm so worried about his recent weight gain. \u00a0I'd do anything for that kid. \u00a0In fact, I do everything for that kid. \u00a0What does he do for me? \u00a0Drive me nuts. \u00a0Everything is a struggle with him. \u00a0At first he fought me on working out. \u00a0Once we get to the gym, he seems to actually be getting into it. \u00a0I believe he thinks he is Jaden Smith, from  The Karate Kid  or this other guy on  Extreme Makeover -Weight Edition . \u00a0So the first few times we go he is very cooperative and even says to me, \"Make sure I do this every day for the rest of the summer!\" I get all excited and so proud. \n \n Last night's workout does not go so well. \u00a0Even though he asked to go, as soon as we pull up, he says, \"I changed my mind. \u00a0I don't want to go in.\" \u00a0Of course, I don't take the bate. \u00a0We go in anyway. \u00a0We get on the treadmill and put on our Ipods. \u00a0I am soaring...in another world listening to the  Black Eyed Peas ,  I got a Feelin,  and  I'mma Be . \u00a0It feels great! \u00a0He isn't moving to fast...no surprise there. \u00a015 minutes in he says, \"I'm done. \u00a0I'm ready to go home.\" \u00a0I'm just getting into my groove, and have no intention of stopping. \u00a0He gets more and more agitated. \u00a0I tell him to go do something else, like work on the weights. \"I don't want to be here!\" he says. \u00a0I refuse to stop my work out. \u00a0I tell him he can go sit out in the lobby.\u00a0 \n \n While moseying around the gym, he runs into a couple of his old teachers, who happen to be friends of mine. \u00a0They encourage him to hang in there, \"Let Mom workout a little longer.\" He agrees. \u00a0He comes back in the gym and goes towards the weights. \u00a0He happens to run into a couple of boys from school who actually speak to him. \u00a0They start a conversation about working out, loosing weight, etc. \u00a0The boys are on the wrestling team. \u00a0They encourage him to join the team. \u00a0He certainly has the build for it. \u00a0Not only that, they offer to work out with him in the future. \u00a0He gives them his cell number, etc. \u00a0I actually go over and meet the boys. \u00a0They seem really nice...genuine. \u00a0I hope they will follow up with Red. \u00a0He certainly won't follow up with them. \u00a0 \n \n It would be so great if he actually does hook up with some neurotypical boys who go to his school. \u00a0This seems to me to be like another God-thing. \u00a0I tell him so when we get in the\u00a0 car. \n \"You know...meeting those boys was God working in your life. \u00a0I hope you can appreciate it and focus on all the positives. \u00a0You are blessed.\" \u00a0He acknowledges me with little enthusiasm. \u00a0I can only hope. \n \n Anyway...back to me. \u00a0 Isn't that ironic? \u00a0Back to me.  \u00a0I seldom get back to me. \u00a0 That's a big part of the reason I'm so tired. \u00a0I'm so busy being  back  to everybody else! \u00a0I go see my doctor today for my full physical, which is of course way overdue. \u00a0She tells me I should leave caffeine alone for a month and see if I can sleep better. \u00a0Really Doc? \u00a0Totally leave it alone...I don't think so. \u00a0Cut back to 1 cup of coffee in the morning and no cokes during the rest of the day...that I can do. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Oh and Diary...my mother is starting to get on my nerves. \u00a0How do I tell her nicely to butt out of every conversation I have with Red, especially after she's had a half a bottle of wine? \u00a0Her chiming in is irritating to me and overstimulating for him. \u00a0Not only that, the more of an audience he has, the more he performs. \u00a0I've already gently mentioned it a couple of times. \u00a0When the wine is on board...my gentle reminder seems to fly right out the window. \u00a0 \n \n That's all the me time for today...have to get back to everyone else now. \u00a0 \n \n And Diary --thanks for listening.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5j9TKbGOhCE/ThyvXUw1ZtI/AAAAAAAAARA/NIPjSWvEYog/s1600/Diary.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/07/dear-diary.html", "title": "\nDear Diary\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 13, 2011", "body": "\n The other night Red hooks up with a couple of boys from his school at the gym. \u00a0They have a conversation that lasts oh...about 30 minutes or so, ending with him giving them his cell number because he doesn't have his with him to take their numbers. \u00a0One of the boys is a senior who drives, the other a sophomore like Red. \u00a0Both young men appear to be exceptionally nice -as young people go these days.  \n \nI am so excited about this exchange and the possibility of him developing a relationship with two atypical peers at his school. \u00a0As usual, I am more excited than he is. \u00a0One of the boys, Ricky (let's call him) \u00a0actually texts Red the following day. \u00a0I believe the text went something like, \"Hey Dude. What's up?\" He is reaching out. \u00a0The boys had talked about possibly getting together to workout in the future.  \n \nI was out most of the day, doctors appointment, lunch with a girlfriend, hiding at Barnes and Noble. \u00a0When I return, no meds have been taken. \u00a0No healthy food has been eaten, of course. \u00a0Nothing productive has been done. \n\"Did you hear from the boys you met?\" I ask. \n\"Yeah...I think so.\" \n\"You think so? Either you did or you didn't.\" \n\"Yeah...Ricky texted me.\" \n\"Did you return the text.\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Why not?\" \n\"I don't know. \u00a0I guess I wasn't sure it was him.\" \n\"Well, how will he know that he reached you if you don't return the text.\" \n\"I will,\" he says with no enthusiasm. \nThis is the boy who all year long whined about not having any friends at school.  \n \nA couple of hours later. \u00a0He is lying in bed telling me how unfair it is that his computer shuts down at 10 p.m. due to parental controls.  \n \n\"Did you return that text yet?\" I ask. \n\"No.\" \n\"Why not?\"  \n\"I guess I was too busy worrying about Six Flags.\" \u00a0He's been bugging the shit out of us about going to San Antonio to Six Flags for weeks. \n\"So you're busy worrying about something that's not happening now instead of focusing on developing a friendship that is right in front of you...today. \u00a0Did you ever think, maybe these two guys may actually want to go to Six Flags?\" \n\"Fine...I'll text him.\" \n\"I don't get it. \u00a0Do you really want friends or do you just want to  complain  about not having friends?\" \nHe has no answer for this one.  \n \nI lay in bed asking myself, why do I worry, get so excited, and work so hard to make things happen for him? \u00a0I buy into every whimper and complaint, when he himself refuses to do much about it. \u00a0This lakadaisical attitude is pervasive in his life. \u00a0He takes his jolly well sweet time to do everything I ask him to do, even when it comes to making friends. \u00a0It honestly feels like I care about his happiness and well being more than he does. \n \nI know that he isn't the only one. \u00a0Developing appropriate social skills is not going to happen overnight. \u00a0 \u00a0I made this observation at an Aspergers Meetup pool party the other day. \u00a0One young lady spent the majority of the time talking to the parents in the group instead of the other teens. \u00a0She talked to the parents about their kids, but didn't interact much with the kids at all. \u00a0She talked to the parents about their kids, about getting together with their kids, but didn't spend much time talking to the kids themselves.  \n \n\"How can you make friends with the kids if you aren't over there talking to them?\" I ask her. \u00a0We encourage her to go over and join the group of teens at the table where they are actually sitting and talking. \u00a0All of us parents are a little taken aback that they are actually conversing. \u00a0Red happens to be one of those kids who is actually sitting there engaging in conversation with the other teens. \u00a0Of course, I am excited to see him do this. \u00a0Now will he make the effort to get together with any of these teens in the future? \u00a0Not if I don't plan it. \n \n Don't forget to click the little lady from Top Mommy Above... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T_DrF4q2-SI/Th4n1Zdp7WI/AAAAAAAAARE/jJZ6dYUSRCY/s1600/friendship+101.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/07/friendship-101.html", "title": "\nFriendship 101\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, July 19, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nThe cleaning people are coming to the house so we need to get out for about an hour. \u00a0I split up the boys, sending Blue with his Dad to lunch at Panera Bread where they can eat, get on their laptops and hubby can do a conference call. \u00a0 I've been gone all weekend and Red has been a complete ass while I've been away, walking around angry, barking out orders. \u00a0\"I'm hungry! Make me something to eat! \u00a0There's no good food here! I have a right to eat!\" \n \nI guess I should note here that I did not tell him I was leaving beforehand. \u00a0He was out visiting a friend and I left, like a thief in the night. \u00a0His behavior was probably about my leaving. \u00a0He feels like I am the only person who understands him, therefore he is very dependent on me. \u00a0He is also starting to freak out about school starting in a few weeks. \u00a0He also has a little anxiety about our upcoming vacation where he will be staying and spending some time with his grandmother. \u00a0(That part will be fabulous.) \u00a0His grandmother is great with him and she has some really fun things planned. \u00a0That doesn't keep him from not worrying about not being in his routine and comfort zone. \n \nI have to take him with me and my mom to get him out of the house while the cleaners are in the house. \u00a0My husband has absolutely had it with him and so has my mom, for that matter, but she doesn't \u00a0have much choice as far as who she is going to go with. \u00a0She would much rather deal with Blue instead of Red who has been rude to her while I was away. \u00a0So would I...but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do. \n \nRed gets in the car and talks non-stop about where he wants to go and where he does not want to go. \u00a0Sucker that I am, I take him where he wants to go just to shut him up. \u00a0It's a pretty neutral place, not expensive and there is something that everyone will eat. \u00a0We order lunch. \u00a0He is cordial, it seems that he is almost delighted to be there. \u00a0He sucks down his burger and fries in two minutes flat and then asks for dessert.  \nAgain...sucker that I am, I order it. \u00a0Big mistake! Huge! \n \nWe order a cookie based sundae with ice cream on top. \u00a0It is big enough for all of us to share. \u00a0In his mind it belongs to him. Of course, he doesn't have a nickel in his pocket to pay for it. \u00a0We explain to him before it is delivered that we will be sharing it. \u00a0\"You can have one quarter of it. \u00a0No never mind...that's too much,\" he says. \n\"Excuse me...where is your money? \u00a0I brought you here and paid for everything you're eating. \u00a0I don't owe you dessert. \u00a0We will share.\" \n\"That's not fair!\" \nDessert is delivered with 3 spoons. \n \nHe starts snarfing it down...trying to beat me too the punch. \u00a0He's guarding it like a dog with his arm and hand literally blocking my access. \u00a0\"You're eating too much!\" At one point he literally pushes my hand away. \u00a0I take the entire thing away. \u00a0\"You're done. \u00a0You are being very rude.\" \u00a0Of course this really pisses him off. \u00a0He's shocked. \n \nWe here about it all the way home. \u00a0He can not see anything wrong with his actions. \u00a0I tell him, it will be a long time before he sees the inside of a restaurant with me. \u00a0\"If you ever order dessert in the future...you will be paying for it. \u00a0That way you can hoard all of it for yourself.\" \u00a0He is literally blind in this situation, he really does not see anything wrong with his actions. \u00a0He is blaming the entire situation on me.  \n \nWe pull up to the house, Blue comes out to greet us. \u00a0He is in a \u00a0happy go lucky mood. \"Hi Red,\" he says. \u00a0\"Hi Bitch,\" Red replies.  WTF! You're kidding me right?  \u00a0We all walk into the house, but Red is slow poking behind. \u00a0Everyone goes in. \u00a0I lock the door behind me, leaving Red in the garage. \u00a0He bangs on the door. \"Let me in! \u00a0It's hot out here.\" \n\"You can leave. \u00a0You can go and live somewhere where people don't mind that kind rude behavior and language. \u00a0It's not acceptable here.\" \n\"What do you mean? \u00a0I live here!\" \n\"Not anymore you don't. \u00a0Anyone who curses and is rude to his family, doesn't deserve to live in this house. \u00a0You can go live somewhere where that kind of behavior is acceptable. \u00a0You will not live here and just crap all over us. \u00a0Sorry.\" \n\"You can't do that! \u00a0That's child abuse!\"  \n\"I'm doing it!\" \n \nHubby is ready to call the cops and tell him that he's being destructive to our home, because he is literally banging so hard he could damage the door. \u00a0Is this the best way to handle this situation? \u00a0Probably not. \u00a0Am I creating a melt-down? \u00a0Probably. \u00a0In this moment, I don't care. \u00a0I'm pissed and I want him to feel the pain of what he has done.  \n \nHubby is completely spent at this point. \u00a0Apparently while I was away, Red said, \"I hate you!\" to his father. \u00a0That compiled with a ton of other pressures and stress just sent my husband over the edge. \u00a0Another factor in my husbands feelings, is the fact that our eldest son, Slim Shady, had just about completely abandoned his family. \u00a0We haven't seen him since April and he lives 10 minutes away. \u00a0He has been the best father these boys could ask for, and the two of them just slap him in the face over and over again. \u00a0He is just so done. \u00a0Hubby doesn't drink. \u00a0He doesn't exercise. \u00a0He has very little relief for his stress. \u00a0It all comes out in his gray hair, which is getting pretty white these days. \u00a0  \n \nOf course, I am the voice of reason. \u00a0I have no intention on letting read leave the house in this moment, but I want him to feel the impact of his actions. \u00a0I want him to be afraid, to realize that he can not just treat us any old way and expect to live here. \u00a0I tell him, \"There are schools, where you can live where they will teach you how to live cooperatively with others. \u00a0There are residential treatment programs.\" \n\"But they will be mean to me. \u00a0They won't love me.\" \n\"Well...what difference does that make? \u00a0We love you and you treat us like crap! \u00a0You don't appreciate our love, so you may as well go somewhere where you can learn something. \u00a0We obviously can't teach you anything!\" \n \nIt takes a while, in the heat of the garage for him to come to terms with his actions. \u00a0When he decides he is ready to apologize to his grandmother and his brother, we allow him back into the house. \u00a0My husband is about ready to blow a gasket! \u00a0He leaves the house and goes out for a ride in his car. \u00a0While he is out, e receives a phone call from one of our quirky neighbors on his cell phone. \u00a0This eccentric guy, makes him laugh. \u00a0He really needed it in that moment. \u00a0He felt like that was God in action, sending him a bit of laughter in the midst of his anger. \u00a0He needed a release and crazy Floyd gave it to him. \n \nThis morning I posted about gratitude on my\u00a0 Facebook Community Page . I ask, \"Can you teach gratitude? Do you have issues with gratitude with the Aspies in your life?\" Follow the link and feel free to chime in on the discussion or feel free to leave a comment here. \n \nI also read a discussion\u00a0 here on Talk College Confidential \u00a0where a woman discusses her son's lack of gratitude. \n \nThe bottom line here is Red does not possess it gratitude. \u00a0Can we teach him to be grateful? \u00a0No. \u00a0True gratitude comes from the heart. \u00a0It's an innate feeling that you either have or you don't. \u00a0He clearly does not have it. \u00a0Blue gets it. \u00a0We have taught him and I really feel gratitude coming from his heart, but every Aspie is different. \u00a0Can we teach Red the proper behavior when someone is doing something nice for him? Yes...we can and we will. \u00a0Even if it kills us! \n \n Don't forget to click the TopMommy lady before you leave... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-koKBZxxFKBA/TiWnVKte0nI/AAAAAAAAARU/oMpRz6LDMks/s1600/images-5.jpeg", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099", "http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parent-cafe/874745-aspergers-gratitude.html"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/07/gratitude.html", "title": "\nGratitude\n"},

We have also had the mild threat of a few thunderstorms. \u00a0He magnifies that mild threat times about 1000. \u00a0We've actually had nada...nothing in terms of thunder in a very long time. \u00a0We are in a major drought and have had very little rain. \u00a0Even when there is a little rain in the area, somehow it tends to skip over us...an answer to Blue's prayers I guess. He says he doesn't mind the rain. \u00a0It's just the thunder and lightening. \u00a0Well, we've had neither. \u00a0Fear leads to anxiety. \u00a0Are we noticing a trend here??? \n \nSo apparently yesterday in Art Camp there was a philosophical discussion about Greek mythology, as they are working on Greek Art. \u00a0Apparently, one of the teachers has strong opinions about the importance of it, and a few of the kids have some knowledge based on the Percy Jackson movie. \u00a0Blue doesn't know much about it. \u00a0He has played a game that is based in ancient history (can't think of the name right now) but the teacher apparently told him that the game is not based in fact. \u00a0Because, he is so literal, he takes everything that is said, even opinion -as fact. \u00a0Especially because it comes from an authority figure.  \n \nBy the time I pick him up from camp, he is ready to explode! \"Why don't I know about Greek mythology?!! \u00a0Why did Mr. A -say....?\" \u00a0I try to explain that some of things said were his opinion. \u00a0I tell him that he is only 12...I didn't learn about Greek mythology until I was in high school, and I still don't remember much about it. \u00a0You can't know everything about everything. \u00a0Sometimes, you know little or nothing. \n\"You do have special gifts and interests an in those areas you can probably run circles around Mr. A. and any student in that class.\" \u00a0He definitely runs circles around his mommy!  \n\"I don't remember much about Greek mythology at all, \u00a0but I know a lot about autism and I think I'm a pretty good writer. \u00a0Some people suck at writing. \u00a0God gives us all special gifts. \u00a0We can't all be perfect at everything.\" \n\"I don't want to go back to that camp. \u00a0I quit!\" \n\"In your life are you going to quit everything because you have one bad day?\" \n\"No,\" he says through whimpers. \n \nAfter a good cry and a phone call to his dad, he calms down. \u00a0We spend the rest of the day, just taking it easy. \u00a0We have an early dinner, a shower and watch a movie together. \u00a0I am praying he won't loose it over the breast feeding and maternal nudity in the movie \"Babies\" we watch together. \u00a0He is grossed out, but he doesn't leave the room and he doesn't over react. \u00a0\"You breast fed just like those babies are doing,\" I tell him.  \nHe looks at me in shock. \"Ewh!\" \n \nI give him melatonin to ensure a good nights rest. \u00a0He's in bed by 9 p.m. \n \nThis morning he wakes up refreshed and ready to go at 7 a.m. \u00a0In fact, he woke me up. \u00a0He asked before he went to bed could we go to Starbucks for breakfast. \u00a0I agreed. \u00a0When we get there he orders a tall, decaf carmel frapuccinno, 2% milk, with whip. \u00a0I'm impressed. \u00a0I send him next door to get a chicken biscuit from Chik Fil A. \u00a0 He arrives at Art Camp on time for the first time this week.  \n \nI love this kid!

He is in 7th grade, so he will basically be taking 8th grade math. \u00a0He scored an almost perfect score on the state achievement tests. \u00a0He obviously has the skills he needs, but that doesn't stop him from being extremely anxious about taking this level of math.  \n \nSo although he did just fine in the camp. \u00a0All of his questions for the teacher were related to how anxious he THINKS he's going to feel if he takes this class. \u00a0On top of that, this weeks grueling schedule of getting up early and having to think for 4 hours made him pretty grumpy once he got home, especially as we reach the evening hours.  \n \nI reassure him, \"Let's just give it a try. \u00a0I think you're up to the challenge. \u00a0You have the skills you need. \u00a0You have accommodations in place \u00a0if you need extra time. \u00a0You will be fine.\" \u00a0Nothing I say matters when he is in this state of anxiety. \u00a0 Everything is wrong...nothing is right. \u00a0Everything I say or do gives him a reason to be angry.  \n \n Bugs Are The New Storms \n \nWe are in a drought here in Central Texas so there haven't been any major thunderstorms lately. \u00a0Also it's been painfully hot so little creatures are looking for a cool place to hang out. \u00a0Bugs in the house have become the new thunderstorm for Blue. \u00a0We're talking a few tiny spiders here and there and for some reason we are also being invaded by rolly pollies (potato bugs). \u00a0Nothing harmful, just annoying. \u00a0Nevertheless, Blue has been freaking out about them.  \n \n\"I can't live in this house with these bugs! \u00a0They're taking over. \u00a0I can't go anywhere without seeing them! \u00a0Those cleaning people aren't doing a good job. \u00a0They must be just sitting on their butts, eating chocolate instead of cleaning this house right,\" Blue says indignantly. \n\u00a0 \nThe funny thing is, we were at a coffee house the other day. \u00a0He notices, the same thing there in the corner as he goes to plug in his laptop. \n\"I guess they're following you,\" I say. \u00a0He doesn't see the humor in my statement. \n \nYesterday he comes banging on my door while I'm in the shower. \u00a0\"I have to use your restroom!\" \n\"Why can't you use another one?\" \n\"Red pees on the seat in his bathroom and downstairs there's a spider web!\" \n\"Tell Nana to help you with it. \u00a0I'm in the shower!\" \n\"She can't help me. \u00a0You can't actually SEE the spider web. \u00a0But I know it's there!\" \n\"So I'm supposed to get out of the shower dripping wet?\" \n\"Well...yeah!\" \n \nSo yes...it's just a barrel of laughs around here.  \n \nHere's what I have for Funny Friday: \n \nWe're in the backyard. \u00a0Blue is watering the brown areas of the grass, as he is trying to make chore money so that he can buy a new steering wheel for his car racing game.

{"date": "Friday, July 29, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nToday is the big wedding we came to Maryland to attend. \u00a0My husband's brother is getting married. \u00a0Hubby will stand up with his brother. \u00a0Can't wait to see him in that tux! \u00a0He didn't wear a tuxedo at our wedding. \u00a0We had an African themed wedding, \u00a0so he wore a beautiful linen African ensemble. \u00a0I wore a pretty non-traditional wedding outfit that I designed. \u00a0A jumpsuit the bottom part was a wide pant with a bodice attached. \u00a0I wore a cape that looked like a dress that I would take off when it was time to party. \u00a0It's sort of hard to describe. \u00a0I wish I were at home so I could scan a picture of it. \u00a0I wanted to go very non-traditional -not serving wedding cake, but peach-cobbler instead. \u00a0I just about gave my mother a heart-attack with my lack of tradition. \n \nLast night we attended the wedding rehearsal. \u00a0Red has a thousand questions as usual. \u00a0It dawns on me that neither he nor his brother have ever attended a wedding.  \nHe says, \"Only two people are getting married. \u00a0Why is everybody else walking down the isle and standing up there? \u00a0Are they getting married too?\" \n\"Now let's just think about that question. \u00a0Your dad is standing up there. \u00a0Do you think he's marrying the girl he's walking down the isle with? Do you think they're going to kiss and have a baby? \u00a0No...they are here to stand up with your uncle, to support him\u00a0because they love him.\" \nDon't think for a second he only asked this question once. \u00a0He kept saying, \"I don't get it. \u00a0Why are we here? \u00a0I don't get it. \u00a0Can we leave now? \u00a0I'm hungry.\" \nThen he asks, \"Why do people have to get married anyway? \u00a0You can have a baby and live together without getting married, so what's the point?\"  \nNow his uncle already has like a zillion children and has been living with his girlfriend for years. \u00a0So this is actually a pretty good question...one that I flounder to answer.  \nI give him something about God prefers that we get married. \u00a0\"When you are married you share a spiritual \u00a0and legal commitment. \u00a0You don't walk away so easily when things get tough...and things will get tough.\" Yada, yada, yada. \u00a0Does he get? \u00a0Not really. \u00a0Do I believe any of what I just said to him? Sort of. \u00a0The truth is I think marriage is a bit of a sham. \u00a0As a girl, I suckered myself into believing that it was a fairytale -happily ever after. \u00a0The truth is...it's a lot of freakin' work.  \n \nHowever, when my boys grow up...I do want them to have a family and hopefully one of them will give me a granddaughter. \u00a0I want them to be committed to being a partner and father, involved in the care and raising of their children on a daily basis. \u00a0Does that require a marriage license? Not really...but for my boys who believe in following the rules...they will believe that marriage is a binding contract. \u00a0So hopefully, they won't cut out when it gets tough.  \n \nRight now, Blue tells me he will NEVER get married and have kids. \u00a0He says, \"Kids cost too much money.\" \u00a0Red is not sure if he will ever find someone who can put up with him. \u00a0He says, \"You know how I fight with my family now...I'm afraid that I will do that if I get married.\" \u00a0I tell him that I'm sure that when he matures, he will have the skills to get along with people better (and I half-way believe this). \n \nMore and more lately Red asks these questions that just don't make any sense. \u00a0Sometimes I think his dialogue is just his way of thinking out loud --trying to process things. \u00a0Then other times I think... are you kidding me?  I worry about him having these obscure conversations with other people. \u00a0 They will think he's bonkers. \u00a0I am hoping that he only asks these non-sensical questions with me because I am his comfort zone. \u00a0Other times, it seems like he's going backwards cognitively. \u00a0He has always been pretty bright. \u00a0He can focus and learn everything there is to know about a subject of interest, \u00a0but as he grows older, it seems like if it's not a subject of interest, he appears clueless.  \n \nHis executive planning appears to get weaker instead of stronger. \u00a0His common sense factor is almost non-existent. \u00a0This worries me, because I want him to become independent. \u00a0Lately, his younger brother helps him with things like step by step, making up his bed, now you need to do this, or that. \u00a0His YOUNGER brother tells him about saving money and setting goals to get the things that he wants. \u00a0Blue explains to him how life works, which really irks the crap out of Red. \u00a0He will say, \"Just shut-up Blue. \u00a0I hate the sound of your little voice. \u00a0You're not smarter than me!\" Which essentially means that he's afraid that his little brother may be smarter than him. \u00a0Blue even tries to explain that, \"It's not that I'm smarter than you...it's just that I understand somethings better. \u00a0Everyone has different gifts.\" \u00a0(He got that from me...the gifts part). \n \nRed's focus is off center. \u00a0Walking through the airport the other day, he is looking out the window at airplanes while he is walking through a crowd. \u00a0He's not looking where he's going. \u00a0I'm like, \"Hello! \u00a0Look where you're going before you bump into someone.\"  \n \n \n \nWith today's wedding I'm sure there will be a trillion more questions. \u00a0I look forward to both of the boys being surrounded by love and acceptance from all of their cousins, uncles, aunts, and grandparents. \u00a0There is nothing like the love of family to give you a sense of comfort. \u00a0 They will be oblivious to any craziness and family drama that is going on behind the scenes. \u00a0 I pray that they will just have pure fun. \n \nNameste' (peace be with you)\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hJ6rD6f1cyU/TjLVWuHHC9I/AAAAAAAAASA/s1fW8f7assQ/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/07/big-day.html", "title": "\nThe Big Day\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 7, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nThis was my status on Facebook after leaving the high school for my 2nd meeting in less than a week with the School Resource Officer, Red and his Special Education Teacher this morning. \u00a0We spend the first 45 minutes of school clearing up Red's misconceptions, paranoia and misinterpretation of previous statements and events. \u00a0It's that famous spinning, looping thing that he does in his head, where he jumbles things all around, turning his own thoughts, feelings and fears into actual events and statements made by other people. \u00a0Thereby, taking up most of the capacity in his brain for learning and getting the actual education that he is attending school for in the first place. \u00a0Not only that, he internalizes and makes things bigger than they actually are. This eventually turns in to anger, outbursts and then finally, he settles into deeper depression and a good ol dose self-loathing. \n \nI already spent a good portion of my day a few days prior with, said officer, \u00a0where he explained to me in great detail, \u00a0how he handles situations with special needs kids like Red. \u00a0He is there to assist when one of these gigantic boys is getting out of control and freaking out other students or teachers. \u00a0His role is to \"serve and protect\"...to serve --by talking to them, helping them to calm down. \u00a0To protect --by removing them from a situation where they could possibly hurt themselves or others). \u00a0He does not work for the school district and they do not tell him what to do. \u00a0He handles things based on the law and his deescalation training.  \n \nRed has it in his mind that the Officer is on campus to, \"...throw me in jail and beat me like they do on Cops.\" \u00a0On the other side of the coin, he has had two different friends hand-cuffed at school in the past. \u00a0One of them was taken away. \u00a0I don't know where this child was taken or what actually happened to him. \u00a0I do know that in both of these cases the boys actually struck a teacher, whether accidentally or not. \u00a0Of course Red has NEVER done anything violent against another person in school \u00a0But in his mind, his friend was handcuffed and taken to jail...never to be seen or heard from again. \u00a0 So the same thing could happen to him at any given moment. Keep in mind that he is not really adding up 2 plus to to make 4...he is not connecting all the dots.\u00a0 \u00a0Hmm so his friend disappeared. \u00a0Where did he go? \u00a0Is he in juvee? Another school? \u00a0He doesn't know. \u00a0Maybe that is why he's a little paranoid? \u00a0 \n \nSo both of us leave the meeting this morning feeling a little better...not because of the school or the special education staff, but because of the officer himself. \u00a0 He ran this little impromptu meeting... \u00a0assuring Red that he and the staff are there to help him. \u00a0They are there  for  him...not against him. \u00a0They want him to be successful, not to fail.  \n \nThis is great...I mean totally Cumbaya! \u00a0However, I am still reeling at the thought that I actually have to have such a meeting. \u00a0I mean who ever thought I would spend so much time having to talk to school police for any reason??? \u00a0Do I really want my son in a public school where this has to be one of his worries on top of all of the mental and social issues that he already has? \u00a0Where every time he pulls up to the school and looks through the school bus window...the first thing he notices is a police car? \u00a0And then he comes home and releases all of his pent up anger and frustration by throwing up on all of us? \n \nWell...I have an ARD meeting tomorrow to talk about this among many other concerns that I have about my son's education. \u00a0Is there any wonder I feel a tad bit overwhelmed??? I mean come on...seriously? \n \n Pleasant surprise coming soon...I will be guest posting over at Flannery Sullivan's\u00a0 The Connor Chronicles \u00a0very soon! \u00a0I will let you know of course...as soon as the post is up.\u00a0 \n \n If you are new to the blog...you are morally obligated to vote here before leaving. \u00a0It is a requirement!

{"date": "Friday, September 9, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nHow I got roped in to having an autism sleep-over I do not know. \u00a0It's not his birthday, or any special occasion, but Blue is the most social Aspie I know. \u00a0He is constantly making plans with his friends, which I think is awesome. \u00a0He's smart enough and compassionate enough to be friends with others who have special needs, all of whom are very smart and have\u00a0issues that are different. \n \nSo he and one of his friends decide they must have a sleep-over this weekend. \u00a0They have never done this before. \u00a0They hang out all the time but this will be a first. \u00a0I think the occasion is they both feel a little deprived of playtime since 7th grade started. \u00a0Blue has just been overwhelmed with the rigor and schedule of homework. \u00a0It is seriously infringing on his time to relax and \"hang out\" with his friends. \n \nSince it is a holiday weekend, they schedule it for Sunday night. \u00a0Meanwhile on Saturday, Blue calls his friend Jay to ask him to come over. \u00a0Jay can't make it on Saturday, but would like to come on Sunday (the day that Twin1) is coming over. \u00a0They all know each other from elementary school. \u00a0So I say it's fine that Jay and Twin1 come over on the same evening. Jay does not plan on spending the night. \u00a0On Sunday, Twin2 decides he also wants to come over and spend the night. \u00a0Therefore, I end up with 3 boys instead of just the 1. Lucky me!!! \n \nThey all behave beautifully. \u00a0They play board games, and video games of course. \u00a0There is a little horsing around, but nothing too loud or rambunctious. \u00a0While on the computer, Blue is constantly monitoring weather. \u00a0Why? I do not know. \u00a0We haven't had rain in almost 3 months. \u00a0He finds that there is a fire warning in our city, due to the extreme heat and drought. \u00a0When they notice the fire warnings, they all come downstairs.  \n \n\"There's a fire warning...we're all going to die.\" \n\"Are we going to burn up?\" \n\"We have to search the area for fires!\" \n\u00a0I allow them to go out to search for fires. \u00a0I give them a flash light and tell them to stay within a 1 block radius in which I know there are no fires.  \nMinutes later they come back...there is no immediate danger they all report. \u00a0Blue tries really hard to get all nervous and anxious. \u00a0I respectfully ask him to just try to enjoy his friends instead of worrying. \u00a0He obliges. \n \nLater, Jay has a close call where he almost has to leave the party early. \u00a0He is afraid to use our bathroom because our fans are too loud. \u00a0He has this \"thing\" with fans right now. \u00a0Note...actually running the fan in our bathrooms is optional. \u00a0You can just turn on the light. \u00a0That is not an option for him, however. \u00a0I try putting a pillow over one of the fans to mute the sound...not good enough. \u00a0As I am calling his mom to help me solve the problem...Blue solves it for me. \u00a0He goes into the bathroom with Jay to make sure everything is o.k. \u00a0while he is using it! \u00a0This is huge! \u00a0He won't let any of us near the bathroom when he's using it. \u00a0And he would never come into the bathroom with one of us. \u00a0Wow! What he won't do for his friends! \n \n \n \nOh...and that whole sleeping issue he has...where he has a fit if he has to sleep with anyone else in the room...out the window! \u00a0He totally forgot about that when he slept with all of the boys in his room. \u00a0He did wear his ear plugs --just in case someone snored, but that was it! \u00a0Remember our  Bed-Hopping \u00a0sleeping disaster on our family vacation. \u00a0Blue would rather sleep on the floor in the bathroom, than sleep next to his brother. \n \nThe next morning...the boys wake up. \u00a0I am in my room, in my bed, on my laptop when they ALL COME MARCHING INTO MY ROOM. \"Good morning. \u00a0What's for breakfast?\" \u00a0HELLO!!! Boundaries??? \u00a0Why are there 12 year old boys in my bedroom? \u00a0How about Blue knocks on the door...waits for me to come and answer before they all come marching in??? \u00a0It was just too funny.  \n \nI must say...I truly enjoyed having the boys in my home. \u00a0It was so good seeing them all enjoy such a typical, teenage-boy activity, with laughter and a sense of comfort. \u00a0No one was teased, taunted or made fun of. \u00a0They just had a pure good time and I received so much joy from watching them. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TPJL-IpA_xY/TmoooCWseWI/AAAAAAAAATo/sIuh137CfuQ/s1600/images.jpeg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BK76tBgMSyw/TmoxD2yrxfI/AAAAAAAAATs/cEMXUUZz940/s1600/theboys.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/09/autism-sleeps.html", "title": "\nAutism Sleeps\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, September 13, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nI send and e-mail to my son's special education tracking teacher to let her know that basically, the programing in place at the high school IS NOT WORKING for him. \u00a0I do not feel he is getting the best education because of all of the distractions in the large environment that are weighing him down. \u00a0Red is so focused on the couples in the hallways making out, and the groups of friends hanging out, feeling lost and left out, that he is not focusing on learning. \u00a0He spends so much time being angry about not having any friends...or any real connections at school. \u00a0He ends up getting himself into trouble, acting out of his anger. \u00a0He makes\u00a0it all\u00a0bigger and bigger inside of his head and that doesn't leave much space for learning and actually getting the work done. \n \n \n \nGranted...I don't think the combination of meds he's been taking over the past year have been exactly helpful either. \u00a0Getting it right is just a maddening process. \u00a0In the past week or so however, he seems like he's on the upswing of that. \u00a0He has not been as moody and depressed. \u00a0In fact, he has been GETTING UP ON HIS OWN, and ready ON TIME every single day! \u00a0He has been working hard on self-responsibility...even doing a little homework for God's sake! \u00a0(Although, he did make me sit there and baby-sit him the whole time he was doing it.)\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo we have this ARD (Admissions, Review, Dismissal it's called here in Texas) meeting as a result of my letting them know that we are ready to pull him out and send him to private school. \u00a0The strange thing is...once the meeting begins, they start it as if it was all their idea. \u00a0\"We are having this meeting because of Red's behavior, which is not safe for him or other students...\" yada, yada, yada. \u00a0Really??? \u00a0So if I didn't send that e-mail saying that I am ready to pull him out would we be having this meeting??? \u00a0 \n \n \n \nOh and by the way...there are additional Special Education staff who have been brought into this meeting from Red's home school. \u00a0You see...Red is a transfer student, because supposedly his home school does not offer programming that will accommodate his needs. \u00a0Was I notified beforehand that additional staff would be there and that they are actually considering weather or not his needs can be met at his homeschool? \u00a0No...we just walked right into that, totally blindsided.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nTypically...a parent should be notified of the agenda of the ARD meeting ahead of time by one of the team members. \u00a0They expect to present you with all of this information that will effect your child's future and you are supposed to make a decision on the spot?? \u00a0The committee asks parents to sign on the dotted line saying that you agree with what has transpired in the meeting...btw without actually seeing the written results of said meeting. \u00a0Don't sign unless you are totally comfortable with what has transpired. \n \n \nIn this case we did agree, because basically this was a meeting to call another meeting. \u00a0The district will be doing a VISIT meeting where we set out a roadmap for Red's future in education and in life. \u00a0They will also be doing a new Functional Behavior Assessment, where they will look at his current behaviors and come up with a new behavior plan based on his current needs. \u00a0They will also be doing some academic assessments to see where the gaps are in reading in math. \u00a0Oh and that additional Special Education staff that they brought in from the other school will be helping them with these assessments...giving them a different set of eyes and ears to look at Red with. \u00a0Why? \u00a0BECAUSE WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST YEAR...HAS NOT BEEN WORKING. \u00a0WE ARE NOT GETTING ANY POSITIVE RESULTS. \u00a0HIS BEHAVIORS ARE NOT CHANGING, which is interfering with his education.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI will admit that part of this sudden attention that Red is receiving is also because they have a new Special Education Lead at the high school. \u00a0She perused Red's files to see what the heck has been going on for the past year? \u00a0Why are they beating their heads against the wall and nothing is changing? \u00a0She looked at his last VISIT meeting that was done in 8th grade and saw that it wasn't very meaty and it certainly did not reflect who he is today. \u00a0Fresh blood can be a good thing. \u00a0Sometimes the status quo staff members get into the habit of doing the same thing over and over. \u00a0Well...we don't have a conventional kid...in fact, non of us do. \u00a0Each child is unique. \u00a0Status quo staff may not take into account new methods and training that someone fresh out of a Masters or Doctorate program may have in their arsenal. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWow!

You may be surprised what is being left out of the documentation or what is changed, by human error or not. \u00a0Ask for a full copy of the documents and review them before you sign. \u00a0You can always call another meeting to sign, once you are comfortable with the plan you have in place. \n \n \n \nWe are often in an emotional state during these meetings. \u00a0Emotionality is not a valuable tool when you are making decisions that effect your child's future. \u00a0Remember...you are signing a legal document. \u00a0Don't sign anything you don't understand. \u00a0I always think of something after the meeting that I didn't address DURING the meeting, or think through completely. \u00a0Give your self some time to digest and discuss the the plan with your mate, or someone who has been through the process before.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAlso, it doesn't hurt to take an advocate with you to your ARD meeting to help you understand the decisions that you are making and to make sure that your rights are not being violated. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n PLEASE HELP me grow my Aspergers Community by voting on TOP MOMMY and ALL THE OTHER PLACES TO VOTE ABOVE . \u00a0THANK YOU!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4SrgYsow2tk/Tm9qLfK6I3I/AAAAAAAAAT0/tTPoRTP0kH0/s1600/blazing+guns.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/09/big-guns-blazing.html", "title": "\nBig Guns Blazing\n"},

{"date": "Monday, September 19, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nIt's hard to believe that sixteen years ago...I gave birth to the most beautiful baby boy I have ever seen. \u00a0He was a perfect little blur as they whisked him away quickly because he wasn't breathing when they took him from my body. \u00a0It took them 5 minutes or so to work on him before we got an actual cry. \u00a0They only let me see him for a moment before they took his little 4 pound, 8 oz body into the ICU where he stayed for 5 days until they could see him actually gaining a little weight. \u00a0I couldn't wait to get him home, where the nurses could no longer tell me what to do with my own baby boy. \u00a0There was absolutely no fear in bringing him home to take care of him on my own. \u00a0I couldn't wait!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhat I didn't realize is that I should have been in no hurry. \u00a0 I would have a lifetime of years ahead of me. \u00a0My life would never be the same. \u00a0I would no longer rest on my own schedule, but on his. \u00a0In fact, I would almost completely loose who I am, so that I could help develop who he will be in this world. I would be in for the roller coaster ride of my life. \u00a0I became a mother...who would give up her own life in order to make his life better. \u00a0As I held that perfect baby in my arms...I had no idea really what being his mother would actually mean. \n \n \n \nWe perseverated over the birthday ALL WEEK LONG leading up to the big day. \u00a0He actually sent out an e-mail announcement to the entire family, reminding them that his 16th birthday is Sunday (you know in case they forgot or weren't thinking about it). \u00a0He tried very hard to act like it wasn't all about the gifts...at least he TRIED. \u00a0He also made an effort to graciously say thank you for what he did receive, even though it was mostly scripted. \u00a0( I know I'm supposed to say thank you and act all grateful...whatever that means, so that everyone won't be mad at me and they will give me more gifts in the future.)  \u00a0 I was glad to at least see him at least making the effort.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOn this 16th birthday, Red opts out of the boring Six Flags trip that he likes to take every single year...mostly because he doesn't really have anyone to go with. \u00a0He only has one friend who actually likes Six Flags and roller coasters as much as he does. \u00a0Instead, he asked for a dinner party with the Aspergers Meetup group along with a couple of his other good friends.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo on Saturday night, we met at his 2nd favorite restaurant, Cheddars, because his first favorite (BJ's) is too expensive for a large group. \u00a0We had a great turn out and the boys all had a really good time. \u00a0It was so awesome to see Red smiling, genuinely happy because he was the center of attention. \u00a0This is a lifelong dream for him. \n \n \n \n \n \nThere were about 20 of us in total, parents all sitting on one end of the table while the boys sat conversing at the other end. \u00a0Most of the boys were all actually very social, which was good to see. \u00a0There were a lot of plain cheeseburgers ordered (no condiments of course). \u00a0Most them ordered double burgers and woofed them down in nothing flat. Hubby allowed them all to order whatever they wanted for dessert, which thrilled them all immensely. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe creme de la creme for Red was his big brother showing up for the celebration. \u00a0The prodigal son whom we have not seen in months, though he only lives 10 minutes away, \u00a0did his brotherly duty, showing up in his Alpha-phi-Alpha fraternity jacket, fresh off of crossing over into the brotherhood. \u00a0Red was so proud to introduce him to all of his friends. \u00a0Slim Shady, sat down on the boys end of the table and actually engaged in conversation with all of the them. \u00a0I think that alone was the single, best gift.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOn Sunday, his actual birthday, Mama slaved over a hot stove to prepare the traditional fried chicken, macaroni and cheese dinner. \u00a0This time it was accompanied by a spinach salad, which Red actually ate. \u00a0He is trying to be healthy so that he can loose a few pounds to be ready for the wrestling team that he hopes to join next month. \u00a0Mama topped off dinner with homemade white chocolate cookie bars with ice-cream. \u00a0We all sang happy birthday to him...even Harry our dog tried to get in on the celebration barking as we sang. \u00a0It was a very special day for a very special boy. \u00a0The difference is this time...he actually seemed grateful. \n \n \n \n \n Blue picked out the most PERFECT card for his brother... \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QYOutC_TJ-c/Tnd4V1NJTvI/AAAAAAAAAUc/BLboZECYzqI/s1600/teensparty.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nzvtCxdq_pM/Tnd9l0ACQTI/AAAAAAAAAUo/2SLAobdkYjg/s1600/brothers2.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E3fB-IN6cME/TneHFqAy9kI/AAAAAAAAAUs/6bCOdIAFeow/s1600/IMAG0553.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/09/sixteen-is-sweet.html", "title": "\nSixteen is Sweet!\n"},

{"date": "Friday, September 30, 2011", "body": "\n \nThe alarm sounds off...he crosses the room to turn it off and crawls back into bed. \u00a0I enter the room a few minutes later he is dead to the world...back into a deep slumber. \u00a0I tap him gently, \"Good morning...today's the field trip. \u00a0Time to get up.\" \n\"I changed my mind. \u00a0I don't want to go.\"\u00a0His eyes are still closed as he speaks in a drunken slur. \n\"Well...that's not really an option. \u00a0Come on wake up.\" \u00a0His eyes do not budge. \n\"Can I have a hug?\" I ask. \u00a0His eyes flicker. \u00a0Hmm...I have his interest. \u00a0He still loves a hug from his mama. \u00a0This actually gets him to open his eyes slightly.  \n\"I need help to get up,\" he says as he reaches towards me. \nI take his hand. \u00a0There is no way that I can really help lift his enormous body. \u00a0He pulls himself up and gives me a hug. \u00a0I scratch his back and his scalp briefly, trying to give him sensory stimuli to help him wake up. \u00a0Finally...he is awake. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \n \n \nI've been in stress and panic mode for the past three weeks really. \u00a0Having him change campuses within the district was put on the table in our last ARD/IEP meeting. \u00a0The word  change  and  Aspergers teen \u00a0within the same sentence is a recipe for explosion and disaster. \u00a0The very thought of this possibility has had him on edge for the past 2 weeks. \u00a0This tension and being on edge looks better than it did last spring where he would have been screaming and aggressive...so I'll count my blessing for that. \n \nWe finally have the big ARD/IEP meeting yesterday. \u00a0He walks into the room full adults, administrators and teachers and immediately lets everyone there know he definitely does not want to go to that other school and all of the reasons why. \u00a0He punctuates his thoughts with, \"That school is ghetto!\" \u00a0Of course he has no idea what \"ghetto\" really is. \u00a0Because this suburban school is definitely not that. \u00a0It is his home campus...the school that his older brother graduated from. \u00a0Last night I ask him, \"So does that mean your brother is ghetto...because he played football and graduated from there?\"  \n\"Uh...no. HE isn't. \u00a0But a lot of kids there are.\" \n \nOf course this is his own quirky perception along with a few extremely negative comments coming from a friend. \u00a0Does this friend go said school? No. \u00a0Does he even go to high school? No. \u00a0So how does he know how \"Ghetto\" this school is? \u00a0He doesn't...but of course, he has Red convinced.  \n \nThe meeting totally sucks! \u00a0The ARD/IEP Coordinator is rude and abrupt. \u00a0She starts off by letting us all know how little time we have to get this done (less than 45 minutes). \u00a0The special education teacher races through the FBA (functional behavior analysis) and testing results so fast I couldn't see straight. Of course, I interject with several questions that I'm not sure were ever answered to any level of satisfaction. \u00a0My husband is sitting there basically, Mr. Happy-go-lucky schmoozer that he is. \u00a0He does ask for them to step up and get Red some reading supports. \u00a0We are not happy with his academic progress at all. \u00a0At the end, the Coordinator abruptly tries to end the meeting while the Special Education Lead from his home campus is still trying to speak. \u00a0I want to reach across the table and slap her.  \n \nI leave the meeting not agreeing to anything. \u00a0I sign that I was in attendence but do not fully understand everything that was presented. \u00a0I have 5 school days to get back to them with any changes that I want. Boy do I want changes! \u00a0I am so done with this school...and last night after a pretty good sales job on my part with Red, I think he may be done as well. \n \nStay tuned...I don't want to say right now exactly what our game plan is because I don't want to jinx anything. \u00a0Let's suffice it to say...things are looking up and I am hopeful. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-A1N3GEnBqY0/ToXsxDA0KlI/AAAAAAAAAVc/RldsSKA-Nyc/s1600/images-6.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/09/aspergers-change.html", "title": "\nAspergers + Change =\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2011", "body": "\n Doesn't that sound cool?  Avant-garde ! It's better than weird...unconventional, strange, dysfunctional which is what we really are.  \n \nWe do lots of things differently around here...i.e. vacations. \u00a0It's been a long time since we've piled the entire family into the car or onto a plane to go on a family vacation. \u00a0It's really not a lot of fun. \u00a0It's just more work in another location for me. \u00a0Blue can have a good time anywhere. \u00a0Red...he complains no matter where he is, especially if I'm there. \u00a0That is really frustrating --when you're paying a lot of money to listen to someone complain. \n \nIn recent history -we send Red on vacation either alone to see other family members (which he loves) \u00a0or we send one of the boys alone with their father. \u00a0Recently Red and I took a little mini vacation to San Antonio, which is only 90 minutes from home. \u00a0I wrote about\u00a0 Six Flags More Fun \u00a0...more fun for him that is. \n \nBack in April -I took my own vacation...away from all of them. \u00a0It was a complete blast! I wrote\u00a0 Dear L.A. \u00a0...how do I love the? Let me count the ways. \u00a0I had so much fun away from my family for 6 days! I came home refreshed, renewed, ready to deal with my reality. \u00a0Didn't take long for the renewal to wear off. \u00a0Reality came and slapped me in the face...woke me up and said, \"Snap out of it!\" \u00a0I'm ready for another vacation right about now! \n \nNow it's Hubby's turn to take a trip. \u00a0Last year he spent his birthday in Georgia with his brothers. \u00a0He took Red with him on that trip. \u00a0This year he is going to L.A. to the  Playboy Jazz Festival .\u00a0There's only one stipulation...I'm making him take Blue with him. \u00a0Blue will mostly spend time with my family (his cousins) while he is there. \u00a0Dad will get a break, go to the festival and see his friends. \u00a0The issue is...I don't want to be stuck here -alone, with the two boys. \u00a0Been there, done that, don't want the t-shirt! \n \nOf course when Red found out the guys are planning a trip to L.A. without him, he looses it. \u00a0\"That's not fair!\" he shouts...no screaming, which is good, but lots of whining and shouting. \u00a0\"But I want to go! I want to go to Six Flags -Magic Mountain!\" \n \n\"I want to go too!\" I say. \u00a0\"But I don't get to do everything that I want to do!\" \n \nWe quickly explain that he's been on 3 trips to Blue's one trip in the past year. \n \n\"Was it fair when you went with Dad to Georgia last year and Blue didn't go?\"  \n\"Was it fair when you went to L.A. over Thansgiving and your brother didn't go?\" \n\"Was it fair when you went to San Antonio last month and your brother didn't go?\"  \n\"Well...I rest my case!\" \n \nI also threw in the fact that Blue has worked incredibly hard this school year, making straight A's. \u00a0He also worked very hard on his state testing and received commended scores. Yes -I also mentioned that he treats us with great respect. \u00a0He more than deserves this trip! \n \nWithout much further ado...Red had no choice but to shut the heck up! \n \nBTW...Red continues to do better. \u00a0Things are not perfect...but they are much more manageable. \u00a0Thank you all for your prayers, positive energy and support. \n \n \n Did you enjoy this post?

{"date": "Thursday, September 15, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \nLife has been a little better since I got to go see Sade and John Legend in concert. \u00a0She rocked my world or at least shook it up a bit. \u00a0 Brought back a memory of me growing up in L.A., riding the RTD (city bus) down Adams to Crenshaw to go buy her first album on cassette tape...popping it into my Walkman, \u00a0then riding back home listening to her. \u00a0This was back in 1984. \u00a0I was 19 years old...no car yet. \u00a0Each song she sang the night of the concert was a memory of something in my young adult life...old lovers, friends, adventures, those fun times when my biggest worry was what I would do to party on the weekend. \n \nI'm so glad that my husband insisted that we go to this show. \u00a0He has taken me to see 2 icons this year...first Janet, and now Sade. \u00a0Music is one thing we have in common for sure...of course he is obsessed with his music collection. \u00a0He spends hours working on it, ripping it from CD's and organizing it in ITunes. \u00a0We really grooved together that night...totally forgetting our worries and how mad we've been at each other. \u00a0For a few good hours we were a couple...not parents, which seems like the dominating role we play these days. \u00a0Being there reminded me to disappear into music more often to sooth my weary, confused, discombobulated soul.  \n \n \n \nOther than that concert...we really have had no time or energy for connection lately. \u00a0I've been to stressed and obsessed with getting Red's meds and school situation straight. \u00a0The good news is...we may finally have the meds right. \u00a0His anger is definitely down to a minimum. \u00a0His outlook on life is better. \u00a0He is still who he is. \u00a0He's talking non-stop...rambling on and on from one subject to the next. \u00a0Asking for opinions and then telling you that you're wrong. \u00a0Asking questions that he already knows the answers to...hardly letting anyone else get a word in edgewise. \u00a0It's kind of weird, he's doesn't even get on the computer that much anymore. \u00a0He wants to be constantly talking to someone...and he wants your undivided attention for hours on end. \u00a0It's quite exasperating...but so much better than anger, rage and holes in the walls.  \n \nAnd then there's my Blue...he's a busy little guy with tons of homework and stress because of it. \u00a0Once he gets home...he's so done with focusing on work, and he gets overwhelmed because of the volume of it all. \u00a0Then he has his social obligations. \u00a0He really thinks he should be hanging out with friends almost daily and he's not exactly happy that he doesn't have the time for it during the week. \u00a0He is beginning to get the homework 'somewhat' under control. \u00a0He is staying after school for an hour to work on it, and he goes in early sometimes, so that he doesn't have to work much more than an hour at home. Still...that's a lot of freakin' homework.  \n \nI am still convinced that the volume of work that he has is because of the freakin' budget cuts in education. \u00a0They are shortening classes and adding content...pushing teachers to the limits, and not giving students enough 'practice time' in class the way they did before. \u00a0Maybe it's just me...but I think it's ridiculous. \u00a0That's all we need is a little extra stress in our lives...caused by these idiotic politicians who didn't plan properly for the most important expense in our state...EDUCATION! \u00a0 I think they really want to keep the masses in America dumb, so that we won't know how to vote in our own best interests.  \n \nMy life is full of so many little details...there is so much to remember when you are taking care of a family. \u00a0Medical appointments, medications, keeping the house supplied with food, helping everyone maintain a proper diet. \u00a0Then I have 2 adults in the house who expect me to do the same thing for them. \u00a0After having to do so much for Kendal...I loose my patience, and I don't want to have to take care of a grown man on top of it all. \u00a0I know I shouldn't feel that way. \u00a0After all, he works extremely hard to take care of all of us financially. \u00a0But sometimes I want to say, \"Make your own damn plate! \u00a0No...I don't know what you're going to eat for lunch. \u00a0You're a grown up! \u00a0Figure it out! \" \n \nMom...she helps out a lot, but she has her days of sitting and waiting for me to do things that she can do for herself. \u00a0I had to babysit her through a business call yesterday. \u00a0She had everything written down that she wanted to ask...still I had to get on the phone with her. \u00a0\"I get nervous and I may forget something,\" she says. \n \n \n \nOver the weekend, I left to go to Houston for my BFF's baby shower . \u00a0(Such a good excuse to leave! Thank you Ms. T.) \u00a0Before I leave on Saturday, Mom asks me what they are going to eat for dinner on Sunday? \u00a0\"I have no idea...I won't be here.\" \u00a0And 2 grown-ass people will be! \n \nI love them all dearly...but we all loose our patience sometimes. \u00a0I do spoil them all. \u00a0That's why they depend on me so much. \u00a0I'm sure they all have a long list of complaints about me. \u00a0I am not perfect by any means...but they have to write about it in their own blog. \u00a0This is MY release. \u00a0These are my 'Confessions.' \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-eQjO9Adud0E/TnIjSQQtBPI/AAAAAAAAAT4/0Z6N1E6yD0g/s1600/Diary.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0nTz8ihH8bA/TnIlyLDHiVI/AAAAAAAAAT8/SO8zDngTDyM/s1600/Sade.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OKnvL7peEn4/TnIrcE_FtUI/AAAAAAAAAUA/4zoa3NJwq3Q/s1600/besties.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/09/dear-diary.html", "title": "\nDear Diary\n"},

My Facebook status: \"If drinking alone is a sign of being an alcoholic all I can say is...it runs in the family.\" \n \nThis morning I read a blog post on\u00a0 Mama Be Good titled \"Frame it Hang It\" \u00a0Brenda reminds herself that her son's anxiety is not about her, it's not to be punished or taken personally. \u00a0The words she wants to frame are \"I am Anxious. \u00a0I'm trying to tell you but I can't!\" \u00a0I am showing you what anxiety looks like by my behavior, but I'm really just plain old anxious! You have to read her entire post. \u00a0It's incredibly insightful. \u00a0Thank you Brenda! \n \nOf course now I feel terribly guilty for taking it all so personally. \u00a0I guess the sign I need to frame is \"I am human.\" \n \n If you enjoyed this post...please click below to vote an support the blog.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 8, 2011", "body": "\n Blue and I have been getting on each other's nerves a lot in the past week or so. \u00a0He is such a \u00a0deep...different kind of thinker. \u00a0He has an opinion about everything. \u00a0I come up with a simple idea and he has to analyze it and ultimately disagree with it, even if it makes perfectly good sense. \u00a0I will admit my patience for it all has been a little short. \n \nFor example...yesterday, I am helping him with his laundry. \u00a0Clothes are spread all over his bed. \u00a0We are folding them and I want him to put them away. \u00a0In the middle of this process, he decides to start cleaning out the bathroom that holds his \"escape the storm supplies\" and he wants to also make his bed. \u00a0Now how can you make a bed when your laundry is all over it? The \"escape supplies\" have been in the bathroom all night and half the day. \u00a0Why do we need to clean it out right now? \u00a0Let's accomplish one thing and then we can focus on the other. \u00a0Well he gets pissy with me because he wants to do things his way. \u00a0Even though his way doesn't make any sense! \n \nLater were in the car,  sitting at a red light  and I pick up my phone to  look  at a text message. \u00a0Well...OMG that is against the RULES! \u00a0\"Mom! No texting and driving!\"\u00a0\" \n\"I am not texting! I'm reading! I am sitting still...not actually driving where I could hit someone.\" \nBlue plays by the rules...the black and white. \u00a0I definitely like to hang out in the gray area...cutting corners around the rules. \n \nWe reach our destination, again I pick up my phone to send a text. \u00a0I am making arrangements for an evening out with a girlfriend. \u00a0I am also making arrangements for him to get together with a friend while I am out. \u00a0He continues to give me a lecture about text messaging. \u00a0\"It seems like you're always texting someone. \u00a0What happened to the good old days?\" ...etc. \u00a0Then he goes back into the texting while driving lecture. \n \nGeez! How many husbands do I have exactly? This speech is straight out of my husband's playbook. My husband gives me a hard time about Facebook and texting, etc. \u00a0He works in information security and really does not like social media outlets. \u00a0You can guess how he really feels about this blog. He's supportive in a way...but he is also very private. \u00a0When he gives me a hard time, he is teasing...sort of. \u00a0I politely...and sometimes, not so politely ignore him. \u00a0What it comes down to I think, is that they want me to be focused on them ALL THE TIME! I'm not supposed to have a life that's not always ABOUT THEM! \n \nBefore I completely loose it on my poor little son...I think it would be best to break this down to him. \u00a0I have PMS! \u00a0This is not the time to mess with me! \u00a0He did not want to do the puberty video at school and I'm not even sure if they cover the subject of girls and their \"cycles\" in the boy's presentation. \u00a0He was about to get a lesson in Females 101. \n \n\"Females have something called a cycle, where once a month for about a week, their bodies go through these hormonal changes. \u00a0It can put them in a bad mood. \u00a0Their patience may be short. \u00a0They may get angry very easily. \u00a0They may cry more easily and not act like their normal cheerful selves. \u00a0This is my week.\" \n \nI also explain that he may see this in girls at school. \u00a0One day they may be nice and friendly and the next day you will wonder why they are in such a bad mood. \n \nA light bulb goes off in his head. \u00a0I could see the gears spinning in his thought process. \u00a0He says, \"So that's why we haven't been getting along?\" \n \nThat's part of it...his Aspergers, rigid thinking, anxiety, acting like he's my boss instead of my son, that's the other part. \n \n \n I'm hanging in on the Top 25 by the skin of my teeth!

So glad you could come out and play with me today.  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \n I haven't been able to write since Monday of this week. \u00a0I've have really missed my outlet. \u00a0My writing was replaced by something even better. \u00a0My \"Bestie\" is in town for a visit. \u00a0She came along with my god-daughter and their doggie, a little mini-Yorky named Loppi. \u00a0They came to keep me company while half of my crew is out of town. \u00a0One might say she came to help me from completely falling apart or totally loosing it by having to spend all that time alone with Red, listening to his non-stop complaints, and requests, and pleas of boredom. \u00a0 \n \nMovie camp started this week for Red. \u00a0It is the same \"Script-to-Screen\" camp offered by the Austin Film Festival, that he took last year. \u00a0He actually asked to be signed up this year. \u00a0It's an afternoon session, which made me believe I would have no trouble getting him there on time...NOT! He is still slow as hell when it comes to getting ready. \u00a0I really do not think he knows the meaning of hurry, quickly, or on-time. \n \nI wish I could tell you how it's going, but I can't get much out of him.  \n \n\"How did it go today son?\" \n\"Fine.\" \n\"What did you do? What did you learn?\" \n\"I don't know.\" \n\"You can't tell me one single thing that you talked about.\" \n\"I don't want to talk about it.\" \n\"Oh. \u00a0I see. \u00a0Well, if you can't tell me one thing you learned, it makes me think you didn't learn anything. \u00a0If you're not learning anything, I guess I shouldn't waste my money sending you next year.\" \n\"What?! What do you mean you won't send me next year? O.K. uh we worked on our script today.\" \n\"Oh, great! What's your script about? Did you present any of your ideas?\" \n\"No...I don't have any ideas.\" \n\"You told me about several ideas last week. What happened to those?\" \n\"Probably no-one would like them.\" \n\"How would you know that if you don't present them?\" \n\"Well, what's it about?\" \n\"I don't know...I guess it's about a bully chasing someone around the school.\" \n\"That's all you can tell me?\" \n\"I dont' really like talking to  you  about it.\" \n \nWow! \u00a0From there the subject moves on to when I'm going to take him to Six Flags...This is  so  not anytime soon. \u00a0Especially, since we're already in the 100's here in Central Texas and will be for the foreseeable future. \u00a0Not to mention a zillion other reasons why he doesn't really deserve to go. \n \n\"You  made  me waste my money on that season pass, because you knew you weren't going to take me.\" \n Yeah...I really held a gun-to your head and threatened you into buying that Season Pass. \n \nI am happy to report that Red had an old friend come out of the woodwork this week. \u00a0He met this young man in their first year of middle school. \u00a0They remained in touch even after Red changed schools for a while...but when Kevin (let's call him) got busy with sports and new friends, we stopped hearing from him. Lord knows Red did not make the effort to stay in touch either. \u00a0The friend is probably a little bored this summer, so he reached out -even sending me a message on Facebook with his phone number so that Red could call him.  \n \nAfter a long day of driving downtown, dropping Red at Movie Camp and hanging out in downtown for 4 hours until he finishes, \u00a0the friend calls and asks Red to go swimming that night. \u00a0Sucker that I am...I didn't want him to pass up the chance for A -some exercise, and B -social interaction with a peer. \u00a0Of course, \u00a0I take him. \u00a0I watch from the car for a while as they interact with other boys who were already in the pool.  \n \nBefore I know it, I see with my own eyes...my son -- runs, jumps in the air, catches the football  and splashes down into the water beneath him. \u00a0For a moment there, I thought maybe I was hallucinating. \u00a0That within itself \u00a0is worth the effort of driving him over there. \n \n I only wish that he could see him graciously receive all of his blessings with an open heart. \nI wish that he could see as I do, that God is working in his life. \nI wish that he could show a sign -just one sign, that he has an ounce of gratitude for anything. \n \n I am always grateful for your clicks below!

What's the big deal?\" \u00a0 The big deal is that I paid for it, and I want every penny's worth of time away from you!   \n \nIt's hot...I'm pissed that he is 30 minutes late for a class that doesn't start until one o'clock in the afternoon. \u00a0I drop him off and burn rubber out of the parking lot. \u00a0I take solace in a cool coffee house where I sit down to write over an ice cold coke. \u00a0As the happy music plays in the background, suddenly I feel almost high, (not that I have any idea what \"high\" feels like...wink wink). \u00a0I am definitely euphoric from having just a few moments of freedom.  \n \n \n \nAnyway...today is  Funny Friday \u00a0here on Confessions . \u00a0I failed to get any funny stories from my community members on my  Facebook Community Page , so I will have to go into my archives to share a few funny statements from my own kids. \n \nThis one I will never forget: \n \nWe pull up to Walgreen's. \u00a0I am trying to park but this little lady is moving very slowly getting in to her car. \u00a0I say to myself sarcastically, \"Could you move a little slower?\" \nI get out of the car, leaving the boys sitting there while I run in to get some milk. \u00a0I come out to find my then 9 year-old son talking to the woman. \n\"My mom says you move very slow.\" \nThe poor woman looks so confused and maybe a little pissed off. \u00a0I motion him to get back into the car quickly. \n\"Mom why are you mad? \u00a0You did say that.\" \n\"Yes...but not so that she could here me!\" \nLesson learned...don't say anything in front of your Aspergers kid, that you don't want repeated. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \nRed and Blue are bantering in the car about...nothing. \u00a0Blue says to Red, \"Can you think of something smart to talk about? \u00a0Because this conversation is stupid.\" \u00a0Mind you...Blue is the younger one. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \nI have a meeting at Red's school. \u00a0He received rave reviews about his behavior and maturity during the school year. \u00a0(This is during middle school.) \u00a0\"He's a joy to teach,\" says his teacher. \u00a0When he comes home I tell him how proud I am. \u00a0I ask, \"Why can't I see some of that respect and good behavior at home?\" \n\"Because I don't like your policies.\" \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n\"So boys like boobs on girls right? What inappropriate part on boys do girls like?\" asks Blue. \n\"Cute butts,\" I say. \n\"No way! \u00a0That's disgusting! \u00a0That's impossible!\" \n\"I'm a girl...believe me I know. \u00a0And you've got a pretty cute butt so you're all set!\" \n\"That's just gross mom.\" \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \nAnd finally this was a prayer from Blue. \n \n\"Dear God, please let me sleep well tonight and not wake up for anything. \u00a0I don't need any dreams...just nothing. \u00a0And definitely no dreams about...I think you know what I mean.\" \n \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \nI hope your friday is funny.  \n \n I have fallen behind in my TopMommy votes. \u00a0Please help my blog by voting. \u00a0Just a quick click... \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p87Tau8NhWc/Tfvb__qyiSI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/qinFeQiU_gU/s1600/images-3.jpeg", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/06/funny-friday.html", "title": "\nFunny Friday\n"},

Responsible middle aged woman will take care of your property while you're away on vacation. \u00a0Will feed your pets, water your lawn and keep the burglars away!\"  \n \nThe only catch is I come along with two children who may put holes in your walls when they have meltdowns. \n \nThis week, we have Art camp in the mornings for Blue and afternoon Movie camp for Red. \u00a0This means I'm in it...driving around in the heat of the day. \u00a0This morning I through in a haircut for Red. \u00a0He was starting to look like a grizzly bear. \u00a0He needs to start learning to shave. \u00a0I've mentioned this to the hubby weeks ago...to no avail.  \n \nThe trip to the barber shop means I \u00a0rush back home after dropping off Blue. \u00a0I give him a good hour and a half to get up, eat, get ready and out the door. \u00a0He moves so slowly, it's excruciating to watch. \u00a0He comes to get in the car after I have told him specifically to wash his face and brush his teeth. \u00a0(Why do I still need to tell him to wash his face and brush his teeth? One might ask.) \u00a0He comes to get in the car without washing his face.  \n \n\"Did you wash your face?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Didn't I tell you to wash your face?\" \n\"I forgot...what's the big deal?\" \n\"The big deal is that oils are building up on your skin and you will end up going back to school with a bunch of acne on your face.\" \n\"Girls like other boys who have bumps on their face.\" \n\"How can you expect anyone to like you if you don't care enough about yourself to take care of your own body?\"  \n \nWe get to the barbershop. \u00a0I get out of the car. \u00a0He is still sitting there. \u00a0I am sitting inside for 10 minutes while they finish up other customers. \u00a0Red is still sitting in the car. \u00a0It is already 85 degrees. \u00a0Why is he sitting? \u00a0I have no idea. \u00a0I step out twice and wave to him. \u00a0A  what the hell are you doing? -kind of wave. \nWe get the haircut. \u00a0He is back to his handsome self -minus the dirty face. \u00a0He starts whining about being hungry. \u00a0The whining gets louder and louder. \u00a0Mind you -he has just finished breakfast an hour before. \u00a0I refuse to go to Mc Donalds. \u00a0I go to Subway and order a turkey sandwich. \u00a0I am insisting on a healthier diet. \u00a0I will no longer participate in the fast food nonsense. \u00a0He complains of being so tired that he can't bend down to pick things up. \u00a0\"I'm too tired to walk up the stairs.\" \u00a0He has gained weight on this new medicine. \u00a0If you're too tired to bend down or walk...you certainly don't need a bacon-cheeseburger. \n \nBy the time I drop him off at camp...I am totally spent. \u00a0I don't know how I'm going to survive this eternal summer. \u00a0My sanity is seriously at stake here and it's only June. \n \nThese are my confessions...I have to finish this rant another time. \u00a0 Duty calls! \n Help a sistah out! ...just a quick click here:\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/06/eternal-summer.html", "title": "\nEternal Summer\n"},

I want to listen to my music!\" \n\"I\"m sorry it's my turn today,\" I say calmly. \n \nHe doesn't like the music. \u00a0Fine...but if this were his dad's car, he would listen to it and not complain. \u00a0If anything, he may ask for it to be turned down. \u00a0He can only listen to his OWN music loudly. \n \nHe goes on and on for 20 minutes about the music. \u00a0He finally gets off of that trip and starts talking about juvenile delinquents, jail, juvenile hall and cops. \u00a0Not a conversation I want to participate in. \u00a0I have to chime in periodically to set him straight because he doesn't know what he's talking about.  \n \nFrom there he goes on to \"Can we stop and get something to eat?\" over and over again. To which I reply, \"I am trying to get across town in time to pick up Harry before the groomers close.\" \u00a0 I have no plans of stopping for anything. \n \nEvery time Blue says anything...he tells him to, \"Shut up!\" Loudly...not acceptable. \u00a0Once he attempts hitting him. \u00a0Not acceptable. \u00a0Traffic stops abruptly. \u00a0I have to break hard in order to avoid hitting the car in front of me. \u00a0He screams, \"What the heck?!\" so loud that it distracts me. \u00a0I am ready to throw him out of the car at this point. \u00a0I tell him, \"This behavior \u00a0(the name calling and shut-ups) is going to get you grounded.\" \n \n\"I don't get grounded!\"  \n\"Oh really! \u00a0I will take the phone and you will loose the use of your computer.\" \n\"I'm bigger than you mom. \u00a0You can't  make  me do anything!\"  \nSounds like a threat to me.  \n\"Oh my dear...you have it seriously twisted! \u00a0I can cut off the electricity to your room. \u00a0I do not need you for anything. \u00a0You need me. \u00a0You are going to learn the hard way that you can not disrespect me and then expect things from me. \u00a0I will not be stopping to BUY you anything to eat. \u00a0In fact...I will not be preparing anything for you for dinner. \u00a0You better ask someone who you haven't disrespected to help you with your dinner tonight. \u00a0As far as I'm concerned...you can starve!\" \n \nWe get to the groomer. \u00a0I go inside to get the dog. \u00a0Red curses at his brother while I am inside. \u00a0Blue gets out of the car. \u00a0He doesn't want to hear this language. \u00a0Red locks him out of the car. \u00a0When I return, the door is still locked. \u00a0He just sits there and looks at me at first. \u00a0He slowly decides to unlock the door. \u00a0This is the straw! I rip him a new one when I get back in. \u00a0I keep my voice low...but I let him know that I am completely done with him. \u00a0He had better not ask me for one single thing until I see some serious changes in his behavior. \u00a0Nothing! \n \n\"I don't know what's wrong with me. \u00a0It must have something to do with the way I came out when I was born. \u00a0You know when I wasn't breathing at first,\" he says pathetically. \n \n Oh give me a break!  \u00a0\"What is wrong with you has nothing to do with that. \u00a0You are making conscious choices! \u00a0You chose to curse at him as soon as I got out of the car so that I wouldn't hear you. \u00a0That was a calculated decision. \u00a0The F bomb didn't accidentally fall out of your mouth! \u00a0 OMG...I tripped and all of these curse words just fell right out of my mouth! \u00a0I don't know how that happened!  \u00a0It was a CHOICE! As is a lot of your behavior!\" \n \nThis isn't Aspergers behavior. \u00a0This is bratty, teenage boy behavior...pure and simple.  \n \nWhen we get home, I quickly give my mother a brief synopsis of what happened. I warn them that I don't want to see or hear from anyone for at least one hour. \u00a0That's right my friends...a mommy time-out. I suggest that Blue go to his room. \u00a0He also needs to decompress.  \n \nI close my door and lock it. \u00a0I am nearly in tears at this point. \u00a0I cuddle up with my computer. \u00a0I have some pretty amazing Aspergers moms who encourage me an offer support on my\u00a0 Facebook Community Page . \u00a0They are my heroes. \n \nMy Facebook status reads: \n \n\"I could just cry right now! I just had a 45 minute ride from hell with my boys. \u00a0My door is locked! Mommy is in a 1 hour time out.\" \n \n Sharon says, \"Did you remember to get a bottle of wine before you closed the door?\" \n\u00a0 \nI did not remember the wine. \u00a0I am sitting there contemplating how I can get a glass without anyone seeing or talking to me. \n \nElena says, \"Call your mom and tell her to sneak the wine to you...then wrap yourself in a blankie...visualize words that describe your loving nature written all over the blankie...an angel will bring them to you because you are a loving person and angels only brings words of goodness and love...(yeah, I sound like a lunatic...oh well...but I do believe) much love to you...you are our angel..xo\" \n \nElena's comment makes me laugh and cry. \u00a0All of their love and support brought tears to my already soggy eyes. \u00a0I wish that we could all escape together and go out for drinks!

Of course the medicine helps tremendously! Blue is so compassionate and he really seems to care about my feelings. \u00a0He may say things that come across as rude or blunt...but if I bring it to his attention, he will apologize and then actually try to do better the next time.  \n \nDuring our time together, he will not let me go through a door without opening it for me and holding it for any other ladies in sight. \n \nHe is an adamant rule follower. \u00a0I am not. \u00a0I skirt around rules that I feel are not important or inconvenient. \u00a0I can't get him to join the rule skirting party to save my life. \u00a0We are on a side street on our way to a pizza joint for lunch. \u00a0I decide to cross the street in the shade instead of walking to the crosswalk.  \n \n\"Mom! \u00a0You're jay-walking! \u00a0You can't do that!\"  \n\"Oh come on! \u00a0It's shady over here. \u00a0Besides, there are no cars coming.\"  \nHe ignores me and goes to the cross walk. \u00a0 Pushes the button and waits for the light to change. \n \nLater that day, we stop at the groomer to pick up the dog. \u00a0It's 100 plus degrees. \u00a0The groomer is about to close in five minutes. \u00a0There are no other customers in the parking lot. \u00a0In fact, we are the last ones to pick up our dog. \u00a0I know this. \u00a0I park in the handicap spot...in the shade. \u00a0I don't even turn off the car so that the air-conditioning can continue to run while I run in. \n \n\"Mom! This is the second law you have broken today!\" \nI guess I don't have to worry about this one ever going to jail...or even getting a ticket! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHere are some funnies from my\u00a0 Facebook Community Page : \n \nJoanne Lees says: \"Mum...why does Fiona have chickens?\" \n\"Because they lay eggs.\" \n\"Why doesn't she just go to the shop?\" \n \nSharon from  Mama's Turn Now \u00a0says: \n \nWhile arguing with Jay (my 10 year old Aspie) he says, \u00a0\"I'm done talking!\" \nI tell him, \"We are not done talking!\" \nHe says, \"I have the constitutional right not to talk!

We leave my car behind and he takes me to Pappadeaux, a New Orleans style seafood restaurant. \u00a0 We sit at the bar. \u00a0He has a beer. \u00a0I have a healthy pour of white wine. \u00a0We chat, watch sports, and have scrumptious appetizers...like real grown-ups. \u00a0This is a simple pleasure that feels like a luxurious indulgence because we don't get it often. \u00a0I am thankful for this moment. \n \nBeing the parents of two Aspie boys adds a lot of stress to our relationship. \u00a0You can loose your identity as a person and definitely as a couple. \u00a0 We have to work hard to avoid this pitfall.  \n \nWe come home and everyone is nearly asleep. \u00a0 The two of us stay up late ...watching a movie together. \u00a0Another thing that we just don't get to do often anymore. \u00a0Again -a simple pleasure that makes me realize that we can still enjoy each other as adults, as a couple ...as grown-ups. \n \n I really need your clicks for Top Mommy...my numbers are dropping into oblivion which is directly related to my identity and self-esteam :-D \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qlPTeZzkr8c/TgjPzFDRjfI/AAAAAAAAAPw/ZtCz4Zj2n50/s1600/IMAG0140.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/06/playing-grown-up.html", "title": "\nPlaying Grown Up\n"},

Lately, we are seeing more of the latter. \n \nI'm sure my neighbors all got a thrill from gossiping, wondering what the hell is going on in my house. \u00a0My mother peers out of the window as a few neighbors gather to talk. \u00a0She assumes it's about the yelling that's been coming from my house and \u00a0the two unmarked cars that pull up. \u00a0 I don't really give a shit what they think at this point. \u00a0I have to do what I have to do. \u00a0I have to deal with my reality --not with what the neighbors think about my reality. \n \nThe Mental Health deputy is great with him. \u00a0Thankfully, Red is not the belligerent out of control person who tore threw my house\u00a0moments earlier. \u00a0I can't believe this is happening, but it's been brewing for months. \u00a0The boy is growing more and more out of control. \u00a0He has good days, but we're all so exhausted from the bad days. \u00a0We're all on eggshells. \u00a0In our fragile box of chocolates, we never know what we're going to get. \u00a0I hate that the little one has to live with the rage and explosions. \u00a0The poor little anxious guy. \u00a0He has his own battles and challenges to get through on a daily basis. \u00a0 Luckily, these days he has friends to play with and go hang out with. \u00a0He can occasionally escape the madness. \n \nI am pretty cool throughout this process. \u00a0 I call Hubby away from  his  mental health break (an evening of basketball playoffs and beer) to come home to the craziness.  \n \nI have the urge to poor a glass of wine while they interview Red. \u00a0I decide it would be inappropriate. \u00a0 Ya think?? \u00a0\u00a0It wasn't until they left that I felt a knot in my stomach and found myself shaking uncontrollably. \u00a0I didn't feel like eating anything. \u00a0I finally poured myself that glass of calm...I mean wine. \n \nBefore leaving the Crisis Deputy hands Red his business card, and tells him if he needs anything to give him a call. \u00a0This kid pulls out his  own  business card and hands it to the guy. \u00a0He's networking for his video business. You just gotta love that! \u00a0We're all on the edge of insanity and he's drumming up business. \n \nThey didn't cart his ass away to the junior looney bin. \u00a0He presented as totally lucid. \u00a0Maybe he should be an actor. \u00a0He sure can pull it together when he needs to. Don't think for a minute that he was all roses and sunshine, \u00a0sorry for what he put us through the next morning. \u00a0He's still hating life at school --saying he just can't take it anymore!  \n \nHis doctor offered for me to have him go half-days until school is over. \u00a0I feel like I'd be rewarding this acting out. \u00a0He'd think...all I have to do is have a major meltdown to get out of school. \u00a0So that would be a no thank-you. \u00a0At the same time, I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. \u00a0I'm really not sure what to do. \u00a0I just know...there has to be a better way. \n \n I look forward to hearing your comments, thoughts and your Confessions: \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/05/desperate-times.html", "title": "\nDesperate Times...\n"},

I didn't give birth to him, so I can't take credit for his great looks. \u00a0However, \u00a0I did raise him from the time he was 5 years old. \u00a0He is my son. \u00a0I chose him. \u00a0I chose to marry a man who had a five-year-old active little boy, when I had no such baggage. \u00a0Yes, I say baggage, because of course, the 5 year-old son came along with an ex-wife, which almost always adds a little drama to a relationship. \u00a0Actually, I admired the fact that my then boyfriend, had risen to the challenge of being the custodial parent. \u00a0How many men do you know who fight for and win custody of their children? \u00a0He must be a good guy right? \n \nI was there for every important moment of his childhood. \u00a0I was there to nurse him through asthma, the flu, \u00a0scraped knees, a broken arm and a dislocated shoulder. \u00a0I was there for homework, last minute projects, talent shows, basketball and football practices and games. \u00a0I was there for the first broken heart in 5th grade when he couldn't stop crying for hours. \u00a0I was there for the second broken heart in high school when the older girl totally dissed him after her first semester in college. \u00a0I saw it coming a mile away, but it was still painful to watch. \n \nI was there when he crashed my brand new car into the side of the house when he was trying to hide his girlfriend's car in our garage, so that her crazy mother wouldn't know she was at our house. \u00a0I was there when he got arrested for pure stupidity. \u00a0I \u00a0was there when we payed the lawyer to prove that he hadn't done anything illegal...just stupid. \u00a0This was at expense of the new kitchen floor that I was about to get, until we spent the money on his freedom.  \n \nI was there at graduation from high school and for the first year at the University that we paid dearly for, only to find out later that our money had been waisted. \u00a0After football season was over, he barely went to class. \u00a0Instead he stayed up all night playing video games and chasing skirts (very short, skanky, skirts). \n \nWe were there to buy the first car that was hit and damaged beyond repair. \u00a0We were there to help buy the second car, so that he could get to work and to the community college, to make up for the classes he failed at the university. \u00a0 \n \nI was there to say good-bye as he went off to boot camp when he joined the Army National Guard, after his dad had walked him through the process of \u00a0joining the Air Force. \u00a0I was very proud as he finished boot camp and started over again as an ROTC student at another local university. \u00a0 \n \nI was always there to listen, to give advice, to discipline, to get his father to day \"yes\", to support him and love him as though my blood runs through his veins. \n \nI did all of this only to be slapped in the face and disappointed over and over and over again. \u00a0 This is an open letter to my son Slim Shady: \n \n Dear Son, \n \n   \n You suck! You suck because you hurt your father over and over again when you lie to him \u00a0--when you ask for his advice and then refuse to take it.\u00a0 \n You suck because you fail to call, bring a flower or a card for my birthday. \u00a0 You don't show your face on Mother's Day. \u00a0I mean come on -you live 10 minutes from here.\u00a0 \n You suck because you don't \u00a0follow the stellar example of the man who raised you. \u00a0The man who is responsible and treats women with the utmost respect. \u00a0You don't stand on your own two feet. \u00a0Instead, you use women for what they can do for you. \u00a0Then you turn around and disrespect them by using offensive language to communicate with them. \u00a0You do this in front of your 15 year-old, impressionable brother. \n   \n You suck because you know that both of your brothers have disabilities and could use the love, \u00a0support and example of a big brother, yet you're too busy to take any time for them. \u00a0You can't take them out to shoot hoops, go to the gym to work out or toss a ball at the park. \u00a0These things are free! \n   \n You really suck because when your brother was in the hospital last week, you didn't show up for a 15 minute visit or make a 5 minute phone call. \u00a0This tops everything! \n \n   \n This isn't to say you haven't accomplished anything. \u00a0I was always proud of your grades throughout your school years. \u00a0 \n I was always proud of how well-mannered you were with your teachers and other adults.\u00a0 \n I was always proud of your discipline on the football field. \n I am proud that you are back in college working on your education. \n \n \n At the same time you disappoint me on so many levels, I've actually lost count. \n \n   Congratulations, you are finally featured on my blog. \n \n   \n I love you always. \u00a0I \u00a0can't wait for the day that you rise to the occasion and become the independent, strong, \u00a0family-oriented man, \u00a0that we raised you to be. \n \n   \n Love Mom, \n \n   \n p.s.

We all prayed that he wouldn't get wound up each evening as we were all winding down with extreme fatigue. \n \nFor months I've been frustrated with the medication process. \u00a0The trial and error. \u00a0Adding this, taking away that. \u00a0Nothing making things better, some making things worse. \u00a0The last medication change seemed to make him more agitated than ever. \u00a0I wanted a clean slate. \u00a0A clean canvas to paint on, to add each color one layer at time until we had just the right mix --the work of art that I know he can be. \u00a0I wanted a clear picture of what is really going on inside that body and that mind of his. \u00a0Is this Aspergers? \u00a0Is there something more? \u00a0I wanted answers. \u00a0I wanted something to help him, to help all of us. \u00a0I wanted a miracle. \u00a0To find it we would have to do something drastic. \n \nI didn't want to make these changes in a hospital setting, yet I was too worn out to fight the inevitable. \u00a0When the aggression became physically dangerous, when there was damage to our home, threats to my younger son and physical posturing towards me...I knew I had no choice. \u00a0 When the raging late at night put all so on edge that we could not sleep a wink all night. \u00a0I realized...something had to give. \u00a0We all have the right have peace in our home. \u00a0We could not allow one person's mental issues to hold us all hostage. \n \nWho ever thought I would have to make such a torturous decision? \u00a0It certainly is not a part of any dream I have for my children. \u00a0Of course I never dreamed that high school would be a place of pain and anguish for my child. \u00a0I just assumed I would have a \"Cosby\" family full of happy children, whom I would love, nurture and push to their highest potential. \u00a0None of that dream included therapy and medications during their adolescent years.  \n \nHe couldn't talk his way out of this one. \u00a0This time, the doctor and an evaluation team made the decision to put him in a safe environment so that we could make the necessary changes to his medication to help him.  \n \nI kept my head held high as we walked through this process but my body and my brain were a scrambled mess. \u00a0I had to keep moving through it and keep moving through the day's details. \u00a0Soon the emotions and fatigue would catch up with me. \n \nA few weeks ago...I dreamed of a white padded room. \u00a0I think then I knew, if something didn't change soon, that is where I would end up. \n \nTo be continued... \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u5d7CdoH-CI/TdNG61MMyzI/AAAAAAAAANQ/5tfHlZOr7Qk/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/05/i-had-dream-this-wasnt-it.html", "title": "\nI Had a Dream & This Wasn't It\n"},

Great! I'm excited at the prospect of this.  \n \nI start making phone calls. \u00a0I am given the run around by the program I am most interested in. \u00a0\"We don't have any space right now, but you are next on our list. \u00a0We will call you tomorrow.\" blah blah blah! I finally get an appointment with another one of the referrals. \u00a0We go for an evaluation. \u00a0They show me around, I'm not super impressed with their so-called evaluation process. \u00a0They basically have me sign a few papers, ask him some general questions and then ask me for my portion of the payment.  \n \nHe is super anxious about this. \u00a0He's telling me all the reasons why he doesn't need to do this. \u00a0\"I can just go back to my school. \u00a0Everything was fine at my school. \u00a0I'm not going to like this!\"  \u00a0Everything was fine at my school!?

To top it all off, it's a PMS week. \u00a0My nerves are seriously fried.\u00a0I finagle getting Blue to school by the skin of my teeth. \u00a0I get on the highway with Red. \u00a0He's driving me completely batty with the complaining.  \n \n\"Why are you doing this mom?\" \n\"Why can't I just go back to my school? \u00a0There was nothing wrong with my school?\" \n\"Why is there so much traffic. \u00a0It's ridiculous for us to drive down here in all of this traffic!\" \n\"You will just do anything to get me out of the house won't you? \u00a0You just hate me don't you?\" \n \nI try to tune him out. \u00a0I have gone back and forth with him long enough. \u00a0I stop answering. \u00a0I'm trying to focus on the traffic, trying to listen to the navigation system, and he's freaking screeching in my ear! He goes from screeching to a loud piercing scream...while I'm driving! \u00a0I loose it! \u00a0Screaming while I'm driving + PMS = recipe for getting cursed out. \n \n\"Have you lost your f-ing mind? \u00a0Do you want me to crash this damn car?

I do EVERYTHING! \u00a0Yes...it would be easier to send you back to your high school to put your ass on the bus and just let you go crazy there so you can end up back at the hospital! \u00a0Maybe I should just get off the highway right now and drive you straight to the hospital myself!!!\" \n \nI swear I wanted to just drive the freakin' car right into the median -drive off a cliff if I could find one \"Thelma and Louise\" style! \n \nHe looks at me as if I am from Mars. \u00a0He calmly says, \"Well you don't have to get so mad? \u00a0See mom, I'm not the only one who looses it.\" \u00a0He gets quiet. \u00a0Five minutes later he says, \"I'm sorry.\"  Ya think! \u00a0You should be sorry!

Where are we going to take him? \u00a0He has to get on an airplane this summer and visit his family. \u00a0We still have doors to replace that have been thrashed. \u00a0Vacation my ass! \n \n\"I didn't buy that Six Flags Season pass for nothing! \u00a0I have to go to another Six Flags this summer,\" he says. \n\"What do you think I'm going to sit around all summer and be bored!?\" \n\"You don't understand!\" \n \nThis is said in a loop with slight variation over and over and over again. \n \nSummer vacation plans are so far on the back burner, they can not be seen with the naked eye. \u00a0They have evaporated! \u00a0Poof! Up in smoke. \n \nOne of the gay male nurses sees him beginning to rant. \u00a0He calls me over to go over some imaginary paperwork, just to get me away from him. \u00a0I fall in love with this guy with his pink t-shirt and pink sparkly wrist watch --his prance across the room so much sexier than my own. \u00a0Five minutes later Red comes over and interrupts us to get back in to his frivolous, manic conversation. \u00a0My new nurse-friend tells him, \"Sweetie, I've been watching you riding your mom for the past 30 minutes. \u00a0This conversation isn't going anywhere, so you may as well sit down.\" \u00a0My hero! \n \nFinally, someone gets to see a little taste of what I deal with day after day. \u00a0This time, \u00a0Red is just so out of it, that he does not care that we are in public and that he has an entire waiting-room audience. \u00a0Notice, his father is also in attendance. \u00a0He is not directing his conversation to his father. \u00a0In fact, Dad is falling asleep. \u00a0He has been actually trying to work all day in-between the craziness. \u00a0 \n \nMeanwhile, I'm sitting there going crazy. \u00a0Electronic devices are not allowed in this secured area. \u00a0(You've got to be freakin' kidding me! \u00a0No cell phone, no Kindle, no laptop! How will I survive??!!) See where Red gets being spoiled? \n \nOne thing about having Aspergers, is that you really don't lie, at least not very well if you try. \u00a0When I try to get my kids to take our own candy or drinks into the movie theater. \u00a0They call it smuggling and they are really uncomfortable with not following the rules. \u00a0 I have to corrupt my own children into being sneaky in order to save a few bucks.  \n \nRed is completely honest throughout this evaluation process about what he has done. \u00a0He does throw in the fact that he really loves his family and would never do anything to hurt us. \u00a0\"I'm just feeling out of control,\" he says. \u00a0He also expresses sincere remorse for his actions. \u00a0The kid does have a good heart. \u00a0He just needs to work on controlling his behavior, these things don't come naturally to him. \n \nWe visit the floor where he will be staying. \u00a0All of the kids seem perfectly  normal (whatever that is) . \u00a0No one looks particularly sad, unhappy or mistreated. \u00a0They look like a typical bunch of teenagers hanging out walking around in socks, no shoes with laces. \u00a0Red complains that his bed looks uncomfortable. \u00a0\"The blankets are rough and there aren't enough pillows. \u00a0I sleep with 3 pillows on my bed. \u00a0These sheets feel like they're going to tear.\" \u00a0He is use to high thread count sheets. \u00a0(So spoiled). \n \n\"Well, it's not the Hilton baby. \u00a0This is a hospital. \u00a0If you want the comforts of home, you have to treat us like you want to be there,\" I say in the nicest tone I can muster.  \n \nIt isn't as bad as I had envisioned. \u00a0There are no \"crazy\" people running around talking to themselves \u00a0in straight jackets. \u00a0The are just kids...kids who have issues. \u00a0The youngest child there is 9 years-old. \u00a0They would be kept separately on the floor. \u00a0But still, there are\u00a0 kids  there! \u00a0(Poor babies.) \u00a0I knew that he would be alive when I returned the next day. \u00a0He wouldn't be mistreated. \u00a0He would be getting help and he would be o.k. \u00a0And so we say our good-byes. \u00a0 Talk about gut-wrenching. \u00a0I am too exhausted to fall apart. \u00a0We go home and I crash...hard. \n \nThe following day I come for a meeting with the Social Worker and a visit. \u00a0I pull into the parking lot, still \u00a0in disbelief of where I am and what I'm doing. \u00a0Whoever would have thought? \u00a0Certainly not me...not in my wildest dreams. \u00a0 I guess a lot of crap happens in life that wasn't apart of our happily-ever-after fantasy.  \n \nThe therapist asks how I am holding up. \u00a0\"What choice to I have? \u00a0I have to keep moving through it. \u00a0I have another child to take care of. \u00a0The stress is showing up in the form of fatigue.\" \u00a0My body hasn't been so tired since I was pregnant. \u00a0I have too many details to take care to slow down.  \n \nEach day Red gets better. \u00a0Meds are slowly taken away and new ones replace them. \u00a0He becomes more and more engaged in conversation and introspection each time I see him. \u00a0He admits to having a \"little\" fun watching the old P.G. and G movies from childhood with the other teens. \u00a0 He is a little bored, but he isn't miserable. \u00a0He lets me know that he is ready to get back home to his bed and his computer every chance he gets. \n \nI became hopeful that he would start to appreciate his blessings when he came home. \u00a0Every child doesn't have their own queen-sized bed, their own computer, a Blu-Ray movie collection, a video camera and software to make videos with. \u00a0Every kid doesn't have two parents who build their world around them, who will do anything to love and support them, to help them become all they can be. \u00a0Maybe there is hope. \n \nStill to be continued... \n \n Thank you all for your support and prayers during this difficult time. \u00a0We are getting through it. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/05/its-not-hilton.html", "title": "\nIt's Not the Hilton\n"},

He was so upset, he had to talk to someone. \u00a0He told his special ed. teacher everything. \u00a0Then they went to talk to Mr. D. the 6th Grade Principal. He did get lunch detention for 2 days. \u00a0 I think he should get leniency for telling on himself...but whatever! \u00a0I suppose he needs to learn to try to keep his cool and just get the other guy in trouble. \n \nAt the same time, these kids need to learn that he is the wrong one to mess with. \u00a0Yes...he may be a little geeky, smart, and not very athletic -but that doesn't give you the right to be mean and ugly to him.  \n \nBlue actually thought  he  was being the bully because he hit the kid and the kid had not hit him. \u00a0When he comes home from school he's really beating himself up about it. \u00a0I tell him, \"A bully messes with people for no reason at all. \u00a0Because he's having a bad day, or just because he's mean and he thinks he can get away with it. \u00a0You hit him for a reason. \u00a0You didn't just arbitrarily pick him out and go hit him. \u00a0He was being mean to you and you reacted. \u00a0That is human. \u00a0That's not bullying.\" \u00a0 I had to tell him to take it easy on himself. \u00a0\"No one is upset about this anymore. \u00a0 We have all moved on.

Wow! Wouldn't it be nice to be young and in love, having fun with no responsibilities?! \" I guess I have to get my fix of that by going to the movies. \u00a0Real life is no romantic comedy! At least not these days. \n \n Instead of writing about the depressing subject I call my life, I thought we would lighten things up a bit. \u00a0On my\u00a0 Facebook Community Page \u00a0friends, Aspergers moms, dads and a few Aspies \u00a0stop by, hang out, chime in on discussions and even share funny stories. \u00a0I thought I would share one of them here. \n \nElena who has 3 children (one with Aspergers) writes: \n \u00a0 Please tell me if this is a normal conversation... cuz I feel like I'm losing it:   \n \n \n \"how was your day cutie?\" \n \"great, my teacher said I behaved beautifully...

{"date": "Saturday, May 28, 2011", "body": "\n It's been so peaceful around here it's kind of eerie. \u00a0I know that I should just be grateful for the peace. \u00a0I should put out positive energy and thoughts that it will continue. \u00a0However, history has put a little cloud over my PollyAnna outlook on life. \u00a0We usually get about 5 good days and then all hell breaks loose. \n \nThings haven't been shall we say --perfect. \u00a0That would really be weird. \u00a0We took a trip to Walmart the other day. \u00a0Red walks out pouting like a toddler because we didn't buy him anything other than food. \u00a0At this point, that's all I think I owe him \u00a0-the basic necessities of life. \n \n\"My life is terrible! \u00a0I'm so bored! \u00a0I never get anything that I want,\" he says as we walk to the car. \n\u00a0To which I respond, \"You're life would be terrible if you were living under a bridge, with no food to eat.\" \n\"Well...that's probably where I'll end up,\" he says. \n\"I guess you should prepare yourself for it now, \" I say. \u00a0\"Get used to not having anything, because if you are not willing to work for what you want, that's what you'll have --nothing.\" \n \nThe pouting ends shortly after we get home and his younger brother continues the reality check.\u00a0Blue, \u00a0the bossy, teacher that he is says, \u00a0\"You can't yell and scream at Mom to get what you want. \u00a0You're not making any sense. \u00a0That's not the way things work!\" Red actually listens for a change. \n \nIt's hard to say what it is. \u00a0Are the new meds working their magic? \u00a0Or is it the lack of stress for him? School is essentially over and he's been spending a lot of time here at home. \u00a0I pulled him from the program he was in. \u00a0They were not communicating with me. \u00a0They essentially pulled a bate and switch, not providing all of the services that they sold me on. \u00a0 I found myself more stressed than ever trying to get him there on time and get Blue to school on time as well.  \n \nWe've had little to no screaming for several days now. \u00a0He seems to be grasping the fact that we are not going to buy him anything. \u00a0He has to earn whatever he wants. \u00a0No...he doesn't have a job per se -but he has to do chores to earn money. \u00a0He now realizes that he has to pay for the doors that he damaged. \u00a0To make that task seem less overwhelming and defeating, in a therapy session a few days ago, we agree that he can keep half of his chore money and half will go towards his debt for the doors.  \n \nYesterday, \u00a0he puts away and washes dishes, and helps me with some work outside in the yard. \u00a0He also barters a deal where he sells me his old video camera for $50.00. \u00a0He gets to keep 25 and 25 goes towards his debt. \u00a0This morning the first words out of his mouth are, \"Can I do any chores today?\" \n \nBlue and Red have actually been getting along for two days now --knock wood! I have been just exhausted for some strange reason. \u00a0I think my body is depressed. \u00a0While I nap the other day, the two of boys hang out together in Red's room. \u00a0This hasn't happened I think, this entire year! Like I said, eerie! \n \nNow...he is still talking incessantly. \u00a0He really has to work on listening during a conversation and not talking over people. \u00a0Watching a movie with him is a nightmare. \u00a0The questions come flying out of his mouth, loudly, non-stop. \u00a0I can't do it. \u00a0I have to leave the room or drink heavily. \u00a0At least he's trying to make an effort to hang out with his family. \u00a0I think he is figuring out...we are the one's who love him. \u00a0We are the best friends he has. \n \n Thank you for your click below to support the blog: \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nmcAgeLoApo/TeFM5LXvWFI/AAAAAAAAANk/lfz5R_QzJ94/s1600/Unknown.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/05/waiting-for-shoe-to-drop.html", "title": "\nWaiting for the Shoe to Drop\n"},

Veterans Day. \u00a0\"Aren't they basically the same thing?\" asks Blue. \u00a0\"So is Memorial Day more important?\" \u00a0My husband was busy giving this matter of fact explanation that just sounded wrong to me...even though he is a Veteran of  Operation Desert Storm . \u00a0Of course, I couldn't accuse him of being inaccurate without having the facts.  \n \nI pull out my handy dandy Android phone and look it up so that I can give the official, correct answer. \u00a0And so it goes...Veterans Day is the day we remember and pay tribute to  all who have served our country in the armed forces.  \u00a0 Memorial is the day we remember those who have actually  fallen  in service to our country in the armed forces.  \u00a0 My husband served, and my eldest son is serving now. \u00a0We thank them and the rest of the members of our family for their service. \u00a0They are honored on Veterans Day. \u00a0Today, we \u00a0give thanks, remembrance and honor to those who have lost their lives in this service.  \n \nThe moral of this story...Mommy is always right! :-D \n \n **************************************** \nThis morning, Blue and Dad decide they want to go to the movies --an activity that they usually reserve to do alone together, which is just fine with me. \u00a0This time...they invite me and Red to join them. \u00a0I seriously wanted to decline, \u00a0and spend he day reading my book, or doing a little art project. \u00a0I felt the family obligation to go with them. \u00a0Red, hemmed and hawed and tried to find excuses not to go. \u00a0We usually just go with that, because ultimately, he ruins the outing for everyone. \u00a0Today, Blue decides not to take no for an answer.  \n \n\"I don't want you to stay at home and be bored all by yourself.\" \u00a0This is huge for brothers who just came to blows the night before. \u00a0I tell you that Blue should be considered for sainthood. \n \nOff we go...the whole clan on our way to see \"Kung Fu Panda\" Woo hoo! \u00a0NOT! \u00a0Somehow, I end up sitting next to Red. \u00a0He just can't help pouncing on me with a barrage of questions and menial complaints. \u00a0Dad rescues me...we switch seats. \u00a0The first five-minutes of the movie Red, wants to walk out. \u00a0This is not his kind of movie. \u00a0He's more of a  Transformers,  or I ron Man,  kind of guy. \u00a0Hell, I'm more of a  Water \u00a0for Elephants  kind of girl, but I'm there with my family. \n \nRed finally settles down and so do I, into a nice afternoon snooze! \u00a0That's right...I sleep right through the entire movie. \u00a0At least I wasn't complaining! I wake up just in time for the ending where two characters are embracing and saying, \"You're my dad.\" \u00a0Red breaks out in tears...real crocodiles. \u00a0Dad has to comfort him for several minutes. \u00a0He says, he feels bad because he doesn't always appreciate his dad. \u00a0I think ultimately, he really enjoyed the movie. \n \nWe all go afterward to 31 Flavors. \u00a0Ice cream makes everything better. \u00a0Except, Mommy can no longer do ice cream, because it tears her stomach apart. \u00a0Oh well...I guess I have to have a margarita instead. \u00a0Cheers! \n \n If you enjoyed this post PLEASE click below to support the blog...thank you!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-35WJ9glbs0I/TeQ0cs6Ot_I/AAAAAAAAANo/dU-wvYX6UHw/s1600/images-2.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/05/memorial-day.html", "title": "\nMemorial Day\n"},

{"date": "Saturday, February 5, 2011", "body": "\n It seems like it's been forever since I've been on a date with my husband. \u00a0It hasn't been...it just  seems  like it. \u00a0He reminded me last night that we did go see \"The King's Speech\" a few weeks ago. \u00a0 For the past two weeks however, I've been wanting to go see the new Natalie Portman/Ashton Kutcher movie but it just hasn't worked out. \u00a0A romantic comedy that my husband actually wouldn't mind seeing. \u00a0He loves all things  Natalie Portman . \u00a0He even took me to see \" Black Swan,\"  so I guess I really should quit whining. \u00a0 \n \nI thought that the boys getting older would mean that we could go out all the time \u00a0-that having teenagers would mean that we don't need a babysitter. \u00a0Then my mom moved in with us last year. \u00a0I thought ' great...we can even spend the night out if we want to!' \n \nI didn't plan on the fact that having two teenagers on the autism spectrum would make for explosive fights that can break out at any given moment. \u00a0Therefore, it's not so simple to just leave them at home alone or even with their grandmother. \u00a0It was actually easier to leave them at home alone two years ago, than it is now that they are older. \u00a0They didn't fight as much then. \u00a0Now hormones have kicked in and the little one doesn't take any crap from the older one. \u00a0He will whack him upside the head in a heartbeat! \n \nThe last time I left them at home with their grandmother for just an hour...I came home to a whole in the wall. \u00a0\"It was Red's fault Mom,\" says Blue. \u00a0\"I'm sorry...but he made me so mad! He wouldn't get out of my room!\" \n \nNow what we have to do is arrange for one of them to be out of the house while we're gone. \u00a0Last night Blue went over to play with a friend in the neighborhood while we went out. \u00a0When we went to see the \"King's Speech\" a few weeks ago, he went to play with another friend. \u00a0Thank God at least one of them has the ability to maintain friendships. \n \n On this \"parents night\" we went to a concert to see Esperanza Spaulding -a wonderful bassist and jazz singer at quaint venue here in Austin called One World Theatre. \u00a0We love this venue because there is not a bad seat in the house. \u00a0It's a Tuscan styled mansion that is nestled on top of Barton Creek Hills with beautiful views of Austin. \u00a0Part of the mansion is converted into a concert hall that only seats about 250 people. \u00a0There is also reception hall and patio downstairs where you can have drinks and dinner beforehand. \u00a0They also rent if for weddings and events. The theater is a very intimate venue. \u00a0You get very up close and personal with the artist. \u00a0Our seats last night were 2nd row center. \u00a0(Not bad hubby! I think I'll renew his contract for another year.)  \n \nWe met our good friends at the concert and afterwards we went out for cocktails together. \u00a0It was great to remember what it feels like to be an adult \u00a0-a couple, sharing adult conversation about art, music, politics and Oprah's new half-sister.  \n \nIt is so important to remain connected as a couple. \u00a0It's easy to get lost in being parents of special needs children. \u00a0So many couples don't make it through the difficult process or raising high-maintenance kids. \u00a0These boys of ours desperately need  two parents in tact.  \u00a0 If we're going to make it, we have to keep our connection which means, 'Parents Night Out' has to be a big priority. \n \n Readers I love Your Comments! \u00a0I have this new comment thingy where I can actually respond to you via e-mail!\u00a0 \n \n \n You can vote for my blog daily with just a click: \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TU2jondRbhI/AAAAAAAAAG4/UCA53X5C7zU/s1600/IMAG0121.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/02/parents-night-out.html", "title": "\nParents Night Out\n"},

What am I supposed to eat? There's no food here!

I hate my life so that's why I'm being mean to you.\" \n \nIsn't that true of most people in the world? They are mean and ugly to people because of some pain or hurt they are feeling...because someone else hurt them in some way. \u00a0Only Red really doesn't have this awful life that he complains about. \u00a0He has two parents who love him and take care of him everyday. \u00a0I would say he doesn't want for anything...but he does. \u00a0He wants for everything even though he has so much. Still in his eyes -his life is horrible, or at least he loves saying that to us on a daily basis. \n \nHis father just went out and bought him a new game last week. \u00a0He said he was \"buying some peace.\" \u00a0It's a flight simulator game. \u00a0It did buy us peace for a couple of days. \u00a0It kept him occupied so that he wouldn't focus on the negatives in his life.  \n \nFor a few days it was, \"The best game I've ever played!\" \n \nSoon that turned into, \"I Need HELP!\" \u00a0(Because he doesn't want to read the directions.) \n \nThen we move on to, \"I need to download such and such to make this game LOOK better!\" We don't have the basic functions of the game down, but we need to  add  something to it!? \n \nIn the middle of dad working on a contract or a conference call in his home office he interrupts, \"Daaaad! I need these add ons!\" \n \nOr when dad comes in from a long day and he's trying to relax for a moment, \"I need you to help me NOW!\" \n \nSo much for peace. \u00a0When I see that dad is fuming -I check him on that. \u00a0\"You are not showing appreciation for what your father has done for you. He didn't  have  to go out and buy you that game. \u00a0And here you are just days later finding a way to complain about it. Do you think maybe that makes him sorry that he bought it? \u00a0Do you think that makes him want to help you or buy things for you in the future? Hmm...he had to think about that one! \n \nIt pains me that he is so miserable that he has to try to make those of us who love him feel his pain constantly. \u00a0 I feel bad for him, but sometimes it's such a downer to be around the constant negativity. \u00a0I really feel sorry for his little brother who can't tune him out very easily. \u00a0It's hard to stay positive\u00a0especially when it seems like the more you try to do for him, the more he complains. \u00a0He's like a bottomless pit --a black hole. \n \nI get that he has yet to develop many friendships, especially at school. \u00a0He talks everyday about wanting a girlfriend. \u00a0He says he wants a group of friends to hang out with, but he hasn't been able to make that happen. \u00a0I'd be happy if he had just one or two positive friends who love and accept him for the way he is. \u00a0I pray that in due time, that will happen for him. \n \n \n \nIn the mean time we love and support him the best way we can. \u00a0Even though most of the time, he is NO fun to be around. \u00a0There is so much love and positive energy in this family, but he can enter a room and just suck the life right out of it. \n \n \n \n \n- I took this picture of Red on one of those mornings when I was dropping him off for school. \u00a0I got him out of the car by telling him how handsome he looks in the leather jacket handed down from his uncle to his dad, and now to him. \u00a0He is handsome just like all of the men in our family. \u00a0\"No I'm not. \u00a0I'm ugly! That's why I don't have a girlfriend!\" No my dear... being  ugly is not the problem. \u00a0 Acting  ugly...???  Fortunately,  t hat is something you can change . \n \n \n Readers...I love, love, love your comments!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n Show me some love...click above. \u00a0Give me an ego boost by moving me up in the ranks. ^^^^ \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Xy7cqLMi-7M/TVVjvE5ALiI/AAAAAAAAAHM/t4C4StVqmV0/s1600/IMAG0115.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/02/downside-of-anger.html", "title": "\nDownside of Anger\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 8, 2011", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nWhy should students participate in their ARD meetings? That was the question on the table at a session of the Teachers Improvement Conference in our school district. \u00a0Blue was a presenter.  \n \n*\u00a0(Here in Texas I.E.P. are called ARD meetings. Everything is different in Texas!) \n \nFor the first time last year in 5th Grade, Blue not only participated in his ARD (admissions, dismissal, review) meeting...he ran the meeting. \u00a0He did the introductions. \u00a0He ran through the agenda. \u00a0Via Power Point presentation, he told us all about his strengths and the things he needs help with. \u00a0He told us about his concerns about going to middle school. \u00a0He participated in setting his goals and listened when we talked about his accommodations. \u00a0It was all about him! \u00a0Six adults were sitting in a room to talk about the plan for  his  education for the next year.  \n \n \n \n \n \nAt the conference Blue\u00a0had the opportunity to inform a room full of teachers about what the experience meant to him. \u00a0The point was to encourage these teachers to get their students involved in their own 'Powerful ARD' \u00a0meetings. \u00a0He said he loved the fact that the meeting was all about him. \u00a0It made him feel important and it helped him feel better about going to middle school. \u00a0The Special Education Lead from the middle school attended his ARD meeting. \u00a0At the end of the meeting she addressed all of his concerns about middle school. \n \nBlue presented at this year's conference alongside the Special Education Lead Teacher from his elementary school, (whose brilliant idea it was to have him involved in his ARD) and two peers, another 6th grader and a 3rd grader. \u00a0All of the boys have high-functioning autism. \u00a0Blue and his 6th grade friend were particularly articulate and appeared to love being charming and speaking in front of the crowd. \u00a0The boy who was in the 3rd grade had participated in his ARD mostly by making a movie so that he didn't have to worry about being nervous in front of a room full of adults. \u00a0He showed us parts of his movie during the presentation. \u00a0Apparently he is a major fan of Star Wars, as he used the theme music and graphics from the movie in his movie. \u00a0It was awesome. \n \n \n \n \nThe parents were also asked to speak briefly. \u00a0I told the group how having him participate and be involved in his ARD gave him a sense of empowerment and ownership in his education process. \u00a0He knows his diagnosis and how it effects him. \u00a0Last year, he started feeling really bad about himself asking, \u00a0\"Why am I different? What's wrong with me? Why do I get so angry?\" We had the talk and went through a workbook together. \u00a0 We were able to turn what was a negative concept in his mind into a positive by giving him the knowledge and helping him focus on his  gifted abilities , instead of his areas of difficulty. \n \nThis helped him prepare for the process of \u00a0being involved in his ARD \u00a0process. \u00a0He now knows exactly what he needs and he has no problem letting teachers know that. \u00a0It helped him have the confidence to go right into middle school and let the teachers know exactly who is is, \u00a0what he needs and what his accommodations are. \u00a0The very first day he was like, \"Hi I'm Blue...did you know I have autism?\" He also has no problem letting other students know. \u00a0He wants them to understand his differences. \n \nIt seemed like the elective teachers were the slowest to get it. \u00a0He also had a few little issues with his math teacher at first. \u00a0I think that teachers look at his grades, \u00a0his test scores and the way he speaks and presents himself and they think,  'This kid is bright . \u00a0 Why he can't do things just like everybody else?' \n \nHis disability is invisible. \u00a0They don't always take into account his extreme anxiety, or the way he can misinterpret social situations and even instructions. \u00a0Sometimes he just gets overwhelmed and can be unorganized. \u00a0He may become distracted by another child making some annoying noise, or by the weather for heaven's sake, and completely loose focus. \u00a0He may need extra time to complete an assignment. \u00a0He just may not make it through homework if he's had a particularly stressful day, especially if there are multiple assignments. \u00a0Just forget about it if you yell at him, or make him feel embarrassed in front of the whole class. \u00a0You will loose him completely. \n \nBecause he knows what he needs and what teachers should be doing to help him, he will readily let them know when they are not following his individual education plan. \u00a0If he is afraid or too intimidated to talk to them directly, he will go to his SPED tracking teacher and talk to her, or he comes to me and I send an email. \u00a0Sometimes we sit down and have a chat with the teacher he is having an issue with. \n \nIn attendance at the session of the conference was the Transition Coordinator for Special Education in our district. \u00a0She was touched so deeply by the boys presentation that she had a John Boehnor moment...tears flowing, though she tried to hold them back. \u00a0She told us how important it was for her to change the system in our district. \u00a0She feels it's imperative to make the children's needs a priority. \u00a0She believes that having the children and their parents involved in their educational process is imperative. She told us about a parent she met at another conference who had always insisted on having her child involved in his ARDS from the time he was 3 years-old. \u00a0That student now attends Yale.  \n \nAs we were leaving, \u00a0we walked through the campus full of teachers and administrators, suddenly I could see my boy becoming not just a teacher, but a counselor or an administrator who knows inside and out what students need to be successful in the classroom. \u00a0Perhaps someday he will become a leader who will make sure that Special Education students definitely get what they need. \u00a0He will know from his own educational experience. \n \nI mean why not? At the age of 11, he is his own advocate and he loves to help others. \u00a0He makes me a proud and\u00a0 hopeful  mama! \n \n \n \n \n \nBlue And His friends...yes they are twins \n \n \n \n \n Readers...I LOVE YOUR COMMENTS!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Show Some Love...Click Above! ^ \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TVLV7LbLqZI/AAAAAAAAAG8/YBBy2MzQRao/s1600/images-1.jpeg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TVL0YXCULaI/AAAAAAAAAHA/32eJwIAIXvs/s1600/present2.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TVL0b48yMdI/AAAAAAAAAHE/vuW7YMgg25s/s1600/presentation.JPG", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TVL3wyTC-YI/AAAAAAAAAHI/3RRv_rzmkhQ/s1600/Colefriends.JPG"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/02/autism-students-training-teachers.html", "title": "\nAutism Students Training Teachers\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 12, 2011", "body": "\n I woke up this morning thinking about my last post. \u00a0They say when you put something personal on the internet you should think about it at least three times before you publish it. \u00a0Well...I thought about it twice and published it anyway. \u00a0This blog is my reality. \u00a0Why should I hide any of my truth? \n \n \nHere's what I wrote in\u00a0 Downside of Anger \n \n\"Red comes down the stairs with a scowl on his face. \u00a0He grits his teeth and starts being ugly to everyone. \u00a0I'm cooking dinner.\u00a0I have no wine...I'm trying not to drink vodka martinis during the week. \u00a0There's a bottle of champagne in the fridge. \u00a0I have to make due with a glass of that.\" \n \nSo my thought this morning was...people may think I'm an alcoholic. \u00a0 If you have a drink to take the edge off of your nerves when your children are being obnoxious and stressing you out...does that make you an alcoholic? If you only have one drink but you feel the  need  for it does that make you an alcoholic? \n \nWell, the truth is I have a few vices. \u00a0Am I alone in this? \u00a0I don't think so. \u00a0I can choose on any given day or night what my vice will be? \u00a0Will cookies be my self-medication? \u00a0Will it be piece of lemon-pie? \u00a0Maybe a brownie or two -but not more than two. \u00a0Will it be a glass of wine? \u00a0Or a Z-Tejas margarita? We can't forget the shrimp tostada bites to go with it. \u00a0Oh -I got it! \u00a0I'll go shopping. \u00a0A good bargain found at TJMaxx is excellent stress relief.  \n \nWhen there is time available I go to Zumba class (Latin dance exercise). \u00a0Yoga is another great way to release stress. \u00a0Deep cleansing breaths, stretching and meditation is a great way to clear your mind and forget your worries. \u00a0The latest thing I've been doing is going to art lessons. \u00a0I paint -mostly abstract. \u00a0I just play with color on canvas. \u00a0It's a divine hour of peace.  \n \nThese healthy stress relievers are not always readily available. \u00a0When children are fighting I can't always run out the door to go to Yoga. \u00a0In the middle of homework and cooking dinner -I can't break out and start painting. \u00a0Half the time I miss Zumba because Red makes me late, and if you don't get there early -there are no spots left. \n \nPeople in my family drink. \u00a0We love good food and a good cocktail. \u00a0We love a good party and we give plenty of them. \u00a0When I was a teenager, I used to call my mother an alcoholic because she drank almost daily. \u00a0I never saw her drunk. \u00a0She functioned well. We went to church 3 days a week (in hindsight -maybe that's why she drank on the off days.) \u00a0She took \u00a0damn good care of us by herself. \u00a0We never had a hungry day. \u00a0We had nice clothes on our backs and a roof over our head.  \n \nAs much as we try not to turn into our parents...somehow we do. \u00a0At the same time, \u00a0I try to have, \u00a0and subsequently  give \u00a0to my own children a little more than I received as a child. \u00a0Where my mother drank several glasses of wine daily \u00a0--I have one (o.k. maybe two). \u00a0Where my parents broke up and I had a single mother \u00a0--I have remained married to my spouse through good times and the not so good. \u00a0I want them to have both of their parents involved in their daily lives. \u00a0We've been married 17 years and counting. \n \nI exercise as often as I can. \u00a0Whereas I watched my mother and my grandmother battle with being overweight there entire lives. \u00a0I refuse to go there \u00a0--or at least all the way there. \u00a0 O.K so I'm not the size 6 \u00a0that I was before I had babies, but I'm holding steady at a size 10.  \n \nI probably get the active gene from my dad. \u00a0He was and is  still \u00a0very active. \u00a0He's 82 years-old. \u00a0He walks daily and he doesn't miss a jazz concert at the Hollywood Bowl or anywhere in L.A. for that matter. \u00a0He too was a drinker \u00a0--or I should say a partier, until he was diagnosed with diabetes. \u00a0Then he cut back to the occasional beer.  \n \nThe bottom line I guess is that we all have stress. \u00a0And we find ways to deal with it and to minimize it since we can't totally eliminate it. \u00a0There are good ways, there are not so good ways. \u00a0I do what I can do given the resources I have available in the moment. \u00a0If it happens to be a Yoga class --Namaste. \u00a0If it happens to be a martini --cheers! \n \n BTW...doesn't the martini above look yummy?! I think I'll have one now!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nReaders I LOVE Your Comments! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2x61hLVUJ8A/TVdGMdVfLFI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/5Cn9hcBIrVw/s1600/pomegranite+martini.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/02/self-medication.html", "title": "\nSelf Medication\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 15, 2011", "body": "\n I really hate the whole commerciality of Valentines Day. \u00a0I have this vision of retailers salivating at the thought of getting some of our money. \u00a0 You have the cheesy jewelry commercials. \u00a0Flowers and balloons are everywhere! \u00a0The mailbox is full of ads. \u00a0I just think... what kind of suckers do they think we are?  We don't need any freakin' gifts for Valentines Day. \u00a0For heaven's sake, Al and I have been married for 17 years. \u00a0I know he loves me and I love him. \u00a0We don't need to go spend money to prove it. \n \nLast year I made him a picture for Valentines Day. \u00a0It was in oil pastel \u00a0--two golden hearts linked together. \u00a0 I mean doesn't that say it all? \u00a0No money spent...bam! \u00a0Here it is. \u00a0I can't even remember if he bought me anything. \u00a0I'm sure he bought flowers, and I'm sure I didn't cook. \u00a0We probably ordered in or something. \u00a0I can't even remember what we did for sure. \u00a0One year just runs into another when you've been married for so long.  \n \n \nI do however remember  making him something  with my own two hands. \u00a0It still hangs in our living room. \u00a0That's what this love day should be about. \u00a0Giving something you made -from your heart.  \n \n<< Here it is.  \n \nWell so much for that soapbox...today, we broke the rules. \u00a0He offered to take the afternoon off and take me to out to lunch. \u00a0(Cha-ching$$) So off we go to North a fancy Italian place in the Domain a fancy-smancy outdoor shopping center. \u00a0I have a calamari and arugula salad with some kind of lemon dressing...yum! \u00a0He has baked ziti. \u00a0Very fresh -delicious! \n \nAfter lunch we go for a walk through the outdoor shopping area. \u00a0Oops \u00a0--I forgot my sunglasses. \u00a0We go into Brighton and he buys me a new pair. (Cha-ching$$$) \u00a0My old ones have scratches on them. \u00a0They are overpriced. \u00a0I seldom buy anything that is not on sale. \u00a0But hey -it's Valentines Day. \u00a0He's feeling generous...I go for it. \u00a0Such a hypocrite! \n \nOn the way home we stop to pick up lunch for my mom and a special Valentine treat for Blue. \u00a0Since Red told me emphatically that he \"hates Valentines Day!\" \u00a0I wouldn't want him to benefit from a day that he hates. I mean...what an insult that would be. \u00a0After all, he just about cursed us out after we took him to his favorite restaurant for dessert last night.  \n \nWe break another rule and buy flowers for my mom before we head home. \u00a0(Cha-Ching$$) \n \n We arrive home and Blue has gone \"out for a walk.\" \u00a0He walked to Walgreens to buy me and Dad chocolates and a card. \u00a0I have 3 sons. \u00a02 of them are older, 22 and 15. \u00a0He is 12 and the 1ST to buy cards and gifts without prompting! \n \n \n \n \n So sweet! \u00a0So thoughtful!\u00a0 \nRed comes home and gives us the wonderful gift of a nice screaming rant about how much he hates Valentines Day. \"It's not even real! \u00a0It's just a fake holiday!\" \u00a0 He goes off to his room and proceeds to tell the facebook world \"F*#! Valentines Day!\" \u00a0We stop him just before he clicks post. \u00a0I tell him that he can express his negative feelings about the day without swearing.  \n \n\"What do you think your grandmother, your cousins, aunts and uncles will think about you if they read \u00a0language like that coming from you?\" \n \nOf course, he hadn't given that any thought. \u00a0He changes his mind, but continues to rant about how horrible his life is. \u00a0-Just Lovely! \n \nWhat a miserable existence -to feel so angry most of the time. \u00a0I ache for him --literally. \u00a0I will not however, let this completely ruin my day. \n \nFor the most part ...it really was a great Valentines Day.  \n \nI failed to mention my favorite part of the day: \n \nAs we walk through the shopping area we hear the Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta Song \"You're the One That I Want\". \u00a0Hubby and I are holding hands. \u00a0We break into full song and dance right there in the middle of the sidewalk like were in the musical \"Grease.\" \u00a0People are looking and smiling. \u00a0The spontaneity of that moment was priceless. \n \nThat moment, the card and especially the  thought  from Blue made it a nearly perfect Valentines Day, despite the fact that we made the local retailers happy. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uJxXmDPLYlE/TVoCWdVrf6I/AAAAAAAAAHo/uRhHmLDuF8s/s1600/IMAG0140.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FGipmcbCpJ4/TVoEbHBq3LI/AAAAAAAAAHs/4231Itxw_ig/s1600/IMAG0142.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZpNDLHqxtyA/TVoEekWjPoI/AAAAAAAAAHw/VQ3zdo3BodU/s1600/IMAG0143.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/02/commercial-love-day.html", "title": "\nCommercial Love Day\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 18, 2011", "body": "\n Today we celebrate Blue and the beginning of his 12th year of life. \u00a0There is much to celebrate as he has come such a long way over the past year. \u00a0You may be wondering why I refer to the boys as Red and Blue. \u00a0Well..when I started seriously blogging I thought the colors suited their personalities. \u00a0Red is the explosive like dynamite. \u00a0(Today is not his day so I'm not going to go in to detail about him.) Last year in 5th grade, Blue was very sad, anxious and kind of... Blue. \n \nHe started to feel different than his peers and he wasn't quite sure why. \u00a0He loathed the fact that his anxiety was so high -that he was deathly afraid of thunderstorms. \u00a0He felt defeated every time he had the compulsion to hide in the bathroom with fan, earplugs and IPod for hours on end. \u00a0He had frequent misunderstandings with classmates and sometimes with teachers. \u00a0P.E. was a nightmare with so many kids and so much noise.  \n \nIt made him sad when he would get angry and say mean things, and subsequently feel really bad about it afterward. \u00a0He couldn't control his anger. \u00a0He knew that some of his classmates thought he was a little \"weird\". \u00a0He tried desperately to please them and fit in. \u00a0He wanted to be funny like the popular boys so he tried to imitate them, but the kids didn't laugh. \u00a0 \u00a0  \n \n1 year and a small dosage of medication later, he has come into his own. \u00a0As he celebrates his 12th birthday, he has a 4.0 grade point average and has been invited to participate in some wonderful challenging classes and activities. \u00a0He now works well with his peers and has developed excellent leadership qualities. \u00a0He is still not in love with thunderstorms, but they no longer bring life to a grinding halt. \u00a0He's getting there on that one. \n \nHis fuse is a little longer than it used to be. \u00a0For instance today at school some kid called him chubby and he didn't go ballistic. \u00a0He didn't go running to a teacher either. \u00a0In fact, he didn't say anything. \u00a0It hurt his feelings enough to tell me about it, but he readily excepted my explanation: \n \n\"Sometimes middle-school boys are just rude and silly. \u00a0There will be a fare share of name-calling mostly because they are insecure and want to make themselves feel better. \u00a0You just have to try to ignore it, unless it makes you really uncomfortable, then you let them know.\" \n \n\"That's why I am so glad I have you, because you love me more than anyone,\" he responded. \u00a0My heart absolutely melts. \n \nI told him I still remember the teasing I got in middle school when my nose was much bigger than the rest of my face. \u00a0They called me \"Sir Nose\". \u00a0Lovely! My nose is still on the grander side of life, but I have learned to live with it. \u00a0I even have my days when I think I'm pretty darn cute! Make-up helps \u00a0a lot! \n \nThis weekend he will have an all boys birthday party here at the house. \u00a0They will play games, eat pizza and just hang out. \u00a0The party will include a friend he has known since 1st grade who has since moved on to another school. \u00a0He will also have the twins that he has known since pre-school and a new friend he made this year. \u00a0For someone with Aspergers he's doing pretty darn well in the friendship department. \u00a0Of course, some of his friends also have special needs but they all get along great. \n \n \n \n Birthday Pancakes 7 a.m. Thanks Mom! \n \n \n \n \n \n Home-made fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, salad and finally Birthday Cake! \n \n I am so proud of my birthday boy!

I don't want any of that crap!\" (just kidding). \u00a0Well, he saw a friend eating oven fried chicken and it looked good, \u00a0so his Social Skills teacher suggested that he give the cafeteria a try. \u00a0(I will be forever in her debt.) \u00a0The following day, he did. \u00a0First a baked potato, then a corn dog, and he ended the week with a cheeseburger! \n \n\u00a0Do you know what this means? I don't have to make lunch for him in the morning! Yay! \u00a0This is big! Big! Huge! \u00a0He topped of the week by also riding the bus in the morning! \u00a0No lunch, no ride --independence! Load of my shoulders! I'm turning cartwheels! \n \nSecond, Blue received his report card for the last 6 weeks. \u00a0He kept it going with the straight A's! \u00a0Yeah baby! That's my boy! \u00a0(Well actually --that's his daddy boy. \u00a0I never made straight A's.) \n \nThird, we participated in the MDA Muscle Walk in support of one of his best friends, Jacob.

{"date": "Monday, February 14, 2011", "body": "\n It's an absolutely perfect Sunday. \u00a0We go from freezing temperatures during the week to seventy degrees and sunshine. \u00a0I go into the backyard to do poop patrol and to pick up a few weeds. \u00a0The sun feels so good, I decide I can't possibly go back inside. \u00a0I have to take advantage of it. \n \nI sit my bottom on the bottom of the slide on our playscape which is drenched in sun. \u00a0I lay back. \u00a0Five minutes later, my back can't take it. \u00a0I can no longer lay on my back without cushion. \u00a0I pull the cushion off of the bench and put it on the slide. \u00a0I position it just right so that Harry (my dog) and I can lay down. It is so peaceful --so quiet, I meditate. I fall asleep. \n \nI am awakened of course, by Blue who comes to ask me where I want to go have dinner. \u00a0We decide on a new place that has a little bit of everything in hopes to satisfy everyone. \u00a0I tell Red that we will leave promptly at 4 p.m. \u00a0If he wants to go, he must be ready on time. \u00a0We will not wait. \u00a0Surprisingly, he agrees, and is actually ready on time. \u00a0Of course, he has to argue about where we are going because it's somewhere we have never been. \u00a0All things must be familiar. \u00a0The place has cheeseburgers. \u00a0That's all that should really matter. \n \nWe arrive at the restaurant which is not very crowded at all. \u00a0That should have been the first sign that the food wouldn't be all that great. \u00a0Red decides not to sit with us, but to sit at the table next to us. \u00a0Whatever -the place is nearly empty. \u00a0He actually puts his head down on the table laying his upper body on it as well.  \n \n\"Are you too weak to hold your body up?\" I ask. \n \n\"No...I'm just bored,\" he replies. \n \n\"Do you see anyone else in this entire restaurant laying down on the table?\" \n \nHe looks around. \n \n\"No.\" \n \n\"That's because it's inappropriate. \u00a0A restaurant is not a place for a nap.\" \n \nHe sits up but his shoulders are slumped over \u00a0--his body is in the shape of the letter C. \u00a0He is wearing a sharp, fitted Calvin Klein shirt which could make his upper body look quite attractive. \u00a0The effect is ruined by his slumping shoulders. \u00a0I give him a mirrored image of himself and ask, \"Would you be attracted to a girl if you saw her sitting like this?\" \n \n\"Stop it mom!\" he says as he sits up straighter. \n \nDinner is less than fulfilling for all of us. \u00a0I bring up the idea of going somewhere else for dessert. \u00a0Blue perks up with a huge smile on his face. \"Dessert! That's just what I need right now,\" he says excitedly. \n \n\"I want to go home!

When he gets to the point of being rational we can actually have an insightful conversation. \n \n\"Can you tell me why you're so angry?\" \n\"I'm just so depressed because of everything that's been happening at school. \u00a0You know how 6th grade was a really rough year for me? \u00a0Well...this year is kind of like that.\" \n \nHmm...two transitional years -lots of changes, adjustments, getting to know new students, teachers and administrators. \u00a0 Change is not easy for a kid on the autism spectrum. \u00a0\u00a0This is a rare moment of clarity from him. \u00a0It's amazing how much better he can actually think when he is calm and rational. \n \n\"I've been taking it out on my family, but I know that you guys love me. \u00a0I take things out on Blue because I hate that he's so smart and I'm not.\" \n \n\"You are smart. \u00a0How can a person that's not smart get commended on a TAKS test? \u00a0You're capable of making A's and B's. \u00a0You're not failing anything (besides Art at the moment). \u00a0You just learn differently and work slowly. \u00a0That doesn't mean you're not smart.\" \n \n\"Well I'm just upset about everything that's been happening to me at school. \u00a0Today, they changed my schedule around for two of my classes.\" \n \n They did what!? \u00a0How could that be? \u00a0I wasn't notified or consulted! Jesus! When does it end? He's been screaming and blowing up with me because they changed his schedule! \u00a0Note the key word\u00a0 CHANGE!

{"date": "Monday, March 7, 2011", "body": "\n It's good to take a deep breath and a day or two of rest before you write something...especially when you're angry. \u00a0I'm still not exactly happy, but I had a fabulous weekend. \u00a0I had a day of rest with my best friend and my god-child --to include shopping, a few hours relaxing at the spa, dinner out with cocktails, a nice chat and dozens of laughs at the expense of our crazy life challenges. \u00a0We also enjoyed a girls sleep over at the Four Seasons Hotel (her favorite) and a lovely Sunday brunch. \n \n \n \n \n Chillaxen with my God-daughter \n Sunday afternoon our family had a wonderful gathering with friends. \u00a0We collaborated on a delicious, ecclectic meal, wine, desserts, music and dancing. \u00a0Grandmas and grandkids danced to Al Green. \u00a0Forty-something year-old adults pulled out old-school rap songs in reminiscence of younger days of partying, sans the responsibility and worries that come along with having children, and bills to pay. \n \nI used this weekend to distance myself from the big pow-wow, \u00a0non-ARD  meeting last week at Red's school. \u00a0 It has taken me a few days and glasses of wine to help digest everything that happened or didn't happen in this meeting. \u00a0I came out with some small...very small victories for Red, but I'm not done yet. \u00a0There is always more work to do -seeing as he is definitely a work in progress with ebbs and flows, highs and lows, peaks and valleys. \n \nFor those of you who are not familiar, ARD is an acronym for Admission, Review, Dismissal. \u00a0Basically, this meeting is to put together a plan for the year for your special needs child's education. \u00a0This includes establishing an Individual Education Plan (IEP, with goals and accommodations as needed. \u00a0In many cases there is also a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP). \n \nThe reason I am calling this particular meeting a \u00a0non-ARD , is because we did not accomplish any of the objectives like changing his IEP or BIP. \u00a0First of all -they only scheduled an hour for the meeting. \u00a0 Really??? An Hour? \u00a0What do you think we can accomplish in an hour other than a basic run-of-the-\u00a0 mill, in and out, rubber stamped, superficial meeting? \n \nThey really didn't want to talk about the incident which occurred two weeks ago which in my opinion brought us to this point. \u00a0Talking about this incident and changing his plan would of course take more than an hour. \u00a0In fact, they didn't seem to see how the incident that took place was intricately woven and connected to the changes that need to be made to his plan. \n \nI realize that Red's behavior during this incident was scary-looking to other students, and totally inappropriate. \u00a0Did it need to be addressed? Of course. \u00a0Did there need to be consequences for the behavior? \u00a0Yes -natural consequences. \u00a0Natural consequence: you freak kids out with your behavior, don't expect that they will want to continue to be friends with you. \u00a0You yell and scream in the hallways -don't expect that you will be able to roam the hallways without supervision. \u00a0Don't expect that saying I'm sorry...will always be enough. \u00a0Some people could care less that you're sorry, especially people who are not\u00a0 really  your friends in the first place. \u00a0They are teenagers. \u00a0They do not understand or care that you have special needs. \n \nDoes he need to understand that this kind of behavior is unacceptable? \u00a0Definitely. \u00a0Should his consequences have included signing an Administrative Directive in the presence of a police officer, without the presence of one of his parents? I don't think so. \u00a0Is he cognitively aware enough to understand the implications and ramifications of signing this document? No. \u00a0 Have they seen his test scores, evaluations or watched how slowly it takes for him to process information? Well they got a glimpse of this in the meeting.\u00a0 \n \n Did he make it to a \"safe place\" without assistance, force or coercion from an adult? Yes he did. \u00a0Once an adult in authority began talking with him, he immediately calmed down and apologized for his \"angry\" behavior and words. \u00a0Did he know that he was wrong? Yes. \u00a0Was that enough to stop him from acting impulsively? \u00a0No. \n \nThe small victory that we came out with, is that the document he signed does not go in his permanent record. \u00a0Supposedly, it will be destroyed at the end of the year. \u00a0They can not release this document or anything in his records without my permission. \u00a0Although, I still wonder what would happen if his file was subpoenaed\u00a0by a court of law. \u00a0I plan to get an answer to that question. \u00a0(See...that's why writing is so cathartic. \u00a0It helps me think.) The document is being used more as a disciplinary contract to concretely let him know that this behavior is unacceptable and that he needs to stay away from the students that he \"freaked out\".  \n \nThe whole ordeal and the way it was handled, still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. \u00a0It  feels  like the way it was presented, criminalizes autistic behaviors. \u00a0The other thing that I'm still regurgitating is the fact that I had given them fair warning of his mood and thought process just 3 days before this incident, and yet enough precautions were not put into place to prevent it from happening. \u00a0Where was the administration when they had been asked to keep a more \"watchful eye\" on Red just days before? No one at this meeting could answer this question.  \n \nI know this isn't a perfect world -and Red has a tendency to present his very best self to the adults there at school. \u00a0The problem is when he gets away from those adults, and finds himself in a stressful situation, he can react the way that he did. \n \nI am his mother. \u00a0I know him better than anyone. \u00a0I get to see the good, bad and the ugly much more so than anyone else. \u00a0So when I tell you -you need to keep a watchful eye on him, you have to trust that. \u00a0 Now -they know . \u00a0Unfortunately, he is the one who is paying  all  of the consequences. \u00a0The good news and additional small victory for Red, is that the next time I tell them that he needs a more watchful eye than usual - THEY WILL ACTUALLY LISTEN !  \n \nThere is more work to be done. \u00a0I will be going through his IEP and BIP \u00a0and will work with the staff to make the necessary changes. \u00a0I requested a current Functional Behavior Assessment so that the BIP is appropriate to deal with his current behaviors. We will have to come together again to have the  real  ARD-Meeting to make appropriate changes.  \n \nOne of the things I noticed in the meeting was the downplaying of the BIP. \u00a0One person stated, \"This is just a piece of paper. We don't take this out and read it every time we deal with Red. \u00a0We are a team of human interaction and response.\" \u00a0To that I say -well that's all wonderful and good. \u00a0So why do we even have a BIP? \u00a0Because when the shit hits the fan -you better have something in writing to make sure that your child's best interests are protected. \u00a0Staff members come and go...teachers vary from class to class. \u00a0When in doubt, they should be referring to these documents, in writing to make sure they are doing what they are supposed to do for the child. \n \nAll things happen for a reason. \u00a0These bumps in the road happen to teach us something. \u00a0I have learned that you can not be passive when it comes to educating and advocating for your child. \u00a0You can not be afraid to ruffle a few feathers if it means that things will be better. \u00a0I am not done ruffling or working out the kinks.  \n \nOf course there are three sides to every story, my side, their side and the actual truth. \u00a0They have to write their own side to the story. \u00a0I have to write my own truth. \u00a0Hopefully, somewhere in the middle where the natural truth lies, RED will benefit from our work together. \n \nKeep reading to see our work in progress. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yoWMED_vlAA/TXUjz5RahII/AAAAAAAAAIo/KM1pklZKgG4/s1600/pic18.jpg", "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4di-sA8I0do/TXVYI7Tj7tI/AAAAAAAAAIw/EiaCN9fn7CE/s1600/IMAG0182.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/03/non-ard-meeting.html", "title": "\nThe Non-ARD Meeting\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, March 8, 2011", "body": "\n For those of you suffering with kiddos on the spectrum who refuse to eat vegetables...I want you to know there is hope. \u00a0Every since the boys could utter the word \"NO\", we have fought the vegetable/fruit battle. \u00a0When we sit down to family dinners, and I actually prepare a balanced meal, the policy has always been...eat just a few bites, even though they act like they're choking, or I'm trying to poison them or something. \n \nI love fresh fruit, especially in the spring and summer -strawberries, cherries, watermelon, fresh pineapple, grapes. \u00a0I mean fresh pineapple is like natural candy! They have never liked any of it. \u00a0They really don't like too many foods that are served cold other than ice cream and cereal with milk.  \n \nBlue was always the exception to the rule. \u00a0He likes yogurt and would occasionally eat an apple or an orange if you cut it up and take off the skin. \u00a0However, he has always been at least willing to try new foods even if he doesn't end up liking them. \u00a0Or sometimes he like them for a while and then burn himself out of liking certain foods.  \n \nIf there is a food featured in a children's movie -all the better. \u00a0After the first \"Madagascar\" he started wanting steaks. \u00a0After \"Garfield\" we began eating lasagna. \u00a0\"Kung Fu Panda\" brought us into trying asian noodles and dumplings. \n \nIn this past year or so food has become somewhat of an adventurous hobby for Blue. \u00a0If he's bored -he easily suggests, \"Why don't we go out for lunch?\" \u00a0To which I usually reply, \"Do you have any out-to-lunch-money?\" \u00a0How nice of you to want to go out to lunch on my dime. Of course, I love to eat too...so most of the time we do indulge him. \u00a0Blue and his dad have made it their goal to find the best breakfast restaurants in town on the weekends. \u00a0No thanks...I'd rather sleep late. \n \nBlue is now 12 years-old. \u00a0A few months ago, he suddenly got into trying to eat healthier. \u00a0We started to talk about protein versus carbs, and including more vegetables and fruit into his diet. \u00a0He started eating dried mangos, apples, and he loves those little Clementine oranges. \u00a0There are still textures that he doesn't like ----no peas and corn for him please. \n \nLast week, I thought I was in the wrong house when he filled his plate with everything on the menu at one of our Sunday dinners. \u00a0Roasted chicken, collard greens, potato salad (which I don't even like) and stuffing (with celery and onion chopped extremely fine). \u00a0Then he asked for left overs the next day!  Who is this kid and what has he done with my son? \n \nIf you've been reading this blog regularly you know he started eating cafeteria food a couple of weeks ago. \u00a0One day last week he chose...drum roll please... a baked potato and steamed broccoli, for lunch -at school, with no prompting from anyone! \u00a0\u00a0I can't believe this kid! He is amazing if I must say so myself! \n \nSorry to say, his brother, who is 15 years-old has not jumped on the bandwagon yet. \u00a0He still only eats vegetables if you're holding a gun to his head. \u00a0His palette is still so limited. \u00a0Of course, his first answer to any question is -no, but that doesn't mean I will stop asking and insisting that he at least tries a few healthy things.  \n \nSo don't give up hope on your child eating vegetables...you just never know what's waiting for you around the next corner. \n \n \n \n Blue's Latest Drawing of the Roman Coliseum \nYes...I mean to Brag!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CTgqayVfAf8/TXaW8U-85YI/AAAAAAAAAI0/zE8yoNtB0VY/s1600/images-3.jpeg", "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bl1r8KBfxNk/TXabQp5bKTI/AAAAAAAAAJA/ZmUsufRzEv8/s1600/IMAG0194.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/03/oh-no-you-didnt-eat-those-veggies.html", "title": "\nOh No You Didn't Eat Those Veggies!\n"},

He says I don't even  see  him when he is here, but he is wrong...I do.  \n \n We may not have this hot and heavy romance thing going on a daily basis. \u00a0I mean who has time for that? A day doesn't go by without a hug, a kiss, a miniature back rub...something. If I'm really in a crappy mood, I may totally dis him, but not that often. \u00a0I don't have a perfect life and I can't always be the perfect wife. \u00a0There are days when I just have nothing left after dealing with the stress of raising these boys. \n \n \n The truth is, I so appreciate what he brings to the table. \u00a0We are excellent partners. \u00a0He has strengths where I have weaknesses and vice-versa. \u00a0He handles finances...I hate finances. \u00a0They make me nervous. \u00a0I know what I need to know.  \u00a0 How much can I spend? \u00a0 He does the heavy discipline. \u00a0I come to the rescue when he's being too harsh. \u00a0I'm the soft touch -new school, while he's the tough and ready -old-school. \u00a0He hyper-focuses on work while I hyper-focus on our kids. \u00a0They connect on the geekiness front, where as I totally don't get it. He gives me a break when I really need one. \u00a0 \n \n \n Thank God...he provides the example for them of what it means to be a man, \u00a0a diligent worker, a responsible citizen, a good husband, and an excellent father.\u00a0 \n \n \n I take care of all of the details of running a house, the shopping, the medical appointments (including his), the therapies, household maintenance, school, teachers, IEP's, all things autism and all extra-curricular activities. \u00a0(I could go on...but I'll spare you.)\u00a0 \n \n \n I have the added responsibility of caring for my 71 year-old mother. \u00a0Well -she mostly takes care of herself, but I have to cart her around, and help her manage her life now that she lives with us. \u00a0 \n \n \n I provide an image of what it means to be a woman, a good wife, a mother and a citizen of the world. \u00a0As far as being the female image for them...let's just say whomever they marry will have a lot to live up to. \u00a0They are totally spoiled!\u00a0 \n \n \n Blue really missed Dad while he was gone on this trip. \u00a0After a few days, I just couldn't do anything right. \u00a0I definitely could not resolve any conflict between he and Red. \u00a0Red has really been trying to get along with everyone, including Blue for the past few days. \u00a0Blue wasn't having any of it. \u00a0He did not trust that Red means anything that he says. \u00a0Like when he says, the infamous, \"I'm sorry.\" \u00a0For a while there, we thought \"Sorry\" was his middle name, he says it so often. \u00a0Then he proceeds to turn around and repeat the same behavior that he is supposedly sorry for. \u00a0 \n \n \n Red tried over and over to be nice. \u00a0\"Good morning Blue,\" he says when he comes down for breakfast. \u00a0This is huge for him. \u00a0He usually comes down and says something nasty like, \"What's wrong with your hair?\" or \"Why are you wearing that?\"\u00a0 \n \n \n I implore Blue to acknowledge his brother's effort and to try to forgive him, to no avail. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Blue says, \"I don't trust him, so I'm just going to ignore him.\" After 3 days of Red trying to be nice and being rejected, he finally lashed out, said something rude and nasty. \u00a0There was a miniature explosion between them. \u00a0 \n \n \n Luckily by this time Dad was home. \u00a0He goes into the room and has quiet little pow-wow with Blue. \u00a0The two of them come out, kick me out of Red's room and they all pow-wow together. \u00a0They kick me out because according to dad, \"I always talk for everyone.\" \u00a0He wanted them to talk for themselves. \u00a0Apologies were made. \u00a0They both promise to try to get along better. \u00a0All is good in the universe. \u00a0 \n \n \n I had been trying the same thing for 3 days. \u00a0It's amazing what happens when Dad comes to the rescue!\u00a0 \n \n \n Dad is leaving again tomorrow and it's Spring Break. \u00a0It will be a break from having to get up early in the morning and deal with the stress of getting ready and going to school. \u00a0For me...it means extra peace-keeping duty. \u00a0What the hell am I going to do?

Help!

I want to hang out in a group.\"  \n \nI know I shouldn't expect miracles. \u00a0It's going to take time and he may never socialize the way that I would like him too. \u00a0(This is the son of a girl nicknamed \"Social Butterfly\" and a father who never stops talking and doesn't meet any strangers.) \u00a0He has to ease into it, \u00a0really become comfortable with people and be in the right mood in order to let go and become the charming person that he can be. \u00a0 He says he wants a big group of friends, but the truth is he does better in one to one situations.  \n \nWe went to lunch after bowling. \u00a0That decision \u00a0within itself was pretty hysterical. \u00a0A group of teens with Aspergers all with very different pallets, quirks and rigid thinking, trying to come together on a decision on where to go for lunch. \u00a0Finally, one of the parents had to step in and make a decision and everyone would have to come to terms with it. \u00a0That is part of the dynamics of dealing with a group. \u00a0There has to be give and take and not everyone will walk away totally satisfied. \n \n Red started off lunch with the sulking face. \u00a0He didn't like the choice of restaurant. \u00a0Once, we all sat down and he sat in the middle of the group, (near the girls), suddenly he became animated, full of life and conversation. \u00a0He managed to smile and talk. \u00a0I have a feeling if I wasn't there, he may have been like this the whole time. \n \nBaby steps are better than no steps at all. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If you read this blog...you are legally and morally obligated to click below:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2-Jc-Gd0DmQ/TYOi-6GUMSI/AAAAAAAAAJk/Wbj4m2AOhTo/s1600/IMAG0202.jpg", "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-DqXpfZ1sPjI/TYOQweerktI/AAAAAAAAAJg/-yfS5KqarRA/s1600/IMAG0203.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/03/social-skills-102.html", "title": "\nSocial Skills 102\n"},

Where are you guys going!? Come baaackk!\" \u00a0We keep walking. \u00a0Blue and I decide to climb down into this little cove where we can put our feet in the water. \u00a0Red can no longer see us from the car. \u00a0He decides to get out of the car to come and see what the hell we are doing. \u00a0We are in heaven experiencing the beauty of nature. \u00a0Blue tells me that we are sitting on limestone.  \n \n\"Limestone can grow plants out of it. \u00a0That's why you see these plants coming up.\" \n \nWe start to chuck rocks into the deeper part of the creek. \u00a0We're just chillin'. \u00a0Red vacillates back and forth between thinking that this would be a really cool place to video, while at the same time hating the fact that Blue and I are enjoying ourselves.  \n \nHe starts to call Blue names.  \n \n\"You look like a girl!\" \n\"You look like Mindy.\" (A girl who used to be in his class) \n\"And you act like her too.\" \n\"Mindy. Mindy, Mindy.\" \n \nBlue and I splash around in the water. \u00a0He ignores Red. \u00a0It kills him that he's not able to push his buttons. \u00a0When we get in the car he says, \"Why isn't Blue getting mad? \u00a0He always gets mad when we're at home.\" \u00a0If Blue could only have the strength to ignore him more often, he just might loose his determination and will to annoy him. \n \n When we get to his Social Skills coach, she tells me that Michelle Garcia, of the popular\u00a0 Social Thinking \nhas these characters she calls \"The Unthinkables.\" \u00a0Apparently, Red was busy being \"Mean Jean Destroyer of Fun.\" \u00a0His super powers are, \"Insulting others...he can be very bossy and hog all of the attention.\" \n \nOh -so you mean...it's not just Red. \u00a0There are other \"Destroyers of Fun\" lurking around in our universe. \u00a0Red is becoming mean and ugly to us, because he's tired of school. \u00a0We love him. \u00a0We are a safe place to take out all of his frustrations. \u00a0Lucky us!  \n \nSo now we just have to figure out how to beat \"Mean Jean -Destroyer of Fun\" at his own game. \n \nAny suggestions?  \n______________________ \n \n Don't forget to click below if you enjoyed this sadly humorous post: \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eNiGc8hdsok/TYrD3Mz2E8I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/LHjlEoSnqM0/s1600/images.jpeg", "http://www.socialthinking.com/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/03/fun-destroyer.html", "title": "\nFun Destroyer\n"},

He is always on task , always prepared and an outstanding example to others.\" \n \nThis same star student slept in the bathroom last night in fear and anxiety over a possible thunderstorm ...which never happened. \u00a0He also woke up and totally reamed me for changing the clothes that he had laid out for school this morning. \u00a0I love him immensely despite this. \n \nAnother young man age 15, came up with the brilliant idea of riding the school bus to school today. \u00a0He says, \"We just can't get along in the car. \u00a0I think I should just set my alarm clock and get up in time.\" \n \nHe did. \u00a0He set his alarm and was dressed by the time I stumbled out of my room. \u00a0Of course, he was sitting on the couch on the laptop. \u00a0(Note to self -hide the laptop before you go to bed tonight.) \u00a0He did make it out the door on time when the bus arrived. \u00a0Of course, he had not brushed his teeth. \u00a0Oh well... \n \nWhen he arrives at school, the staff in his BASE room give him a big fan fare. \"We're so proud of you!\" High fives...the whole shebang.  \n \nMy phone rings at 8:35 a.m. \"Mom...I made it to school at 8:28 a.m. \u00a0Are you proud of me?\" \n \n\"Yes son...I'm very proud of you. \u00a0Keep up the good work.\" \n \nLater I call his teacher and ask, \"Did you guys have a talk with him about being late?\" \n \n\"Nothing new,\" she says. \u00a0\"Just the same repetitive conversation we've been having. \u00a0With these kids, it just takes repetition. \u00a0By the way...I did get a not from the A.P. that he has time to make up because of so many tardies. \u00a0He can do it before school, after school or on Saturday.\" \n \n\"Did you mention this to him?\" I ask. \n \n\"Yes.\" \n \nAh hah!

{"date": "Wednesday, January 5, 2011", "body": "\n \nMy first born son is now 15 years old. \u00a0We have known that he has special needs since he was a toddler. \u00a0He was first diagnosed with a speech delay, later ADHD, then depression, and now Aspergers.  \n \nIt took a while for me to accept the ADHD diagnosis, because at first I thought that the schools just toss that label around like it's a frisbee. \u00a0I had private testing done where the diagnosis was confirmed. \u00a0It did explain some of his behavior i.e. his tendency to be off in his \"own world\" and his impulsiveness. \u00a0It did not however totally describe him. \u00a0I knew there was something more. \u00a0He was a jigsaw puzzle and all of the pieces were not quite put together. \n \nWhen we received the Aspergers diagnosis in his first year of middle school it was scary, but at the same time, it was a huge 'ah hah' moment. \u00a0It explained so much...the incessant talking about areas of interest, the obsessions, the difficulty with peer interactions, depression as a result of feeling different than others, lack of understanding humor, idioms and context clues, \u00a0difficulty with understanding fiction while he was an excellent reader of non-fiction. \u00a0It further explained his sensory issues and limited diet. \n \nHere we are three years later and I still look at him sometimes and say, \"WTHeck?\" What is with this kid? Why doesn't he get it? I've said the same thing over and over again. \u00a0Does he think if he just keeps asking me the same questions, the answer will somehow change. \u00a0We usually have this problem whenever the answer is no. \u00a0No -we can't buy that. \u00a0No -you can not have company today.  \n \nIs he thinking  let me just beat her down and wear her out -eventually she will give me what I want. \u00a0\u00a0That is exactly what he's thinking. He has actually said it out loud, \"Why don't you just give me what I want so we can avoid all of this.\" \u00a0It kind of sounds like a threat...or at least intimidation. \n \nIf you have been behaving atrociously, I am not going to turn around and reward you by allowing you to have company. \u00a0If you were not on time for school -I will not reward you by giving you a ride home. \u00a0You will take the bus. \u00a0If I take you to a restaurant and you are rude and ungrateful, why would you turn around and say, \"Now can we go somewhere else?\" \u00a0The answer would be NO! \n \nO.K. so in my head, I know the answer to many of my own questions. \u00a0He has autism. \u00a0He is emotionally immature. \u00a0Sometimes, he just likes hearing the sound of his own voice and his own familiar dialog. \u00a0He makes statements and asks questions that comfort him somehow -even though they annoy the hell out of me. \u00a0Also -he is a teenager. \u00a0It his his job to test the limits.  \n \nIt is my job to maintain the balance, keep the peace and to hold the line. \u00a0However, just because I know there is a reason for his behavior, doesn't make it any less painful to deal with. \u00a0That doesn't take away the headaches. \u00a0I often find myself wondering is this Aspergers or just a teenager trying to push my buttons? What's the difference? It's all exasperating. \n \nLately, it seems like things are going backward not forward. It almost seems like he's regressing in some ways. \u00a0I am looking towards the finish line (although I know it's not really a finish line). \u00a0I'm looking at him becoming an adult. \u00a0I want him to eventually become independent. \u00a0I want him to be successful. \u00a0I want him to be out of my house. \u00a0(I know that sounds bad...but hey, these are my confessions). \u00a0While he seems to be running in the opposite direction or at the very least, running on a treadmill that goes nowhere. \n \nWhy is it that I am watching his brother (who is 3 1/2 years younger and also has Aspergers) take off like a lightening bolt seemingly growing past his brother? \u00a0In this past year I have watched Blue become an independent, organized, self-starter, excellent student. \u00a0He gets up on his own every morning, takes care of all of his responsibilities for school and personal hygiene independently. \u00a0(Except the occasional reminder to put on deodorant.) While getting Red to do any of the above is like pulling wisdom teeth with no anesthesia or laughing gas. (Well..white wine is my laughing gas, or if things are really tough, a martini or a margarita.) \n \nBy the way, over Christmas vacation Red was up almost every morning before everyone else -usually around 8 a.m. \u00a0Sunday morning -he wanted to go to church with a friend. \u00a0He set his alarm and was up and dressed, on his own by 8:15 a.m. \u00a0Two days later, when school started we were back to \"I'm just so tired! \u00a0I can't get up. I don't know what's wrong with me.\" \u00a0Yes -you know exactly what is wrong. \"I just hate school because I have no friends.\" Exactly! \n \nI realize that every child with or without Aspergers is different and I shouldn't compare him to his brother. \u00a0Still, it is baffling. I wish that he could be more introspective and tell me what he needs. \u00a0He can't seem to do that, so I have to help him figure it out. \n \nI am the one person in the world that he knows will love him through anything. \u00a0Somehow that entitles me to bare the brunt of his negative behavior. \u00a0He doesn't have many friends, \u00a0that makes him sad, that makes him depressed. \u00a0Who does he take it out on? Me! \u00a0He's bored so he spends a lot of time fixating on the next thing he wants to buy and when he can't get it right away, who does he bug to death? You guessed it...me! \n \nWhere is his father in all of this...well thank God, he's still here. \u00a0Many fathers of special needs children can not deal with the pressure. They often have a hard time with the amount of time and attention that these children need. \u00a0Not to mention, disagreeing on treatment and parenting issues.  \n \nIn our house, Dad's patience aren't nearly as long as mine. \u00a0Red knows this -so he will only approach Dad with certain nonsensical things and he will only push so far. \u00a0I play completely dumb when it comes to his computer, so he has no choice but to go to Dad with those issues. \u00a0Dad also has a knack for drowning things out much better than I do. \u00a0He also has the added benefit of escaping to the office or out of town on business on a regular basis. \n \nThe bottom line here -is that there has to be a better way. \u00a0Something has to give. \u00a0We need to do something different because I'm loosing it.  \n \nOne of my New Year's resolutions is to find that better way -to get some answers and to help him move forward. \u00a0I have to keep him busier so that he won't be bored and bug the s#*t out of me. I have to find a social skills coach, a mentor, someone or something to help him to help himself. \u00a0He has a therapist and a Psychiatrist, but we can't keep doing the same things and expect different results. \u00a0This may mean having him re-evaluated and getting a second opinion from a Neurologist or Neuropsychologist to make sure that we are on the right track. \n \nIt's crunch time. \u00a0I have three years before this dude is 18. \u00a0I may be wishing on a star to hope that he will be on the road to independence by then. \u00a0I do know this for sure...he has loads of potential. \u00a0I intend to see to it that it does not go to waste.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TSUagLKsS9I/AAAAAAAAAEo/WPe-xL2Zbj0/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/01/baffled.html", "title": "\nBaffled\n"},

Yesterday an entry from my blog\u00a0 My Prayer \u00a0was published on the\u00a0 Autism Speaks \u00a0\u00a0 In Their Own Words \u00a0official blog! I was so excited and thrilled by this honor. \u00a0This meant that thousands of people would read words that I had written. \u00a0Not only were they my words -but they were important words of prayer for my children. \n \nThese\u00a0 people  who would read would\u00a0have all felt the same frustrations, feelings and have the same hopes and dreams for their children who are on the autism spectrum. \u00a0Many of those people are joining me in prayer. \u00a0That means all of that positive energy is being focused on  my boys . \u00a0What a blessing. \u00a0 I thank each and every one of you for reading, praying, meditating and sending positive thoughts our way!   \n \nThe wonderful world of blogging in the autism community has helped me immensely. \u00a0We all have those \"woe is me\" pity party days. \u00a0Then we read about something positive that someone has experienced with their child and it gives us hope. \u00a0Or we read about a new idea parenting idea that someone is using and we ad it to our arsenal. \u00a0We can find out about treatments and therapies that others have tried. \u00a0The resources are endless.  \n \nJust this morning I got advice from  Tanya@TeenAutism \u00a0(who btw I am beginning to idolize) regarding privileges and consequences. \u00a0She referred me to\u00a0 pixiemama \u00a0who had just written a post about the very same subject, wherein she asked for advice from other bloggers and they all gave their two cents. \u00a0Then I picked up at least  one of those cents  \u00a0to figure out my own \"currency of privileges\" to implement in this house. \u00a0Pretty awesome huh? \n \nThere are days when I read about a single mom who is parenting a special needs kid or two on her own. \u00a0Then I think - what the heck am I complaining about?  \u00a0This is hard -but there are those who have a much more challenging road than I do, and they are making it. \u00a0It gives me the strength and courage to keep going.  \n \nWhen I read about someone who is just as frustrated as I am -I feel less alone and less guilty! I know for sure that we all have those days where we feel that somehow \"this is all my fault\" or \"what am I doing wrong?\" Well -it's not any one's fault. \u00a0We are all doing the very best we can on any given day with the circumstances we have to work with on that day. \u00a0When we know better -we do better. When we don't know better...we have a glass of wine and call it a day! \n \nWe will all get there together!

{"date": "Monday, January 10, 2011", "body": "\nBlue my soon to be 12 year-old calls his brother Red a terrorist. \u00a0\"He terrorizes this house, holding us all hostage!\" He says. \u00a0There goes that brutal honesty. \u00a0\"We can't even relax in our own home!\" says Blue.\u00a0I have to agree with him to a degree. \u00a0The simplest things can be turned into a circus act. \u00a0What really gets me is that it's the eldest of the two whose behavior is the worst. \n \nLast night we had homemade fried rice for dinner. \u00a0My mother cooked, as she now lives with us. She uses green and red bell peppers, green onion, bean sprouts, ham (leftover from Christmas) and egg. \u00a0We also threw in some leftover peas. Her recipe is renowned in our family. \u00a0I also made steamed broccoli. \u00a0Now -I knew this wouldn't go over well because there are ' too many colors ' in the fried rice. Typically the boys don't like their foods 'mixed together'. \u00a0They mostly like everything served and eaten separately. \u00a0So\u00a0I actually prepared a less colorful version for them, with just the rice, egg and ham. \u00a0The broccoli was served on the side. \n \nRed had company all day yesterday. \u00a0He and his friend made a movie called \"Kung Fu Brothers\". \u00a0He spent the day with his friend here at the house editing the movie and burning the DVD. \u00a0It was actually a quiet day here at home because he was preoccupied with this project. \u00a0Just before dinner, my husband took his friend home. \u00a0When Red walked through the door and saw what we were having for dinner -he instantly showed us all the other side of his personality. \n \n\"What?! I have to eat that?! There's no food in the house! There's no cookies! There's no cereal! Why didn't you go shopping Mom? Why can't I just have hot dogs or something?\" \n \nMind you, this is the same kid who was caught on video eating wild rice and fish at my nephew's house a month ago. \u00a0He says he ate for my nephew because he was afraid of what might happen if he didn't. \u00a0My nephew is about 6 ft 3 with a very deep voice (intimidating) but of course he wouldn't hurt a fly. \u00a0(Unless the fly wouldn't eat his vegetables!) :-) Red isn't afraid or intimidated by us. \u00a0He doesn't care what we think about him. \u00a0We're just his parents. \n \n\"We're going to have dinner as a family and this is what we're having. I did prepare a simple version for you and your brother. \u00a0You like all of the things in that version (ham, rice and egg) \u00a0so you should have no problem eating it,\" I say.  \n \n\"I don't want to eat that!\" And so on and so on. \n \nWe say our prayers and sit down as a family. \u00a0I actually made sure everyone was served, but lost my appetite because of all of his antics. \u00a0I decided I would eat after everyone else finished. \u00a0He laid his head down on the table. \u00a0He pouted and shouted like a toddler. \u00a0I wanted him to at least try it before he just flat out decided that he didn't like it. \u00a0Of course I had my mother coaching from the sidelines (not helpful). \"Back in my day blah, blah, blah!\" \n \nThis is why I have avoided this issue with him in the past. \u00a0We have so many freakin' battles, I just don't have the energy to fight them all. \u00a0After I've spent time and energy preparing a meal, I want to sit down and enjoy it...not fight to get him to eat or listen to him tell me how disgusting it is. \n \nEveryone at the table finished their meal while he was still pouting and slow poking around. Blue ate seconds of his rice and then tried the broccoli. \u00a0I told him how it is like a broom sweeping all of the toxins out of his body and giving him nutrients. \u00a0He asked for seconds! \u00a0Of course, this infuriated Red! \"Stop it Blue! I hate that look on your little face!\" \n \nWe pulled out the old,  'if you want any dessert, you need to finish your dinner'  trick. \u00a0To which Red replied, \"Why are you being so mean Mom!?\" \n \nHe finally finished his meal and shortly thereafter turned back into his original personality. \u00a0\"What's for dessert? I'm sorry Mom and Nana for how I was acting.\" \u00a0He says that, ' I'm sorry ' line so many times during the day, till it looses it's value. \u00a0It's really like a script instead of a sincere apology. \n \nI finally sat down and ate my dinner. \u00a0I didn't have ice cream for dessert like everyone else. \u00a0Instead I had a glass of wine. \u00a0Ice cream wasn't going to do it for me last night. \u00a0Now if I had chocolate chip cookies to go with it -that's another story.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/01/terror-at-table.html", "title": "\nTerror at the Table\n"},

I'm not going!\" \n \nI can not home-school him. \u00a0It would be impossible. \u00a0He does not listen to me. \u00a0He is not self-motivated enough to complete assignments on his own. \u00a0We would both be completely miserable. \u00a0Not to mention that he desperately needs the social component of being in school. \u00a0 Life doesn't get any easier after high-school if you want to have a good future. \u00a0He says he wants to work in the film industry. \u00a0Those jobs don't come to your house, knock on the door and say, \"Hello...are you ready to work now?\" \u00a0You have to get your education first. \n \nHe often compares himself to his one and only friend these days who is home-schooled. \u00a0I explain again that everyone's circumstances are different. \u00a0If he wants a future in multi-media or film-making he needs to be in an environment that will nurture that. \u00a0Besides, his friend actually  listens  to his mother. \u00a0Right now he is going through the painful, doldrum of pre-requisite, freshman classes. \u00a0His electives being Art 1 and Social Skills. \u00a0This obviously does not motivate him enough to want to get to school on-time everyday.  \n \nBack to the dance -I ask him to go brush his teeth and put on his shoes so that we can go. \u00a0He refuses. \u00a0We tell him that privileges are being lost with each refusal. \u00a0Computer time -gone. \u00a0Phone -bye-bye. \u00a0Still he refuses.  \n \nOut of desperation I call his Special Ed tracking teacher -can't reach her. \u00a0I try the School Psychologist -no answer. \u00a0I call the Special Ed Counselor -no luck. \u00a0I finally call the Campus Resource Officer -he is not in his office, but he does he call me back right-away. \u00a0He talks to Red on the phone. \u00a0They have a nice little chat and within moments -he is brushing his teeth and putting his shoes on. The officer asks that we stop by his office once we arrive on campus for a moment. \n \nWe do. \"You know son -your mom is legally responsible for you until you're 18. \u00a0That means she's the boss. \u00a0Legally -you need to come to school everyday without giving her a hard time.\" \n \n\"O.K. I understand. \u00a0I will. \" he says like a docile little pup. He even put on a half smile. \n \nThe officer congratulates him for making it to school and sends him on to class. \u00a0I'm thinking - Wow, how very nice of him. \u00a0He is so pleasant.  \u00a0Part of me wanted him to scare the hell out of him -but I \u00a0suppose he was taking the right approach. \n \nI go to see the Counselor after Red heads to class. \u00a0The philosophy at the school seems to be to remain positive, to give him incentive to want to get there and get there on time. \u00a0Mr. K, the counselor-talks about possibly switching his classes around so that he goes to his BASE (Social Skills) class 1st period where he will have some sort of engaging activity that he will want to get there on time for.  \n \nI walk away feeling like wow -here I am wanting to put the wrath on this kid, wanting to take away every privilege imaginable, and they want to give him  incentive  to come to school. \u00a0\"We want to give him something to work for, not work against,\" he said.  Wow!  On one hand I was impressed at their positive attitude on the other hand I'm thinking -I've tried the positive road with this boy -nothing works.  \n \nThe bottom line is that school is a miserable place for him and he hates going. \u00a0I hope that their  incentive  works. \u00a0Meanwhile, there will be no cell phone for a while. \u00a0If he wants it back -the  incentive  will be to get up on time in the morning. \n \n \n If you like this post...please take a few seconds to click through and vote!

{"date": "Wednesday, January 12, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nYesterday after school Blue and I made a mad dash out to go to the store for my mother. \u00a0On the way, he says, \"I'm really in the mood for tacos.\" \u00a0What the heck? I took the opportunity to have a little one on one time with him to hear about his day at school. \u00a0When we're at home, there's no telling what kind of interruptions we will have -so off to Chipolte we went. \n \nI had a mini quesadilla (just so that he wouldn't have to eat alone...not). \u00a0He had two burrito like tacos with charbroiled chicken only. \u00a0No cheese, no veggies, nada! \u00a0We both had a coke and a smile. \u00a0It felt so good to be alone and connected to him.  \n \nI had just read an article earlier in the day about children being bullied at school on\u00a0 Thinking Persons Guide to Autism -Imagine \u00a0\u00a0After reading it I thought, how could you not know as a parent that your child is being bullied? I talk to my kids everyday. \u00a0I ask them about specifics of their day, and if anything was unusual, somehow I think I would know. \u00a0I check on their facebook page and eavesdrop on conversations with friends and of course with each other. \u00a0(Sorry...there is no privacy in my house.) My kids are usually brutally honest and they don't miss an opportunity to complain to me about something. \u00a0If anyone was bothering them, it would show itself one way or another. \u00a0You just have to be paying attention. \n \nBlue started telling me about a disagreement he had with a peer who also has autism. \u00a0This friend seems to get pretty stressed out easily. When he does, he goes through a miniature melt-down with crying, flailing his arms, hitting himself, pacing and sometimes hiding underneath a desk. \n \nIt's kind of ironic that Blue gets so exasperated by this behavior. \u00a0He was pretty explosive himself just a few short months ago. \u00a0He has been doing so much better with agitation and melt downs since we started him on a mild dosage of Abilify. \u00a0I reminded him of this fact and also the fact that he still gets pretty agitated by his brother at times. \u00a0He likes to be in control. \u00a0He damn near wants to parent his older brother. \n \nI explained to Blue that everyone with autism is different. \u00a0His friend's autism causes him to have these outburst, mostly when he feels like something is happening that he can not control and he desperately wants to. \u00a0I cautioned Blue not to take it personally, not to try to  fix it,  \u00a0 but to just be patient and realize that he isn't doing it on purpose. \u00a0A lot of his behavior probably can't be helped. \u00a0We also have to throw into the mix, another child that is in their group who has ADHD, is very impulsive and does a lot of name-calling. \u00a0I'm sure that sends the friend with autism over the edge. \n \n \n \"Do you remember how on edge you were in the beginning of school?\" I asked. \u00a0He looked at me deep in thought and shook his head to the affirmative. \u00a0 \n \n \n He gave it a lot of thought. \u00a0He came home and made a story board of what happened that day so that he could process it and then explain it to their Social Skills Teacher, who was not happy about the situation. He told me that his teacher had said, that some of the things the boy was doing was \"on purpose to get attention.\" \u00a0I can't imagine that to be true. \u00a0However, I don't know the boy and all of his situation personally. \u00a0She may have some knowledge about him that I am not privy to. \u00a0 \n \n \n I cautioned Blue that it's hard for us to judge weather someone with a disability is doing something on purpose unless we are actually inside his head, and walking in his shoes. \u00a0Maybe I'm being my usual  Polly Anna- self about it, but I usually give people the benefit of the doubt. \u00a0 \n \n He asked me if I thought his teacher was doing a good job with his friend. \u00a0To which I replied, \"I'm sure she is doing the very best she can with the resources she has. It takes a lot of patience to work with kids who have special needs. \u00a0That doesn't mean she's always right and that she won't loose it sometimes. \u00a0I try to be patient with you boys, but sometimes I loose it. \u00a0We're only human.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TS4ar0S1LQI/AAAAAAAAAEw/qUwd-7GSYjI/s1600/im_only_human_and_thats_my_saving_grace_tshirt-p2358648623012112183ll4_400.jpg", "http://thinkingautismguide.blogspot.com/2011/01/imagine-this.html"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/01/only-human.html", "title": "\nOnly Human\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 19, 2011", "body": "\n \n \nFriday morning was like every other school morning. \u00a0There was yelling and screaming involved and by the time we finally made it to the high-school campus, I was physically and emotionally spent. \u00a0I walk inside and ask to speak with the school Psychologist (Ms. W- lets call her). \u00a0I wanted to share with her what I had observed the day before in the cafeteria when I skulked around like a private detective, watching my son from across the room. \n \n\"I watched him pacing back and forth looking totally lost. \u00a0He spoke to some peers and apparently they blew him off. \u00a0He just looked -disconnected, lonely and out of place. \u00a0It broke my heart to watch.\"  \n \nAs I sat in her office, I suddenly found myself in tears. \u00a0The tears were a combination of stress and exhaustion from the week with that I had been through him. \u00a0I try to stay pretty calm and centered, \u00a0but it weighs on me heavily. \u00a0At the same time, I was literally feeling the anguish that he is going through as if it were my own. \n \nMs. W- \u00a0empathized with the pain that he must be feeling and that I feel as his mother. \u00a0She assures me that he does have alternatives to going down to the cafeteria, but for whatever reason, he chooses not to go with those alternatives the majority of the time. \u00a0Apparently, there are a few students who regularly ask  him \u00a0to hang out at lunch and he blows  them  off in order to go to hang out with the \"normal\" kids. \u00a0 He is fixated on a friend whom he has known for most of his life, even though she doesn't really want to be bothered. \u00a0He also has a mentor group that he can sit with at lunch. \u00a0He usually doesn't.\u00a0 \n \n \n Mrs. W also\u00a0 reminds me of how far he has come in a years time. \u00a0\"He is going to all regular classes every day and once education starts -he is fully engaged,\" she says. \u00a0When he is in a regular ed. classroom, there is no frowning, no acting out. \u00a0He is doing his work and even participates in group activities. \u00a0She suggests that I peek in on him in one of his classes to observe that he is not as miserable as he says. \n \n\"The hallways, and lunchtime are difficult for him, but he is actively participating in his education in the classroom and doing well,\" she said. \n \nI manage to dry my tears. \u00a0I remind myself that I can only do so much for him and the same goes for the professionals that work with him. \u00a0We can open doors and encourage him to walk through to the other side, but he has to do the leg work. \u00a0We can't pick him up and carry him through. \u00a0They can teach him social skills...but he has to decide weather or not to use them.  \n \nWhat's that saying -you can lead a horse to water... \u00a0No -I've got a better one -you can take a girl to a bar but she can still order a Coke and be a total party pooper! \n \nHe complains about his life, while refusing to do the work involved to change it. \u00a0A part of it is fear. \u00a0We can attribute some of it to delays in his thought process, his tendency to get stuck. So as the adults and professionals in his life we have just keep trying -keep repeating and hope that eventually he will learn some of what we are trying to teach. \u00a0After he learns it, we have to pray that he will actually  use  the skills. \n \nI finally found a social skills high-school group (outside of school) that he will start attending in a couple of weeks. \u00a0I am hopeful that it will help him. \u00a0I will continue to monitor what is being done at school \u00a0(social skill-wise) and try to reinforce it at home. \u00a0I asked Ms. W -to continue to try to redirect him during his lunch period, to help him to find other things to do instead of putting himself through the agony of the cafeteria. \n \nI did peek in on him in class before I left. \u00a0He was working. \u00a0There was no frown, no sadness -just a normal boy trying his best to be just that. \n \n \n READERS...I love your feedback, comments, advice, sympathy, condolences -whatever!

{"date": "Monday, January 24, 2011", "body": "\n Autism's Voice \n \n \nIt's Saturday morning and Blue has a meeting with his ex-social skills teacher from elementary school. \u00a0I am so proud that she has invited him to present again at the Teachers Continuous Improvement Conference in our school district. \u00a0He is becoming the voice of autism in the district, which makes me an exceptionally proud mama. \u00a0This is the second year he has presented at this conference. \u00a0Last year's presentation was \"What You Can Do to Help a Student with Autism in the Classroom.\" \u00a0This year he will present on \"ARD Meetings -Why It's Important for Students to Particpate\". \n \nLast year was standing room only in his presentation. \u00a0Can you imagine? An opportunity to tell teachers what they do to get on your nerves and then teach them how to fix it. \u00a0Only better -he is helping more than himself. \u00a0He is helping those with autism who can't speak for themselves -whose communication skills are not quite as good as Blue's.  \n \nI say he's becoming the voice of autism in the district because he is also doing an introductory video at his middle school for students in 5th grade who will need social skills support when they come to middle school next year. \u00a0On video -he will take them on a tour of the school so that they will become a little familiar with the campus prior to their first official visit.  \n \nHe will also be doing another video for the school Psychologist (LSSP) at his middle school that will also be used at the Teachers Training conference this year. \u00a0This presentation will be about behavioral issues and choices. \n \nThe fact that he is being chosen to represent a positive image and voice for autism is a huge honor and says so much about his character. \u00a0He's come a long way baby! \u00a0His future is so bright -it burns my eyes.  \n \n \n Hanging Out \nThe prep meeting that Blue attended on Saturday included a friend that he has known since pre-school. \u00a0The two of them have grown and matured so much since the days of their Blues Clues and Toy Story obsessions. \u00a0After their meeting I took them out to lunch followed by a playdate at our house. I suppose since the two of them are now 12 years-old (Blue will be in 2 weeks) they would be mortified by my using the term playdate. \u00a0I suppose it's more like - hanging out  when you're a pre-teen. \n \nAnyway, they spent several hours watching funny You-tube videos, playing games on the Wii and playing outside. \u00a0While they were playing in Blue's room, the two of them hatched a plan to go see \"Tron\" at the movie theatre, even though Blue has already seen it twice. He had all of the movie times in the local area committed to memory by the time he shared his plan with me. \u00a0He was so excited and all spun up. \u00a0They  had  to go! \u00a0I mean - why not? \n \n\"Can we go? Can we go? Can you take us? Can Dad take us? Can you drop us off?\" \n \nI'm not quite sure I'm ready to  drop him off  at the movies. I didn't make any promises one way or the other. \u00a0I said I'd think about it and talk to his dad. \u00a0The two of them go over to his friends house where they play for a few more hours. \u00a0During which time, I am hoping he'll forget about the movies or be too tired to want to go anymore. \u00a0(A girl can dream...) \n \nAround 6 p.m. he calls, \"So Mom are we going? Can you take me? Can his mom take us? There's an 8 p.m. showing.\" \n \n\"I think you've already had a pretty full day. \u00a0Why don't we wait until tomorrow afternoon?\" I say. \n\"Why would we do that? Why can't you take me? You aren't doing anything.\" \n \nI had my reasons. \u00a0I didn't really feel like I needed to explain them all to him. \u00a0Sometimes the answer is just no. \u00a0You had a full-day with your friends. \u00a0Why can't that be enough? \u00a0I took you guys to lunch. \u00a0You spent 6 hours playing together. \u00a0Let's call it a day -and a good day at that.  \n \nI do remember scheming and plotting like this with my friends when I was a kid. \u00a0Enough -was never enough. \u00a0I never wanted the party to be over. \u00a0At the same time, I had to learn to accept the answer -no. \u00a0  \n \nHe comes home from his friend's house and gives me the evil eye. \u00a0He comes into my room and takes \u00a0 Harry -our dog. \u00a0\"Come on Harry. \u00a0Let's get out of here.\" \u00a0I guess I don't deserve any company. \u00a0He is really mad at me. \u00a0That's o.k. I can take it.  \n \nHe asks my mom to help him make his dinner. \u00a0I continue hiding out in my room -alone. \n \nBy bedtime he comes in, apologizes and gives me a hug good night. \u00a0All is forgiven at least for the night.  \n \nYou bet your bottom dollar -he held me to my word. \u00a0He saw \"Tron\" for the 3rd time at the cost of $10.25 for a matinee showing because it's in 3D. \u00a0 What a rip!  The things we'll do for our children. \u00a0BTW- No I did not drop them off. \u00a0I hung out in and around the theater until the movie was over. They had a great time. \u00a0But of course, the party did not end there. \n \n\"Mom can he come over and hang out at our house for a while?\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0I love your comments, suggestions, thoughts, condolences, \u00a0applause...whatever!\u00a0 \n Click below if you enjoyed this post: \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TT3B59w44gI/AAAAAAAAAFc/11RvCexrTvs/s1600/images-1.jpeg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TT4qQx5u4XI/AAAAAAAAAFg/tr1Bm4IsDyk/s1600/LL950.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/01/autisms-voice-hanging-out.html", "title": "\nAutisms Voice / Hanging Out\n"},

You're obsessed with that phone!\" \n \n\"Have you lost your mind?\" I retort. \u00a0\"Who do you think you're talking too?\" Aspergers or not -I will not be blatantly disrespected. He's not in the middle of a meltdown. \u00a0He's in the middle of being a disrespectful teenager! \n \n\"Well...why are you always looking at that stupid phone?\" \n\"Why are you always late? Why do I have to sit here waiting for twenty-minutes every morning? \u00a0If I choose to spend my time reading something while I wait for you, that is my choice.\" \n \nHe goes on with a couple of other ugly, personal insults. \u00a0One of them I about why I eat \"disgusting guacamole.\" \u00a0I refuse to engage him in this nonsensical conversation. \u00a0I just drive, trying desperately to ignore him. \u00a0When we arrive at school, we do the usual dance. \u00a0He refuses to get out of the car, but this time he actually starts cursing at the people behind us in the car line. \u00a0(They don't hear him of course, but I do.) \u00a0Oops...that's my cue. \n \nI get out of the car and enter the building so that he no longer has an audience. \u00a0A few minutes later he gets out. \u00a0He comes in...I go out. \u00a0I return to my car...only this time he follows me. \"Why are you embarrassing me mom?\" \n \n\"You're embarrassing yourself. Go to class,\" I say calmly as I continue walking. \u00a0I get in the car and lock the door behind me.\u00a0\u00a0I leave...burning rubber behind me. \n \nAt 4:30 the storm blows back in and continues basically right where he left off. \u00a0He unloads the frustration of his day -of his life, on me. \u00a0Everything is exaggerated. \u00a0Everything is somehow my fault or my problem that I need to fix.  \n \nThe source of most of his fury -the main reason we said \" sayanara to Mr. Nice guy ,\" is the fact that he \"broke up\" with his best friend over the weekend. \u00a0His friend also has \"issues\" and when he is feeling down he has a tendency to be rather ugly to Red. \u00a0That's not to say that Red did not play a role in whatever they fell out about. \u00a0You put two kids together who lack appropriate social skills, and they both have disabilities -everything isn't going to be peachy all of the time. \n \nI listen. \u00a0I offer advice. \u00a0I console. \u00a0It all falls on deaf ears. \u00a0He talks calmly. \u00a0He rages. \u00a0He yells. He rants from one subject to the next -really just having a conversation with himself, but I am supposed to listen attentively. \u00a0If I give a suggestion he talks right over it. \u00a0All of that is fine --for the first hour and a half!  \n \nI am so glad that I scheduled my day so that I can go to a 6:30 p.m. yoga class. \u00a0I want out! \u00a0I want a glass of wine! \u00a0But I can't have wine and then go to yoga -I'd fall asleep during savasana (meditation). \u00a0Around 5:30 I start calling my husband. \u00a0\"Are you on your way? Where are you? How long before you can get here?\" \n \nMy mom finally felt sorry for me and asked him to come into to her room and talk to her for a while. \u00a0She's been trying really hard to stay out the middle of our madness, but he was relentless. \u00a0 Thank you Mom! \n \nMy husband walks in the door -I run out! \u00a0I almost drive right past the gym to my favorite margarita joint. \u00a0Determined to keep myself on the list, I pull into the gym. \u00a0I have not worked out this year! \u00a0It was good to be there. \u00a0I try my best to breathe and be present.  \n \n\"Breathe out all of the stress of the day deep take deep, cleansing breaths,\" says the yoga instructor. \n \n You have no idea!  I think to myself.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \nWhen I left the house, my husband said, \"Take your time.\" \u00a0When I leave the gym I thought -hmm he said take my time. \u00a0 Should I go to TJMaxx for shopping therapy?  \u00a0Somehow my car drove itself to Z-Tejas where I had a deep cleansing margarita all by myself. \u00a0I felt a little weird walking in alone, but it's not like I haven't done it before. \u00a0So much so -the waitresses all know me by name and favorite drink.  \n \nI sat at the table nursing one drink, \u00a0playing scrabble on my Kindle. \u00a0I had a party all by myself -other than the occasional visit from my favorite waitress, Raquel -who has become a friend.  \n \nYoga was good therapy...but margarita therapy was even better.  \n \n Readers -I love your comments!

That's awsome!\" \n\"You know, I really do have more friends than I say I do.

I act different around you -at home than I do at school. \u00a0I'm usually pretty happy at school most of the time. \u00a0I mean -I get sad sometimes, like because I don't have a girlfriend and I really want one.\" \n \nI'm sitting there just flabbergasted. \n \nWe go to his therapy appointment. \u00a0He is lucid, talkative, sitting up straight, using gestures and appropriate facial expressions, and even the occasional smile. \u00a0He talks about the movie he made with his \u00a0new camcorder.  \n \n\"So how is school going?\" asks doctor Stein (lets call him). \n\"Actually pretty good,\" Red replies. \n\"I talked to a lot of people today. \u00a0I actually have more friends than I thought I did.\" \n \nThey talk for a while. \u00a0The conversation is so positive it's hard to believe this is actually my son. \n \n\"Dr. Stein, I'm a little confused,\" I interject. \u00a0\"Every morning for two weeks we have been fighting tooth and nail, I mean yelling, screaming, refusing to go to school. \u00a0He's only been on time once in the past two weeks. He comes home everyday frowning, telling me how horrible his life at school is. \u00a0He uses that as the reason that he doesn't want to get out of bed and go to school on time.\" \n \n\"How about that Red? Why are you giving your mom such a hard time?\" the doctor asks. \n\"Well...I'm just tired in the morning.\" \n\"The funny thing about that is that he's the first one up\u00a0on weekends and while on we were on Christmas break,\" I say. \n\"It sounds like this is about motivation...not about being tired if you have no trouble getting up on the weekends,\" he says to Red. \u00a0\" \n\"Also...on weekends and during vacation their is less stress,\" he says while looking at me. \n \n\"Red -your mom also says that you come home and complain. \u00a0You're picking a fight every morning so that you can be late. \u00a0So what's up?\" \n \nRed looks around for a bunch of excuses. \u00a0None of them really add up. \u00a0He tries to blame me for \"yelling and being mean.\" \u00a0The doctor broke down that explanation by asking him, \"Is she yelling or just asking you to do something you don't want to do?\" \n \nRed admitted that to be true.  \n \n\"I don't know why I treat my mom so bad. \u00a0She's not really mean. \u00a0I just act different with her because I've been with her my whole life.\" In other words...I am most comfortable with her. \u00a0\"I really depend on my mom a lot.

{"date": "Saturday, January 15, 2011", "body": "\n Given Up -Linkin Park (One of Red's favorite songs by his favorite band) \n Stuck in my head again Feels like I'll never leave this place There's no escape I'm my own worst enemy\u00a0 I've given up I'm sick of feeling Is there nothing you can say Take this all away I'm suffocating Tell me what the f- is wrong with me! I don't know what to take Thought I was focused but I'm scared I'm not prepared I hyperventilate Looking for help somehow somewhere And no one cares I'm my own worst enemy \nOn Thursday morning we had a therapy appointment with the Pediatric Psychiatrist. \u00a0We see her about once a month to evaluate medications, to see how they are working, or not working, to determine if we need to make tweaks or adjustments.  \n \nHe doesn't particularly care for this doctor because she tells him the naked truth. \u00a0The truth can be painful. \u00a0She thinks that his behavior especially with me, borders on harassment and abuse. \u00a0She once told him if he didn't make some changes that she may have to take him out of this house for a while. \u00a0He definitely did not want to hear that. \n \nHe's sitting there in her office, \u00a0his head in his hands, looking down at the ground, frowning -like he's being tortured. \u00a0I tell her about the issues we've been having lately. The fighting every morning to get him out of bed and to school. \u00a0He tells her how miserable he is at school because he doesn't have any friends. \u00a0He says that he's so tired, that he's nearly falling asleep in classes. \u00a0He goes on to say that his fatigue is the reason he can't get up in the morning. \n \nWe call him on the fact that he got up easily during the break. \u00a0At the same time, she realizes that during school he is much more stressed. \u00a0The bottom line is that she increased his Focalin by 10 mg to help with his cognition during the school day. \u00a0I would say that the session was somewhat productive not fun, arduous -but worthwhile. \n \nI gave him a little break after the appointment. \u00a0I drop him off at Best Buy -while I run into Nordstrom Rack to look at shoes for a few minutes. \u00a0Afterward, we grab a couple of burgers for lunch. \u00a0Finally, I take him to get a haircut. \u00a0The day before, he came in home from school angry -starring in the mirror.  \n \n\"I'm ugly! Look at my eyes! Look at my hair! \u00a0I need a haircut. \u00a0That's why girls don't like me -that and the fact that all the girls at my school are white and I'm black. \u00a0They don't like me because I'm black!\" \n \n\"Son -no one in our family is ugly. \u00a0You are very attractive. \u00a0Try smiling and see how your eyes light up and you look so much better,\" I say as he's staring in the mirror. \n \n\"I can't smile.\" \n \nHe does look ten times better with his haircut and his face shaved. \u00a0He grows these soft little baby hairs on his face. \u00a0When they are shaved it really does help light up his face. \u00a0When he stands up straight and tall and holds his head up. \u00a0He really is quite handsome. \n \nI tell him, \"Honey, you have to love yourself before you can expect anyone else to love you. \u00a0You have to believe that you're handsome for other people to feel that.\" \u00a0Again, I remind him that all of the men in our family are black, handsome and smart. \u00a0He is no different. \u00a0What's more -they are loved by women and his time will come. \u00a0\"When you mature and start loving yourself...you will find the right girl.\" \n \nI may as well be speaking French. \u00a0He doesn't get it. \u00a0He doesn't believe it. \u00a0The problem couldn't be something that  he  could fix. \u00a0It has to be everyone else's problem. \n \nWhen we arrive at school it is his lunch time. \u00a0I encourage him to go up to his social skills classroom since he has already eaten lunch. \u00a0He opts to go to the cafeteria to \"hang out\" instead. \u00a0 He did stand with his head erect and took the frown off of his face -no smile, but no frown.  \n \nI am worried about him wandering aimlessly through the cafeteria with no special education staff or student mentors on alert. \u00a0Instinctively, I decide to skulk around behind him to observe his behavior. \u00a0I want to see for myself if he is actually having a good time at school, while making me think that he is miserable. \u00a0I also wondered if he was acting \"weird\" and freaking people out.  \n \nFrom across the room I watch. \u00a0He paces back and forth -never sitting down. \u00a0He exchanges a few words with someone sitting at a table. \u00a0I couldn't see who. \u00a0He paces around some more -looking completely lost and out of place. \u00a0It broke my heart.  \n \n \nI am instantly taken back to a high school experience of my own. \u00a0After leaving middle school, where I had a wonderful circle of friends and knew just about everyone, I went into a high school where I hardly knew anyone. \u00a0I walked around feeling lost, lonely and out of place. \u00a0The few people I knew, I could never find them. \u00a0I just stood around, trying not to look conspicuous -praying that others didn't know how lost and pathetic I was feeling. \u00a0I came home everyday and cried and begged my mother to transfer me to another school. \u00a0A week later -I enrolled at another high school that my best friend attended. \u00a0I didn't know many people, but I at least I had one person in my corner. \n \nThe pain that Red has been feeling suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks. \u00a0He is just as lost as I was for that one week -only it keeps on going, and going, like the Energizer bunny. \u00a0Not only that -but he has no clue what to do about it. \u00a0He is trying desperately to cling to a friendship with a girl that he has known since kindergarten. \u00a0The problem is -she has a boyfriend and they don't want to be bothered with a third wheel, especially a third wheel who is socially clueless.  \n \nThere are other boys in his social skills class who reach out to him, but for whatever reason he rejects that friendship. \u00a0The only person he really hangs with -is another boy, who also has special needs and is even more socially clueless than he is. \u00a0However -he knew this boy last year in middle school, so there is a sense of familiarity -a comfort zone. \u00a0He hangs out with him, \u00a0although deep inside he's feeling like this isn't good enough.  Why can't I walk the hallways with a group of friends laughing? Why can't I have a special girl who likes me just the way I am? \n \nHere enlies the anger that he comes home with everyday. \u00a0This is why he HATES going to school. \u00a0In the hallways he sees kids walking in clumps, talking and laughing -being silly while he walks alone. \u00a0In corners he sees couples hugging and sitting on each others laps, kissing and smiling at each other. \u00a0He wants it too. \u00a0He wants it desperately -but he has NO IDEA how to go about getting it. \n \n He is trapped behind the glass doors of his own mind. \u00a0In some ways...he is his \"own worst enemy\". \n \nI MISS YOUR COMMENTS READERS! \u00a0PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS.  \n \n Please take a few seconds to click through and vote!

{"date": "Monday, January 31, 2011", "body": "\n It's an \"early release\" day in our school district. \"A teacher's treasure is a parent's miserable afternoon.\" \u00a0This was what I tried to post on Facebook that morning.\u00a0For some reason the post didn't go through. \u00a0I took it as a sign from God. \n \nThey arrive within minutes of each other around 1:30 p.m. \u00a0Blue comes in first and quickly reminds me of our tradition to go out to lunch on early release days. \u00a0I hadn't even realized they were getting out early until early that morning. \u00a0I hadn't planned on going out. \u00a0Red and I had hardly been getting along for days, and I really did not want to take him anywhere.  \n \nI call their dad and ask him if he can break away from work for an hour to meet us for lunch. \u00a0I really did not want to be out in public --alone, with both of them with all of the fighting and discontent that we have been dealing with lately. Thankfully, he agrees to meet us. \u00a0I let him choose the place because the boys were debating about it. \u00a0Everyone has their reasons for wanting this place and hating that place.  \n \n \"I threw up the last time we went there!\" \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"That place has hot girls that wait on you!\" \n \n \"That place doesn't have good cheeseburgers.\" \n \n \"I don't want to see a bunch of hot girls! That's embarrassing!\"\u00a0 \n We have a nice lunch together. \u00a0Both of the boys are having a real love affair with their dad right now, which is more than alright with me. \u00a0Dad has been taking Red to school for the past week. \u00a0He gets up and gets ready for school with no argument -and of course, their is no stalling and arguing once they arrive. He and his dad have even had a \"guys day out\" one Saturday. \u00a0This is huge! \n \nBlue has always been majorly impressed with his father. \u00a0He wants to be just like him in so many ways. He definitely doesn't want his dad to be upset with him.  \n \nOver lunch, they all enjoy talking \"geek\" together. \u00a0I'm sitting there trying my best not to zone out of the geek talk. \u00a0They all love computers and all things electronic. \u00a0The boys naturally gravitate towards the same things as their father \u00a0--science, history, cars and action movies. \u00a0Blue, however is a little more well rounded. \u00a0He not only has his father's science and math brain. \u00a0 He also has my arts and writing brain. \u00a0Red -now I'm not sure whose brain he has! \u00a0He marches to his own beat. \n \nThe bottom line is --they are boys and I am so glad that they have their father as a positive male role model. \u00a0He is becoming even more important to them as they grow closer to becoming young men. And thank God for that! Hopefully, \u00a0this means I can run away from home more often!\u00a0 \n The restaurant where we meet for lunch is located near a park that the boys and I used to go to frequently. \u00a0The park is right behind a little shopping area called the Arboretum here in Austin. \u00a0We go there to have lunch or ice cream, hang out at the book store and the game store. \u00a0This is usually followed by a walk on the hiking trail down to the pond where we feed the ducks. \u00a0The last several times Blue and I have done this, Red has optioned out. \u00a0He complains and takes the joy out of it, so we usually let him stay home. \n On this day however, he is already with us so when Blue asks, \"Can we go down the trail and see the ducks?\" Red strongly objects. \"I don't want to go to that park! I want to go home!\" \n \"Why are you in such a hurry to get home? What to you have to do?\" I ask.\u00a0 \n \"I don't know. \u00a0I just don't want to go to that park! I hate that park!\"\u00a0 \n Well...these days he HATES EVERYTHING, especially anything that is not his idea!\u00a0 \n \"We're here. \u00a0You wanted to come with us today, and WE are going to the park. \u00a0If you want to stay in the car, you are welcome to do that,\" I say matter-of-factly.  \n \nHe continues to object. \u00a0I allow Blue to take the trail down and we meet him in the car at the bottom, near the pond so that Red can stay in the car if he so chooses. \u00a0That way he will be close enough for me to keep an eye on in case he changes his mind.\u00a0 \n It is a gorgeous spring-like, January day. \u00a0The sun is shining the temperature is hovering around 74 degrees. \u00a0How could we possibly pass up the chance to be out enjoying nature on a day like this? \u00a0Next week it could be freezing, raining or maybe even snowing! \n \nBlue and I walk leisurely alongside the pond observing the ducks swimming in patterns. \u00a0We quack in attempt to get them to come closer to us, though we have nothing to feed them today. \u00a0I watch parents with their toddlers and reminisce on the days when my boys were young, sweet and innocent like the 3 year old boy who is running away from his mother.  \n \n\"You see that. The little girl is sticking close to her mommy,\" I say aloud. \n \n\"What are you trying to say mom? Girls are better than boys?\" asks Blue. \n \n\"No...I'm just saying boys are impulsive. \u00a0They don't think about the repercussions of running away from their mother near a pond.\" Something that he and his brother used to do all the time. \n \nWe notice these two loud mouth geese sitting over near a picnic table. \u00a0They are squawking ostentatiously as if they are trying to tell us something. \u00a0Perhaps, \"Don't even think about coming to sit at this table!\" Or maybe, \"Don't you get near my babies!\" \n \nAs we start to mosey on back towards the car, they appear to be following us. \u00a0We stop and turn to look at them from up on the grassy area. \u00a0At first we think they are going to get in the water. \u00a0 Instead, they grab a quick drink to moisten their vocal cords so they can continue to squawk. \u00a0Then they turn and follow us up onto the grass. \u00a0They begin to walk faster and faster, talking to us the whole time. We keep walking. \u00a0Blue of course is getting a little nervous. \n \n\"Mom, maybe we should hurry. \u00a0They might bite us.\" \n \n\"I think they're trying to tell us something Blue. \u00a0Maybe they want to come home with us. Or maybe, they figure if Red won't come and see us...we will go see him!\" \n \nAt this point we are pretty close to the street. \u00a0From the car, Red sees them following us and gets out of the car. \n \n \n They thought his white shoe was a loaf of bread!\u00a0 \n \n \n This is the boy who absolutely, positively... \n\u00a0did not want to go to the park!\u00a0 \n \n I Live for your comments! \n \n \n Move me up in the ranks at Top Mommy -with just a quick click! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TUdSah_D8pI/AAAAAAAAAF8/gIkBsAKLHM0/s1600/IMAG0101.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TUdSVOxTVSI/AAAAAAAAAF4/bIkAaSY6kaQ/s1600/IMAG0100.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/01/duck-duck-goose.html", "title": "\nDuck Duck Goose\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 8, 2011", "body": "\n Today's Blog Gem \n \n Red is starting to work on his video editing business again. \u00a0I will be writing about that adventure very soon. \u00a0In the meantime here is a previous post that I think is still very relevant: \n \nI finally escaped to the movies with my girlfriend Friday afternoon.\u00a0 It took some maneuvering, switching child transporting duties over to my husband, but I managed it. We saw the movie \"Social Network\".\u00a0 Loved it! Very interesting subject matter, script and characters. \n \nAfterward my girlfriend and I debated whether or not the main character had Aspergers.\u00a0 I definitely think so. He was brilliant, but lacked facial expression, and social skills.\u00a0 He had friends, but did not really know how to interact with them.\u00a0 Had a girlfriend who he really liked, but because of his bluntness, and lack of social and communication skills, inability to be empathetic, he couldn't figure out how to keep her or his best friend.\u00a0 He had tunnel vision, hyper-focusing abilities, a great deal of intelligence.\u00a0 All he could see was his goal....what he wanted to do -which he hoped would finally lead him into social acceptance.\u00a0  \n \nSo that guy, Mark Zuckerberg -he lives here in my house.\u00a0 He's only 15 and he's black, he's not exactly a genious but he has that same hyper-focus on the things that he wants.\u00a0 He doesn't have the social skills to maintain relationships with peers, although he desperately wants to.\u00a0 He often self-sabotages himself with things he does and says.\u00a0 Of course he's a lot less mature than the college kid we saw in the movie.\u00a0 He is only 15 after all. \n \nHe has been hyper-focused lately on achieving the goal of buying a Blue-ray drive for his computer.\u00a0 We finally cut the cord and are unwilling to buy him anything other than basic food, shelter, and clothing.\u00a0 We can not please his insatiable appetite for all things electronic.\u00a0 He has been forced to come up with creative ways to earn money.\u00a0 He has a video editing business, he does chores, saves money from birthdays, Christmas, etc.\u00a0 The latest thing is that he wants to sell things he already has but doesn't use.\u00a0 The latest bright idea is to sell his television.\u00a0 He says he doesn't really watch it and would rather watch \"high-definition\" movies on his computer with his new wide-screen monitor.\u00a0 His older brother -who lives in his own apartment agreed to buy this tube television for $50.00.\u00a0 Of course, we haven't seen him or the money since they made this agreement. \n \nSo we're having a garage sale yesterday -and Mr. Impatient-Tunnel-Vision wants to put the t.v. out there.\u00a0 He is now willing to sell it for $30.00 to a stranger, rather than wait for his brother who really needs a television.\u00a0 Wow! I was like that is total 'Mark Zuckerberg character in the movie!' Forget about those who love and care about you...let's get to the bottom line --what I want now! As God would have it -the t.v. didn't sell at the garage sale.\u00a0 It will go to his brother today.  \n \nHyper-focus can be a good thing.\u00a0 I could make you extremely successful if it is put to good use -as Mr. Zuckerberg did with the invention and development of facebook, of which I am a major fan.\u00a0 It is one of my guilty pleasures --can't stay off of the damn thing.\u00a0 The question is, will that success bring you happiness? What I've seen so far -is that my son is never happy or satisfied for long.\u00a0 He reaches his goal of getting what he wants eventually -but then it's just on to the next thing that he wants. The movie also depicted an unhappy person who was very successful in the world of business.  \n \nIn my mind -true happiness comes from relationships with those who you love and who love you.\u00a0 It comes from experiences, not things.\u00a0 It comes from doing something for others who are less fortunate -or just plain old selfless giving.\u00a0 I don't know if that is something that my son will ever experience.\u00a0 And even if he does -will he ever be truly happy?\u00a0 As long as he thinks happiness comes from getting things -I don't see how he can be.\u00a0 I can try to teach selflessness but I don't know if I can break into his mind and heart.\u00a0 At some point it has to come from within.\u00a0 Does he even have the capacity to make that happen?\u00a0  \n \nPerhaps in the Aspergers mind -the idea of happiness is not the same as atypical people. Perhaps it is something I will never totally understand.

I've said before when he was younger -he would throw a fit on his brother's birthday. \u00a0When he got a little older -he would sing, \"Happy Birthday to Me\". \u00a0Last year on my birthday, he sat silently on the couch as the rest of the family gathered around to sing to me. \u00a0This year was no different.  \n \nThis year, our neighbors -friends we have known since we moved here 11 years ago, surprised me by stopping by the house to sing \"Happy Birthday.\" \u00a0It was so sweet and thoughtful. \u00a0I used to take care of these children everyday after school when they were in kindergarten and 3rd Grade. \u00a0Now G- is a junior getting ready for the prom and driving, and D.J. is in the 8th grade! \u00a0This gesture really made my day. \n \nAs they got ready to leave, G -who has grown into a gorgeous young lady says, \"Where's Red? \u00a0I want to say good-bye.\"  \n \nHe was in the kitchen actually crying -real tears. \u00a0Did it make him so sad that they came over to pay tribute to me? \u00a0Wow! \u00a0I couldn't believe it. \u00a0He pulled himself together so that G- could give him a hug and say good-bye. \u00a0I deflected from myself to tell them that Red was planning on trying out for the talent show at school. \u00a0They were of course thrilled for him and said they would love to come and support him. \u00a0I hoped that my gesture would pull him out of his funk. \n \nAfter they left, we sat down to have dinner. \u00a0He sat on the couch and started with the crying again. \u00a0I asked if he would join us at the table in prayer. \u00a0He said no of course. \u00a0I guilted him into it and he finally did. \u00a0I said a special prayer for him. \n \n\"Dear Lord -thank you for all of the blessings of this day. \u00a0For the cards, flowers, notes, phone calls and outpouring of love from all of my friends and family. \u00a0I like to give special thanks to the Moore family who reached out in a loving way by stopping by tonight. \u00a0For my friend Tona for taking me out to lunch today. And for all of the love that my immediate family has given me tonight. \u00a0I say a special prayer for Red. \u00a0That he will feel the love of everyone at this table who loves and supports him. \u00a0That he will be able to look at the positives in his life and feel good about himself.\" \n \nThroughout dinner -Red attempted to dominate the conversation. \u00a0I tell him, \"We are only going to talk about positive things during my birthday dinner.\" We had to continuously interject to keep the conversation positive. \u00a0By the end of dinner -he started to yell about the parental controls on his computer -that he wouldn't have enough time to work on his projects. \u00a0Although, he had spent the majority of his time during the evening complaining, and talking instead of using his computer time.  \n \nAfter he finally went upstairs, Blue says to me, \"I can't believe he ruined your birthday.\" \n \nTo which I reply, \"He didn't ruin my birthday. \u00a0He could only ruin my birthday if I gave him the power to do so. \u00a0I didn't give him that power. \u00a0I choose to look at all of the positives of this day. \u00a0No one can ruin your day unless you let them.\" \n \nHappy Birthday to Me! \n \n BTW...I have to give a special shout out to my husband who did EVERYTHING to make my birthday special. \u00a0He drove me to Houston to have lunch with my best friend, while he had a business meeting. \u00a0And on my special day -he bought me a Michael Jackson cupcake (black and white) among many other special gestures. \u00a0God Bless him -he's learning after 19 years together. \u00a0His contract has been renewed for another year! \n \n Your click below will be a wonderful gift...especially if you have never voted! \u00a0All you have to do is click. \u00a0Thank you!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7xSvGh2hiK0/TZ3XJd5MnxI/AAAAAAAAALA/zoheqmx157o/s1600/images-2.jpeg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2c17tTRKNKA/TZ3YY0wHpnI/AAAAAAAAALI/1508IyBjV8M/s1600/images-1.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/04/happy-birthday-to-me.html", "title": "\nHappy Birthday to Me\n"},

What do you want for breakfast today?\" \n \nMy eyes are closed! \u00a0 Why are they talking to me?

{"date": "Saturday, April 9, 2011", "body": "\n 7:25 a.m. -five minutes before it's time to get up for school, Blue hears singing coming through the walls of his bedroom. \u00a0He comes running, \"Mom! \u00a0He's singing! He woke me up! \u00a0Why do I have to wake up to this? \u00a0He's ruining my morning! \u00a0Why does he have to live here!!???\" \n \nI try to explain that it's time to get up anyway. \u00a0I ask him to lay down and let Daddy rub his back for a minute so that he can calm down.  \n \nHe's had it with his brother. \u00a0He went to bed, not exactly happy because in his opinion --his brother ruined my birthday the night before with his antics. \u00a0Now he wakes up to this irritation.  \n \nA couple of nights before that Red had a meltdown at bedtime that ruined Blue's nightly routine.\u00a0When Red melts down it's hard to tell what is acting and what is real. \u00a0He screams like Chester from Linkin Park in a rock song. \u00a0He can make himself cry. \u00a0His words are full of drama. \u00a0He blames everyone else for his problems and turns the table on the issue at hand. \n \n\"Why are you guys being mean to me? Why do you only care about yourself? \u00a0Why are you making me suffer? \u00a0Why are you abusing me? \u00a0Why do you have to force me to do things? You're not being fair! \u00a0You're being selfish! \u00a0This is your fault! \u00a0This is Blue's fault!\" \n \nHe balls his fist and hits doors, tables, pounds his bed, harasses the dog, he invades my personal space, follows me around closely. \u00a0 I assure him that any physical damage will be paid for with his money. \u00a0If he doesn't have enough, we will sell something that belongs to him to pay for it. \n \nHe doesn't scare me in the least, because I mostly see it as drama \u00a0-a way of acting out his pain or frustration with himself. \u00a0I have what may very well be a delusional attitude that I will knock the shit out of him if he goes too far. \u00a0Mind you -I am 5 ft. nothing and he is 5ft 10\" and weighs twice as much as I do. \n \nBlue however, sees Red's behavior as a threat to our safety and security. \u00a0It isn't fair that he has to live with this. \u00a0Blue suffers from anxiety and these antics make him nervous. \u00a0He told his dad the other night, \"I'm just afraid that one of these days, he's going to break something or hurt someone.\" \n \nMy husband says to me, \"Blue is really nervous and anxious about his brother's behavior. \u00a0He says, Red needs to go. \u00a0He doesn't want him to live here anymore.\" \n \nI respond, \"He's also nervous and anxious about thunderstorms. \u00a0We can't make those go away. \u00a0We can't just give up on his brother.\" \u00a0Of course, that's not what my husband was asking but he and Blue are both right, he shouldn't have to grow up with this.  \n \nFortunately for Blue, a very low dosage of medication keeps his tantrums under control. \u00a0Where his brother who is on several meds, at maximum dosage, is anything but under control. \u00a0He does manage to hold things together very well when he's at school. \u00a0Here at home is another story all together. \u00a0I swear I hate this whole trial and error psychiatric medication crap! \n \nWhat is choice, \u00a0what is real, and what do we do about it? \u00a0I find myself pondering that all too often. \u00a0Blue thinks the answer is to send his brother away -give him to another family. \u00a0Give him to the circus! \u00a0The only problem with that is we  live in the Circus. \u00a0 Just call me \u00a0 the Ringmaster. \u00a0 \n \n I Love Your Comments! \u00a0 \n If \u00a0you're new to the blog click below to show me some love~ \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-efSKH6ygJ2c/TaClx7TKWhI/AAAAAAAAALM/FEv34eCSEQs/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/04/life-in-circus.html", "title": "\nLife in the Circus\n"},

Yay!!!! I am off to Los Angeles to see my Dad who is turning 82 on Friday. \u00a0He is almost as crazy as my son, but he's 82, it's not going to change and at least I don't have to live with him. This man thinks that the word motherf*#ker is the best word in the English language. \u00a0I will also get to see all of my friends and brothers and sisters. \u00a0Los Angeles is where I grew up. \u00a0 \n Aspergers Dad -will be on Mommy duty for 5 days. \u00a0He actually will take off work in order to do so. \u00a0 What do you mean? \u00a0You can't focus 100% on your high-pressure, demanding job and take care of these kids at the same time?  \u00a0Don't feel too sorry for him. \u00a0He left me alone with them during Spring Break and does so quite often when he travels for business. \u00a0( I think his business trips are really pleasure. \u00a0He gets to sleep every night in a nice quiet hotel room and have fine dining and cocktails on the companies dime. \u00a0Business my arse!)\u00a0 \u00a0 \n Besides, my mom is here to help with the cooking, washing and to call 911 in case we need to haul someone off to the looney bin.\u00a0 \n Good news to come about Blue's ARD meeting. \u00a0Will post soon.\u00a0 \n Show me some love by clicking, commenting or both. \u00a0Didn't you know you have to work when you come here?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QTgHAGzD964/Ta2kSJqMqSI/AAAAAAAAALs/XezQJ8wabMs/s1600/signheavenhell.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/04/hell.html", "title": "\nHell\n"},

That doesn\u2019t have to make you upset. You can still choose to be happy. If your child is moping about and grumbling about her life, guess what? You don\u2019t have to pull her out of her emotional ditch to feel good about yourself. You can still find joy. Even if your child is yelling at you how horrible you are, you do not have to take it personally. You can find peace.\u00a0 This is a very freeing sentiment because it allows you to recognize a simple and powerful truth. No one can make you feel anything. When this truth can sink in, you will be in a much better position to really be with your child as they go through these difficult emotions. And they will see that you are stronger than the winds blowing around you. They will naturally gravitate towards you and your calm so that you will be able to provide comfort, consequences, or clarity when they need it most.\" \n Hal Runkel,\u00a0LMFT, Author of\u00a0 ScreamFree Parenting \u00a0and\u00a0 ScreamFree\u00a0 Marriage\u00a0 \n \n \nNow I know we are all have our moments. \u00a0Lets face it, our kids are extremely challenging. \u00a0So many times I've said to myself, \u00a0 Why do I have to feel every single emotion that they are feeling?\u00a0 \u00a0I mean it's freakin' exhausting. \u00a0Especially, when half the time Red (my 15 year old) goes through these tantrums with the sole purpose of getting a reaction from me. \u00a0 Imagine if even half the time that our children are upset, we could  choose  to stay calm, and happy. \u00a0Do you think it might rub off on them? \u00a0We could just say, \"I'm sorry you feel your life is so horrible, but I am choosing to be happy. \u00a0I'm going to focus on the positive things in my life.

I love my children dearly. \u00a0I hope that comes across here. \u00a0I do not however always \"like\" their behavior -in fact sometimes I hate it. \u00a0I am appalled by it.

He's not the kind of guy who's going to knock you upside the head if you don't eat your vegetables, but my son probably isn't so sure about that.  \n \nThe truth is, my son manages to behave well with any member of the family, who doesn't live in this house. \u00a0He used to behave well for my mother, before she moved in with us. \u00a0All she had to do was call and tell him, \"Get in the shower and stop giving your mother a hard time.\" He was in the shower before I could hang up the phone. \u00a0Now, he covers his ears when she admonishes him. \n \nThe images on this video made me suddenly feel inadequate as a mother. (What else is new?) \u00a0Of course it's all my fault that he doesn't eat healthily hear at home. \u00a0It's because I let him get away with it. \u00a0It's because I give him a choice. \u00a0It's because there's too much junk food here in the house. \u00a0Oh and the best one of all...it's because I hate cooking!  \n \nIf I must say so myself, I am a pretty good cook. \u00a0I still like to cook and entertain my friends, that is when I'm not to exhausted. \u00a0The art of cooking and eating well, runs in my family. \u00a0My mom, my dad, my brother and my sister, are all excellent cooks. \u00a0In fact, we compete over who makes the best macaroni and cheese, the best chili, and the best caramel cake. \n \nMost of the time however, cooking feels like just another chore on my long list. \u00a0It's not particularly enjoyable when your children do not appreciate it. \u00a0It's a lot of freaking work to cook only to have people look at you like you're serving poop on a plate. \n \nI cook a good meal, and even my husband turns his nose up at leftovers. \u00a0He loves my cooking, but I guess only the first time I serve it. \u00a0He calls me from work and if leftovers are on the menu I get, \"I'll stop and pick something up.\" \u00a0(He will totally deny it when and if he reads this.) \n \nSo getting Red -my 15 year-old, Aspergers boy to eat healthy is just one of the many battles that give me combat fatigue. \u00a0Blue is a little more flexible in the eating department. \u00a0He drinks vegetable/fruit juice daily, and will eat a few bites of veggies if they are put on his plate. \u00a0He won't be happy about it...but he'll do it. \n \nAfter I picked my bottom lip off of the floor, and finished beating myself up...I came back to reality and realized that most children behave better for other people than they do for their parents. \u00a0The contrast in our particular situation is just so vast. I find that with Aspergers, most things are to the extreme and come along with a good deal of drama. \n \nI am his mother...he feels no need to impress me. \u00a0He doesn't have to put on the pretense of being the nice boy who everyone loves and will want to have around. \u00a0At least he has the ability to pull his crap together when he needs to, right? He knows, that I love him unconditionally. \u00a0He believes that I have no choice but to put up with his shenanigans. \u00a0I have no choice but to have him live in our home.  \n \nOr do I? \n \n THANK YOU!\u00a0 \n \n \n A special shout out of \u00a0THANKS to all of my family who loved, entertained and spent time with my special boy. \u00a0I can't tell you how much I appreciated the much needed reprieve. \u00a0Auntie Sheila, Uncle Damon and little Damon, Uncle Ward, Auntie Sandy, Cousin Erin, Uncle Kevin and cousin Karsen, Grandfather and Mary. \u00a0 \n \n \n p.s.

Mom and Dad are not going to simply hand it over.\u00a0 \n \nIf we continue on the same course, what the heck will he ask for next year?\u00a0 Or I should say, next month because undoubtedly he will be asking for something else within weeks of Christmas.\u00a0 \n \nHe does work periodically editing videos for friends and family members, sometimes even for teachers at school.\u00a0 He makes an introduction, transitions, mixes still photos with video and ends it with a list of credits like a professional movie. \n \nLuckily, his dad has a work-related video project that he can work on over the break that he will pay him for.\u00a0 This will add to his savings.\u00a0 At the same time, hopefully it will keep him occupied some over the break.\u00a0 \n \nLast night, Blue blew a gasket when I told him he could stop editing his list because I'm done shopping.\u00a0 In his eyes that means I'm not getting him anything he asked for.\u00a0 I can't tell you how he arrived at that deduction. \n \n\"Do you have any idea how much I am worried about Christmas!?\" he said. \n \nI left the house to meet my husband for dinner while Blue wasn't talking to me.\u00a0 By the time I came home, he had taken a nap, calmed down and sincerely apologized.\u00a0 Not like the scripted apology I often get from Red as he continues doing whatever it is that he is apologizing for.  \n \nI will have to admit, Red sent me a very eloquently written e-mail with his list. (Actually he has sent me about 6 revised lists.)\u00a0 The e-mail was well thought out, structured, very detailed and the grammar was perfect.\u00a0 He even came across as asking, not demanding.\u00a0 Maybe all of his communication should be in writing.\u00a0 When he gets to talking -there's no telling what will come out of his mouth. \n \nSometimes when I repeat back to him what he has said he tells me,  \"You can't listen to everything I say!\u00a0 I didn't mean that.\"\u00a0 \n \nThat's another fabulous Asperger's trait -being brutally honest, and sometimes talking without thinking.\u00a0 There is definitely no planning or thought of how what he is saying sounds or how it makes another person feel. \n \nI can not say here, in this forum what will really be under the tree this year.\u00a0 What I can promise is that we will be creative and do the best that we can with the resources we have.\u00a0  \n \nThe boys don't know this yet...but we're going to spend next week shopping for another family who is less fortunate than we are.\u00a0 Think it will make them pay attention and have a little more gratitude? \n \nThat is my Christmas wish.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/12/christmastime-part-2.html", "title": "\nChristmastime... part 2\n"},

It was great -until I got to the airport to come back home when I get one of those infamous phone calls. \n \n   \n Yes -that's right. \u00a0The shit hit the fan on my very last day. \u00a0My mom calls to ask me a question about medication. \u00a0She also fills me in on the days events. \"We had the opportunity to walk in your shoes today. We now know what you go through.\" \u00a0 \n \n   \n This time, my husband was there to field the phone call from school, \"You need to come and pick up your son. \u00a0We can't put him on the bus because he is seeking attention by making suicidal threats.\" Aspergers dad -was in the middle of carpooling Blue and his friends when he gets the call. \u00a0He had to drop them off and go over to the high school to retrieve an angry, unhappy Aspergers teen.  \n \n   \n After a conversation with the school Psych -Red apologized for making those statements. \u00a0He says he was just angry and didn't know what else to say to express his anger. \u00a0There is a wall full of positive statements written and posted all over the walls to remind him of all of the good things in his life. \u00a0The staff is \u00a0trying their best to be supportive.  \n \n   \n By the time they get home...he goes back to the negative script, \"Ms. so and so is just mean! \u00a0No one cares about me! \u00a0The work is just too hard! \u00a0The classes are too loud. \u00a0I hate the cafeteria. \u00a0Maybe I should go to the hospital. \u00a0I have no other choice.\"  \n \n   \n The following morning I call his Psychiatrist's office to fill her in on the days events. \u00a0She wants to see him. \u00a0Instead of me falling back into bed because I am jet-lagged, I get myself together to take him to see her. \u00a0She almost hospitalized him based on his statements. \u00a0He talked his way out of it. \u00a0Assured her that he just needed to rest at home and wait for the tweak in his medication to kick in. \u00a0He promised that if he had any more serious bouts with anger he would be willing to go to the hospital. \u00a0She gave him a mental health day off from school and sent us on our way with a medication adjustment. \n \n   \n It just doesn't seem right that a kid should have so many different meds on board just to make it through the day at school. \u00a0At the same time, we can't have him exploding all over the place, making threats and creating havoc at school and at home making himself and everyone around him miserable. The whole situation is just screwed!  \n \n   \n It's a really difficult decision to give your kid medication, but when he's full of anxiety, depression, anger and heavy moods you feel helpless. \u00a0I feel inclined to take the advice of the professionals who are close to the situation and have all of the facts to help them make an informed decision on how to proceed. \u00a0I just wish their was a better way -you know, like a miracle. \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n If you have any thoughts or feelings about your child, Aspergers and medication...I would love to hear your feedback. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qETxR2Kb-j0/TbgxQRwFV0I/AAAAAAAAAMg/utmnvQvKhWw/s1600/images-17.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/04/that-aint-right_27.html", "title": "\nThat Ain't Right!\n"},

They don't have to be expensive places. \u00a0He just wants to get out of the house, change his environment, see and do something to change the flow of things. \u00a0We can go to the mall, just to walk and look. \u00a0We don't have to  buy  anything. \u00a0He also  loves  to go out to eat. \u00a0I don't know where he got that from. (I say with sarcasm.) \u00a0That is a trait on my side of the family and since my husband and I have been married, and we are no longer in dire straits for money, he loves it too. \u00a0We waste a lot of money on this habit. \n \nOn Thanksgiving day Blue comes down to the kitchen as my mom and I are cooking and asks, \"So what are we going to do today?\" \n\"We're doing it,\" I reply. \n\"You mean I can't go anywhere?\" \n\"Well, you were invited to your friends house in the neighborhood. \u00a0You can get dressed and go over there.\" \n\"They probably won't answer if I call.\" \n\"Well, there's only one way to find out.\"  \n \nThis friend's mother seldom answers the phone for some reason. \u00a0I explained that it doesn't matter. \u00a0He was invited, and anytime he wanted to go, I would take him. \u00a0He wasn't really satisfied with this answer. \u00a0He wanted to go somewhere FUN! \u00a0And that wasn't happening...and so we have a miniature meltdown.  \n \n\"Son...you told me that you wanted to be at home for the holidays this year. \u00a0You also said you wanted peace. \u00a0I gave you that. \u00a0I sent your brother to California so that we could have a peaceful, quiet holiday. \u00a0Yet, somehow you're still not happy. \u00a0I don't understand.\"  \n \nA few \"Skittles\" and minutes later, he pulled himself together, took a shower, got dressed and headed off to his friends house. \u00a0They played games, and jumped on the trampoline for a while. \u00a0They had a good time. \u00a0He called for me to pick him up in time for dinner. \n \nI'd spent the entire day cooking. My mother who taught me how to cook, was there only as my assistant. \u00a0I wanted her to TAKE OVER...no such luck. \u00a0I found it all so anti-climatic \u00a0-all day cooking for a meal that was over in less than a half-hour without any fanfare.  \n \nThe prodigal son (our 22 year-old) returned to the nest along with his girlfriend for dinner. \u00a0We are all a little pissed with him, since he hasn't called or come to visit in several weeks. \u00a0Lately, it seems like the only time he comes \u00a0or calls is when he needs something. \u00a0We are terribly disappointed at how self-centered and selfish he has turned out to be. \u00a0He has little or no time for his brothers who really could use the example of a neuro-typical big brother, a mentor in their lives. \u00a0Instead, both of the younger boys know that they can't depend on their brother to be there for them. \u00a0He may come through, he may not. \u00a0We tried for the sake of the holiday to keep things pleasant and peaceful. \u00a0And we almost made it...but I won't get into that. \n \nThe turkey was moist. \u00a0I cooked it upside down, in a bag so that all the juice flows into the breast. I added a two expensive cheeses to my macaroni, to give it a little pizazz. \u00a0Everyone said they \u00a0loved my experimental stuffing. \u00a0It was Emeril's recipe that he made on \"Good Morning America\" -Wild mushroom stuffing. \u00a0I thought it was just o.k. \u00a0It was delicious the next day as leftovers.  \n \nIn my younger days, I used to so look forward to the holiday season. \u00a0It was all about the social aspects of it -all of the parties and family gatherings. \u00a0Now it just seems it's all about work! \u00a0Cooking, cleaning, decorating, shopping, more cleaning, and then putting away the decorations. \u00a0The next holiday meal I cook will be beg, borrowed, picked-up, catered -whatever!

This meant he walked out the door with out taking his medication. \u00a0 I realized it almost immediately, but I was too exhausted to deal with it right away.\u00a0 There have been days where he has gone without it and been fine.\u00a0 This was not one of those days. I had my coffee, took a shower and got dressed and finally headed over to the school.  \n \nAs was signing in at the school office, my cell phone rings.\u00a0 Guess what? It's the school calling.\u00a0 His teacher tells me that he is having a rough morning and needs to talk to me.\u00a0 What a surprise. I go to the classroom to find out what's been going on.\u00a0 My head starts to spin as I listen to the deplorable things my child has said to another student and the expletives he has used towards teachers and staff.\u00a0 Yes...children with Aspergers have melt-downs in which they go into rage and say things they don't mean.\u00a0 But the things that were said to his peer seemed just mean spirited -deplorable.\u00a0 I was embarrassed to say the least.\u00a0 How could a child of mine be so mean? I am doing everything I possibly can to love support and help him.\u00a0 Therapists, doctors, counselors, grandparents, teachers, all telling him the same thing.\u00a0 Yet his thinking is that we are all wrong.\u00a0 It's the world according to him.\u00a0 Nothing would to be penetrate line of deranged thinking.\u00a0 Their was no remorse for how he was treating this other student.\u00a0 In his mind, the other student was wrong for not being his friend and for being rude to him.\u00a0 His definition of rudeness by the way, is not speaking to him in the same \"friendly\" way she speaks to others. \n \nI understand the need for social acceptance is huge. He is reacting to what he feels is just another rejection from a friend.\u00a0 What I don't understand the belief that you can change or control others. I don't understand because it doesn't make any sense. Irrational thinking has a tendency to do that. You can get them do behave the way you want them to behave, especially by being mean to them.\u00a0 How could think that would possibly work? \n \nI also have the frustration with the whole medication issue and finding the right combination.\u00a0 The ambivalent emotion about him having to take  anything  at the same time knowing it is an absolute necessity.\u00a0 Worry about the stigma of all of the above -yet knowing that I don't really have a choice.\u00a0 This day was proof that he needs the medication. However, it did seem that since he started the latest one, he is more irritable and angry.\u00a0 The most simple requests turn into a fight.\u00a0 He is totally unreasonable. \n \nWhen I call the doctor to tell her what I am noticing, she suggests taking him to the full dosage of the new med.\u00a0 \"We are not seeing the result of the full dosage.\" I'm not a doctor.\u00a0 I'm a mom and to me this didn't make any sense.\u00a0 I couldn't bring myself to take her advice.\u00a0 In fact, I took him off the med all together.\u00a0 I did increase the dosage on one of the other meds as directed by the doctor. \n \nI also kept him home for a couple of days so that I could observe his reaction to these changes before throwing him back into the fire at school.\u00a0 He was on a downward spiral and I could only see it getting worse.\u00a0 He needed a break. \n \nOver the next two days, his demeanor was measurably improved.\u00a0 We went to see his therapist and for the first time in months and he was able to process through his feelings and actions and came to terms with his error in judgment.

He is an excellent provider and I know that he loves me and our children with all of his heart.\u00a0 Just last week, he took a day off and spent it with me.\u00a0 We went to lunch, followed by a leisurely walk, passed by Tiffany, where I coaxed him to going in to \"just look\" and I came out with a brand new necklace.\u00a0 I indulged him afterward by going to a bloody movie, full of violence, which is totally not my cup of tea.\u00a0 But that's what you do for the man you love.\u00a0 A few months ago, he totally indulged me by allowing my mom to move in with us, which involves a whole other level of sacrifice.\u00a0 So far, it's been more of a blessing than anything else. \u00a0  \n \nWhen it comes to raising our Asperger's children however, I often feel like I'm on my own --like I'm the only one who gets it.\u00a0 My husband has this \"old school\", traditional mentality. But these are not traditional, atypical children.\u00a0 He sees many of their ASD behaviors as a personal affront to him and/or the rest of the world.\u00a0 Thus, he wants to discipline them as such, weather or not it works to change any behaviors and often despite the fact that it usually makes matters worse.\u00a0 He's a guy -so when he sees my son being aggressive, not listening and driving me batty, he wants to step in even more aggressively than my son is behaving, in order to let him know exactly who is the alpha male in the house.\u00a0 His aggression makes the sons aggression worse.\u00a0 It certainly doesn't  teach  him anything. I understand the whole I will protect my family ' by any means neccessary'  mentality.\u00a0 However what the aspie teen and preteen needs is balance and calm when they are out of control.\u00a0 Yelling or litterally putting them into a corner, will not get them to buy anything that your selling, much less to absorb it into their psyche.\u00a0 Instead they begin to resent and loose respect for you. \n \nThat's all well and good as far as hubby is concerned.\u00a0 The problem comes in when I want to leave them with dad so that I can have a reprieve, but they want nothing to do with him because, \"he's mean\".\u00a0 And that's o.k., I leave them anyway, when I really need a break.\u00a0 However, that makes my homecoming more stressful.\u00a0 It can also mean dozens of phone calls while I'm away.\u00a0 I am actively learning how to ignore these calls or turn the phone off. It's a work in progress...just like the rest of my life.  \n \nGranted --he works a full-time, very demanding job.\u00a0 On top of that, he is a perfectionist, work-aholic.\u00a0 He gives 150% to his job and he doesn't have a whole lot left over for anything else.\u00a0 I am a full-time mother.\u00a0 The kids are my job.\u00a0 I spend my days, reading and researching Aspergers, taking them to therapists, dealing with teachers, school-psychologists and counselors -advocating for them to have their needs met in the educational setting, and trying to figure out the best way to parent them.\u00a0 NO ONE else does that. Yet, many people want to have a say on how to discipline them.\u00a0 That would include of course, their father, my mother who now lives with us, and any relative whom they spend time with. \n \nYesterday hubby had the day off and son had an appointment scheduled with his therapist. Did hubby get up in time to go to said appointment? NO! Why did I want him to attend, so that we could try to get somewhere on the same page when it comes to dealing with him --so that he could perhaps understand why he does some of the things he does to irritate and annoy us.\u00a0 When I try to tell hubby anything with regards to what I've read or what professionals say, he thinks I'm just being an overprotective, coddling mother.\u00a0 It couldn't be that I have any expert knowledge based on what I deal with everyday. \"When they go out into the real world -nobody's gonna give a shit that they have Aspergers. I'm trying to prepare them for reality.\" That's a valid thought process.\u00a0 But does it help us have peace in our house?  \n \nNow we have Nana living with us, who is seriously \"old school\" and bless her heart, she tries to \"get it\" but she sees some of their behaviors as just plain, rude, obnoxious and annoying.\u00a0 They are just that on the surface, but their are underlying reasons why some things just are. She wants to protect  her child  who is being driven to the nut house and guess who's driving. \n \n \nI love them with everything within me -and even I loose my patience at times.\u00a0 I am human.\u00a0 I just find it hard to listen to the advice of those who have not been educated to understand Aspergers.

There is also many request for overextended hugs from me -not to express love or affection, but to slow down the process of getting ready, to control and annoy me if only for a few moments.\u00a0 Daily I say, \"You'll get your hug when you're ready and on your way out the door.

{"date": "Monday, August 30, 2010", "body": "\nWow! So Facebook is all the rage in our house -at least for me and my teenage son.\u00a0 For me, it's a connection to the outside world that I don't get see all that much of.\u00a0 It's adult dialogue with friends old and new, near and far.\u00a0 Most of my friends are not near...they are all over the U.S.\u00a0 It is way cool to communicate with friends from high school who are my age and have children who are the age we were when we met.\u00a0 We're all on the other side of watching teenagers grow up.\u00a0 It's a way to stay connected and know what's going on with your friends from day to day.\u00a0 Who has time or peace and quiet long enough for lengthy conversations on the phone.\u00a0 It's an opportunity to quickly share joys and triumphs as well as commiserate over difficult moments.\u00a0 It's the water-cooler conversation for those of us who work at home. \n \nOn the other hand for my son who is socially immature -he can communicate with a number of people without having to worry about facial expressions and reading social cues.\u00a0 He can chat online in the comfort of his room without being in some busy, loud, social setting, which makes communication for him much more difficult.\u00a0 He has many more Facebook friends than  real friends  -meaning the ones you hang out with regularly.\u00a0 It makes him feel more a part of the teenage culture. \n \nOn the other, other hand --he sometimes can be just as socially inept online, as he is in real life.\u00a0 That would be the case on Saturday evening when he decided to write on the wall of one of his friends. \n \n\"Dude -why do you have to go out with L? I mean I'm so jealous.\u00a0 I've known her for a long time.\u00a0 We live in the same neighborhood.\u00a0 I really like her. She's the only girl who is really nice to me.\u00a0 I want to go out with her.\" \n \nWOW! This is what he writes on this girl's boyfriend's wall for all the teenage world to see!  Dude -I really like your girlfriend.\u00a0 Can't you just stop going out with her so that I can?!\u00a0 I mean -just hand her over! Give her up...don't you see that I need her to be my girlfriend.\u00a0 You can have any girl you want, but my resources are limited -so I need this one.\u00a0 She's the only girl I know who is nice to me and kind of understands me. \n \nI was just flabbergasted when he told me so matter-of-factly that this is what he had done. \u00a0   Luckily for him the dude didn't try to find him so that he could come and kick his a*#!\u00a0 In God's infinite wisdom -this young man happened to be a Christian and decided to respond amicably. \n \n\"Dude -I'm sorry but L and I are going to be going out for a long time. So you're going to have to find someone else.\" \n \nThen other teens chime in, \"The way to find a girlfriend is just hang out with friends.\u00a0 Become friends with a girl and maybe one of them will hook you up with one of their friends who is single.\" \n\"Dude -you gotta just relax about it.\u00a0 Let the girls come to you!\" \n \nIn other words,  don't act so desperate!  \n \n \nI was actually impressed with the advice that these kids were giving him.\u00a0 They actually were using the same words that I have said to him myself like a zillion times! But hey -what do I know? \n \nHis first reaction when the boy very nicely told him basically - Dude -it's not happening... was rage! He pounded doors and his bed!\u00a0 Screamed, \"I Want a F-ing girlfriend! IT's NOT FAIR!\" He charged through the house looking for his little brother to pound on, luckily he was gone out.\u00a0 When he came to his senses and reduced his tone -I asked him what happened to make him react like this.\u00a0 He told me the whole scenario. \n   \n \"Wow -you have a lot of nerve kid! I can't believe you did that!\"  He looked astonished.  What...what did I do? \u00a0 He had no clue how much nerve it  should  have taken to dare to post such a thing.\u00a0 I painted the picture for him. \n \n\"What if\u00a0 some old boyfriend of mine called up your dad and said, 'Hey dude...I made a mistake when I let your wife walk out of my life all those years ago.\u00a0 I really haven't found anyone else like her and I don't think I will, so would you do me a big favor and just give her up.\u00a0 I mean -haven't you been married to her long enough?\u00a0 It's really not fair -I really want to marry her.\"  Hey -it could happen!  \n \nHe had that deer in the headlights look on his face -completely oblivious that was what he had essentially just done.\u00a0 I encouraged him to apologize to the young man and the young lady.\u00a0 He felt so bad.\u00a0 He wrote, \"Maybe I should just delete my facebook,\" on his wall.\u00a0 He wrote that hoping that his friends would all feel sorry for him and beg him not to. \n \nWhen I saw it I said, \"Maybe you should delete your account if you're going to do such impulsive things.\"\u00a0 That was the end of that.\u00a0 He realized, that he should think a little harder before he acts.\u00a0 That doesn't mean he will.  \n \nHe made his apologies and they were graciously accepted.\u00a0 In fact, -the next day he ended up going to church with the young lady.\u00a0 She warned him beforehand that her boyfriend would indeed be there.\u00a0 He trepidatiously agreed.\u00a0 The three of them ended up having a good time together at church.\u00a0 He looks forward to hanging out with them again soon -maybe going back to church with them next week.  \n \nI worry of course that he will become obsessed with this friendship.\u00a0 I always worry about the next weird thing he will do with regards to friend, especially when it comes to female friends.\u00a0 My mother doesn't think he's ready for a Facebook account.\u00a0 Of course, neither she or my husband want me to be on it either.\u00a0  Sorry...I'm a grown up! \u00a0  \n \nAs for my son -he will have to tread his way upstream on Facebook just like he does in the rest of\u00a0 his social life.\u00a0 He will learn from his mistakes.\u00a0 I can't protect him from that -nor should I.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/08/facebook-and-autisic-teen.html", "title": "\nFacebook and the Autisic Teen\n"},

They stayed downtown @ The Four Seasons and invited me to spend the night with them.  I went down Friday afternoon after getting everyone all settled down here at home.  Why is it that I have to make sure everyone is fed -and the refrigerator is fully supplied before I leave home?  Wait a minute...I'm not supposed to be complaining in this post.  \n \nFriday night we had a light dinner on the patio with our baby girl. The babysitter came and off we went for an evening of cocktails and fine dining @ Eddie V's a posh seafood restaurant and bar in downtown Austin.  There was a local jazz band of blind musicians who rocked the house with soulful tunes.  We had a few martinis, delectable appetizers, and the most scrumptious creme brulee' that I have ever tasted in my life! \n \nBabies don't care what time you went to bed or how many drinks you had.  So we were up at 8 a.m. for breakfast -again on the patio.  The day was beautiful, bright and sunny.  After we ate, I lounged on a hammock over looking Town Lake while Bella and her mommy went for a walk.  There was a yoga class on the lawn that I was too lazy to participate in.  When Bella was all tired out -we went up stairs to put her down for a nap and we joined her in slumber for a couple of hours.  Yes -we were sleeping off the martinis.  \n \n \nWhen she awakened we showered and took off for lunch al fresco at an Italian restaurant at a local outdoor shopping area.  We walked and played at the playground.  My son Blue joined us for an afternoon of play with his god-sister. As her mommy shopped -we went off and had our alone time with my little sunshine doll.  We had ice cream, where she flirted with a group of young men.  Then we followed her as she explored a little field of trees and plants.  She found treasure in the acorns that she grasped tightly like they were golden nuggets.    \n \nIt was this little get-away and time with two people that a love immensely that gave me the fortitude and strength to deal with what would be coming this week.  Meltdowns, a run-away child, a sick husband, numerous doctors appointments, phone calls and e-mails to the schools.

I'm freaking out about this. \u00a0This is a reoccurring issue that we have been dealing with since middle school. \u00a0I'm thinking if he doesn't get this behavior under raps...sooner or later we will end up with legal bills on top of everything else. \u00a0Of course there are a number of behaviors that we have to change if he will ever be able to live out in the real-world as an adult, without his mommy to protect and advocate for him. \u00a0I can't even explain how much this makes me sick to my stomach with worry. \u00a0He is 16! \u00a0I will not always be able to protect him from the world...or even from himself! \n \nThis most recent behavior means we are going to have to take the cell phone away so that he is not barraging people with phone calls and text messages. \u00a0We are going to have to take Facebook away from him for a while...as he is continually putting these inappropriate messages out there...sharing way too much information. \u00a0Laying this serious guilt-trip on his friends at school. \u00a0 Basically, he is attempting to put the state of his mental-health in their hands. \u00a0'If people would be better friends to me...then I wouldn't feel so depressed,' is the gist of what he is saying. \n \nHe says he doesn't want them to feel sorry for him. \u00a0But obviously, what he wants is attention...however he can get it. \u00a0What he doesn't understand is how this is making other people feel and what thoughts they are having about him. \u00a0 There goes that Asperger's mind-blindness. \u00a0He is laying this guilt trip out there which makes people who are trying to be a friend to him feel like, 'If I don't call, message and be there for him 110%, then he may hurt himself.' \u00a0What teenager can handle that responsibility? \u00a0And furthermore...why should they have to? \n \nDuring this meeting with the school special education staff, we come up with a game plan that will keep Red safe and out of trouble, without totally confining him to home or one area of school all-day. \u00a0They will be keeping a very watchful eye on him until things settle down with these med changes.  \n \nIn the midst of this sh*# storm, I do get a small blessing. \u00a0I don't know if it was God, the medicine or both. \u00a0When I have the conversation about the cell phone and Facebook with Red, he agrees ...on his own, to disable his Facebook account for a while. \u00a0He also agrees to delete certain phone numbers from his phone so that he will not be tempted to text message. \u00a0What's more...he doesn't even seem to get depressed about it. \u00a0I thought this was going to be a major fight. \u00a0It was so civil and mature, I was totally caught off guard...in a good way. \n \nSo despite all of the knots in my stomach, headaches, and sleepless nights, we made it through the week from hell. \u00a0The only thing I actually forgot to do during the week was to take Blue to his Art lesson. \n \nOh...and I never made it to my 'play hookie day'. \u00a0I haven't been to the movies in an absolutely sinful amount of time. \u00a0Having grown up in Los Angeles, \u00a0I am usually an avid movie goer. \u00a0Hopefully, I will see a few of the Oscar picks before the actual Oscar ceremony. \u00a0The movie I really want to see is \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\" but then again...I can see that live and in living color, right here in my own home.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fglgPoxAcN8/TzA1NmYBibI/AAAAAAAAAmQ/Ihd3KaP8LVI/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/02/extremely-loud-and-very-close.html", "title": "\nExtremely Loud and Very Close...\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 6, 2010", "body": "\nWell the first try on the medication with Blue didn't go so well -big surprise. I hate Psychiatry and the whole trial and error bull that goes along with it...especially when it comes to my child! But when your child is unraveling before your eyes, feeling helpless and suicidal -you're willing to pull out every possible tool from the toolbox to try and fix it. You just have to be agile, play very close attention and stay in very close contact with the doctor. \n \nThis past weekend was just a barrel of fun. I watched him go from a pretty fun-loving kid into his angry,\"Blue\" alter ego in a matter of moments. It was a beautiful, sunny, quiet Sunday morning.We had a lovely, leisurely, family Sunday brunch planned at a local seafood restaurant. My mouth was watering in anticipation of a long casual meal that would be followed by a lack of Sunday dinner cooking. (NOT!) Instead we had to corral our little boy back home.  He decided to run away because his life is so horrible. \n \n\"This is all your fault! You're not making it any better! Why is this happening to me? Why does God hate me?\" This started over a weather report of rain that was over 300 miles away and had a zero percent chance of coming to our area.  I don't know if he heard that part, and he certainly didn't believe me when I said it.  \n \nNothing was right for the rest of the day. I think he finally sat down and watched a movie with his Dad later that evening. However, the rest of us all remained the enemy until bedtime. We were on lock down -no family fun to be had.   \n \nMonday morning was met first with a 'parents appointment' with the boy's therapist. A 45 minute session that one of the  parents  showed up 30 minutes late for. No -I was not that parent. It was the one who needed the appointment the most who showed up late. How did I get two difficult children off to school, drive all the way downtown to meet a friend for breakfast and return her cell phone that her baby girl had slipped into my purse a few days earlier, and still make it to the appointment on time? \n \n\"Well -I do have a job you know.\" \n Yes -so do I. Unfortunately, it's not of the paying kind.It does however have a fair share of grunt work! \n\"But you put this appointment on your calendar a week ago,\" I reply.  \n\"That doesn't stop the phone from ringing,\" he says calmly.  \n\"But it should have stopped you from picking it up,\" I say trying not to sound as highly pissed as I am.  \n\"Well -what did he say (meaning the therapist) that was new?\" Wow! \n In other words -did I really miss anything important?  \n \nAfter that appointment, I took a little \"me time\"to decompress at TJ Maxx -the best therapy of all. I found a bottle of \"DKNY Be Delicious\" because I am -delicious, therefore I deserve this. I walked around for an hour before I could decide if I should spend $30.00 on the $50.00 bottle that I've been wanting since like 2 years ago when I ran out of it. Yes -it did make it home to my vanity. \n \n \n \nAt 1 p.m. I high tail it over to the middle school to pick up \"Blue\" for his appointment with the Pediatric Psychiatrist. On our way to the appointment, he told me about a  video he watched about children in Africa at school. A light bulb went  on for him. He assessed, \"Those kids don't have hardly anything, but they are still happy. Americans are really spoiled! We have everything  and yet people still complain -like my brother, he's never happy with  what he gets. I want to figure out a way to make things more equal for everyone. I have to find a way to change the world.\u201d This alone \u2013made my day. Watch out Barack Obama!  \n \nOnce we arrived at our appointment, Blue very eloquently told the doctor exactly what has been going on for the past two weeks since we saw them last. \n \n\"I thought I was doing better, and then I realized it wasn't the medicine that was making me better. It was just me. Somehow when I got home after school, I didn't feel better anymore. By Friday, I really felt worse. I started drawing on my body where I wanted to cut myself.\"  Heartbreak . Of course, that was the end of that trial with Zoloft. We were given a new medication to try. I am not thrilled about this prospect, but you gotta do what you gotta do.  \n \nAfter we left the doctor, the day was so beautiful. The sky dazzled a hypnotic blue. There were zero clouds, and it was a sweet 75 degrees. We just didn\u2019t want to go home and be between four walls when we could be out absorbing the sun. Off we went to our favorite outdoor shopping area \u2013The Domain where walked and talked. He stopped into his favorite store to browse. That would be the Apple store. \n \n \n \nJust as we are contemplating stopping for a bite to eat, my cell phone rings. Home\u2026I ignore it. That usually means my son who wants to bug me about something unnecessary. The message is from my mom. \n \nMy husband is in really bad shape and needs me to take him to the doctor. Mind you \u2013he\u2019s been sick for going on two weeks. He was scheduled to leave town again the following day. I had insisted that he see a doctor before the trip because he has had this congestion for so long. Good thing he had that appointment scheduled for that evening. He came home with a high fever, body aches and the whole shebang all over again. \n \nThis meant I was off -back across town to pick up my husband for my third doctor\u2019s appointment of the day. As it turns out, he has the flu. There would be no flight the following day. He would have his butt in bed, recuperating, like he\u2019d been refusing to do for the past two weeks. I stop to get his medicine, Gatorade, soup and ibuprofen. I will be playing nurse Ratched for the next couple of days. All while playing Psychiatrist, Therapist, Driver, Cook and Maid. \n \nFlippantly \u2013my 22 year old son says to me last week, \u201cMaybe if you got a job outside of the house\u2026Dad wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard.\u201d I wanted to slap him back into the future where he would have his own difficult children\u2026and maybe he would catch a glimpse of how much it takes to raise them. THIS IS A FULL-TIME JOB! I have three children to care for (including my husband). I add my 71 year old mother that mix. I am responsible for taking her to the doctor, dentist, grocery shopping, and to get her hair done (which is much more often than I get my own hair done mind you.)  \n \nJust call me nurse Ratched running the crazy ward \u2013only I\u2019m a lot nicer, at least most of the time.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/10/nurse-ratched.html", "title": "\nNurse Ratched\n"},

There going to think I'm like a baby,\" he says. \n\"No they're going to think you have high-functioning autism, and they will help watch out for you and keep you from getting lost.

That doesn't mean that behind the scene...I haven't also been dealing with my \"Easy\" child's issues.  \n \nAfter school one day, the phone rings. \u00a0 It's Blue on the caller I.D. \n\"Mom! Whatever you do...DO NOT PICK UP PHONE IF THE SCHOOL CALLS!\" \u00a0He is crying and very upset. \u00a0\"They are just going to lie to you!\" \n \nI try to get out of him what is going on, but when he's this upset, there is no getting through to the actual facts of the matter. \u00a0There is just pure emotion, vivid anger and exaggeration. \u00a0His anger appears to be directed at his Special Ed tracking teacher. \u00a0\"She's MEAN! \u00a0And she's always getting in my business! \u00a0I don't need her help!\" \u00a0 Of course he needs her help. \u00a0He would not survive without it. \n \nShortly after we hang up the phone, Mrs. E. calls. \u00a0Apparently, we are still having adventures with the Shoe-Licker. \u00a0I have written about this before  HERE \u00a0and\u00a0 Part 2 HERE .\u00a0The two of them \u00a0have supposedly been separated in the classrooms. \u00a0However, in the hallways apparently, they find their way towards each other. \u00a0This time the Shoe-Licker apparently pushed Blue and slammed his locker shut. \u00a0Subsequently, Blue sees him after-school and runs towards him...probably ready to knock the crap out of him, when his teacher screams to stop him. \u00a0She quickly redirects him to get straight into the car with my carpool partner...saving him from getting himself into real trouble.  \n \nWhen he gets home, he barrels out of the car running towards me...crying frantically. \u00a0He is angry.. yelling. \u00a0He is actually cursing! \u00a0 Yes...this is my so-called 'easy' child.  \u00a0He has been pushed to the edge. \u00a0Mostly he is afraid and angry because he fears that HE has done something wrong. \u00a0He is 'Student Of the Week'. \u00a0He is worried that has all somehow been ruined and of course it's all the Shoe-Lickers fault! \n \nAs the night goes on and he calms down...I start to get more accurate pieces of the puzzle --the story of what actually happened. \u00a0Allegedly, the kid taunted and threatened Blue and he did not back down. \u00a0He was threatening that he was going to shut Blue's locker. \u00a0Blue got in his face, tapped him and told the kid to get away from him.  \n \nThe shoe-licker says, \"Tap me one more time and see what happens!\"  \nBlue taps him one more time. \u00a0 After-all he TOLD him to do it.  \nThe kid then shoves him down to the ground and slams Blue's locker shut. \n \nSo it turns out...Blue is very fearful about the part that he played in the matter. \u00a0Of course, I have no problem with it. \u00a0He didn't back down. \u00a0The Vice-Principle may see things differently.  \n \nWe have a meeting with the Vice Principle and the Special Ed. Teacher the following day. \u00a0Blue tells the whole story, which of course is much easier to do when he's not in emotional havoc. \u00a0There is an investigation. \u00a0Blue is not in trouble. \u00a0The boys apologize to one another. \u00a0Finally...there is a schedule change. \u00a0Blue is no longer in almost every class with this boy. \u00a0I am hopeful that the adventures with the Shoe-Licker have come to an end. \n \nThe first day of his new schedule without the shoe-licker I ask, \"So how do you like your new schedule?\"  \nHe says, \"It's fine but...there's this kid who called my friend the R-word.\"  \n \nGod help me. \u00a0Now he has to be the R-word police. \u00a0Let us pray.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E0CXIUKYRYk/TzKlp3Gu3RI/AAAAAAAAAmY/lNTz1oB6XDk/s1600/images-19.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/02/adventures-with-shoe-licker.html", "title": "\nAdventures with the Shoe-Licker\n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 10, 2012", "body": "\n \n \nEditorial Note: \u00a0If you haven't played hookie lately...you really should. \u00a0Find a beautiful place and get lost. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI grew up with the strictest single-mother on earth. \u00a0According to her, there was no dating...even in high-school. \u00a0I had a midnight curfew, despite the fact that all my friends could stay out till 1 a.m. \u00a0 I could not see rated R movies. \u00a0There would be no teen night-clubs. \u00a0Sex was for married people, so there was no sense in us having a talk about it. \u00a0Other than, \"Kissing and petting leads to pre-marital sex. \u00a0So you should not be kissing and petting.\" \u00a0 \n \n \nThat worked out really well. \u00a0I had my first boyfriend in 10th grade. \u00a0I would sneak out to see him...giving her all kinds of lame stories. \u00a0There was plenty of kissing...luckily, I was too afraid to have sex. \u00a0 I would even play hookie to hang out with him and our group of friends. \u00a0 I did everything that I could possibly get away with...all without my mother's knowledge. \u00a0Including seeing my first rated R movie, \"Saturday Night Fever\" with a group of friends from my neighborhood. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI promised myself to never be THAT mother. \u00a0I want my kids to be able to talk to me and ask me about anything. \u00a0Well...little did I know that I would have to Aspergers kids who do actually talk to me about EVERYTHING. \u00a0In fact, my 16-year old son informed me the other day about his research on porn. \u00a0\"I looked it up on Wikepedia,\" he says very matter-of-fact. Great! \u00a0That's just great. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI actually allowed him to watch a rated R movie \"Snakes on a Plane\" the other day here at home with his friend. \u00a0I could have made him go through the trouble of sneaking and watching it at his friend's house. \u00a0But why go there? \u00a0Apparently, the rating is for language, one scene sexual in nature, \u00a0intense terror and violence.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen I turned 18, I finally told my mother, \"You know, I would rather just tell you what I'm doing rather than sneak around all over town telling you I'm at point A when I'm really at point Z. \u00a0I'm going to find a way to do what I want to do, so I may as well be honest with you.\" \u00a0Her bottom lip dropped down to the floor. \u00a0She couldn't believe my audacity, but things changed after that conversation. \n \n \n \nI guess there is still apart of that little girl within me who wants to do what I want to do, without having to answer to anyone. \u00a0I spend so much of my life doing for other people, being the responsible mother, wife, daughter and friend. \u00a0Sometimes, I just want to sneak away and do my own thing.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nPlaying hookie is still something I do every now and then. \u00a0Lately, things have been so crazy, I haven't had the opportunity to do it. \u00a0Unfortunately, I'm not doing anything too exciting like sneaking off to make out with a boyfriend. \u00a0Although, wouldn't that be fun??? \u00a0I sneak out for lunch, happy hour, shopping or to the movies. \u00a0(Ssh! Don't tell anybody.) \u00a0\u00a0I use cash for all payments so that my steps can not be traced. \u00a0When anyone asks questions or calls me and says, \"Where are you?\" \u00a0I simply answer, \"I'm not at liberty to say.\" \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe boys have been out of school for the first 3 days of this week thanks to teachers in-service training. Essentially, we had a 5 day weekend. \u00a0Yes...that's right...TORTURE! \u00a0Thursday morning, I get them off to school. \u00a0I decide...this is it. \u00a0This is my day to escape. \u00a0Friday I already have an appointment scheduled for my mom, I have to take the dog to the groomer and I have an appointment for myself Friday afternoon. \u00a0I have not been to the movies...alone, in I can't remember when. \u00a0I am going today! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nRed calls at 11:55 a.m. \u00a0\"Mom...you forgot to give me lunch.\"\u00a0 \n \nGreat! \u00a0I have to run over there to bring his lunch. \u00a0I throw on a pair of sweats and tell my mom, \"I have to take Red lunch and then I have some errands.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOff to the movie theatre I go. \u00a0No makeup, no shower...wearing sweat pants...but I made it! \u00a0In case you're wondering I saw \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\", which of course makes me think about my husband and my children. \u00a0I cry...but at least, I escaped. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nLater that evening, I am doing my normal mommy duties, taking Blue to the library, running to the grocery store, running home to make sure Red eats and takes his meds, running back to the library to pick up Blue. \u00a0Making dinner for my husband. \u00a0Suddenly, my mom stops me in my tracks and says, \"Are you hiding something from me?\" \n \n \n \n\"What do you mean? \u00a0Like what? You mean my rendezvous with my boyfriend this afternoon?\" HA HA!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI never did answer her question. \u00a0The last time I checked...I was 46 years old. \u00a0Do I have to disclose my whereabouts to my mother, my husband and my children at all times? \u00a0I don't think so! \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8BwhOKWddXs/TzVFqpp5xwI/AAAAAAAAAmg/5aNCC81vqV8/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/02/playing-hookie.html", "title": "\nPlaying Hookie\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 2, 2012", "body": "\n \nMy friend Roma is a middle school math teacher, a single mother of a beautiful, precious, smart little girl. \u00a0Roma was born in Cambodia and has lived here in the states since she was a little girl. \u00a0I love what she brings into my life via her culture and background. \u00a0Better yet, I love that she is taking the time and interest in my children enough to drag them kicking and screaming to go exercise.  \n \nWhen I would take Red myself, sometimes he would work hard, other times he wouldn't. \u00a0Many times, I couldn't even get him out the door. \u00a0I fight so many fights on a given day, that it didn't seem worth it to fight this one tooth and nail. \n \nEveryday when Roma calls to say she's on her way, Red goes through his song and dance of excuses why he can't go. \u00a0She has none of it. \u00a0He whines and complains. \u00a0 She totally ignores him. \u00a0She gets him to walk that track, walk the tread mill or elliptical to burn those calories, and release those endorphins. \u00a0He comes home with an elevated mood, \u00a0a little more self-esteem and a sense of accomplishment every time. \u00a0Her goal for him is to help him feel better mentally and physically. \n \nIf you've been reading this blog for long you know that he is dying to go out with\u00a0 \"Hot Girls\" . \u00a0Unfortunately, between his medication and high carb diet, he has gained a bit of weight in the past two years. \u00a0He has no clue that he needs a lot more than a nice body to get ANY girl, but getting more fit will be a good start.  \n \nHe listens to her so much better than he ever listens to me so, I give her the ball and let her roll with it. She does not accept \"No\" for an answer.  \n \n \n \n \n \nHer daughter has become like the little sister the boys never had. \u00a0She's smart, precocious and like her mama doesn't take any crap! \u00a0She pushes Red and Blue around and watches them to make sure they are doing what her mama tells them to do at the gym. \u00a0The other day, she popped Red in the back a couple of times, trying to get him out the door to go work out. It was so funny! \u00a0This pic is from one day when he burned 519 calories on the elliptical. \u00a0She made him carry her on his back as a sort of victory dance. \n \nSo as we're riding home from the gym last night, he turns to me and says, \n\"You know Mom...you really are the best mom ever.\" \n WTH? \u00a0Where did that come from? \u00a0Is he serious? \u00a0I look at him in disbelief. \n\"What makes you say that?\" \n\"Because you always support me.\" \n I really don't know what to do with this. \u00a0Is he just talking? Does he really mean what he's saying?   \n These are the words every mom lives her entire life to hear. \u00a0Does he REALLY see me? \u00a0Does he REALLY appreciate all that I am doing from him? \u00a0Could this boy who is ordinarily totally self-centered, truly mean what he's saying. \u00a0Wow...it's really too bad that I have to question it's validity, but I'm just...shocked!\u00a0 \nI muster up a,\u00a0\"Thank you son.\" While a million thoughts run through my head. \n 'You're damned right I support you! \u00a0Thanks to me you have a Person Centered Planner (like a Life Coach), and she's not just any old one. \u00a0She's the best one in the entire school district! \u00a0You have a personal Video Teacher that I found for you through our Aspergers Meetup group. \u00a0You have job coaches, thanks to my advocating for you at school. \u00a0I just \u00a0sent you to L.A. to spend time with your family who loves, cares and supports you. \u00a0And now you have your very own personal trainer thanks to my friend!' \n \nHe has a grand village of people that are helping him to be the best he can be. His pastor picks him up for church every Sunday, mentors him, answers his phone calls, and comes to his Person Centered Planning meetings. \u00a0Our friends, all give him personal attention, pep talks and reality checks. \u00a0I have a great relationship with the Special Education Lead at his school. \u00a0She works hard to get him the support and programming that he needs there. Oh and his PCPlanner, is also an Administrator in the Special Education Department in our district. \u00a0I have a good relationship with her as well. \u00a0She is 100% in his corner. \u00a0This boy is blessed! And I work my ass off to keep it that way. \n \nI hope that he really meant what he said about me being the best mom ever. \u00a0I will go ahead and think positively that he did. \u00a0Whatever the case may be, I know for sure...is that he is absolutely right. \n \n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n I love to read your comments.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UORv9DAjtvg/UBqstWBef3I/AAAAAAAAAwM/Nb5PUQMMPn0/s1600/Ken&Stel+.png"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/08/best-mom-ever.html", "title": "\nBest Mom Ever?\n"},

Meanwhile, I hope you enjoy.... \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have big dreams for the day...for the week really. \u00a0It's going to be \u00a0a week of working out, swimming, running, hanging out at the Y. \u00a0We've had such a busy summer so far, that I haven't had an opportunity to work out. \u00a0The boys have been swimming, but not much in the past two weeks because of camps. \u00a0Today, I plan to have both boys go to the YMCA with a friend to swim. \u00a0I will run on the treadmill for a half-hour or so and then join them in the pool. \u00a0HA! \n \nFirst of all, Red has been complaining for close to a year about not having any friends, so today's plans include a new friend of his. \u00a0So why is it that when it's time to go...I find him in bed? \u00a0When I tell him I will call his friend to cancel, he screams...\"NO!\" Yet, he takes his sweet time getting up to get ready. \u00a0Now on the other end, \u00a0his new friend Adam (who also has Aspergers) is telling his mom, \"I don't think I want to swim today. \u00a0I swam already.\" \u00a0His mother insists that he come because it is a social opportunity and both boys have been so \"bored\" this summer. \u00a0It seems that we mothers are working hard to make this friendship blossom. \u00a0I guess we have the tools. \u00a0Them? \u00a0Not so much. \n \nBlue also brings a close friend Jake, who has Aspergers. \u00a0I love this kid! \u00a0There is just something about him that I find so endearing. \u00a0He is of course, brutally honest and has no problem asking me any question. \u00a0He doesn't see many boundaries and for some reason, I find it very charming. \u00a0He like Blue, \u00a0is also a bit of a rule follower and appears to think in very black and white terms. \u00a0He has a tendency to blurt out things and his volume is seldom on low. \u00a0He makes me laugh. \u00a0Watching him and Blue together just lights up my heart, because they've been friends for so long and have worked at maintaining their friendship despite the fact that they are no longer at the same school. \n \nAre you keeping up? \u00a0This means there are 4 Aspie boys on this trip to the pool. \u00a0Red and his friend Adam just kind of mill around for a while. \u00a0 It seems they are trying to decide if they will actually get in. \u00a0They finally do. \u00a0Jake, Blue's friend takes his swimming test and then they're off swimming, mostly together. \u00a0I'm chatting it up with Adam's mom, Angel (let's call her). \u00a0They met us there. \u00a0The next thing I know...I have no idea where Red is. \u00a0He's off in his own non-social world. \u00a0His friend Adam is now hanging out with Blue and Jake.  \n \nIt's nice and steamy in this mostly indoor pool. \u00a0I need exercise desperately. \u00a0Finally, I get in to do a few laps. \u00a0Not long after that, Red's friend Adam has had enough. \u00a0He goes to change out and is ready to leave. \u00a0 A few minutes later, my boys are also ready to leave, but of course, they want to stop and get something to eat. \n \nAt first Jake is resistant. \u00a0Eating was in the plan as far as he knew. \u00a0Blue and I coax him into being a little flexible. \u00a0I tell him I will call his mom to make sure it's o.k. \u00a0Of course it's fine. \u00a0Now the big question when you have more than one Aspie you're dealing with is, where can we eat in order to make the majority happy? \u00a0I make what I think is a healthy choice. \u00a03 of us agree. \u00a01 person adamantly disagrees. \u00a0This person of course is Red. \n \nHe makes such a major stink in the car. \u00a0It isn't pretty...at all! \n\"Why do I have to eat that!? \u00a0Their fries are disgusting! \u00a0I don't like anything there! \u00a0I want a milkshake!\" \u00a0You know the drill, why can't we go here...or there? \nBlue is so embarrassed by his brother's behavior he's ready to give in.  \n\"Just let him have what he wants mom! \u00a0Just forget it!\" \n\"No...we're not going to do that. \u00a0We have a decision. \u00a0There is a majority and that's that.\" \n \nFrom the back of the car Jake says, \"Yep! That's right! \u00a0Majority Rules!\" \nBlue turns around and says to Jake, \"Ssh! \u00a0Don't say anything. \u00a0You're just going to make Red more mad.\" \nJake doesn't really care or is oblivious. \u00a0The next thing I know he's singing, \"You can't always get what you want,\" \u00a0the Rolling Stones song. \u00a0He's singing that line over and over with a smirky smile on his face. \u00a0I see him through the rearview mirror. \u00a0I start laughing so hard I thought I'd pee my pants! \nBlue is fervently trying to get Jake to stay out of the dialogue. \u00a0He doesn't want his brother to get mad or start screaming at his friend. \u00a0Jake doesn't appear to care. \u00a0It's hilarious! \nRed is still ranting, being very ugly. \u00a0He's not cursing...thank God! \u00a0But he is being extremely disrespectful and embarrassing the hell out of his brother. \u00a0Blue grows more and more frustrated. \u00a0He's about at the point where he wants to curse. \u00a0He just wants the madness to stop! \u00a0It's impossible. \nFinally Blue says, \"Let's just forget it. \u00a0I don't want to eat!\" \n\"That would be allowing your brother's behavior to dictate what we do,\" I say. \nTo which Jake replies, \"Yeah...we don't want any dictators around here. \u00a0I don't like dictators.\" \u00a0His voice remains very flat and he's laughing in a nervous kind of way. \u00a0This of course makes me laugh even harder. \u00a0I'm so glad that he's with us. \u00a0Normally, I would be ready to explode at this point, but Jake makes it all sort of funny. \n \nI come up with an alternative for Red. \u00a0There is a sandwhich shop next to where we are going. \u00a0This still isn't good enough for him. \u00a0\"I don't want that either!\" \u00a0What he wants is a hamburger and fries. \u00a0This is not going to happen. \u00a0His demanding, disrespectful tone and attitude assures the fact that I will not give him what he wants. \u00a0When he turns down my option and is now yelling and ranting, I decide to take him home. \u00a0  \n \n\"I don't want to go home! That's not fair!\" \nI call my husband to prepare him. \u00a0Red actually tries to grab the phone from me. \u00a0I tell him, he can either go home peacefully or I can drop him off at the local police department. \nJake says from the backseat, \"Is Red going to jail? \u00a0I don't like that yelling. \u00a0Is he going to jail?\" \n\"No...he's just going home,\" I say. \u00a0\"I was only kidding,\" I assure him. \n\"Well...you're right. \u00a0I don't like \u00a0all that yelling and I don't like dictators. \u00a0I don't want any dictators around here.\" \nMoments later he starts singing again, \"You can't -always get what you want,\" laughing nervously.  \nBlue is mortified at this point. \u00a0I am laughing uncontrollably, the kind of laughter where you can hardly speak or catch your breath. \nWe drop Red off at home. \u00a0He goes inside and rants with his father for another hour. \nJake, Blue and I go off and have our peaceful meal.  \n \nAs if that were not enough...later we pick up 2 different autism friends to go back to the Y to play basketball. \u00a0I finally get in my run on the treadmill thanks to the \"Black Eyed Peas\" who really get me moving. \u00a030 minutes in to my run...here come the boys. \u00a0They want to try out some of the gym equipment. \u00a0That's a whole other autism story!  \n \nAspergers and autism is alive and kicking in our world. \u00a0Do you think my plans for the day were a little too ambitious? \u00a0Maybe I should have bowed out at the first sign of trouble --when Red was laying in the bed refusing to get up and be on time. \u00a0Nah...then I wouldn't have had all that laughter! \n \n Help!!! I'm drowning over at Top Mommy!

{"date": "Friday, June 15, 2012", "body": "\n \nAbout a week ago...Blue made a very good argument for why he needs a new Ipod. \u00a0He sent his dad the following e-mail: \n \n \n \n \n Hey dad, \n \n \n \n \n \n I knew you didn\u2019t have your phone so I sent this. \n \n \n \n I need a new iPod really bad, because my iPod is acting up badly. I restored it a week ago and today it said, \u201ciTunes cannot read the content on this iPod, you need to restore it!\u201d Really? I\u2019ve restored many times and I get this! My iPod is outdated. I need the 4 th \u00a0Generation iPod Touch with the latest software! I also need more memory. The next up memory storage is 32GB, there\u2019s no 16GB, just 8GB. I need more memory. So the iPod I wanted to get is the iPod touch 32GB 4 th \u00a0Gen. It cost $299 plus a 10% discount for my old iPod. Please think about it because I am really frustrated with my iPod, it\u2019s very old. If you could, reply to me on the airplane or call when you get to your car. If not, then can we talk about it when you get home? Thank you. \n \n \n \n Sincerely,\u00a0 \u00a0(first and last name) \n \n \n \n \n Primary and Secondary e-mail addresses for response. \n \n \n \nWe were both quite impressed with his research and the formality of the e-mail. \u00a0I thought, he is ready for the business world already! The e-mail along with the fact that he has a straight A average for the entire school year, was enough for me to convince dad to go ahead and get the IPod. \u00a0There is also \u00a0the condition that Blue will pay $100 of the  ONLY $299.00. \n \n \n \nDad buys it for him and gives him. \u00a0When he hands it over, he adds one more condition: \n\"My Birthday is on Wednesday. \u00a0I want total peace in my house for my birthday. \u00a0That's all I want.\"  Ha! \u00a0Be careful what you ask for!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWednesday morning arrives and Dad goes off to work. \u00a0The day is incredibly hectic with comings and goings, camps, appointments, shopping for the birthday presents, etc. I drive around the world and back. \u00a0In fact, the day is so busy, that Blue accidentally skipped taking his a.m. meds before he left for camp. \u00a0When Blue and I arrive home after all of our running around, we find Red on the couch watching a movie loudly. \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \"Let the wild rumpus start!\" ~Maurice Sendak,  Where the Wild Things Are \n \n \n We are all busy cleaning up, and getting things together for dad's birthday celebration. \u00a0The plan is, we are going to order food in, have my older son and his girlfriend come by, have cake, and dad will open presents, etc. \u00a0A little family birthday party.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIn the midst of preparations, Red -the boy who always comes in the room when anyone is watching t.v., starts talking, asking questions and telling you how stupid the show is that you're watching, starts yelling at all of us, \"BE Quiet! I can't here!\"\u00a0 \n \n \nI am attempting to make a cake. \u00a0The mixer is going on and off. \u00a0Dishes are rattling. \u00a0Water is running. \u00a0The dog is barking. \u00a0I understand his frustration but, we only have so long before dad will be home. \u00a0It's not as if he has never seen this movie before. \u00a0Or as if he will never see it again. \u00a0It's a DVD. \u00a0He watches movies over and over until he has memorized the entire dialog along with all of the voices. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nBlue ~the Controller and Rule Police, \u00a0starts yelling at his brother to turn the movie down. Ridiculous, sibling fighting and subsequent meltdown for Blue ensues. \u00a0It quickly turns into total chaos. \u00a0As suggested by his therapist,\u00a0I ask Blue repeatedly to remove himself from the situation. (She also suggested that if he can't or won't remove himself, that we leave or at least disengage). \u00a0Nothing I can say or do is helpful when he is in this state. \n \n\"Go upstairs to my room or your room.. Put on your Ipod. Watch something else on t.v. Turn on your computer. \u00a0Lock the door. Go outside. \u00a0Go for a walk ...just remove yourself,\" \u00a0I suggest as a way to solve the problem. \n \n \nI ask Red, \"Please disengage from your brother. \u00a0Stop responding to him, \u00a0Stop talking to him. \u00a0You're only making matters worse.\"\u00a0 \n \n \nNO ONE LISTENS!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI pour the mixed cake batter into the pan in-between feuds. \u00a0Before I put it in the oven, I ask myself, \"Did you put any butter in that batter?\" \u00a0Something tells me I did not. \u00a0I take the batter back out of the pan, put it back in the mixing bowl, add butter, remix, clean the pan, re-oil and flour, poor the batter back into the pan and bake. \u00a0I do remember,  Thank God,\u00a0 to set the freakin' timer.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHubby calls in the middle of Chaos Control. \u00a0I tell him, \"Please don't come home now. \u00a0I don't want you to have to deal with this on your birthday. I don't even know if what we have planned is going to work at all. \u00a0I don't see things getting any better ...any time soon.\" I suggest that he go over to my son's apartment until I can figure out a new game plan. \n \n \nI quickly call dear friends of Blues and ask them can he come over there so that hubby and I can at least have a dinner out together. \u00a0There is no way I can leave the two boys here together. \u00a0Luckily, they are gracious enough to come and pick him up. What a blessing. \u00a0I think I will send them flowers for saving the day. \n \nHubby and I end up having a lovely cocktail infused dinner together, drowning our sorrows and planning our next escape. \u00a0We really need a vacation together from this chaos. \n \n \nAfterward, we go back to pick up Blue. \u00a0We finally get back home...it's late. \u00a0Everything has cooled down between the boys right? Wrong! Before I can even make it up the stairs they are right back at it. \u00a0Red is on the phone talking loudly. \u00a0Blue marches straight to his room to tell him to be quiet and hang up the phone. \u00a0Yelling back and forth ensues. \u00a0Both boys are banished to their rooms. \n \nSo much for total peace for Dad's birthday.  \n \n \n \n Caramel Cake our Birthday Tradition \n \nWe never even made it to cake. \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hIWkvT0f5pk/T9uCO3BpN_I/AAAAAAAAAuk/or7Bfwu0YuU/s1600/__R0427_FOOD_CLARE_14242035_JPG_305x260_crop_upscale_q85.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/06/never-made-it-to-cake.html", "title": "\nNever Made it to Cake\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 12, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n My Bella\u00a0 \n \nFor the past two weekends in a row I have been supposed to go to Houston to see my Best Friend and my godchildren. \u00a0My little darlin -Bella turned 3, and I have not seen my little angel Corvin in 2 months. He's only 7 months-old, so he's growing and changing...without me. \u00a0I was going to go in for Bella's birthday party and to be perfectly honest --to escape my family. \u00a0Going to see my Houston family is my respite. \u00a0They make no demands of me. \u00a0We eat we drink, we sit around play with the kids and watch movies. \u00a0They let me sleep a long as I want to. \u00a0I take long, hot baths and sometimes, Bella actually lets me do this alone. \n \n \n \n Newborn Corvin \n \n \nThe day before I was going to leave the first time...I got a flat tire. \u00a0There was a huge bolt in it. \u00a0The car sat in my driveway for more than 24 hours ...waiting for my husband to get off of conference calls to fix it. \u00a0I had numerous errands to run before I could leave. \u00a0Lord knows they don't know how to go to the grocery store and the pharmacy without me. \u00a0And forget about me leaving without getting my mom her supply of wine.  \n \n (Side note: The guys at the local liquor store get her order ready when they see her getting out of the car. \u00a0I think they all know her on a first name basis.) \u00a0 Love you mom!\u00a0 \n \nOne may wonder, \"Why didn't you just take your husband's car to run your errands?\" \u00a0One who wonders that has apparently, never met my husband. \u00a0His car is his most prized possession. \u00a0Although both of our names are on the car's title..I do not drive it \u00a0because number 1) it's a stick shift. \u00a0 He did that on purpose to make it harder for me to drive.  \u00a0And number 2) If anything were to happen to it while it is in my possession, we would be on our way to divorce court. \u00a0 Not literally...I think . \u00a0But it would be the end of life as we know it. \n \nAnywhoo...it was also our Anniversary that Monday and he was leaving town on Tuesday. \u00a0The later I would leave, would give me less time I would have to spend in Houston and I would have to rush home in order to celebrate our Anniversary. \u00a0Not to mention... I've been perpetually tired for the past month or so. \u00a0I really didn't have the energy to drive down there (3 hours) only to have to rush back \nhome. \n \nI stayed at home and we had a wonderful 18th Anniversary together. \u00a0When we arrived at the restaurant...there was a huge bouquet of flowers. \u00a0I was the envy of every woman sitting around us. \n \n \n Flowers from Hubby \n \n \nThe following weekend I am supposed to go again. \u00a0This is the first week that the kids were out of school. \u00a0Hubby had been out of town most of the week on business, which means I had been entertaining kids 24/7. \u00a0I have already been running on a low energy factor. \u00a0By the time the weekend rolled around, I was freakin' exhausted. \u00a0I couldn't muster up the energy to go. \u00a0 Sucker!  \u00a0I should have just sucked it up and left. \u00a0 See ya! Sayanara family!  \n \nPart of me was also not comfortable with leaving Blue with his dad since he's been so explosive lately. \u00a0With the two of them being twins and all...I mean they are so much alike, especially in the stubbornness department. \u00a0They either can't get enough of each other or they can't get away from each other fast enough. \u00a0 So yes, the  sucker  mother that I am...let the guilt keep me from leaving \n \nSo this week is my husband's birthday and on the weekend it's Father's day. \u00a0Blue's friends are supposed to come to stay a couple of days because their mother is going out of town for a wedding. \u00a0I volunteered for this months ago, \u00a0after she was so kind to keep Blue for us while we were in Vegas.  \n \n Sucker  that I am...I give hubby the option of going to L.A. for the Playboy Jazz Festival (alone). He's actually been doing this almost annually for the past few years. \u00a0He goes and meets my dad and some \u00a0friends. \u00a0I made this offer because he is not a fan of having other kids in the house. \u00a0He barely wants his own kids in the house. \u00a0How could I do that to him for his birthday and Father's Day? Right? \n \nOf course, \u00a0he doesn't think twice about my offer. \u00a0He booked that plane ticket so fast, he left my head spinning. \u00a0He is out of here! \u00a0So the  SUCKER  who has missed getting away for 2 WEEKS in a row, is now going to be stuck at home with a bunch of kids for the weekend!  \n \nJust give me a tattoo and put it on my forehead.  \u00a0BIG FAT SUCKER!  \u00a0Ha ha ha ha ha! \u00a0That's what my husband will be saying as he takes off on that plane. \n \nThe good news is...after he booked his trip, Blue's friend's mom cancelled on the boys coming to spend the weekend. \u00a0It turns it's their dad's weekend. \u00a0 Awwh! I'm so sad! At least one father will be stuck with his kids on Father's Day.   \n \nThe other good news is my Bestie texted me and says that she's going to come up  here  to spend time with me! \n \nAnd that's why this  SUCKER  loves her so much! \n \n \n \n Me and my Bestie \n \n \n \n Editorial Note:   Hubby says I threw him under the bus on this post. I will admit that both weekends he did encourage me to go even after he made me a day late, but I was just too exhausted. \u00a0However I must remind everyone...this is MY blog and stories are written from MY point of view. \u00a0These are MY Confessions -MY therapy! \u00a0I can't tell you how good I felt after writing this. \u00a0It made me laugh. \u00a0I am entitled to creative license. \u00a0I tell the story as I see it. \u00a0There are times when I write for comedic release and to make others laugh. \u00a0What is the world without a little laughter? \u00a0If you can't laugh at yourself and your life ...your life is going to be really BORING and in MY opinion...that would be tragic. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I welcome guest posts if you would like to write something from your point of view. \u00a0Of course since this is My blog...I am also Editor-In-Chief! \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--gxoiG5skPQ/T9d07PaMI6I/AAAAAAAAAuM/tKh_aKnKN3s/s1600/IMG_0273.JPG", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FSSYvb2LNC0/T9dz81C5OEI/AAAAAAAAAuE/vCjJvL4eGzU/s1600/DSCN1003.JPG", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PHy49iE7j3g/T9fmLeNc4aI/AAAAAAAAAuY/lDDvgM7joEs/s1600/flowers.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JcU4b9rbDbY/T9dyFeuPloI/AAAAAAAAAt4/LKY5lhdqD58/s1600/IMG_4782.JPG"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/06/sucker.html", "title": "\nSUCKER!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 3, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nAlthough we know it's inevitable...it's hard to watch your child go through their first broken heart. \u00a0In this case, it is my child's best friend, whom I love like he's my own. \u00a0Alex...is the manly man kind of 13 year-old boy. \u00a0He has some athletic ability. \u00a0He's tall and handsome. \u00a0He can be goofy and silly when he's in his comfort zone, but at school he is generally busy trying to fit in and not call too much attention to himself. \u00a0He is somewhere on the Autism Spectrum.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe's been crushing on this girl since about the 3rd or 4th grade. \u00a0She's come to his birthday parties, and always been really nice to him. \u00a0Since middle-school, their friendship has waxed and waned and come back again, waned and come back again. \u00a0This year however, he was all to pleased that they now share a class together! \u00a0What's even better than that...their lockers are right next to each other. \u00a0 Woo hoo! Score!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo this girl let's call her Liza, has been smiling, saying hello and generally being nice to Alex so far during this school year. \u00a0They are now in 8th grade. \u00a0Meanwhile, in his head...they are pretty close to \"going out\" with each other, only she has no idea about this. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Because he has never expressed his feelings to her. \u00a0He just hopes that she knows through osmosis.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAlex's biggest fear has been that she may somehow get a boyfriend before he actually works up the nerve to let her know how he feels. \u00a0And on this day...his biggest fear comes to reality. \u00a0They are in the hallway near the lockers and she says to her friend something along the lines of, \"This is my boyfriend.\" And she's not talking about Alex! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo after school, I am waiting outside for over a half an hour \u00a0for Alex to come out. \u00a0I call inside to his tracking teacher. \u00a0She tells me she was in the middle of a counseling him about a girl situation. \u00a0He makes it down the hallway and towards the front door when he stops to talk to the Vice Principal. \u00a0They are not used to seeing Alex unhappy. \u00a0When he finally reaches the car...the sadness is palpable. \u00a0As soon as he gets in the car, he lets go with deep sobs. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n\"My life is over! I can't believe she has a boyfriend! What am I going to do now? \u00a0What if she kisses him? \u00a0I just couldn't take that! \u00a0I don't know what I would do!\" \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, his brother who is somewhere deeper on the spectrum says... \n \n\"You don't need her Alex! She didn't like you anyway! Why do you like her?\" \n \n\u00a0 Not exactly what he wants to hear.  \u00a0 \n \nAnd then Blue,  Mr. Practical  says... \n \n\"I told you relationships in middle school are a bad idea. \u00a0It never lasts and you're just going to get your feelings hurt. \u00a0Just wait till she breaks up with the guy and then you can go out with her in high-school. That will be better. I told you to wait till high-school anyway. \u00a0And dude...she didn't even know you liked her because you never told her.\"\u00a0 \n \nThere goes that brutally honest Aspie of mine.  Yeah...that's what he wanted to hear --sobering reality while he's falling apart. \n \n \n \nI have to chime in of course, \"Alex --I'm sorry that you're feeling so bad. \u00a0I know it's hard. \u00a0Just remember, you can still be her friend. You can still smile and say hello and talk to her.\" \n \n \n \nHe's deep in sadness and none of our advice means much at this point. \u00a0He goes right back to... \n \n\"What if she kisses him?! \u00a0I couldn't take it! \u00a0I don't think I'll ever be happy again.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThis is so amazing coming from him. \u00a0He is usually so macho...so tough and go with the flow. \u00a0My heart aches for him. \u00a0His mom is not home when we get there. \u00a0I call her and tell her what's going on so that she can talk to him as soon as possible.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe following morning on our way to pick them up I tell Blue, \"People don't want to hear 'I told you so' when they are hurting. \u00a0They want to know that you understand how they feel and give them some kind of encouragement. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen Alex gets in the car Blue says to him, \"Dude...I'm sorry you're upset. \u00a0It's going to be o.k. Just remember friendships last longer than relationships. \u00a0You can always be her friend.\" \u00a0Alex's brother chimes in, \"That's right! You don't need her!\" \n \n \n \nAs each day passes...he seams to feel a little better. \u00a0By that Friday morning I ask him, \u00a0\"Are you going to the dance tonight?\" Days before ...when life wasn't worth living, he didn't think he could go. \u00a0He says, \"Yeah I guess I'm going.\" \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe all break out clapping in the car...applauding his decision to move on and have fun with his friends. \u00a0And they do just that!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Editorial Note: The names have been changed in this story...to protect the broken-hearted.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Your comments make my day! \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7_FG5MpafBc/UGxTaQlDSnI/AAAAAAAAA1o/g2EsYDAl858/s1600/images-8.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/10/3-boys1-broken-heart.html", "title": "\n3 Boys...1 Broken Heart \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 17, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nIt may be blasphemous to talk about a relationship with God and sex in the same blog post...but this is the reality of my life raising teens with Aspergers. \u00a0At seventeen that uncomfortable conversation about sex is bound to come up ...no matter how much I would like to avoid it. \u00a0This time it was actually a reasonable conversation, I think only because of his new found desire to be a \"hardcore Christian\" as he calls it. \n \nI have to say, that the closer he gets in his relationship with God, the more clear his thinking seems to become. \u00a0That...along with the therapy we're paying an arm and a leg for. \u00a0That's right, instead of us helping him by a car at 17...we are paying cash for a therapist who specializes in working with Aspies on sexual and relationship issues. \n \nSo there's a girl...who shows interest in Red. \u00a0She has been showing interest for quite some time, but he didn't pay attention to it, as he was too busy focusing on girls who did not even know he was alive. \u00a0Now that he has come down to reality, this seemingly nice young lady has caught his interest as well. \u00a0Although, he is taking things surprisingly slow. \u00a0He is developing a friendship with her. \u00a0He is slowly ...very slowly trying to get to know her. \u00a0It's kind of strange to see him with this approach.  \n \nI caution him, don't just ask her out for the sake of saying, \"I'm dating someone.\" \u00a0Don't just ask her out because you think you should. \u00a0You need to be sure of your feelings. \u00a0You need to really get to know her and her family to determine if she is a good fit for you. \n \nHe tells me, \"She deserves respect. \u00a0Not just some guy who is trying to have sex with her. \u00a0I'm trying to show her respect and get to know her.\" \u00a0 Wait a minute...who is this kid?\u00a0 \n \nLater on we're having lunch he says, \"I really want to take my time. \u00a0I don't want to have sex because I know it's a sin, but just in case it happens...would you be mad?\"\u00a0Ugh! Punch to the gut! \u00a0I am not ready for this...and neither is he, despite what his hormones and teenage urges tell him. \n \n \nI go into the whole explanation of the emotions that come along with sex, which he has no clue about. \u00a0\"What do you mean? \u00a0Like I'm gonna cry or something?\"  \n \nWhen we talk about double protection he asks, \"What do you mean? Like wear 2 condoms?\" \n Woo hoo! \u00a0We are so not ready here . \n \nWe talk about safety, and sexually transmitted disease, pregnancy, protection for both parties (birth control and condoms) and still...there are no 100% guarantees. \n \nFortunately, he knows a young man at school whose girlfriend already has a baby. \u00a0Of course, the young man he has no money or life skills to give this child. \u00a0Red can see this...and says he doesn't want to end up in that situation. \u00a0 Yeah...but isn't that what they all say? \n \nWe talk about abstinence being the best policy...that sex is designed for people who are ready for that kind of emotional commitment. \u00a0It's for people who can afford to pay the consequences if a pregnancy comes out of the situation. \n \nHe tells me honestly he just wants to know what it's like to kiss someone, give them a hug, and have them hug him back. \u00a0I am realistic and tell him how one thing can lead to another. \u00a0It's kind of like how he feels about cursing. \u00a0He swears because of his Christianity, \u00a0that he wants to stop cursing. \u00a0But everyday there he goes! Oops! \u00a0It just slipped out. \u00a0It just happened. \u00a0I couldn't help it! \u00a0The next thing you know...he will be saying the same thing about kissing.  \u00a0Oops! It just happened. \u00a0We were just kissing naked and I slipped and fell into her vagina! \n \nHe is getting closer in his relationship to God. \u00a0He is talking and listening to his youth Pastor and at least has in his mind...that he wants to do the right thing. \u00a0He feels free enough to talk to me. \u00a0He periodically talks to his dad, and to his older brother (who can also be clueless when it comes to sex and doing the right thing. \u00a0Oy...that's a whole other blog post!) \u00a0But at least he's talking and thinking out loud. \u00a0So eventually, when and if \u00a0anything happens...we will know about it, and hopefully we can help him be prepared.  \n \nI have to keep reminding myself, he is 17. \u00a0The curiosity about sex is at it's peak right now. \u00a0At least we can talk about it...even if afterwards I need a very strong drink.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6E-Yi3w63h0/UH7CGk8R_JI/AAAAAAAAA2g/KBgQqwzs4w0/s1600/images-9.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/10/lets-talk-about-sex-ba-by.html", "title": "\nLet's Talk About Sex Ba-by\n"},
{"date": "Monday, October 22, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nSince our Aspie kids have their own special flavor...I thought it would be fun to change up the\u00a0#YouMightBeAnAutismParentIf hashtag that was originally started on twitter in\u00a0November 2011, by Elise of\u00a0 Raising Aspergers Kids \u00a0and @manyhatsmommyMI \u00a0 to\u00a0 #YouMightBeAnAspieParentIf \u00a0.  \n \nLast year the trend\u00a0took off and connected so many autism parents all over the world. \u00a0Some of the tweets were funny. \u00a0Some of them were quite sad, but the best thing that came out of it all, was the connection of so many parents who were able to come together and feel less alone in this special, and sometimes difficult journey. \u00a0I would love to do the same for our community of Aspergers and HFA parents. \n \n \nFrom time to time I list these quirky things about being a parent of an Aspie on my  \"Confessions\" Facebook Page  \u00a0and on my\u00a0 Twitter  @KAspergersMom \u00a0page. \n \nHere are a few that I thought of lately: \n \n #YouMightBeAnAspieParentIf \u00a0-your kid says, \"I was bad at school yesterday. \u00a0The kids were all being hyper in class. \u00a0They were making me laugh and drawing me in.\" \u00a0But you're not upset...in fact, you're happy because he was included! \u00a0And for once he wasn't being the fun police! Then he adds, \"But I still got my work done.\" And you think...' Darn why couldn't you be a total rebel?' \n \n #YouMightBeAnAspieParentIf  -Your kid gets student of the week because he \"always helps others, is respectful and always prepared\" @school...yet, he comes home and bites your freakin' head off!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n #YouMightBeAnAspieParentIf  -you have to tell your kid, \"Hey! Stop talking about politics. You're supposed to be swimming,\" when he's at the neighborhood pool.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n #YouMightBeAnAspieParentIf  \u00a0-your relatives think your parenting style is \"Wuss\" but you don't really give a shit because you know you're doing your best with the set of cards you've been dealt. \u00a0Not to mention, your parenting comes from education and research, and trained therapists, not just beating your kids into submission because that's the way you were raised and that's quicker and easier.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n #YouMightBeAnAspieParentIf  -you cringe every time your phone rings and you see the name of your child's school on the caller i.d. \u00a0 Oh shit! What did he do now?! \n \n \n \n #YouMightbeAnAspieParentIf  -you love your child so much more when they're asleep and that's the only time you can kiss them without them cringing and wiping it off. \n \n \n \n #YouMightbeAnAspieParentIf  -you're used to your kid running away...and you don't run after him. \u00a0You know that he's just taking a cool down period. \n \n #YouMightbeAnAspieParentIf  -you have a few wholes that have been punched or kicked in your walls. \n \n #YouMightbeAnAspieParentIf  -you've heard your kids say...I just want to laugh like all of the other kids...but I just don't get it and your heart sinks into the bottom of your feet. \n \n #YouMightBeAnAspieParentIf  -you have prayed for your child to have at least one friend who accepts them just the way they are.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n #YouMightbeAnAspieParentIf  -you know more about StarWars, airplanes, exotic cars, computers and electronics of any kind...than you EVER wanted to know. \n \n #YouMightbeAnAspieParentIf  -you think the term \"family vacation\" is an oxymoron. \n \n #YouMightbeanAspieParentIf  -your kids are teenagers, but you can't leave them home alone for 5 minutes because the police may be called because they are trying to kill each other. \n \n #YouMightbeAnAspieParentIf  -you're on a first name basis with the entire school administration and the special education department of your school district and they say, \"Oh Shit! It's her again,\" when \nthey see you coming. \n \n #YouMightbeAnAspieParentIf   -you say out loud, \"Lady can you move a little slower!\" when you're trying to park the car. \u00a0 When you come back out of the store, your kid is telling the lady, \"My Mom says you move really slow.\" \n \n #YouMightbeAnAspieParentIf  -you know for sure that your kid knows every curse word in the English language and he may know a few in French and Spanish. \n \n#YouMightbeanAspieParentIf -your teen comes straight out and asks you will you be mad if they have sex in your house. \u00a0Or he may have to become a porn star if he can't find a girlfriend when he gets older. ( No...that NEVER happened to me! ) \n \n #YouMighbeAnAspieParentIf  -you know for sure that you have a child who will make the world a better place. \n \nI could go on all day, \u00a0but I'm going to give you all the chance to join the party. \u00a0Leave your  #YouMightBeAspieParentIf  comments below or better yet, lets start the trend again on twitter. \n \nHugs and Love, \n \n~Karen \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gppBpafPb84/UIVq19rNfMI/AAAAAAAAA28/mCEhorXJW2g/s1600/images-11.jpeg", "http://asd2mom.blogspot.com/2011/11/youmightbeanautismparentif.html", "https://twitter.com/manyhatsmommyMI", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099", "https://twitter.com/KAspergersMom"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/10/youmightbeanaspieparentif.html", "title": "\n#YouMightBeAnAspieParentIf\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 24, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nIf I don't go to college can I still be rich and successful? I don't want to be poor...but I don't want to do anything I don't want to do. \u00a0I want to go to college...but I don't want to do any homework in high school. It's way too stressful and takes up way to much of my free time!  \u00a0Free time to do what? Watch Sponge Bob? \u00a0This is the kind of logic I'm dealing with here when it comes to Red. \n \nWho likes homework really? None of us. \u00a0Personally, I hate it. If feels like teachers are punishing me for having to put up with my kids all day. \u00a0For Red it has never been about what he knows how to do. \u00a0It's about what I have the patience to  HELP  him do. \u00a0It's about how much of a headache I want for the night. \n \n\"Why do they even give it out?\"  \n\"Are they trying to torture us? \n\"Are they trying to make us all miserable?\" \n \nI've heard these questions thousands of times from both of the boys over the years. \u00a0I feel their pain...literally.  \n \nBlue (13) really does see the point. \u00a0He realizes it's about practicing what you have learned. \u00a0Sometimes it's an opportunity to finish what you weren't able to finish in class. \u00a0He goes through great lengths to get his done. \u00a0He will stay after school for tutorials and even go to the library or to Starbucks to work in a less distracting environment than this house with his brothers shenanigans. \u00a0 It doesn't mean that homework doesn't cause him stress and that sometimes...he just doesn't feel like doing it. \u00a0He gets overwhelmed. \u00a0 It has even caused him meltdowns. \u00a0After holding it all together at school, sometimes he wants and needs to come home and just chill...have some downtime. \n \nAt the same time, Blue has an ultimate goal. \u00a0He wants to go to college. \u00a0He says he wants to get a Ph.D. \u00a0He wants to be the best in his class. \u00a0He wants to be well...perfect...and he will drive us all completely nuts in order to get there. \n \nRed is a different animal altogether. \u00a0As he reaches the finish line of high-school he is starting to get a little more than panicked about his future. \u00a0You see, he wants to be successful. \u00a0He wants to be \"rich\"even. \u00a0He wants to be able to buy all of the \"things\" that he thinks will make him happy. \u00a0However, he does not want to come out of his comfort zone or push himself to do things that he just doesn't want to do.  \n \nHe says he wants to go to college, but only because he thinks that will yield him the best return on making money faster...and he wants everything fast! Unfortunately, he has never been one for getting out of the comfort zone and doing things that he really just does not want to do. \u00a0He is only self-motivated when it comes to doing what he  enjoys . \u00a0He can sit for hours and work on editing a video, but \u00a0he won't sit for 30 minutes to read a book for class unless someone is pointing a gun to his head. \u00a0He has taught himself how to use video editing software, but he can't or won't figure out how to do a research project for school. \n \nHe is on a minimum graduation plan, because of this fact. \u00a0Not because of his level of intelligence, but essentially because of his processing speed, which appears to be extra slow and because when he is sitting in a regular-ed classroom full of distractions, he can't focus and follow what's being taught, especially if he is just not interested. \u00a0It all sounds like garbly goo to him. \u00a0They may as well be speaking French. \u00a0He requires a smaller, more quiet environment with individual attention. \u00a0He does fine with his grades in a special education classroom. \u00a0He gets the work done and makes good grades. \n \nPart of the issue is also that in the high-school environment, he seems to be extremely distracted by the social climate. \u00a0 Why do all of these other boys have girlfriends? They all look like they're having so much fun, talking and laughing.  \u00a0He doesn't know how to do that. \u00a0He feels left out. \u00a0It really kills him when he sees the couples holding hands and  making out . \u00a0He takes all that garbage to class with him, which takes up space in his mind for actual learning.  \n \nThe theme of our conversation on Monday, on our way to his therapist is about how panicked he is about going to college because he's not in regular classes and he gets so much support. \u00a0He doesn't do any homework. \u00a0How can he possibly get through college without the same level of support? \u00a0Well...son the truth is they don't hold your hand in college. \u00a0College is for people who are self-motivated enough to get through the subjects that they hate...in order to get to the classes that they love. It's sad for me to say...I don't see that for him. \u00a0 I've asked him to challenge himself and take a few regular ed. classes...to bring assignments home to work on. \u00a0He did take regular science last year and was totally lost. \u00a0He refuses to do homework. \u00a0So there you have it. \u00a0They don't hold a gun to your head in college. \u00a0You either want to do it...or you don't.  \n \nI want both of them to have as many options as they possibly can. \u00a0He already has the social deficits of autism as a strike to make things more difficult for him. \u00a0The truth is, he is an African-American male...a minority, which can be another strike to make things more challenging on the road to success. \u00a0No matter how much this scares me as his mother, I have to remain positive with him.  \n \nI told him yesterday, \"There is more than one road to success. \u00a0Everyone has their own path. \u00a0Stop comparing yourself to your friends and your peers. \u00a0They don't have the same gifts that you do.\u00a0You can do anything you really want to do...if you are willing to work hard. \u00a0Aspergers does not limit you. \u00a0It just makes your path a little different.\"  \n \nI told him to investigate the video technical certification programs that his mentor sent him information about. \u00a0He may just have to get a job, or an apprenticeship to learn his craft and slowly move up and make more money. \u00a0His video tech mentor has already told him that he has a gift...a talent for editing which could get him a job as an assistant editor after high school.  \n \nRed is a very visual person. \u00a0I think what he needs is a visual road map leading towards his future. \u00a0We may have to work with his Person Centered Planner to create one. \u00a0The map may change with time and maturity. \u00a0In the end...if he keeps moving forward and working hard...it will lead him  out of my house  and to success.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9xmfmcQpsZ8/UIhAXl-z85I/AAAAAAAAA3g/fYe0XiGLmXw/s1600/images-14.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/10/homeworkno-thanks.html", "title": "\nHomework...No Thanks\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, October 13, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nBlue is upset...feeling like the entire world is resting on his shoulders. \u00a0Why? In a word...School. \u00a0He is smart as a whip -but it's that deficit in executive planning that gets him every time.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThere are so many things to do...so many deadlines to think about. \u00a0There's that science project -building an atom model to the tune of $45.00 in supplies plus $30.00 in tutoring fees. \u00a0That's an expensive got-dammed model! \u00a0I kind of feel like I've been robbed. \u00a0He could have drawn an example of an atom for free! \u00a0He has excellent artistic skills. \u00a0Seriously...I have to admit it was totally worth paying our teenaged neighbor to help him. \u00a0He would have fought with me tooth and nail all the way through if I tried to assist him. \u00a0But still...$75.00 later!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThen there is that history test that his Social Studies teacher stresses ...\"You all better study! \u00a0It's not going to be easy!\" And it was not. \u00a0Blue did not do well...and he was not happy! \u00a0 Pre-Ap Algebra 1? ...too much homework for his taste. \u00a0He is longing for a little more down time when he comes home. \u00a0And he needs it! \u00a0Anything extra...even going to church (which he is starting to really enjoy) can mean a meltdown.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nLanguage Arts of which he decided to take Pre-Ap? \u00a0He's starting to feel like he made a big mistake! \n \n\"I can not read that fast! \u00a0She expects us to read silently...to ourselves! I need to hear it. \u00a0Not just read it. \u00a0I do much better when we read along together in class.\" \n \nHe needs to involve at least two senses to everyone else's one. \u00a0He is a great writer...like his mama. \u00a0It's the fiction reading that slows him down.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe stress shows up here at home in the form of a disagreeable, grumpy, extra-arugmentative, easily explosive child. \u00a0Yeah...fun for us! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen I tell Aspergers Dad about his stress and feelings of being overwhelmed, his response. \"Tell him it's only going to get harder. \u00a0He better get used to it.\" \u00a0 There is a reason why God gave these kids two parents.  \u00a0Of course Dad is right...in a way, but I'm not going to tell him that. \u00a0The part that he leaves out, is that we have to teach him ways to advocate for himself to take down his stress level. \u00a0For instance ...in college, you can take less classes to slow things down a bit, or take classes after noon so you don't have to get up so early in the morning. \u00a0You can build flexibility into your schedule.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am all for trying to be the best...but not to the point of stressing yourself out and being totally anxious about it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo Blue talks to his tracking teacher and his Language arts teacher about his trouble keeping up. \u00a0He doesn't really feel like they are hearing him. \u00a0He comes home and tells me, \"They weren't any help!\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI have to work my Mom Magic in the background. \u00a0I send an e-mail to the Language Arts teacher, informing her of the testing I had done last year by our Neurologist, which shows that Blue's reading fluency is below grade level, although his vocabulary and word recognition are well ABOVE grade level. \u00a0So basically, when it comes to reading fiction, he needs a little extra support in the form of audio as well as visual. \u00a0She graciously agrees to accommodate him. \u00a0We all know he has a brilliant mind and is capable of plenty, we just have to be flexible and make things work for him. \n \n \n \nI put a spark under the tracking teachers ass with a phone and an e-mail stressing that he needs a road-map to help him with executive planning. \u00a0I also ask her to work with Blue and the Social Studies teacher to see how he can make up the grade for the test he did not do well. \u00a0We need to do all of this today because I am going out tonight and I can't afford for him to come home and have a meltdown. \u00a0I do not want to miss the concert I've been planning to go to for weeks. \u00a0She jumps right on it and handles the situation.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI then put in a phone call to Cole's bestie's mom to ask her if she can help me out by allowing him to come over and hang with the boys for a few hours while we go out. \u00a0That will help take the sting out of his day of mishaps. \u00a0It will allow for me to go out without getting any phone calls about a meltdown or fight at home between the two boys. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nYep...a sistah has to work that magic that so that Blue could get the support he needs while his mom and dad got the chance to go out to get our groove back. \u00a0We partied like we were young, and in love with no responsibilities for the night. \u00a0Not only did we enjoy seeing Erykah Badu at Austin City Limits...we also danced our asses off to the DJ's music out on the patio afterwards. \u00a0I was like... Wow! I remember this! \u00a0There is life on a Thursday night when you don't have kids to worry about. \u00a0Sweet memories of \u00a0life B.C. (before children).\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI partied like a rock star for the night. \u00a0Until it all came to a screeching halt when I had to get up the next morning to get Blue to school on time and then take Red in to the Podiatrist for a little toe surgery. \u00a0What was I thinking when I made that appointment? \u00a0Obviously I wasn't thinking about drinking so much vodka the night before. \u00a0He's doing fine by the way...\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs for me...it only took me two days to recover.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X_9uHxEVef4/UHnDeldz9fI/AAAAAAAAA2E/YSqW9N-Y5co/s1600/ACL.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/10/mom-magic.html", "title": "\nMom Magic \n"},

Yeah...what fun! \n\"Try not to worry about it. \u00a0You'll be fine,\" says Blue. \n\"What if I don't know the answers...do I just guess or do I leave it blank\" \n\"No...don't leave it blank. \u00a0Well...make a knowledgable guess.\" \n\"Huh?\" \n\"Just give the best possible answer based on what knowledge you have.\" \n \nNow this is great advice if you have a little knowledge and can make an educated guess. \u00a0But if you're like me, when I was in high-school and you have absolutely no clue...you just guess...and you guess C. \u00a0I remember doing that many times. \u00a0It's definitely better than leaving it blank...at least in my opinion. \n \nOf course, Blue like my husband, \u00a0is very smart, \u00a0scientific and logical. \u00a0Blue also thinks he knows EVERYTHING! \u00a0Can you imagine the two of them in an argument or shall I say, discussion? \n \nNow it's true in many ways Blue probably is smarter than me. \u00a0However...I have 35 years on him. \u00a0I've been through high school, college, have held a professional license for Real Estate and took said exam for \u00a0this license. \u00a0Of course, I passed...well...eventually. \u00a0I've also had years of work and life experience. \u00a0That means something right?  \n \nSo I interject, \"And if you have absolutely no clue what the answer is...guess C.\" \n\"NO!!! What are you talking about mom? \u00a0First of all you're interrupting me when I'm talking to my friend. \u00a0You always interrupt me!\"  This is a classic line straight out of his father's mouth! \n\"If you answer C you only have a 25% chance of being right! \u00a0Don't do that Twin!\" \n\"Actually, I think it's slightly more than 25%. \u00a0I remember reading that somewhere,\" I reply. \n\"This is the 21st Century Mom! This is not the 1900's. \u00a0This is basic math! \u00a0You ALWAYS disagree with me!\"  Another classic line from hubby! Because I'm always supposed to agree right?\u00a0 \n\"This is what we call a discussion son. I am allowed to share my opinion based on my life experience. \u00a0It's called a conversation. \u00a0You know where people share different ideas.\" \u00a0 Also a classic line from every argument I've ever had with my husband!  With hubby, \u00a0 I \u00a0usually \u00a0also through in a line about taking Philosophy in college, where I learned that you have show me some proof about what you're saying. \u00a0I don't have to just accept what you say without any evidence. \u00a0Yeah...he loves that!\u00a0 \n \nYou see...hubby likes to give these soliloquies where he goes on and on for 5, 10 even 20 minutes argument for his point of view. \u00a0You are not supposed to interject, or disagree...just listen (even if you are being accused of non-truths, and inaccuracies. \u00a0I should be like President Obama, taking notes and looking disengaged during the debate, so I don't forget my point when it's finally my turn to talk.  \n \nI tell Blue...I'm going to look up the statistic on-line. \u00a0To which he tells me...there is no point in looking up. \u00a0He knows he is right.  \nThis is what found this on Wiki-Answers: \n \n \"I remember, in college, reading a study where someone took tens of thousands of multiple-choice tests from different disciplines and studies. The result was that, on a standard 4-choice test, the letter \"C\" came up more than 28% of the time as an answer. This was due to \"writer's bias,\" and the author assumed it was because the letter \"C\" - or the third choice - would \"be hidden\" as a selection. \u00a0A s a high-school teacher and an Ohio graduation test-prep tutor, I tell my kids that, if they come across a question where they\u00a0absolutely\u00a0can't use deduction and/or find an educated guess ..pick the letter \"C\" - you have at least a 1 in 4 chance of being right, and if you consistently pick \"C\" in these circumstances (hopefully only once or twice per test!), you have a slightly mathematically higher chance of getting that question right... maybe only a fraction higher, but at that point, \"Play the numbers!\" \n \nI also found evidence to support Blue's answer of 25%. \u00a0But I won't print that here. \u00a0 Hey...it's my blog damn it! \n \nThe point is...arguing with my son is almost exactly the same as arguing with my husband. \u00a0Yes...I am a common denominator in these arguments. \u00a0I do have a tendency to look at and think about different perspectives. \u00a0Hence, one of the reasons hubby says I always disagree with him. \u00a0I often point out the perspectives that others may have. You see...I love a good exchange of ideas. \u00a0I am the first to admit that I don't know everything. However, I can learn from a good conversation or argument. \u00a0To learn you have to be willing to actually listen to the other party with an open mind. Hopefully, you don't fall asleep while they go on and on for 20 minutes. \n \nIt is my biased opinion that both husband and son see the world from their own perspective (Aspie and undiagnosed Aspie)...and me not being that way makes me a serious pain in the ass!!! \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-E1WtVlIQ3Qw/UJFQyhpJf6I/AAAAAAAAA38/Y6awcR44Xis/s1600/images-15.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/10/my-husbandmyson.html", "title": "\nMy Husband/MySon\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 30, 2012", "body": "\n \n As a tribute to what many autism parents maybe be going through this morning after Hurricane Sandy, I am republishing this post. \u00a0It was originally posted in April, \u00a02011. \u00a0Blue was still in the heart of his storm anxiety. \u00a0Here we are a year and 1/2 later. \u00a0He is nearly 14 years-old, \u00a0and that anxiety has mostly been alleviated. \u00a0Maturity, time, Abilify and facing those fears head on by actually being out in the middle of storm, all helped him to put the squash on what was once crippling storm anxiety. \u00a0I just want you all to know...there is always hope! \n \n April 11, 2007 , \n \nI get on Facebook this morning -all my Central Texas friends are happy because we got rain last night. \u00a0It cooled our temperatures a few degrees. \u00a0Our grass and trees appreciate the free water. \u00a0 Blue is not happy with the rain. \u00a0I thought things were getting better with the anxiety over thunderstorms -no such luck. \n \n \n \nIt's starting to warm up here in Central Texas. \u00a0Cold air coming down from the north mixing with our warm air = thunder and lightening. \u00a0Thunder and lightening = frightening to my little boy Blue. \n \nHe checks the weather and radar with regularity. \u00a0If there is more than a 20% chance -he worries, especially if its overnight. \u00a0He doesn't want to be awakened by a loud clap of thunder and the house vibrating. \u00a0He wants to control his environment, especially when it's time to go to sleep. \u00a0He doesn't like loud sounds, and he certainly doesn't want to be surprised and awakened by one in the middle of the night. \n \nThings are better since he's on a low dosage of Abilify -meaning he's not hiding out throughout the day when the sun is still shining. \u00a0But overnight -if there's a good chance of a storm -he camps out in the bathroom. \u00a0Loud fan blowing, layers of blankets and pillows, sleeping bag, Ipod, earplugs, earphones and a lamp for soft lighting. \u00a0He'd rather sleep next to a toilet than be awakened by a storm. \u00a0That is really sad. \u00a0One day we will look back on this and laugh --not today. \n \nWe have tried the whole ordering him to sleep in his bed -no matter what. \u00a0All that means is once we're asleep, he sneaks into the bathroom anyway. \u00a0His fear is very real to him. \u00a0No matter how logical we try to be in our explanation, \"It's not going to hurt you. \u00a0Have you ever been hurt by a storm? \u00a0We are here...we will keep you safe. \u00a0We won't let anything bad happen to you.\" \u00a0It doesn't matter what we say. If I can't crawl into his head and flip a switch...it doesn't work. \u00a0He has to come out of this on his own. \n \nLast night he sets up camp while there isn't a cloud in the sky, but the radar says there is a 40% chance that a storm is coming. \u00a0He comes into our bedroom around 12:30 a.m. and asks me if I will come in the bathroom with him if it starts. \u00a0There is nothing but a little wind at this point. \u00a0I beg him to go back to sleep and not worry. \u00a0I may as well have told him to fly around the room like a bird. \n \nThe thunder claps start around 4 a.m. \u00a0They are short lived, but the build up in waiting for it kept him awake most of the night. \u00a0As I write this, he's sleeping it off, \u00a0unable to go to school on time because he probably didn't go to sleep until 5 a.m. \u00a0He will not miss the entire day. \u00a0He refuses to get behind in his schoolwork.  \n \nFor now I wait -until he wakes. \u00a0Thankfully -he will wake up to sunny skies, fresh green grass and blooming plants...not that he cares one damn bit. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-__ObkNMPhMM/TaMKBhekkqI/AAAAAAAAALQ/Mqy_EQzxV8Q/s1600/images-14.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/10/after-storm.html", "title": "\nAfter the Storm\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 28, 2012", "body": "\n \n11 p.m. we are driving down the road on our way to the E.R. \u00a0Red says to me, \"When I'm an adult and I get this sick...who is going to drive me to the doctor?\" \u00a0Before we left the house he had asked, \"If I was living in my own apartment and I am this sick...who would help take care of me and tell me what to do?\" \u00a0I wanted to tell him, you are not the first or the last man who can't figure out what to do when they are sick. \u00a0Many of them do nothing...they just lay there helplessly, in misery.  \n\"Hopefully there will be a woman in your life who will help you, or hopefully a roommate,\" I say knowing, it may very well end up being me. \n \nHe had this little cough for days...no fever, no loss of appetite.\u00a0I started out with herbal, natural remedies, \u00a0teas, honey, lemon, steamy baths, eucalyptus and peppermint oil. \u00a0I progressed to trying everything in the book of pharmaceuticals. \u00a0Whatever I gave him would make things slightly better for maybe an hour or while he slept. \u00a0Until every thing stopped working...completely. \n \n \n \nHis dad kept telling me to put on a mask or something as I kept going in and out of his room and later in and out of \u00a0the steamy bathroom, where I had him soaking in a eucalyptus, peppermint and lavendar bath. \u00a0I kept going in to tell him what to do next.  \n\"I don't want you to get sick,\" hubby says. \n\"I am his mother...I don't care about that. \u00a0I have to take care of my son!\" \nHubby accused me of biting his head off and maybe I did. \u00a0A mother has to do what a mother has to do, without hesitation or apprehension. \n \n \n \"God knew exactly what he was doing when he created woman. \u00a0He thought to himself ...he'll never make it...smh. \"  My Facebook status that night. \u00a0 \n \n (Sorry men...don't mean to bash you. \u00a0I love you...really...well, most of you.) \n \nI did my hand-washing and cupped my face when he was coughing, and had him cough into a wash towel as a precaution, but I didn't think twice about not being around him. \n \nWe arrive at the hospital and get out of the car into to the cold, night air. \u00a0I make him put his hood on his head, as he had not long been out of the steamy bath and his hair was still damp. \u00a0We are both carrying a micro-fiber blanket. \u00a0I'd been through this before a few months ago with hubby. \u00a0It's always cold in those E.R. rooms. Too bad I didn't pack a snack. \u00a0I always end up figuring out that I'm hungry shortly after we arrive. \nI check in. \u00a0Red starts exploring the place. \n\"This is pretty cool. \u00a0It's new isn't it? I've never been here before,\" his curiosity like that of a young boy. \n \nI notice he isn't coughing nearly as much. \u00a0Before we left home the coughing fits were so fierce I thought he would never be able to sleep. \u00a0I would therefore never be able to sleep with him in that condition. Now these nurses and doctors are probably going to think I'm a nutty, neurotic mother. \u00a0Perhaps that's a good assessment...but whatever...we're here. \n \nWe go into triage within minutes. \u00a0They ask questions directly to him because he looks like he's an adult, with his hairy, needs-to-be-shaved face. \u00a0I want him to be able to answer these medical questions just in case this ever happens in the future and I'm not around. \u00a0There are awkward pauses and hesitations, like he is trying to process what the hell they are saying. \u00a0Some of them quite simple, obvious questions, at least to me. \u00a0It's all I can do not to step in and be his voice, \u00a0He almost gets through the list of medications he is taking, only forgetting about one. \u00a0He turns to me and says, \n\"Am I going to have to take these medicines for the rest of my life, because I can't remember all of this?\" \n\"Hopefully, you won't. \u00a0But you can always keep a list of your medications in your wallet.\" \n \nHis temperature is normal. \u00a0I ask about his oxygen level, which I guess is fine. \u00a0They don't offer any additional incite or information.  Lovely . \n \nThese days Red is constantly thinking about adulthood and the responsibilities, that will soon belong to him. \u00a0It's kind of a good thing...but it's also becoming a source of anxiety. \n \nThey take us through towards the back of the E.R. to a room. \n\"I'm sorry, but this is the only room available. \u00a0It's our rowdy room.\" \n What the hell is a rowdy room?  It's sparse...drab, nothing on the walls, no medical machines...nada...just a chair and a bed. \u00a0I assume this is where they take the drunk, belligerent people who come in during the wee hours of the night after a bar fight. \nI think to myself,  okay ...we told them the medications he's on. \u00a0Do they think he's going to go ballistic? Or is the room for black people?  We are often the only \"colored\" people in the room in our community. \u00a0But seriously... what the hell?\u00a0 \n \nAs we are waiting for the doc...I take a look around. \u00a0The nurse says, \"May I help you mam?\" \u00a0\"Seriously...is the only room you have available?\" \n\"Right now...yes.\" \n Wow! Whatever... \nRed is looking at the gown like it's a foreign object. \u00a0\"What am I supposed to do with this?\" \nHe tries to put it on and then lays back and starts talking incessantly about some video series on YouTube by an angry Ginger who is bullied and harassed. \u00a0Why he is watching these videos over and over again...I have no idea. \u00a0Do I care to hear anything about it? \u00a0Absolutely not. \n \nThe doctor comes in with no chart...nada. \u00a0\"I'm doctor whoever...and what's going on here tonight?\" I wonder if he even knows all of the information we just gave triage. \u00a0He asks a few questions and examines Red briefly, checking the ears and throat, listening briefly to his chest...I think he listened to his chest. \u00a0It was all so fast...it's just a blur. \u00a0He's walking towards the door when he says, \u00a0\"Well it's probably just a virus, but we will do a chest x-ray to make sure it isn't pneumonia.\" \n\"How does his throat look?\" I ask...I'm sure with all of the coughing it has to be kind of raw. \n\"It looks normal.\" \n \n \n \nThis guy is definitely no Mc Dreamy, Mc Steamy or anything else. \u00a0In fact he's kind of a douche. \u00a0He gave off this vibe like he didn't really want to be in the room. \u00a0Seriously, why are you standing at the doorway talking to us? \n \nThe tech comes with a wheel chair to take him to x-ray. \u00a0Again Red looks like,  what the hell? \nHe says, \"That's o.k. I can walk.\" \nThe tech explains it's their policy that they have to transport patients this way. \n \nLater the doctor returns to say, \"Well I see a spot that looks a little suspicious on his lungs. It could be pneumonia, so we're going to go ahead and treat it with antibiotics.\" \nI tell him, Red has had breathing treatments before when he was coughing like this, but it's been so long, that I didn't have any current medicine for the nebulizer. \n\"Oh...well we can give him a breathing treatment if you want.\"  If I want? Like, what if I don't want? How do I know what he needs? \u00a0You're the doctor! What the hell? \u00a0Let's give him the works! Like we're ordering a pizza!?\u00a0 \n \nThey finally move us to a decent room because the tech can't give us a breathing treatment in this room that has no hookups. \u00a0 Just wow!  She asks him if he feels better afterwards? He says, \"Not really. \u00a0I'm still coughing.\" \nShe explains that the nebulizer medicine doesn't actually take away the cough, but it should open up his lungs and help him breathe better. \u00a0He looks at her kind of like... whatever. \n \nThe nurse comes in and gives us discharge instructions. \u00a0The discharge papers say that it is bronchitis. \u00a0 So why did the doctor say pneumonia?  He gave us a few prescriptions. \u00a0I ask her if they can give him the first dosage of the medicine for the cough so I don't have to go to the pharmacy at what is now 1 a.m.  \n\"Well the doctor didn't order that.\"  And so....ask him to order it! Isn't this an f-ing hospital? \u00a0Do they not have medicine here?  \u00a0Nope...she directs me to the 24-hour Walgreens...as if I don't already f-ing know where it is! I'm sorry people...at this point I am exhausted. \n \nWe go drop the prescriptions...it will take 20 minutes to fill them. \u00a0We drive across the street to Wendy's to take up the time and of course, because I am starving!  Why is it I'm always starving when I have to wait around an emergency room for hours?\u00a0 \n \nMy favorite quote of the night was when Red said, \"This is really bad. \u00a0I'd rather go to school than be this sick.\" \n \n \n \nWe make it home somewhere around 2 a.m. \u00a0I check in with my\u00a0 \"Confessions\" facebook community . \u00a0So many had reached out to us, with suggestions, prayers and well wishes. \u00a0Some of them were waiting up to see what happened until we got home. \u00a0I was just amazed by the outpouring of love. \n \n \n \n Dr. McHottie \nRed's real \nPediatrician \n \nToday we go to see Red's Pediatrician as a follow up to make sure this lame doctor assessed him correctly. \u00a0Dr. B could teach that E.R. doctor a thing or two about bedside manner. \n \nI'm sure he would just love to know he has been objectified in this manner. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-cB0hddGm8SM/ULZgbEF08WI/AAAAAAAAA54/o5hYhFwNCrs/s1600/images.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=hl", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y7dVXz6kUho/ULZh6DtiWFI/AAAAAAAAA6I/8f6mPIyc_Rs/s1600/brooks_booker.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/11/er-minus-mcdreamy.html", "title": "\nE.R.

I had not made one nor did I feel like rushing to do so. \u00a0 \n \n\"Can you just eat in the cafeteria?\" \n\"Mom...I hate that food. Can you just bring me a sandwich from Subway and a cookie?\" \n \n\"Fine...I will bring you your lunch later.\" \n \nI've been gone for 4 days....I let a little mommy guilt set me up for bringing the boy lunch. \n \n \n \nMeanwhile...I crawl back in bed with my laptop. \u00a0Before I know it...I am passed out cold. My flight got in late. \u00a0I had narrowly escaped getting sick while I was away. \u00a0Apparently, my body needed rest.  \n \n \n12:45 p.m. The phone rings.  Shit! I forgot about the lunch.  He convinced me that I needed to come. \u00a0He said it was too late to get a cafeteria lunch. \u00a0Luckily, his special-ed teacher heard him on the phone and caught me before I headed out the door with my sweats on, and an unwashed face. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n\"I can get him a lunch in the cafeteria. \u00a0He will be fine,\" she says. \u00a0 \n \n\"Tell him I'll make it up to him later,\" I say to her. \nTo which I'm sure she rolled her eyes and said,  \"Whatever lady,\" under her breath.  I'm sure she wanted to say,  \"He needs to get over it. \u00a0You don't need to come running to his rescue to bring him lunch. \u00a0He needs to roll with the punches. \u00a0You're not feeling well. \u00a0Why should you run out in the cold, over here to bring this kid lunch?\" \u00a0 \n \nHe did make it sound like it was too late to get lunch and who knows, maybe in his mind it was. \u00a0He certainly didn't want to ask her for help. \u00a0He'd rather ask me. \u00a0He's no dummy. \u00a0He knows who he can manipulate. \u00a0Nevertheless, his teacher took him down and made sure he got a sandwich. \u00a0He survived. \u00a0He did not die of starvation....and I did not have to get out in the cold, in my my sweatpants with a dirty face. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAfter school, I took his spoiled ass to Mc Donald's and bought dinner for him and his brother...a total wimp move. \u00a0At the same time, I did not feel like cooking...so this was also win for me.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nSo back to the question I posed... wimpy or strong, \u00a0definitely got minds spinning. \u00a0I usually use a bit of humor and provocation to solicit a passionate response. \u00a0On the  Facebook thread \u00a0the advice that was given was good for all of us. \u00a0Some of us admitted to being wimpy, because we are tired of screaming fits that often come along with Aspergers. Mostly everyone commented that it's most important to be consistent and to always follow through. \u00a0Aspergers kids especially, need to know what to expect and they need to know the boundaries. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nLorrelle Wittingslow sums it up perfectly... \n \n \n \n \" The WORST thing you can do is say one thing and do another!!! This teaches children that the rules are able to be bent and manipulated if they keep nagging/ annoying/ misbehaving. This eventually teaches them not to listen/ obey what you have to say and makes it difficult for when adolescence arrives. Studies have provem that a child with strict rules and strong boundaries is a much happier child because there is no fear of repercussion if they stay within the clearly defined lines. So being a hard mum doesn't mean you are hard, it just means you are ensuring your child is confident and socially well rounded. I have used this method with both of my children including my son who has Aspergers Syndrome (no social skills) and he is doing marvelously!\" \n \n \n \nI also loved this comment from Krista Hallet\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \"... I've got to give all you parents a standing ovation. the fact that you have the strength to ask the tough questions shows me that you, in fact, are a tough mom. You are also so incredibly loving as you are asking for help and the welfare of your child, is above all your priority!! I am also a mom ...the comments also taught me a few things that I have yet to completely figure out on my own. Bless you all for your honesty, compassion, love and strength. For those moms that think they are wimpy, I see otherwise and you should be darn proud of yourselves.\" \n \n \n \nAnd most of the time...I am proud of the job that I do. However, I know there is always someone out there who is doing it better, easier or who has some magic secret that has eluded me. I never stop looking for answers.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lRQoJWalmzI/UKUZMiqcgZI/AAAAAAAAA4k/WQa28m5OVcQ/s1600/wimpy.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=hl", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=hl"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/11/wimpy-or-strong.html", "title": "\nWimpy or Strong\n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 23, 2012", "body": "\n \nI am starting to notice certain changes as I evolve into my 47 year-old self. \u00a0Yep! I said it...forty-seven. \u00a0I know for sure the things that I like and the things that I don't. \u00a0I have a great deal of patience for my kids, but very little for some adults and things that I simply do not want to do. \u00a0There are too many things in my life that I do on a daily basis not because they are my favorite thing, but because I am a responsible adult, a mother, a wife and caregiver. \u00a0When it comes to choices where there really is an option...I may very well choose to  opt out  if it's not something I honestly want. \n \nI know for sure that am very spiritual, but not religious. \u00a0I believe in God. \u00a0I believe in prayer. \u00a0I believe in following the example of Christ. \u00a0I do not necessarily believe in following people and/or churches who claim that they are following Christ. \u00a0Not all of them are really. \u00a0Many are self serving, selective, and judgemental. \u00a0I will only be judged by God...not men. I am thrilled that my boys are choosing faith and following their own path and relationship with God. \u00a0I am pleased that their faith is authentic and not forced by anyone, including me. \n \nI believe in freedom of choice in all aspects of life, including your path to God. \u00a0I strongly believe that all people despite religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability, or different ability, are entitled to certain inalienable rights. \u00a0I believe in living my life in service to help others, especially those who are less fortunate than I am. \u00a0If I can touch a life, help someone financially, make someone smile or feel less alone in this world...I am successful. \n \nI have come to treasure simple pleasures like peace, quiet, time alone, art, music, things that make me laugh authentically. \u00a0I love a good glass a wine or three, a margarita or two, and a great martini. \u00a0I love and treasure the true friends that I have. \u00a0They really do mean the world to me, including some of my friends that I have truly connected with online. \u00a0I think about them daily. \u00a0I think about their children. \u00a0I cheer with them on their journey, and cry with them when they are in pain.  \n \nThere is just nothing like someone whom you love and trust with your most treasured secrets...that you can talk to, laugh with, share your truths and receive the truth in return...without judgement. \u00a0A couple of weeks ago I got to spend time with my one of my treasured girlfriends, Beccy. \u00a0She was my first roommate when I was in my 20's. \u00a0We took a girls-trip together, along with another good friend of hers Lilli. \u00a0Beccy and I \u00a0are different in so many ways and yet, we have so many things in common. \u00a0It was interesting to see how much she has grown and changed ...how life as a wife and a mother has allowed her to blossom and mature into this wonderful, bright, articulate, strong woman. \u00a0  \n \nWe were able to share our stories and laugh at the craziness of what has become our lives. \u00a0We are both kind of artsy fartsy. \u00a0We love writing, movies and books. \u00a0She, unlike me is very focused and organized where I am a bit of a scatterbrain. \u00a0She was smart enough to have only one child, a precious little girl, where I have 3 wild and crazy boys...hence, the scatterbrain. \u00a0We reminisced about the days when we were young, partying and carefree ...about some of the crazy escapades and guys that we dated. \u00a0There was never any, \"I can't believe you raise your kids that way.\" Or any, \"Why did you make that decision?\" It was just love, laughter and support. \u00a0If feel so lucky to have this woman in my life 23 years later and still be able to enjoy each other's company so much. \n \n \n Me and the girls hanging out drinking martinis \n \nAt the same time, one of the best parts of my trip was the final day. \u00a0Beccy and Lilli left early that morning. I got to wake up to silence and solitude. \u00a0I drank hot coffee and sat like a cat curled up in the window seat of my hotel room, staring out at the view of the city. \u00a0I listened to a little music, did a little writing and just reveled in the silence. \u00a0I took a long, hot, steamy, aromatic bath. \u00a0I took my sweet time getting dressed. \u00a0I walked to a little Italian cafe, had a leisurely glass of wine and a yummy, light lunch. I basked in the glory of the warm sun and the cool California breeze on my walk back to the hotel.  \n \nAs much as I love my friends and being social, I also have come to just love and treasure time by myself. In my 20's I was afraid to spend time by myself. \u00a0I hated it...probably because of immaturity and insecurity. Now...I love not having anyone to check in with, \u00a0having no-one to negotiate with over what we are going to do next. \u00a0I love not rushing...taking my own, sweet time, enjoying my own thoughts instead of constantly being bombarded by the thoughts of others, requests and even simple conversation. \u00a0Sometimes I just want stillness. \n \nBeing a mother to these children, a wife and a daughter, caretaker has created this person who has truly come to love a simple life. \u00a0I love to dance, go out and have a few drinks, but I don't have to do it every week. \u00a0I can have my very own private party in the privacy of my own home. \u00a0I can have just as good of a time, drinking wine and painting, or writing at home. \u00a0I love a really good party, a concert, a good movie. \u00a0Actually, it's become hard to get me out of the house unless I feel that the movie is really worth my precious time and money.  \n \nI love time alone with my husband...especially when we can get away from the hustle of this house. I love to travel with him ...where we can really get into pleasing one another. \u00a0As I grow more into myself, I realize that he is a big part of my world, but he is not my  entire  world. \u00a0He is a part of what makes me happy, but he is not my happiness. \u00a0My happiness comes from within...it comes from every once in a while, doing something that pleases me...despite how everyone else feels about it.  \n \nEvery one is not going to be happy when you do things to please yourself. \u00a0In fact, sometimes when you step out of the box and chart new ground, many even those you are closest to will look at you like you're crazy. \u00a0 It's because you're doing something that they would never do. They don't understand it. It may also be because they know in some way, it will divert your attention away from them. \u00a0My children are definitely guilty of this. \u00a0In their eyes, my life should be all about them all of the time. \u00a0My mother and sometimes my husband are guilty as well. \u00a0They really loathe and do not trust social media. They hate that I spend so much time on it. \u00a0Hubby does information security for a living so he has a different insight. \u00a0Mom has always been the most paranoid person on earth. \u00a0I don't really care. \u00a0I can't live my life in paranoia over what  might  happen, or who may be reading what I write.  \n \nWhen I first started this blog and noticed readers from all over the world, my mom said, \"It's probably the terrorists reading it.\" \nTo which I replied, \"Well, they must have children with autism. \u00a0I hope I can help them.\"  \nWriting this blog and my  Facebook page \u00a0has been one of the best decisions I have made in my adult life. \u00a0I love it! \u00a0I love the connections I have made with people all over the world. \u00a0I can not allow how others feel about what I am doing stop me from doing what's in my heart. \n \nYesterday was Thanksgiving. \u00a0We shared our dinner and our day with good friends who live nearby. \u00a0We had plenty of wine and plenty of food. Overall, it was a great day. \u00a0A few hours in however, I was done. \u00a0I was all talked out. \u00a0There were several generations in the house and at a certain point, all of the elder generations went home...except my mother. \u00a0Since she moved to Texas, she has no life outside of this house. \u00a0This was a social outing for her, and she was not about to cut it short.  \n \nOh My God...the conversation went on and on with my girlfriend, her daughter, me and my mother. \u00a0We talked about raising children, movies, college, health, life...you name it. \u00a0Only I could not freely let go in this conversation because my mother was sitting there, with her judgement about my life. \u00a0I was bordering on trying to have a good time, and trying not to tell her to mind her own freakin' business. \u00a0I raise my children the way I see fit...not the way she sees fit.  \n \nThe whole time I kept thinking, \u00a0 boy...I'd rather be home in my P.J's writing, or zoning out watching a movie. \u00a0Geez Christmas is only a month away and I will have to do this cooking-all-day and socializing all-night thing afterwards!  \u00a0I'm pooped! \u00a0Overstimulated! \u00a0Give me a break...please! I love to socialize, but at a point, I get tired. \u00a0I am done. \u00a0I know I am blessed to have my mother in my life...but I really don't want to socialize with her for extended periods of time...especially when there is wine drinking involved and she looses her filter. \n \nWhen I was on my girlfriend trip a few weeks ago in San Francisco, I have to say my favorite  night  of the trip was not when we were out at fancy restaurant, although that was great. \u00a0It wasn't hanging out in the bar drinking martinis... and that was really fun. \u00a0My favorite night was when we came in after a long day of walking through Chinatown, and shopping. \u00a0 We put on our pajamas, ordered room service, drank wine, shared a few laughs, watched a funny movie and went to bed by midnight.  \n \n \n Tired feet after a day of walking around the city \n \nWhat I know for sure about myself \u00a0is that I am growing, changing and evolving daily. \u00a0I don't have to have glitz, glam and party-all-the-time atmosphere. \u00a0I know what I want and I want what I know. \u00a0This is the girl that I have become...and I think I kinda love her. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z3_6Mi-aOfQ/UK_K9gfG2cI/AAAAAAAAA5U/c23wExY82kI/s1600/thegirls.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=hl", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uhfdTpHGa0M/UK_LVr_vhaI/AAAAAAAAA5c/i897hhMyTaY/s1600/tiredfeet.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/11/getting-to-know-me.html", "title": "\nGetting to Know Me\n"},

Who ever created porn is a prick!\"\u00a0 \n \nAs a mother I know I should not be laughing, especially with the language and all...but I thought this was hilarious. \u00a0I love that Aspie honesty. \n \nLater that night before bed he says, \n \n \"You know mom...I really had a good time with you and Blue today. \u00a0It may not always seem like it but...I really love you.\"\u00a0 \n \nJust wow.... \n \nTuesday afternoon Facebook status: \n \n \n \n \"Had a really awesome day!!! :) I job trained two students with special needs today. I'm very proud of doing that. My job coaches are working on getting me a job at a hotel. God has blessed me a lot this school year!! Thank you God for everything!!! :) \n \nHis job coach told him he was doing a really good job. \u00a0She also made the mistake of telling him there was a 90% chance that he would get a job at this hotel. \u00a0He went to the site on Wednesday, opened mouth and inserted foot.  \n \nWhile vacuuming in front of the prospective employer he says and I quote: \n \n \"When it comes to certain things...I move kind of slow.\"\u00a0 \n \nOn the way back to school he and job coach get into it. \u00a0She tells him he made the wrong impression. \u00a0You never tell an employer you work slowly. \u00a0He becomes angry. \u00a0She tells him he may have blown it. \u00a0So basically, he has gone from an extreme high to this low... and of course he blames the Job-Coach. \u00a0When they get back to campus he starts yelling, door slamming, fist banging, etc. \n \nI have to say...he did show  some  restraint. \u00a0At least he waited until they got back to the classroom to show his anger. \u00a0However, \u00a0as a consequence...he gets an office referral and ends up getting lunch detention the following day. \u00a0Personally, I think the job coach should have gotten detention too! \u00a0She should never have opened her mouth to tell him that the job was 90% in the bag in the first place. \n \nHe comes home from school...quote: \n \n \"I don't need those freaking job coaches! \u00a0I don't need special education! \u00a0And I'm not going to any freakin' detention!\"\u00a0 \n \nI told him not to worry, if for some reason this door closes it just means that a better one will open. \u00a0Perhaps this is not the job for him. \u00a0He watched a little Sponge Bob to lighten his mood. \u00a0Later he says, to me... \n \n \"I just want to be normal. \u00a0I don't understand why I have to get so angry. \u00a0Other people aren't like this. \u00a0I'm tired of being this way and I don't know what else to do when I'm angry .\" \n \nI remind him of how far he has come in a year's time. \u00a0That his anger does not take as long to get through. \u00a0He recovers quickly. \u00a0He apologizes. \u00a0He is not actually cursing teachers out. \u00a0That's progress... and he will continue to progress as he matures. \u00a0He will have to remember his cool off strategies. \n \nAfter our conversation \u00a0he writes this Facebook quote... \n \n \"I had a really rough day but I'm going to youth tonight and having fun with my church friends :)\" \u00a0 \n \nThe following morning however we were back to.... \n \n \"I'm not going to any freaking detention today!\" \n \nAround 11 a.m. he starts a  text conversation  with me. \u00a0He is basically processing his feelings...which is great self-advocacy... \n \n \"Mom don't be surprised if you get a call from Mr. B. today. I don't care what Mr. T. says, I'm not going to D-hall.\"\u00a0 \n \"Don't make it worse for yourself son. \u00a0If you don't go to D-hall the consequences will only get bigger. Remember your goal. \u00a0You want a job. People are looking at your actions to determine if you are ready for that.\"\u00a0 \n \"I hate Mr. B and Mr. T. \u00a0I want to get out of this program. \u00a0I just want to be normal.\" \n \"I'm sorry that you're upset. \u00a0 Talk to God...don't make things worse for yourself.\" \n \"Why can't I be normal like S.?\" (his friend who is also on the spectrum) \n \"S - told you last night he gets angry too. Everyone gets angry at some point.\"\u00a0 \n \"Not like me.\" \n \"Son ...this is an opportunity to be mature and make the right choice.\"\u00a0 \n \nHe did. \u00a0He went to D-hall and shortly thereafter posted this on Facebook... \n \n \n \"The most sucessful people are the ones that have failed the most. We all make mistakes because we're all human. God didn't make us perfect. Only Jesus was perfect. Learn from your mistakes and try to do better in life. Don't give up!!\"! \n \n \nIn his own words....or maybe someone else's... probably Mr. B., whom he \"hates!\" But at least these words resonated with him enough to share with his friends on Facebook. \n \n In  My  own words. ... \n \nToday, I had a book review published by Little Pickle Press. \u00a0The book is about a day in the life of an elementary school aged boy on the spectrum. \u00a0Check it out here: \n \n\u00a0  \"Spaghetti is NOT a Finger Food and Other Life Lessons\" \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2sZqkj-CHMM/UMIlIqdmXWI/AAAAAAAAA6g/alkBn0GHTzg/s1600/EarlyKendal.jpg", "http://bit.ly/KWSpaghetii"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/12/in-his-own-words.html", "title": "\nIn His Own Words\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 21, 2012", "body": "\n \nOne would think there is nothing more simple or pleasurable than a walk in the park on a beautiful, mildly cool, fall day. \u00a0Then again, if you know my family, things that look simple on the outside can quickly become complex once you peel back the layers and get to the inside. \n \nAt the beginning of this week, Blue made a list of thing to do on this Thanksgiving break. \u00a0On the top of this list is to go hiking at a nearby trail. \u00a0He so needs exercise as the medication he's taking has helped him gain a few pounds. \u00a0Supposedly, exercise is also it will be great for his not-so-lovely teenage mood. \u00a0On this lovely afternoon, he has actually been in a pretty good mood because we have company over. He has a little sister for the day. \u00a0They have been laughing, playing and challenging each other all day.  \n \nMy girlfriend has to work and we love to borrow her daughter whenever we can. \u00a0Skye is 8 years-old, smart, gorgeous an with a quick wit...definitely my kinda girl. \u00a0Actually, almost any little girl is my kind of girl. \u00a0I am surrounded by testosterone most of the time. \u00a0Sweet little girls are refreshing. \u00a0I made her promise not to change when she becomes a tween. \u00a0She promised she would not change...but then again, so did Blue. \n \n \n \nAfter walking for miles through the streets and along the bay in San Francisco on my vacation, I think to myself,  this walk will be a breeze.  \u00a0Let's do it! \u00a0Walking is much more fun when there is something to see, instead of walking around a boring track or on a treadmill. Communing with nature is good for the soul. \u00a0So off we go. \n \nHarry our little Maltese is also along for the walk. \u00a0I didn't really think he could keep up, but the kids, especially Blue, insisted that he come.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI have my I-pod earphones in one ear, walking in rhythm to the sound of the \"Black-eyed Peas\". I am using the other ear to hear the kids if I need to. \u00a0Me and Skye, my daughter for the day, are a few steps ahead of Blue.  \nSuddenly, he starts yelling at us... \n\"Wait...slow down!\" \nWe are literally just a few steps ahead of him. \u00a0I wonder why he sounds so angry? He was just fine moments ago. We keep walking at a moderate pace. \u00a0I can tell his attitude has definitely turned to crap. We reach a big blue pole, which is an emergency phone station. \u00a0Blue wants to stop here. Skye wants to keep going...so do I.  \n \n\"You always want to stop here. Come on this is an adventure. \u00a0We need to keep going,\" she says. \nWe compromise and take a rest stop. \u00a0 \n \nWe are all sitting on a park bench. \u00a0The two of them are having shall we say, an exchange of ideas. \u00a0He is bitching and moaning because he wants to stop and turn around. \u00a0She is telling him he needs to push through it, in her sweet little girl voice. \u00a0Hiking  was  his idea after all. \nHe is completely argumentative and combative. \u00a0He accuses her of arguing with him to which she replies,  \"I'm not arguing. \u00a0I'm just trying to have a conversation!\" \n Ah hah!  This is the exact sentiment I have all the time when I am trying to talk with Blue and his father. \u00a0If you are not in complete agreement with them ..thinking the very same thoughts, in his mind you are arguing with him! \u00a0Finally, I have proof that I am not crazy! \u00a0I just need another sane person to live in the house with me to help me prove it! \n Did I tell you I love this girl?! \n \n \n Taking a Break\u00a0 \n \nThe next thing I know Blue takes off...and not in the direction of the car. \u00a0Suddenly, he is determined to make it to the end of the trail. \u00a0He gets nearly a quarter of a mile ahead of us, in the twist and turns of the trail, to the point where I can't see him anymore. \u00a0It's starting to get dark. \u00a0I realize that if we don't start heading back soon, we will find ourselves walking back in the moonlight. \u00a0I finally get to a point where I can see him. \u00a0I call out to him yelling his name, waving for him to come back. \n\"We have to head back now! It's going to get dark!\" \nHe hesitates, but decides to head back in our direction.  \n \nOnce we are walking together again, the two of them are slightly ahead of me. \u00a0I here Stell say... \n\"I'm sorry Blue. I didn't mean to make you angry.\" \nMy heart melts a bit. \u00a0I think... this is what it would be like for him to have a little sister.  \u00a0They would not get along all the time, but she would help bring out the best in him, that caregiver side that teachers see at school, that we see when he's with his younger cousins. \u00a0He apologizes to her as well, and then to me.  \n \n \n Skye and Harry in the dark \n \n \nWe pull out our phones to use the flashlight app. \u00a0We are now walking in the dark. \u00a0Part of his anger I discover, is that fact that Stella and I were laughing and talking...enjoying our walk together, while he was walking with his IPOD in his ears and not a part of the conversation. \u00a0He could very well have joined the conversation, but chose to get angry instead. \n \nThis girl is so smart...so funny and such a grown up little soul. \u00a0She is growing up with her single-mom. I think spending so much one on one time with an adult has made her grow up faster than your average girl.  \n \n \n \n\"I know you would rather have a little girl mom.\" He is only partially correct. \u00a0I would love to have a little girl not  instead  of him, but in addition to him and his brothers. \u00a0I tell him this. \u00a0I don't think he believes me. \u00a0One thing about it...we will never find out for sure.

That's all I can do is have faith ...have faith and get involved at their schools to make sure that the culture of bullying and isolating children who are different really changes and not just accept lip service. \u00a0 \n \nI can advocate for a child who Red has taken under his wing, although he is only a step away from being shunned himself. \u00a0 I know this friend of his is a target at their high-school. \u00a0His parents don't really seem to get it, because their way of disciplining him is to further isolate him from the few friends that he does have whenever he makes a mistake. \u00a0I can not change their parenting decisions, but I can work around them, advocate for him and help this child as much as I possibly can. \u00a0 \n \n \nThere has been some link to the fact that the person who committed these monstrous acts ...was somewhere on the autism spectrum. \u00a0It has been said that he possibly had Aspergers. \u00a0The thing is ...we have no idea what co-morbid diagnosis this person had. \u00a0I hate to comment on what is an ongoing investigation. \u00a0We don't have an entire picture painted at this point. \u00a0We have pieces of information. \u00a0I believe that speculation based on only pieces can be extremely dangerous to those in the mental health and autism community. \n \nI do know this ...autism or more specifically Aspergers within itself, does not equal violence. \u00a0To quote my friend Jill Smo of\u00a0 Yeah Good Times \u00a0 \" There is no connection between planned, violent behavior and an autism spectrum diagnosis of any kind.\" \n \nI strongly urge you to read her short and sweet post on the subject. \u00a0You can find it\u00a0 HERE . \n \nI will write about this more later. \u00a0I have so much information to digest and to share. \u00a0I need time to process this tragedy before I jump into dissecting it. \u00a0We can't ignore what happened, but what we can do is turn off the 24-hour news cycle that is sensationalizing and bringing attention to the person who committed these acts. \u00a0Instead spend time\u00a0loving and nurturing our children.  \n \n \n We must pay attention and seek help for them \u00a0when we see a behavior pattern that is extreme or unusual, no matter how difficult that may be.\u00a0 \n Talk to them and encourage an open dialogue about what they are feeling and going through.\u00a0 \n \u00a0If we see another child who is in pain or hurting ...help them. \u00a0 \n Do whatever we can to embrace those with differences and teach our children to do the same. \n Don't turn your back or wait until we see another tragedy unfold.\u00a0 \n \n \nThese answers may seem simplistic and I know there are larger issues at hand like \n \n \n The state of mental health in America and equal access to it. \n Gun control or lack thereof.\u00a0 \n Violence in American culture ...video games, and movies, etc. \n \n \nAs I say on my header\u00a0-I am not the expert mom with all of the answers. \u00a0I am just the mom who won't stop looking for them \n \n #Love, #EmbraceDifference #Mentor, #Advocate \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://yeahgoodtimes.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-connecticut-tragedy-and-autism.html", "http://yeahgoodtimes.blogspot.com/2012/12/the-connecticut-tragedy-and-autism.html"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/12/what-i-know-what-i-dont.html", "title": "\nWhat I Know & What I Don't \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, December 13, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThe layers of drama that come along with this time of the year are almost too much to bare. \u00a0I feel like I'm in a deranged game of ping pong, being banged with two paddles back and forth between two extremes of madness.  \n \nSeriously, it's one and then the other when you have two teenage boys on the spectrum and they are both going through their own individual issues. \u00a0I am there in the middle soaking it all in, being deluged by their emotions, anger, arguing, fighting, yelling, screaming and yes...sometimes cursing. \u00a0It's too much for them to handle. \u00a0It's too much for  ME  to handle, but what choice do I have really? \u00a0I am their person. \n \nIn high school their is always drama, but when you don't have the social nuances down, when you say things that you think are funny, but they are extremely inappropriate ...the typical high school drama is taken to a whole other level. \n \nSo Red has been on a bit of a high lately. \u00a0I mean so happy that he's found his tribe...his peeps ...his relationship with the Lord, that he feels like he can do no wrong. \u00a0He has been happy, confident, self-assured even. \u00a0He thrives on being a blessing to other people...helping those who are less fortunate than himself. \u00a0In fact, he is mentoring a young man who stands in the shoes that he walked in just a short time ago.  \n \nWe had the awesome privilege of meeting with this young man and his mother on Saturday. \u00a0The young man has Aspergers and is in a really negative space right now. \u00a0 The two of them were connected by a Special Education Administrator in the school who works with both of them. \u00a0We met at a hamburger/ice cream joint for lunch ...and it could not have gone better. \u00a0They both opened up to each other and had great dialog. \u00a0Red encouraged this young man and told him that it does indeed get better. \u00a0Oh My God ...I was such a proud mommy to see him in this role! \u00a0You could not wipe the smile off my face or take away the elation in my heart. \u00a0They will continue to work together in the future, which is a huge blessing and honor. \n \nAnd then it all goes to crap ...he goes to school this week and says something socially inappropriate to one girl, about another girl and it all comes back to bite him in the ass. \u00a0He ends up meeting with a Vice Principal and has to sign an agreement to stay away from this girl. \u00a0I also have the Principal have the girl sign an agreement to do the same.  \n \nYou see...this has happened before. \u00a0They become friends everything is hunky dory, until it's not. \u00a0She goes and \"tells on him\" for saying or doing something that makes her feel uncomfortable. \u00a0He stops talking to her. \u00a0A few months go by, and the girl befriends Red again. \u00a0They add each other on Facebook. \u00a0Time goes by...Red says or does something else to make her feel uncomfortable. \u00a0The next thing you know, she's back in the Vice Principals office complaining...again. \u00a0She's yanking his chain and confusing the hell out of this already social confused, inept boy.  \n \nOf course this whole thing upsets him. \u00a0He fixates, perseverates and ruminates over it until the point that he gets angry. \u00a0The next thing you know, he's yelling and cursing in a classroom with a friend over said issue. \u00a0This of course, causes another problem for himself. Today, he sits in PAD which is kind of like in-school-suspension, but it's for kids in a behavior program.  \n \nThis means he will come home even more angry than he was in the first place. \u00a0And who will be the lucky winner in that situation? Yep...that's right. \u00a0Me, and probably his brother who he will pick a fight with.  \n \nHis brother, Blue ...who is already dealing with his own set of issues, depression anxiety and anger because ...well,  Tis the Season. \u00a0 Blue has been upset and sharing the love with me mostly about school in recent weeks. \u00a0He wants his grades to be nothing less than perfect. \u00a0He spends so much energy on this and is wound up so tight you could bounce right off of him. \u00a0He has all of this homework and sometimes, he's just too freaking exhausted to get it all done. \u00a0Heaven forbid there be something extra thrown into the game plan, like a therapy appointment, him going to youth night at church, or me reminding him to take a shower! \u00a0Then we have WW3.  \n \nThere is also the issue of Christmas and that list that he keeps doing and re-doing, researching, changing, adding, subtracting until the point of absolute madness. \u00a0Fixating on really expensive gifts that we can not afford to and will not be getting him this year.  \n \nOh yeah ...lets add another layer to this madness. \u00a0My mother...who lives with us gets so highly offended when they loose it with me. \u00a0When they are here in their home, their safe place and they absolutely loose it. \u00a0There is of course, yelling, screaming, fighting and sometimes cursing. \u00a0She wants to call them out on it, usually in the middle of it, because she can't stay out of anything. \u00a0Or better yet, she wants to put them on the naughty list and let them know that they won't be getting any gifts from her, or their gifts will be modified because she doesn't appreciate the way they treat her daughter. \u00a0I mean it's great that you love me mom and want to protect me...but I find myself trying harder to manage them so that they won't upset you, which makes my life what? HARDER! \u00a0This is our home...this is our life. \u00a0This is our bullshit drama! \u00a0I don't need anything to add to it!  \n \nThese are mental, neurological issues. \u00a0Telling them what they are not getting for Christmas does not make their issues go away! \u00a0It does what? It increases their anxiety!!! And MINE! \n \nGuess what if I'm honest...I don't really care that they curse here. \u00a0I mean yeah...it sounds bad. \u00a0But I would rather them do it hear than at school! \u00a0And I know how to deal with it. \u00a0I know how to calm them down. \u00a0I also know how to walk away when I can't handle it anymore.  \n \nThey have issues with anger...I would like to teach them skills to better handle their anger, and Lord knows I am doing everything I possibly can to help them with it, from medication to therapy, teaching them anger management skills \u00a0...but I can not teach them anything in the middle of their anger!!! The teaching part comes in when they are calm.  \n \nMe getting angry (and I'm not saying I don't) or Grandma and Dad getting angry when the boys are already angry just makes for bigger anger. \u00a0When will anyone in this house ever freakin' get that??? \n \nI swear...we just need a therapist to move in with us. \u00a0Anybody know one? \u00a0Not that we could afford it. That's another thing ...the therapy bills are killing me.  \n \nAnd that is my rant for today ...thanks for listening. \n \nFeel free to comment below... and if you are a therapist willing to move in with us or adopt my children... please leave your contact information.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AKG5P3P_fZ0/UMoD2_skOSI/AAAAAAAAA64/Ux9o2SJcG4M/s1600/images-1.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/12/tis-season-it-aint-jolly.html", "title": "\nTis the Season & it Ain't Jolly\n"},

They are more likely to be the victims of violence rather than the perpetrators. \n \nI have two of those boys.  \n \nThis is what Aspergers is: \n \n \n \n Red is a self-taught Videographer And Editor with his own business He loves to help others with more severe disabilties at his High School He gets up every Sunday and goes to church on his own In his words: \"My goal in live is to follow the example of Christ Help others as much as I can and not be a douchebag.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n Blue is an Honor Student He spent his summer volunteering at a camp for kids with disabilities.

{"date": "Thursday, September 13, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nAs a part of my job duties as Personal Assistant to the four people I live with, I regularly pick\u00a0up prescriptions from the drug store. \u00a0On this lovely afternoon, the young, blond, female clerk says to me, \n\"That will be $59.00 Mam.\" \nI looked her kind of like she was crazy. \u00a0I knew right away it was an odd amount. \nI ask, \"Are these name brand or generic?\" \n\"They're generic.\" \n\"Well that can't be the right price.\" \n\"Oh...do you have insurance?\" \n Hell yeah...I have insurance. Lucky for me!\u00a0 \nThis was the first time I have used this particular pharmacy for my husband. \u00a0Not because I like this pharmacy. \u00a0I am actually forced to use them by our lovely insurance carrier. \u00a0They don't have the insurance on file for hubby, who hardly ever gets sick and even less...actually take medicine. \nI hand her my insurance card and the price comes out to $10.00 \n Now that's a lot more like it! \n \nInstantly, I think of my boys. \u00a0If that had been one of them...and the clerk had made the same error...they would have fumbled around and paid her the $59.00...no questions asked, or they may have walked away without the medicine.  \nThe boys take what people say at face value and don't question it if they seem honest. Why would an honest looking person lie...or make a mistake? \u00a0They're an authority figure. \u00a0They are the professional. \u00a0They must know what they're talking about right? \n \nAnother example: \nBlue really does try to be independent. \u00a0The other day he wants to go inside and order his own pizza at Little Ceasar's....or as I call it, Little Yucky's.  \n\"It's only $5.00 Mom!\" \n\u00a0He had it at a birthday party a while ago and now he swears by it. \u00a0I give him a $10.00 bill. \u00a0I say explicitly, \"Pizza and soda...that's it! \u00a0No extras.\" \nHe comes back with pizza, soda and breadsticks and only $1.00 in change.  \n\"What happened?\" I ask. \n\"They said I have to get the special. \u00a0It would save me money.\" \n \nThese little common sense financial decisions are the things that freak me out about their future. \u00a0You can't believe every advertisement. \u00a0You can't trust every body and take what they say at face value. \u00a0You have to always be thinking and be quick on your feet, otherwise you can be duped out of your money or spend needlessly. \n \nThey don't teach everyday finance in school. \u00a0They don't teach common sense. \u00a0This leaves it up to us. \u00a0The parents. \u00a0I don't know about you...but my kids hate learning anything from me. Of course, that doesn't keep me from trying and dissecting these financial common sense matters, in order to keep them thinking and hopefully learning a thing or two. \n \nRecently, I \u00a0felt a little more reassured about Red's future when his Video Tech mentor said this about his most recent project, \"I have worked with college interns that are not this talented! \u00a0He could get an assistant editing job right now paying $20. to $30. an hour. \u00a0And the best thing is that he is self-taught. \u00a0Which means he can teach himself on the job. \u00a0Employers love that!\" \n(By the way...this lovely woman has a son with Aspergers, so she gets Red and better yet, she won't let me pay her for her time!  How blessed are we?!!! ) \n \nSo alas...there is light at the end of the tunnel. \u00a0Maybe...just maybe, I will get this boy out of my house someday! Now we just need to finish high school with out going totally beserk about not having a girlfriend! \u00a0And...figure out a way to teach him some common sense. \n \nBlue...I don't worry about as much. \u00a0I can totally see him going to college. \u00a0I can see him driving and eventually being very mature and responsible. \u00a0The literalness and believing everything that people say...I hope will get better with time and maturity and experience. \n \nYesterday, I read the funniest blog by Aaron Liken. \u00a0The post is titled\u00a0 \"Anyone Can Be Fired\" . It's about the literal mind of an Aspie. \u00a0I felt so guilty for laughing so hard that tears were falling, about what he thought as a child about people getting fired. \u00a0He accurately describes the literal thinking that many people on the spectrum experience. \u00a0It's a must read. \n \nThere really should be a high school class on Literal Finance 101, where they teach you how to spend money wisely and not waste your precious dollars. \u00a0Money really does not grow on trees or get magically dispensed from the ATM. \u00a0Heck ...my 24 year-old is not on the spectrum. \u00a0He could  still  use a class like that...and he's in his last year of college! \n \n You can support my blog and buy Aaron's Liken's Book,  \"Finding Kansas\" \u00a0 by clicking here.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yz3whQiwcmM/UFH_WAf6SUI/AAAAAAAAAxg/M18nHkH_5lI/s1600/images-5.jpeg", "http://lifeontheothersideofthewall.blogspot.com/2012/09/anyone-can-be-fired.html", "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399537333?ie=UTF8&tag=findingkansas-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0399537333"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/09/literal-finance-101.html", "title": "\nLiteral Finance 101\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 5, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nWe were on a positive vibe a few weeks ago leading up to the start of school. \u00a0Once it started, the reality of it all started to show it's ugly face for my high schooler. \u00a0He is light years ahead of where he was just two years ago. \u00a0He has a few \"real friends\" now and a few close associates. \u00a0He has a huge support system, both in and outside of school.  \n \nHe belongs to a very small church that he found through one of his friends. \u00a0He has become close to the Pastor and even calls him up when he's going through a really rough day. \u00a0Talking to his Pastor seems to soothe him. \u00a0He listens and calms down ...at least for the short run. \u00a0He also attends a youth group at his friend's church on Wednesday nights. \u00a0It's a little more lively with more teens than his own church. He really seems to enjoy it. \u00a0But no sooner than he crosses our threshold, does everything he learned at church seem to fly out the window. \n \nHe is no longer isolated in a behavior program. \u00a0This school year, we are giving him even more flexibility to have lunch in the cafeteria and roam the hallways, being shadowed by staff and administration. \u00a0They all know him by name and their eyes are always open. \u00a0He is a big tall, good looking black dude in a sea of mostly white and brown. \u00a0He does stand out in a crowd. \u00a0That has always been the case in whatever school he's been in. \u00a0He is popular alright...but not in the way he would like to be.  \n \nRed has this pattern of thinking, perseveration and fixation right now on a particular group that he would like to become a part of. \u00a0Even more in particular, there are a couple of young ladies in this group that he thinks are the only \"hot girls\" on the planet, even though I have pointed out several others who he agreed were attractive. \u00a0\"I want to be popular!\" he yells at me, as if I can make that magically happen in an instant. \u00a0Even though I have talked to him till I'm blue in the face (and that's a feat because I'm black) about how interpersonal relationships work. \u00a0Even though, his Pastor has talked to him, his brother, my nephew, his father, his uncles, his cousins...he remains stuck in his out of touch with reality thinking. \u00a0He even said to me, \"Everyone keeps telling me the same thing. \u00a0I'm beginning to think I'm the only one who thinks this way.\"  YA THINK! \u00a0He is so not ready for a male/female interpersonal relationship, even though that's all he can think about. \u00a0He doesn't have a clue about how they really work. \n \nOne of his good friends who is also on the spectrum, \u00a0is affiliated with this group, but it's more of a \"on the surface\" affiliation. \u00a0This friend of his is just a friendly person. \u00a0He says, \"What's up?\" to damn near everyone and a lot of people know who he is, partly because of his friendliness, but also because his family is well known in the community. \u00a0It doesn't mean he has deep, meaningful relationships with all of these people.  \n \nWhatever the case may be...Red has his focus on this group to the point of blindness. \u00a0I tried to illustrate this to him by putting a solid book in front of his eyes and asking, \"Can you see everything that's going on in the room?\" \n\"No.\" \n\"Well...this is what you're doing by focusing on this group. \u00a0You can't see all of the other people around you who you could be connecting with. \u00a0People who you actually have more in common with. \u00a0People who will like you for exactly who you are.\" \nI may as well have been talking to that book. \u00a0He didn't hear me any more than the book did...at least not enough to change his rigid thinking. \n \nHe can not see all of the opportunities to meet and become friends with people whom he could have more meaningful relationships. \u00a0He wants what looks good to him on the surface. The blindness extends to not even seeing what he already has, in the couple of close friends. \u00a0He doesn't seem to soak it in and feel the blessing of it, because he is too busy yearning for what he doesn't have. \u00a0It has to be an extremely frustrating head-space to be in --to never, ever (well hardly ever) be satisfied or happy with what you have. \n \nWe at home get to deal with the brunt of that frustration. \u00a0He is angry, agitated, argumentative, annoying, irritable...combustable. \u00a0 It's like he wants to share the love of his misery with all of us. \u00a0NO ONE in the house has the patience for him or what he is going through right now. \u00a0I feel like the chief-referree of all fighting...constantly running interference, trying to keep everyone from blowing their top. \u00a0Meanwhile...I'm loosing it! \u00a0I can't keep the wine flowing fast enough! \n \nI try my best to keep it calm with him. \u00a0I try to use the extremely low, calm voice to get his attention and often take him out of a hot bed situation. \u00a0But I can only stay calm for so long. \u00a0I feel like a rat trapped in a maze...of craziness and I can't find my way out. \u00a0It's not a fun way to live...AT ALL. \n \nI am working on getting him into the right therapist. \u00a0We had an emergency session with his Psychiatrist today. \u00a0She believes everything we are seeing now is behavioral ...not chemical. \u00a0So, I'm off to get him into the right therapist, which of course is not on our insurance plan, so I have to go through a few hoops to make it happen.  \n \nI used to look forward to aging. \u00a0I wasn't afraid of heading towards my late 40's and 50's. \u00a0Age does have some benefits. \u00a0I definitely am more comfortable with who I am and I will be damned if I let the opinion of others change me. \u00a0I know what makes me happy and I will not give up on the few things that I have that give me happiness. \u00a0However, I thought age would mean that I would be closer to the finish line of raising these kids. \u00a0I thought...as they get older, \u00a0become teenagers heading into adulthood, I will have to do less and less for them. \u00a0This will mean I'll have more time for myself. \u00a0I couldn't have been more wrong. \n \nDo you feel me?\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-e1x0lhgucWc/UEdcC2U2k4I/AAAAAAAAAxE/AqMtXcI2OJE/s1600/images-4.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/09/happy-go-sucky.html", "title": "\nHappy Go Sucky\n"},

Yada yada yada.\u00a0 \n \n \nDuring the carpool this morning...Blue is trying to convince his best friend to join him on the walk for Autism Speaks.\u00a0If you follow this blog you may know that I drive a carpool with 3 middle school boys on the autism spectrum. \u00a0Now as much as I no longer like getting up early --I do enjoy the ride to school with Blue\u00a0and his friends. \u00a0Their purity, innocence, honesty, bluntness and sense of humor are refreshing. \u00a0Usually at this age --everything is a secret. \u00a0You don't want your mom all up in your business. \u00a0But these boys talk as if I'm not even there, about girls, friends, video games ...whatever --with no edit button. \n \nBlue and his friends are the very definition of spectrum ...they are very different. \u00a0Blue wants to know all there is to know about autism. \u00a0He wants to create awareness so that others understand it. \u00a0He will talk about being on the spectrum almost immediately after meeting someone. \u00a0You may remember he actually read an essay about it over the P.A. system at school last year called,  \"Freaks Geeks and Aspergers\" \nHis best friend is somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. \u00a0At this point, he doesn't want much to do with autism. \u00a0He doesn't want to talk about it. \u00a0He doesn't necessarily want people to know he has it. \u00a0He definitely does not want it to define who he is. \u00a0He wants to slide under the radar, fit in as best he can and not be identified as the \"kid with autism.\" \u00a0It is more than o.k. for him to feel this way. \u00a0This is his journey --his life and he is entitled to define it as he sees fit. \nHis twin brother is in another place on the spectrum. \u00a0He spends a lot of his time in his own universe and he's pretty damned happy right where he is. He is not all that aware of what other people think and I don't think he really cares. \u00a0When you think about it...what a great place to be -knowing and being happy with exactly who you are. \nI love these boys as if they are my own. \u00a0They are lights in my life. \n \nSo here's the conversation.... \n \n\"Do you want to walk with me tomorrow for Autism Speaks.\" \n\"No thanks. \u00a0I don't really like walking.\" \n\"Dude, come on! It's a walk to help kids with autism.\" \n\"Help them do what?\" \n\"Help them get money to help with their autism. \u00a0That's what Autism Speaks does.\" \nI stay out of the conversation just to see where it will go.  \n\"I don't understand. \u00a0I'm confused. \u00a0What do they do?\" asks his friend. \n \nI think to myself...you're not he only one who doesn't really know what exactly what Autism Speaks does other than raise awareness, and fund research, which is important. \u00a0However, I would like to see some of that money raised get directly into the hands of families who are actually struggling with the high COSTS of autism for therapies, summer camps, etc. \u00a0Of course, \u00a0I'm not going to go down this road with the boys. \u00a0For once, I'm going to keep my 2 cents to myself. \n \nWe have been doing the walk for several years. Even Aspergers Dad is involved and is raising funds with his family and co-workers. \n \n\"Basically..they help kids like us,\"Blue says.  \n\"So you walk and you give them money and other people give them money...to walk?\" His friend asks with genuine skepticism...trying to gather and process this in his mind. \n\"Yeah...something like that,\" says Blue. \n\"Um....If I'm going to raise the money for kids with autism...I think I'd rather keep it myself.\" \nI laugh cynically to myself thinking ...the kid does have a point.  \n \nHere is the link if you would like to help us meet our goal:\u00a0 Walk For Autisms Speaks -Our Family Goal Page \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lI3paQTogew/UFy46wQ5YiI/AAAAAAAAA0s/EpXriID8tCo/s1600/Unknown.jpeg", "http://www.walknowforautismspeaks.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=1014858&supid=367406407"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/09/autism-kids-on-autism-speaks.html", "title": "\nAutism Kids on Autism Speaks\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 17, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nWe have the same conversation nearly everyday after school and you guessed it ...it's about girls and the mighty quest to get a girlfriend. \u00a0This is the current fixation...perseveration that we are living with. \u00a0It makes me want to jump in my car and keep driving until I make it to the Pacific Ocean ...or at the very least --to my favorite margarita joint. \u00a0Some days I avoid being at home when he gets there after school, because after a day of being at school and \"having to watch all of those couples in the hallways\" he wants to come home and release his frustration...and yes, I am the lucky winner who gets to engage in the same conversation every-single-day. \n \nI find errands to run in hopes that he will come home, start watching Sponge Bob and forget to have the conversation. \u00a0Maybe he will get on the phone and have the conversation with his friend instead of me.  \n \nHe even gets on facebook to have this conversation.... \n\"It really sucks that all the hot girls only like the buff guys!\" \n\"It makes me so angry when I see girls with ripped guys! They're douche bags!\" \n\"Why are girls in high-school so shallow?\"  Yeah...this one is a real winner. \n\"I hardly have any girls who are even friends.\" \n\"Why do you have to be ripped to get a girl?\" \nAnd the fait accompli... \n\"Someone told me I have to go for ugly girls first before I can get a pretty girl. Really?\" \n Yep...that one is going to score tons of points with any female who is reading it. \n \nSo one of the moms on my  Facebook Community ,\u00a0(thank you Jessica) suggested that I just become an \"active listener\" instead of trying to advise him on a problem that we can not readily\u00a0 fix . \u00a0There is no answer (at least not one that he is willing to really hear). \u00a0 The suggestions from me and anyone else he knows just go around in circles --in one ear...out the other...down the street, around the corner and back again. \u00a0It never sinks in...he never agrees. \u00a0He just wants to talk about it. \u00a0He just wants to be heard. \u00a0He just wants EVERYONE to know how frustrated he is. \n \nI decide to try just listening, saying things like, \"I understand how you feel. Yes, I'm sure that must be frustrating.\" When he asks a question, I say something like, \"I don't know...what to you think?\" \u00a0It works for a while. \u00a0I am less emotional. \u00a0I am not so invested because he isn't taking my advice. \u00a0I am divorced from it...or at least legally separated. \u00a0The conversation goes on for a good 45 minutes or so. \u00a0I'm really tired of it at which point\u00a0comes this question... \n\"Do you think I would have a better chance to get a cheerleader if I were a football player?\" \n\"Well lets see...you're in 11th grade. \u00a0Football season is already half-over.  \nDo you like to work out? \u00a0Do you like to run? So do you think you can suddenly become a football player in your Senior year?\" \n\"I dunno.\" \n\"Well then I don't really think there is any point to this question...is there?\" \n\"Just answer it!\" \n\"Well...what do you think?\" I ask. \n\"I just want you to answer it?\" \n\"I want you to answer it for yourself.\" \n \nThis goes on for about 20 minutes. \u00a0He gets louder and louder because I just can't do it. \u00a0I can't...won't...whatever. \n \nNow maybe I'm being a bitch here. \u00a0But I have answered this question already 9 zillion times. \u00a0He knows damn well he is not about to become a football player. \u00a0He knows that if he did ...yes it may ever-so-slightly increase his chances at getting a cheerleader. \u00a0But getting a cheerleader is so far off the mark from where he should even be looking. \u00a0I mean why doesn't he just ask Jennifer Lopez to be his girlfriend? \n \nHe knows...he should be looking for friends...female and male. \u00a0He knows that he is the one being \"shallow.\" He knows that his focus should be on getting his education and building his future. \u00a0He knows that establishing good friendships is the key to finding someone who really understands him and loves him for exactly who he is. \u00a0He knows all of this because I have told him this ...over and over again. \u00a0Everyone he knows has told him this. \u00a0Relatives, friends, his brother, his father, his Pastor, friends at church, his Facebook friends...everyone!  \n \nNow he may not know exactly how to go about this...friend making of the opposite sex. \u00a0He does have some deficits in social skills and conversation starting. \u00a0But the biggest part of his problem is the tunnel vision. \u00a0He seems unable to take a 360 degree view of the world. \u00a0He only looks through a narrow tunnel at 1 or 2 people who are difficult if not impossible to get. \u00a0With his black and white thought process...he is stuck on girls are either  ugly  or  hot ...two words that I have come to absolutely loathe when it comes to describing young ladies. \n \n\"So if I can't get a hot girl...you're saying I have to get an ugly girl.\"  \nTo which I vehemently reply, \"There are no ugly human beings!\"  \nI hate that word ugly!  Did I say that already? \n \nThe good news is...I didn't get emotional this time. \u00a0I didn't answer the question. \u00a0I made him answer it for himself. \u00a0And today when he comes home from school. \u00a0We will go through the same routine...again. \n \nThe other good news is that I also found him a new \"expensive\" therapist that specializes in Aspergers, adolescence and dating. \u00a0He can talk to him too. Too bad it's only once a week and not everyday after school. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Lhyfs-EBo9g/UFdC37foUpI/AAAAAAAAAx8/fbqgzWBufiI/s1600/images-6.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/09/active-listening.html", "title": "\nActive Listening\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 20, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Editorial Note: This was originally published in January of 2012. \u00a0Since then, Red's meds have been adjusted, he has grown and matured. \u00a0He has been on time every day of the current school year. \u00a0Still, the first line out of his mouth every morning is, \"I'm EXTREMELY tired!\" to which I reply, \"So am I.\"\u00a0 \n \n7:00 a.m.: \nMom hazily rises with the help of the alarm on her cell phone. \u00a0It's still dark outside. \u00a0She grumbles something or other to herself, but still she rises, goes to pee, grabs her cell and her best friend (the laptop) and sits it all on the coffee table in the family room.  \n \n7:10 a.m: \n \nThe phone buzzes again. She takes it into her son's room and lays it next to his head. \u00a0Groggily, he opens his eyes and shuts it off. \u00a0 \n \n\"Come on son...it's time to get up.\" \n \n\"I'm too tired. \u00a0I don't want to go to school,\" he grumbles.\u00a0 \n \nMom runs her fingertips lightly around his face, eyes, ears, nose, hairline. \u00a0She imagines it tickles a bit. \u00a0 \n \n\"Stop!\" he says. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nMom doesn't care. \u00a0She wants him to wake up. \u00a0She walks away giving him the chance to process and wake up. \u00a0Meanwhile, Facebook and Twitter are calling. \u00a0She has to see what the crew is up to. \u00a0It appears that a number of autism parents were up at 3:30 a.m....their kids waking them for some reason or another. \u00a0She counts her blessing...at least no one woke her up in the middle of the night.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nTen minutes pass...her 16-year old son is still not up. \u00a0It looks like it's going to be one of those mornings. \u00a0This started the night before with the announcement, \"I'm too tired to go to school tomorrow!\" \u00a0His actions this morning are a manifestation of this. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nShe goes in again...gently prodding, trying to wake him. \u00a0His eyes open, he turns over, \"I need more rest!\" he screams. \n \n\"So do I,\" she says...\"but I'm up.\" \n \n \n \n7:20 a.m: \n \nShe leaves his room. \u00a0Enters her younger son's room, turns on his light and gently prods him. \u00a0\"Time to get up.\" \u00a0He opens his eyes and turns over, the gentle sound of jazz music is playing from his IPOD speaker. \n \n \n \nThen another stop in older brother's room. \u00a0This time Mom resorts to turning on the water in the bathroom, wetting her hands. She sits on his bed and gently touches his face. \"Mom!!! Stop!!!\"\u00a0 \n \n\"You know...we need to wash these sheets today.\" \u00a0She takes the cover and top sheet off of the bed. \u00a0 \n \n\"Mom!! I'm cold!\" \u00a0 \n \n\"Well...get up and put some clothes on.\" \n \n \n \n7:30 a.m: \n \nAt this point, mom realizes there is no way he's going to make the school bus today. \u00a0She calls the transportation department to alert the driver not to stop by. \u00a0 \n \n13 year-old son is up and dressed...also tired, he lays on the couch. \u00a0 \n \n\"Mom...can you make me some waffles?\" \u00a0 \n \n\"Sure son.\" \n \n \n \nThe 16 year-old is now sitting on the side of the bed not moving...still complaining. \"Why can't you just let me sleep? \u00a0Call them and tell them I'm sick. \u00a0 How do you expect me to function today? \u00a0I'm extremely tired!\" \n \n \n \n\"Come and get some breakfast, take your medicine and you'll get some energy. \u00a0Come on let's go,\" says mom.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe 16 year-old finally makes it down the stairs. \u00a0\"What?!!! You didn't make me Cream of Wheat?!!!\" \u00a0 \n \n\"Nope...I do that on mornings when you get up on time. \u00a0Not today...sorry. \u00a0Pour yourself some cereal,\" Mom says calmly, trying to ignore his disrespectful yelling.\u00a0 \n \n\"What??!! That's not fair!\"\u00a0 \n \n Really? And it's fair that I have to listen to your bullshit? I could make you a long list of what's not fair in my life! \n \n \n \n8:00 a.m: \n \n13 year-old moves on to the teeth-brushing, face-washing, hair-brushing routine. \u00a0 \n \nMom puts in a \u00a0text to her carpool partner. \u00a0 \n \n\"Can you please take the boys this a.m.? I'm dealing with Red?\" \n \nHer partner agrees to take the middle schoolers. \u00a0 \n \nThe high-schooler is going to obviously be late. \n \n \n \n8:30 a.m: \n \n13 year old is waiting by the door for his carpool driver. \nMeanwhile, 16 year-old eats cereal. \u00a0Mom begrudgingly prepares toast and eggs. \u00a0He takes meds and puts on shoes, but...sits down again claiming that he is  super tired !\u00a0 \n \nAt this point, mom is upstairs, not wanting to give him an audience to talk to and move slower for. \u00a0 \n \nShe shouts downstairs, \"Did you brush your teeth?\"\u00a0 \n \n\"No! \u00a0I really can't do this. \u00a0Why can't you respect the fact that I'm tired?\" \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n\"I respect it. \u00a0I understand it...but you still have to go to school.\" says the mom. \n \nHe goes on refusing. \u00a0Finally, Dad steps in. \u00a0 \n \n\"That memory for the computer I spent $130 dollars on this weekend...I'll be taking it out of the machine today,\" he says in his very deep, manly voice. \n \n\"Noooo!!! \u00a0Mom! Stop him!\" \n \n\"Um maybe he'll stop if we hear that water running,\" Mom says. \n \n\"O.Kaaay...fine!\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n9:00 a.m: \n \nTeeth get brushed. \u00a0We head out the door. \u00a0On the way to school he starts in. \u00a0 \n \n\"I still don't get why you can't respect the fact that I'm tired.\" \n \n\"It's kind of hard to respect and believe it when you announced that you were too tired to go to school before you even went to bed last night.\" \n \n\"I'm still really tired.\" \n \n\"Every student in that school this morning is tired and didn't feel like getting up this morning. \u00a0When you have a job...your boss isn't going to say, \u00a0'I respect that you are tired this morning. \u00a0You go ahead and sleep.' \u00a0He's going to say, 'You're fired!' Everyone has to get up and get moving in the morning. \u00a0You are no different,\" says mom. \n \n\"I guess the answer is we're going to have to send you to summer school this year, because you obviously have too much trouble transitioning after breaks from school.\" A passive-agressive threat.\u00a0 \n \n\"That's not going to help,\" he says.\u00a0 \n \n\"Maybe we'll have to find a nice residential summer camp where you can learn some coping skills.\" \u00a0She says giving him \u00a0more food for thought. \n \n \n \n9:10 a.m:\u00a0 \n \nThey arrive at school. \u00a0He is now 25 minutes late. He refuses to get out of the car. \u00a0His class is in the portables, so luckily Mom can pull up right outside the door. \u00a0She gets out of the car, to which the boy strongly protests. \u00a0\"Don't get out of this car! \u00a0You're going to embarrass me!\" \u00a0 \n \n\"Well, you can get out of the car yourself and save yourself the embarrassment.\" \u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe doesn't move...she does. \u00a0She\u00a0gently knocks on his classroom door and opens it. \u00a0A young, beautiful milk chocolate-brown-skinned teacher with an adoring smile and dazzling eyes comes towards the door. \u00a0\"Hi there...you have a student who is refusing to come into your classroom. \u00a0He's sitting outside in the car,\" says the mom, feeling frumpy in her sweat pants and no makeup. \u00a0The teacher looks slightly confused, but she comes to the door and\u00a0outside. \u00a0She sees that it is Red. \u00a0She turns back to the mom and says with a soft voice, \"Oh...it's so nice to meet you. \u00a0I love your son. \u00a0He never gives me a moment of trouble. \u00a0He's very compliant.\"  \u00a0 Well gee! How nice for you! No wonder...you're young and beautiful! \u00a0He'd never give you a hard time. Wish I could say the same. \n \n \n \n\"I'm sorry you're having a tough time this morning Red. \u00a0It was hard for me to get here this morning too,\" says the teacher to the boy. \n \n\"Yeah, I'm just really tired,\" he says with flat affect.\u00a0 \n \n\"Well come on in. \u00a0We can get some tea or hot chocolate to help get you going!\" \n \n Hot chocolate...tea? \u00a0Really??? \u00a0Damn! I want to go to her class!\u00a0 \n \n\"Wow Red! \u00a0You are so lucky to have such a great teacher in your corner,\" says Mom.\u00a0 \n \nHe pops his ass right out of the car and goes with the lovely teacher.\u00a0 \n \n\"Have a nice day. \u00a0Make good choices!\" says Mom. \nAnd then she burns rubber out of the parking lot... \n \n \n \n9:30 a.m. \n \nMom arrives back home. \u00a0She pours herself a cup of coffee...she adds Bailey's. \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1BOjQKXRmg4/TxWlAYfoH2I/AAAAAAAAAlk/gQmq9PqFjU4/s1600/Unknown.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/09/morning-scene-take-999.html", "title": "\nMorning Scene -Take 999\n"},
{"date": "Friday, September 28, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nA month or so I was asked to read and review the book \"Easy to Love but Hard to Raise.\" \u00a0 I thought, How exciting...my first book review and giveaway for the blog! \u00a0I forgot about the fact that I haven't been able to complete a book this entire year because my life is so hectic between the boys, my husband, my mother, my dog, the blog and my\u00a0 \"Confessions\" Facebook Community . \u00a0So, I read this book in pieces...which is easy to do because of the way the book is written.\u00a0There are many short essays that tell the tale of a parents experiences in raising challenging kids. \u00a0The size of the essays are small enough for a busy mom like me to read before falling asleep, after getting the boys in bed.  \n \nOf course...I can relate in some way, shape or form to ALL of the stories, even though the diagnoses varies from ADHD, ODD, Tourettes, PDD and other combinations. \u00a0They are are all somehow about me and  my experiences  with my own children. \u00a0The words are all are all thoughts that I've had inside my own head or have even written about at one time or another. \u00a0If I had written one of these essays, it would probably be titled, \"Easy to Love but Not Always Easy to  Like \" especially, when they become teenagers (because that's the snarky kind of girl I am).  \n \nSeriously, it is so important to our mental health as parents, to have a community to reach out to and be comforted in the fact that we are not alone in this journey. \u00a0This book accomplishes this goal phenomenally. I thoroughly enjoyed the essays and the expert advice that follows each.  \n \nLet me give you an example of just a few of my favorite quotes: \n \n \n \"Why had our parenting seemed so natural and effective with our two older children and yet felt so inadequate with Sarah?\" -Rachel Penn Hannah says about her daughter who is diagnosed with ADHD. \n \nFor me what worked with my stepson, Slim ...didn't work at all with Red. \u00a0Of course, at first we place blame and convince ourselves that their behavior is all our fault. \u00a0It must be something we are doing wrong. \u00a0I even blamed myself when my boys were both speech delayed. \u00a0When the truth is of course, that these kids are just different. \u00a0Therefore, so must be our approach to parenting them. \n \n \n \"There is something inherently wrong with the system when, in order to receive a correct diagnosis and effective treatment, a parent must know more than the doctors.\" -Robbi Nester says in one of my favorite essays, \"The Virtual Village\".\u00a0 \n \nIn my own paranoia, I always think that my friends and family wonder,  \"What the hell does she do all day? The kids are in school now. \u00a0Why doesn't she go back to work?\"  \u00a0They have no idea how much time I spend, reading and researching medications, their side-affects, treatments and therapies, much less carting them around to all of these appointments. \n \nHow many average parents have to go into doctors offices and tell them, although they have years of schooling and experience, \u00a0that you do indeed know more about your child than they do? \u00a0\"No, I do not want to try this medication. I've read how this combination works better.\" \u00a0I research medication classifications, because I know based on experience how my boys will react to certain medicines. \u00a0I should be awarded an honorary Pharmaceutical and Nursing degree!  \n \nNot to mention having to know more than the teachers, administrators and special-education professionals, about the Individual Education Plan for my children, because the will often do the bare minimum or not even tell you what programs and modifications are available.  \n \nAnother of my favorite parts of the book is the Q&A with Jean Winegardener, a.k.a. Stimey author of\u00a0 Stimeyland.com \u00a0about the role of social media as a support system to parents of special needs children. \n \nJean says, and I will paraphrase here... \n \n \n \" Having a child with special needs can be extremely isolating. Friends who don't understand what you're going through as a parent...may fall away. \u00a0Some days it's just too hard to face the stares and judgments...so parents end up staying at home.

When you just need some adult contact to take your mind off of all that is so difficult, Facebook steps up.\" \n \nMy blog,  Confessions Facebook Page \u00a0and virtual Autism community have been my saving grace. \u00a0I have felt so much less alone since becoming involved with other parents who \"get it.\" \u00a0Not only do they love, support and understand me...I get so much more from giving and sharing information with them. \u00a0Sometimes, I just give them something to laugh about in an otherwise funky day and they do the same for me. \u00a0Nothing makes my day more than some one thanking me for helping them feel a little less alone and crazy in this journey. \n \nHere's the fun part.. \n \n Comment below leaving your name. \u00a0You have to put in an e-mail address to leave a comment. \u00a0I will draw a name next week to give away a copy  of the book  \"Easy to Love by Hard to Raise\"! \u00a0 \n \nYou have until Friday, October 5th to enter. \u00a0Good luck! \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \nIf you just can't wait for my give away. \u00a0You can purchase the book\u00a0 here on Amazon \u00a0it even comes in Kindle format and I get a little Amazon associate credit to help fund the blog and help with my kids therapies! \n \n~ Love, Karen\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-U56PLif1Mvc/UGXnV6YE1cI/AAAAAAAAA1M/ELdNS54yfUo/s1600/images-7.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099", "http://www.stimeyland.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099", "http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Love-but-Hard-Raise/dp/1933084154"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/09/easy-to-love.html", "title": "\n\"Easy to Love...\"\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 26, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Harry is our now 5 year-old Maltese.  \u00a0 The longer Harry lives with us...I am convinced that he (like all of the other boys who live in this house) has a touch of Aspergers. \n \n \n \n \u00a0Here's why: \n \n \n \n1. He\u00a0 interrupts my conversations .\u00a0 If I have a friend over, or I'm on the phone, he yaps and tries to get all of the attention as if he is the most important person in the room. \n \n \n \n2. He has\u00a0 no sense of personal space .\u00a0 If I'm sitting down, he can't just sit accross from me or next to me, but he has to be touching some part of my body. Red has told me there's no such thing as personal space. \u00a0Harry apparently, feels the same way. \n \n \n \n3. Everytime I pull out my laptop to type...he comes over, stands on two legs and puts his paws on the keyboard, as if to say, \"What about me? Pat attention to me! Don't you know\u00a0 it's all about me\u00a0 all the time ?\" \n \n \n \n4. As soon as I get busy doing something, like sitting down for breakfast or lunch, all of a sudden he needs to go potty.\u00a0 He's like,\u00a0 Hello!... Focus \u00a0on me please. \u00a0 I'm over here!\u00a0 I need you right now! What you are doing is not as important as me.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThat's the exact same thing Red says to me when he comes into my room and I'm watching a show or writing.\u00a0 \"Stop looking at that t.v. Look at me!\" Even though he just came in to repeat something to me\u00a0 that he's already said about 25 times that day. \n \n \n \n \n \n 5.\u00a0 Harry \u00a0 is \u00a0 impulsive . Even though he knows better than to run across the street -if he sees something or someone that he just has to talk to...off he goes. (Luckily we live on a quiet street.) \u00a0He comes back humbly, knowing he was wrong and that \u00a0he is in trouble.\u00a0 You know the infamous, \"I'm sorry.\" Like Red says when he knows he's going to do the exact same thing the next time. \u00a0That doesn't keep me from giving him a bop on the nose and a time out! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Harry and Oliver (brothers) from the same litter \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Young Harry \n \nI don't mean to paint Aspergers with a broad stroke. \u00a0Every person with Aspergers is different right down to the two children I gave birth to. \u00a0I do see these traits in both of them, some more in one child than the other. \u00a0However, the essence of these traits can be found in both of them. \u00a0Maybe it's not them, maybe it's me. Maybe I have spoiled everyone in this house so much, that they all want my attention all of the time. \u00a0Maybe it's just the air we breath in this house, but probably not. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n Blue and Harry, 2009 \n \n \n \nAspergers or not...I love Harry, as I love my Aspergers boys. \u00a0The good thing about Harry is that he never gets mad at me. \u00a0He accepts discipline humbly. He is always happy to see me and sad to see me go. \u00a0Best of all -he's the only one in the house that doesn't talk back!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Editorial note: This was previously published here on \"Confessions\" a few years ago. \u00a0It still holds true today. \u00a0There is no such thing as personal space in this house!

Instead, I am scared shitless about his future and trying like hell to get certain behaviors under wraps and push him towards independence. \n \nI had a very interesting conversation with my  Facebook Confessions Community ,\u00a0\u00a0in which I received very diverse feedback regarding Red's most recent behavior and how I should deal with it. \u00a0I posed the question, \"You're nearly 17 years old-, with Aspergers and depression. \u00a0Should there be consequences for treating your family with blatant disrespect?  \n \nThere was everything from take away his favorite things until he's down to a bed, a pillow and a room with no door. \u00a0To find out what is triggering him. \u00a0He needs cognitive behavior therapy to help him with his negative thought process and find better ways to release his feelings. \u00a0It was a really great thread full of great advice and experience. \u00a0If you don't follow me on Facebook...you really should. \n \nAfter reading everyone's input, this is the conversation I had with Red: \n \nHe is sitting in front of the television spewing hatred about the \"buff guys who get all the girls and how it's not fair and how he would like to kick their asses!\" \n \n\"Son...I know you're not feeling very happy right now. \u00a0You have a lot of worries on your mind. \u00a0School is starting school soon. \u00a0You're worried about how that will go. \u00a0You're worried about your future. \u00a0You're disappointed because you don't have a girlfriend yet. \u00a0And because you're unhappy and feeling bad right now...you are doing your best to let us know how bad you feel by taking it out on all of us.\" \n\"Yeah...you're right,\" he says softly. \n\"You are blaming your unhappiness on anyone and everyone. \u00a0 You feel bad, so you're doing everything you can to make us feel as bad as you do. \u00a0You're starting crap with your brother and being annoying and hateful to us. \u00a0But your feelings are not about us they're about you, \u00a0and it's not fare to treat the people who love you badly because you're feeling bad.  \n \nThis is not about the buff guys or the girl who you like, who doesn't like you. \u00a0This is all about how you feel about yourself. Right now you are you happy with yourself?\" \n\"No...not really.\" \n\"That's because you are not loving yourself. \u00a0You are too busy focusing on all the things you feel are wrong with yourself instead of the good things. \u00a0How can you expect anyone to love you if you don't love yourself first?\" \n\"I guess I can't.\" \n\"When you are feeling negative and focusing on negative thoughts and feelings, you project that out into the world. \u00a0You put those negative statuses out on facebook and out into the world. \u00a0The reason you don't have a girlfriend doesn't have anything to do with the way that you look...because you are a handsome guy. \u00a0You are extremely handsome and attractive when you smile and are happy like you were when you were surrounded by your cousins last week.\" \n \n \n \n I showed him this picture taken last week... \n \n\"This guy is attractive. \u00a0This guy looks happy and positive. \u00a0This guy can find a nice girl who cares about you, understands and likes you just the way you are. \u00a0Start looking in the mirror at this guy who is smiling. \u00a0Tell yourself positive things and start believing them. \u00a0People are attracted to positivity. \u00a0It all starts with loving yourself. \u00a0This guy is lovable. \u00a0A person going around frowning and blaming the world for his stuff, \u00a0saying negative things about people is not attractive...this guy IS! \n \nIf you're unhappy with your body...only YOU can change that. \u00a0It has to come from within you. \u00a0It has to be what you really want. This is YOUR life...you are the person who can make it into what you want it to be. \u00a0This guy in this picture can go to school with this smile, make friends and the more friends you make the better chance you will have of finding that someone special. \u00a0It all starts with you. \u00a0You are the only person who can change your life. \u00a0Start loving yourself.\" \n \nAnd in that moment...he got it. \u00a0He turned off the attitude, got up off the couch and tried to get along with us for the day. \u00a0He was positive...at least until he went to the gym and saw all of the buff guys with girlfriends. \u00a0Then he was back to wanting to kick their asses. \u00a0 \n \nIt's definitely not the end of the attitude...the worries and the depression. \u00a0But it's a start... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=hl", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j2gmdjq8AVk/UDaWYFGPw3I/AAAAAAAAAwk/PquLJhV6upI/s1600/KendalSmile.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/08/self-loathing-to-max.html", "title": "\nSelf-loathing To the Max\n"},

He now considers himself a \"hardcore Christian\" who believes that sex is to be saved for marriage. \u00a0Very recently, he started seeing a young lady, who according to him, has the same views. \u00a0 \n \n Now who knows ...if \u00a0they really get into dating, their feelings may change. \u00a0I'm not naive. \u00a0Been there done that. \u00a0But this post is proof that our children do keep evolving, maturing and growing.\u00a0 \n \n The irony of this conversation below ...is that Red and his friend had it on the way to church!\u00a0 \n \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \nI can hardly catch my breath from all of the comings and goings that I have been responsible for this summer. \u00a0I have to keep them busy and on somewhat of a schedule otherwise, they will drive me completely nuts instead of the usual half-way-to crazy. \u00a0Swimming, working out at the rec center, hanging with friends on top of half day camp for Blue and 1/2 day vocational training for Red. \u00a0In between all of normal refereeing of fights and general madness. \n \nWhat never ceases to amaze me is there sense of entitlement, as if I owe it to them to keep them stimulated and entertained every second of every day. \u00a0It's not good enough that you drove me back and forth to camp today, where are we going next? \u00a0And what do you mean you don't have time to take me to point A, B and C? \u00a0Well, why not?  \n \nDo I owe you an explanation? Uh...no. \u00a0I do not. \n \nToday is particularly busy. \u00a0On top of my normal runs, I have to pick Red and his friend up to take them to the church for a youth outing. \u00a0In the car they are conversing as if there is not an adult...a woman, a mother no less, anywhere within earshot. \u00a0Here's the conversation. \n \nRed says, \"Man...I want a girlfriend so bad. \u00a0But I want a HOT girl not an ugly girl.\" \nHis friend says, \"Dude...you should just want a girl who is nice to you, not just some random HOT girl that's going to treat you like crap.\" \nRed \"The girls at my school only like you if you're a football player and you have a six pack. \u00a0That's why I'm working out because I'm too fat.\" \n\"That shouldn't even matter. \u00a0You need to stop trying to go after these cheerleaders and just go with a normal girl.\" \nRed -\"But the cheerleaders are the Hottest. \u00a0Come on Dude! \u00a0Sexually, speaking...I don't want to make out with some ugly girl with cracky lips. Who would want to do that?\" \nThis is followed by ruckus laughter. \nHis friend then says, \"You know what your problem is dude? \u00a0You need to stop looking at those girls on those videos. \u00a0Every time you come to my house...that's what you want to to.\" \nRed replies \"That's not me! \u00a0That's you! I don't look at porn all the time.\" \n\u00a0 HELLO! I'm sitting right here! \n\"Yes you do.\" \n\"It's not even really porn. \u00a0It's just hot girls in bikinis.It's just not fair! \u00a0Why do girls only go for the boys with six packs and the athletes?\" \n\"That's not  all  girls.\" \n\"It is at my school.\" \nFriend says, \"D -goes to your school. \u00a0He has a girlfriend and he's skinny!\" \n\"Yeah -but he has an ugly girlfriend.\" \n \nI finally interject into the conversation, \"You know why you don't have a girlfriend? \u00a0Because you don't want one for the right reasons. \u00a0You have no clue as to go about getting one. \u00a0And God isn't going to bless you with one until you figure that all out. \u00a0You're not ready!\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"I just said what I mean. \u00a0First of all if the first words that come out of your mouth are, 'Do you have a boyfriend?' when you first meet the girl. \u00a0She's going to shut you down right there. \u00a0She's knows you're scoping her out and your asking personal questions that are none of your business. As soon as you ask that question...she can't get away from you fast enough.\" \n\"What do you mean?\" \n\"I mean get out of the car. \u00a0We're here.\" \n\"Mom...\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Can I try out for football this year?\" \n\"Good bye Red and I hope your conversation is more appropriate once you get inside of the church.\"  \n \nHe brings a whole new meaning to the term \"No shame to my game!\" \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/06/hot-girls.html", "title": "\nHot Girls\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, May 9, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n Editorial Note: This was written by my 13 year-old son Blue. \u00a0He was inspired after reading, \"Freaks, Geeks and Aspergers\" by then 13 year-old Luke Jackson. \u00a0He put this article together...on his own and submitted it to his Language Arts teacher and to the Principal at his school. \u00a0The school principal allowed him to read it on the daily announcements. \u00a0When he came back to class, his peers gave him a standing ovation:\u00a0 \n \nDo people call you a \"freak?\" Do you feel different from others? It may be what others think, but you're not a freak. \u00a0You have a gift! Some people have autism and even more have ADHD, but this article focuses on Aspergers Syndrome (AS), which falls under the autism spectrum. \u00a0This is a very helpful article. \n \nSo what is Aspergers you ask? Well...some kids say it's bad, but it's not! It's defined as a disability but I think it's a gift. (I know, I just repeated) It's also known as High Functioning Autism (HFA). \u00a0People who have it have a few problems such as social skills, anxiety and more. \u00a0So they may not have a lot of friends. or don't have  any  friends. \u00a0But they are very smart too. \u00a0They usually have a special interest and know a lot about it; sometimes they can bore you to death when they talk about it a lot. Some people think that they're freaks because of the bad things. \u00a0We shouldn't judge their differences, we should help them, be a friend, support them and be kind.  \n \nNow there are other disabilities too. \u00a0They also need help. \u00a0Some AS peeps can't think about other people's feelings, they are stuck in their own closed world and even repeat themselves. \u00a0Don't pick on people who are different because you are too! \n \nFor those of you bullies who tease them, or think you're popular, you are wrong. \u00a0Popularity is not real. You are no better than them! \u00a0Remember, everyone is unique and should be themselves. \u00a0It makes me feel horrible when others criticize me for being myself. \u00a0You shouldn't have to be someone else to fit in. \u00a0You should be able to be yourself. \u00a0You chose who you want to be! \n \nPeople with Asperger's Syndrome may help change the world if we put down our differences and accept each other. When they are adults, they will have worked on and learned how to handle their AS. \u00a0Having Aspergers to me, helps me focus on my interest and know a lot about it, like computers and cars. \u00a0I try to help others in lots of ways, especially kids with AS. \u00a0I even spoke twice at a teachers conference about AS so they could help their students with AS. \u00a0I am a compassionate person. \n \nSo now you have some information about autism, try to be a friend. \u00a0Remember AS peeps, you are not a freak! You are unique. \u00a0Others, please be considerate.  \n \nIf you want to know more about teens with Aspergers, I'd recommend a very good book by a 13 year-old with Aspergers called, \"Freaks, Geeks and Aspergers Syndrome.\" \u00a0There are other good books to educate youself. \u00a0I would recommend you read them, or just talk to me. \u00a0Try to understand people with autism and be patient.  \n \nOh and it's cool to be different. \u00a0I hope that this article helped someone's life. \u00a0I really want to impact their lives in a good way. \n \n\"If we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity.\" -John F. Kennedy. \n \n While Blue was reading this announcement over the P.A. system, there was an ARD (Admissions, Review, Dismissal) meeting going on. \u00a0The parents were facing the option of having their child evaluated for autism and putting him in to the Social skills support system that the school has to offer. \u00a0After hearing Blue speak they said, \"If you can do that for our son...sign us up!\"\u00a0 \n \n Yep...he got his wish. \u00a0He changed at least one life. \u00a0I didn't give him the extraordinary math and science gene...but I think I gave him the gift of wanting to make the world a better place. \u00a0 \n \n I am one proud mama!\u00a0 \n \n If you are interested in reading the book, to Help Support The Blog you can purchase it here: \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Qd-PJ6zsz_k/T6qVw3ojsEI/AAAAAAAAArE/ZKsVb8oI1RA/s1600/images-12.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/05/freaks-geeks-aspergers.html", "title": "\nFreaks, Geeks & Aspergers\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 7, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nI've been wanting to write a post about medication changes and the blues it's giving Blue. \u00a0It's such a draining process and therefore draining subject to think about much less write about. \u00a0I've been going through this for so long...first with Red and now with Blue. \u00a0A sistah just can't seem to get catch a break. \u00a0Now that things have settled down a bit with Red...it's Blue's turn to fall apart.  \n \nA good part of this past year has been pretty challenging for Blue. \u00a0He's growing and going through lots of changes hormonally, which has had his anxiety and anger factor turned up to max volume. \u00a0He has gone from my easy child...to my problematic child as he approached the big 13. \u00a0He's inflexible, angry, incredulous, impatient and overwhelmed by all of his many, many thoughts. \u00a0His mind is spinning at 100 mph and the rest of us can hardly keep up. \u00a0He is making straight A's, however he seems totally spent when he comes home from school because of social issues. \u00a0He's so exhausted and drained mentally, yet he pushes himself and makes homework bigger than it has to be. \u00a0Most nights by bed-time he is a complete mess. \n \nA little over a month ago we weaned him off of one med and started him on another. \u00a0I don't really want to get into specifics because as we all know, each med works differently for each individual child. \u00a0Let's just say it's in the SNRI class of drugs, which is supposed to treat depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. \u00a0We started minimally lets say with 20 mg. \u00a0When that didn't seem effective the docs decided to move him up to 40 and then 60 mg, which is the max for his height and weight.  \n \nDid it change things for the better? No. \u00a0He seemed to become not exactly anxious, but very aware of all of the things and people who really got on his nerves and he felt the need to let us all know about it...angrily. \u00a0We were up to at least one explosion a day...at least. So I'm thinking...this is not working right?  \n \nThe Psychiatrist who always wants to add another med, \u00a0but I have to see her because he's making self-harm statements, and I can't get in to see anyone else anytime in the near future...says lets add this stimulant which should help loosing up his rigid thought and explosiveness. \u00a0I argue...I put it off...but eventually, out of desperation, I try it...praying that it will help. \u00a0NOT!!! I should have followed my instinct! It was like he was on speed.  \n \nHe had already started this researching electronics obsessively...more obsessively than ever. The new Microsoft store opened up and he had to go to the Grand Opening. \u00a0He went and spent several hours and then asked to go back 2 days later. \u00a0The obsessions, questions and lists and lists of things to do, buy and research were over the top, to the point where he didn't feel like he had time for homework and showers because he had to do more research for things he can not possibly buy. \u00a0He became highly agitated whenever he did not get the response from us that he wanted or when we requested anything from him other than what he wanted to do. \n \nSo of course, back to the freaking drawing board. \u00a0We scratched the stimulant after about 8 days, which made him like a robot on crack. \u00a0A few days later we go into the Neurologist and tell him, hey.. the SNRI is not working either. \u00a0He says, let's pull him off of it...slowly. \u00a0He brings up the possibility of trying couple of nightmare meds that I've already been through with Red. \u00a0Then he brings up a relatively new one called Prystic. \u00a0I'm like... hell no!  \u00a0I don't want to try something else new and put him through this freakin' trauma again! \n \nNon of the SNRI's or SSRI's that we have tried have worked so far. \u00a0None of the non-stimulant meds did anything for him but make him sleepy. \u00a0The only thing that has ever worked is Abilify. \u00a0Then he started growing and going through these hormonal changes and it wasn't working anymore. \u00a0Instead of\u00a0increasing it...the Psych started adding these anti-anxiety, antidepressant drugs. \u00a0I want him on as few drugs as possible. \u00a0So I tell the doc...here is what we're going to do: \n \n \n Take him off of all of this crap except the Abilify.\u00a0 \n Increase Abilify it to the appropriate dose for his current height and weight.\u00a0 \n Supplement it with the best possible Omega 3's (and no not one prescribed so big pharma can make money) \n A supplement combination of vitamin methyl B12, Hydroxy B12 and vitamin D\u00a0 \n Change our diet to high protein, vegetables and fruits and less processed food \n An increase in exercise\u00a0 \n Psychotherapy individual and family with an autism with a certified BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Analyst) \n \nSo that's the plan. \u00a0Praying that it works and that he doesn't completely bite my head off in the process.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fu-3fqjJjko/T6f0fwb2NDI/AAAAAAAAAq4/HXzgtj3q1xk/s1600/images-11.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/05/hes-got-blues.html", "title": "\nHe's Got the Blues\n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 14, 2012", "body": "\n \n This was the best Mother's Day ever in our house...and that is not to say that it was perfect, but it was really good. \u00a0 \n \n I am awakened at say 8 a.m. with loud banging on the door. \u00a0It's Red of course.\u00a0 \n \"Can I come in?\" \n \"No...we are sleeping.\"\u00a0 \n He keeps fiddling with the door, finally retreating a few moments later to go down to eat his breakfast. \u00a0He's up early because he is going to church and his Pastor will pick him up at 9.\u00a0 \n Half-hour later he's back. \u00a0 \n \"I just want to come in and say good-morning.\"\u00a0 \n So much for sleeping in. \n More than wanting to say good morning to me, he wants to come in and play with/annoy the dog. \u00a0 \n He does actually wish me a Happy Mother's Day without prompting, and gives me a hug. \u00a0 \n He made a video for me that he wants me to watch right away.\u00a0 \n You see last year on\u00a0 Mothers Day \u00a0he was supposed to make this video, but he decided he was just too tired. \u00a0In fact, he also decided that his handwriting was so bad, he couldn't even sign my card. \u00a0 \n So this was a huge step in the right direction. \u00a0Here's the video: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I must admit this made me smile from ear to ear. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n I have to also acknowledge my husband who really stepped up this year. \u00a0He doesn't cook, but he brought breakfast and dinner in. \u00a0He bought beautiful cards and flowers for both me and my mother. \u00a0He cleaned the kitchen (extremely rare) and did everything he could to keep the boys out of my hair for the day. \u00a0Of course,\u00a0 that\u00a0 was the greatest gift!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Another awesome gift (that I believe was definitely God at work) --Red gave me the gift of leaving the house for most of the day! ( I know that sounds bad huh? ) \u00a0He went to church and then his Pastor dropped him off at his friends house where he spent most of the day. \u00a0This allowed Blue to have peace and therefore give me peace, so that I could nap and lounge for most of the day. \u00a0Hallelujah! Thank you Jesus!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Oh...and the long lost son, Slim Shady showed up at the house, not 1 but 2 days in a row. \u00a0He actually hung out, ate dinner, watched a movie and the basketball game with his dad and his brothers. \u00a0He will be deployed soon to Afghanistan. \u00a0I appreciate that he is finally reaching out in his own way, trying to show that he does love his family.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Blue did his best to hold it together for most of the day and for that I am grateful. \u00a0He opted out of doing homework together. \u00a0He knew that would probably push him over the edge.\u00a0 Unfortunately, as soon as Red walked through the door, it wasn't long before the 2 of them were at each other's throats, which was the spark that lit the fuse and sent Blue over the edge and out of the house. \u00a0He walked over to our neighbor and friend's house where he cooled down. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n It really was the best Mother's Day I can remember in recent history. \u00a0Of course, there is always room for improvement. \n \n \n \n \n While I was lounging in my room, browsing on my computer, \u00a0I received 2 comments from exasperated Aspergers moms from last year's\u00a0 Mother's Day \u00a0post. \u00a0Here is one of them:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \"Another heartbreaking mothers day, I actually hate this day. On a whim I decided to look this up to see if it would help. I have talked to my daughter a ton of times today, not one happy mothers day, even when I reminded her, just her going on and on about some boy she is upset about...and by on and on, I mean on and on. This is an extension of a two hour conversation from last night. When I reminded her it was mothers day and she has not acknowledged it she said \"I planned to later\" When????? I know this sounds bad, but I feel I sacrifice so much for her, and this is the one day I was hoping for a little acknowledgment. HOw did I forget this is how most mothers days are. Now she is upset because how could i kick her when she is down....really????? Ok, another venting hope this helps me get thru the rest of the day. \" \n \n \n \n To these 2 moms I say, there is always hope. \u00a0To\u00a0all of you Aspergers Mom's who did not get the acknowledgement that you wanted, needed and deserved, please know that they do love you. \u00a0They show it the best way they can with what they are working with at the time. \u00a0Continue to let them know what you want and expect from them. \u00a0You may not get it right away, but you may be able to get it from them in the future. \u00a0Don't set your expectations too high. \u00a0It may not come packaged perfectly with the flowers and bow on top...but it is love none-the-less. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I also want to acknowledge you here: \n \n \n \n You are the best mom you can be \n \n You are enough \u00a0 \n \n You are loved \n \n \n \n \"You are a cherished Blessing to the world and to me.\" -my friend, Elena de Beche\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["rtsp://v1.cache1.googlevideo.com/ChoLENy73wIaEQneGRZTxZLMMxMYDSANFEgDDA==/0/0/0/video.3gp"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/05/aspergery-mothers-day.html", "title": "\nAspergery Mother's Day\n"},

D. \u00a0 I mean who talks about that when they're 12?  \n \nHe is the one who use to be the attorney for his brother, when he was acting out. \u00a0\"Mom he doesn't mean that. \u00a0He's just trying to... Don't be angry with him.\" He is the one who said, \"I don't want to turn into one of those disgusting teenagers, who curses and disrespects their parents.\"  \n \n \n \nHe's the one who is this wonderful artist, this deep thinker, who always thinks outside of the box. \u00a0He's the one who wrote this wonderful essay,  Freaks Geeks & Aspergers \u00a0about autism acceptance. \u00a0He wrote this of his own volition, just a few weeks ago, and read it on the P.A. system for the entire school to hear. \u00a0He is the one who gets notes sent home about what a wonderful student he is...what a great leader he is.  \n \nAnd yet...right now he is in such pain that it's palpable. \u00a0He's falling apart, yet he's wound up tight, like a sling shot. \u00a0He clenches his fist ...his body trembles with anger. \u00a0He's a stick of dynamite with a short fuse. \n \nSo...I speak softly. \u00a0I \u00a0indulge him. \u00a0I try to make him more comfortable in his own skin. \u00a0I attempt to surround him in a protective bubble, keeping him away from the triggers as much as possible. \u00a0It's a lot of work! \u00a0And it's feels like all for naught. \n \nI lay in bed next to him...trying to massage the stress away with lavender oil and a soft voice of reassurance. \u00a0He turns around and starts biting the sheets, to show me, 'What you are doing is not working. \u00a0Just leave me the fuck alone! I'm miserable! And you can't rub it away with lavender oil or Gaba cream!' \n \n\"I'm working on getting you a new therapist who really knows Aspergers,\" I say. \n\"I can't do it! \u00a0I can't do anything. \u00a0It won't work. \u00a0I can't start anything new right now. \u00a0I'm tired of this.

{"date": "Monday, May 21, 2012", "body": "\n \n Guest Post By: LeLinda Faulk -Aspergers Mom of \u00a0her beautiful, brilliant son, who is going into the 3rd grade in a Houston, Texas public school.\u00a0 \n \n Edited by: Karen -Aspergers Mom \n \n \n \n \nI\u2019m just a mom of an Asperger\u2019s kid, who survived an ARD.\u00a0 Some states call them\u00a0 I.E.P. (acronym for Individual Education Plan) meetings.\u00a0 Here in the state of Texas, our goal planning meetings are called ARDs (acronym for Admission, Review and Dismissal). \n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \nARD\u2019s are SCARY! \u00a0This was my 3 rd  one so I knew what to expect. Preparation is everything! \u00a0It\u2019s so important to know what works for your kid. The good thing about it is, you know your kid better than anyone else. I\u2019m not an educator. I wouldn\u2019t even comfortably call myself a kid person. I do love my son immensely and want him to have a fair chance at success.\u00a0 I will give you some resources that I found helpful and I\u2019ll even share some of my ideas for the IEP and BIP (Behavior Intervention Plan). \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe main thing I\u2019ve noticed is the old saying is true; the squeaky wheel gets the grease. You have to make your voice heard and your presence known regularly.\u00a0 It's important that the educators working with your child know that you plan on being a big part of your child's education process.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIf you\u2019re brand new to ARD\u2019s,\u00a0 the first thing I recommend is that you at least  chat with an advocate . There\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll be able to incorporate some things you didn\u2019t even know about.\u00a0 We used the ARC of Houston.\u00a0 Our advocate did not recommend specific accommodations, but she was insistent that we get what we wanted and made sure all evaluations and testing were performed to ensure we could get the right accommodations. \n \nSpecial Education laws can be tricky. I don\u2019t know if they are designed more so to help or hinder the education process. Just know there are ways to get what you NEED accomplished. If the first person you call can\u2019t help you, call someone else! Don\u2019t give up!\u00a0 If you do not push for your child his education...I can assure you no one else will. \u00a0Here are a few things you can do to prepare.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n You can begin looking for Advocates here -- Autism Speaks Family Services Resource Guide \u00a0 Find your State - There\u2019s an Advocacy bullet listed\u00a0 \n You can also try\u00a0 COPAA -Council of Parent Advocates and Attorneys  \n I would suggest becoming familiar with the  Wrights Law.com .\u00a0 If you speak in technical/legal terms or can interpret it, it\u2019s VERY useful. You'll kind of freak the committee out and they will believe you actually know what you're talking about.\u00a0 They will be less likely to give you the old okie doke.\u00a0 \n \u00a0Your  State Education Department's  website will have resources, contacts and phone numbers listed.\u00a0 Call and ask questions. \n Your local  School District's Special Education Department  is also another resource.\u00a0 No matter how intimidating \u2018the district\u2019 may seem call them and ask about services specific to your child\u2019s needs.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt turns out our district has an  \u00a0Autism Specialist\u00a0 who\u2019s a  Special Education Coordinator  for the district. Plead your case to them; ask them to be a part of the ARD. I have also invited our Special Ed. Coordinator to teacher meetings when the IEP wasn\u2019t being followed. This is the person who can \u00a0also facilitate the training for your teachers. Make sure they know your kid is out there. \u00a0Before my contact she had never heard of my kid and she manages all Autism plans for children on the spectrum. There are also TOSA (teachers on special assignment) who specialize in training teachers to meet the needs of children on the spectrum.  Had I not called we\u2019ve have never been offered these services. \n \n \nBy the time the ARD is scheduled you should already have plenty of contact with your child\u2019s teacher(s) and I\u2019m betting the school administration. I\u2019ve found it very beneficial to play nice as part of a team, even when I bitch moan and complain...I remind them we are a team. \u00a0I specialize in my child, and they specialize in education. Together we will get this done, and we need ALL involved to play our roles. \n \nI learned by my second ARD meeting that no one was very forthcoming with suggestions or accommodations. It was a lot of,  \u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d \u00a0 This time around,\u00a0I was determined to come up with my own ideas. Here's what I did: \n \n \n I googled, researched and read. By the time it was all said and done I had printed over 25 articles and consolidated them into 5 pages of handwritten notes.\u00a0 \n I asked around to other parents and even had Andrea from\u00a0 My Aspergers Teen.com \u00a0send me the accommodations they had just put in place for her son. \n There\u2019s also a Facebook page called  Autism Discussion Page \u00a0GREAT INFO! \u00a0The moderator is able to break down what works and why. I have sent several of his articles to my school administration. They\u2019ve really helped the principal \u2018get it\u2019. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIn our specific case our Aspie is in an advanced placement program called AIMS, the program is for Gifted and Talented students through 6 th  grade. \u00a0The main benefit of the AIMS program is the children are taught with other gifted students.\u00a0 The classes move at a slightly faster pace allowing for various projects that general education students don\u2019t do. \u00a0The AIMS class involves extra homework and class work that don\u2019t coincide with my son's,\u00a0 \u201cIf I know it, \u00a0why do I have to keep practicing it?\u201d  mentality. Since we aren\u2019t sure of placement moving forward, I requested both sets of teachers be trained on how do teach an Aspergers student over summer break.

I hate my life! I just want to die,\" are words none of my siblings have had to hear come out of the mouths of their children. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo I won't take it personally when it is insinuated that, \"I don't work.\" \u00a0But on this last day in California, I will not be used up. \u00a0I will do my laundry and rest before I go back home to WORK...to \u00a0deal with my own drama and sleep with my own down pillows! \n \nIf you feel me Vote for me on Babble! \nhref=\"http://www.babble.com/baby/baby-development/top-autism-blog-nominate/\"> \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YnRNij8j1BU/T4hkFQ8OfdI/AAAAAAAAApU/hxKIth883QA/s1600/images-5.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/04/theres-no-place-like-home.html", "title": "\nThere's No Place Like Home\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 10, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nI spent most of my birthday this year getting ready for an emergency trip to see my 82 year-old father in California, in the hospital. \u00a0My siblings call the night before, after spending the entire night in the emergency room with him, with high blood pressure, high-fever and disorientation. \u00a0He's on oxygen, his fever is showing no signs of breaking, the blood pressure is through the roof. \u00a0Naturally, they are concerned that at his age, and being a diabetic, that anything could happen, a stroke, heart-attack, or even the inevitable. \n \nNot such a happy birthday, which is kind of par for the course the last few years. \u00a0There is usually something about my birthday that makes Red act out. \u00a0This year Blue is full of anxiety, and for some reason tells me, \"You know...it's not all about you today. \u00a0You're not the only person on earth with a birthday on April 6th.\" \u00a0Yeah...really nice. \n \nInstead of disappearing for the day, which I desperately want to do, I spend the day with Red, while dad spends the day with Blue. \u00a0We do errands, and a little shopping. \u00a0He just can't seem to help himself from getting into the looping conversations about all the things we should be doing for him...which ends up making me sorry I chose to take him with me, instead of leaving him at home. \n \nHubby and I are able to sneak away to have cocktails and appetizers that night. \u00a0A couple of martinis, appetizers and creme brulee helps ease my pain. \n \nI make it in to Los Angeles the following day. \u00a0My dad is sitting up in the bed by now. \u00a0The fever is broken, the blood pressure is down. \u00a0He is refusing to lay down, giving the nurses a hard time and talking non-stop. \u00a0He is in his glory I think, being surrounded by most of his children. \u00a0There are 5 of us in total. \u00a0He makes me laugh with his warped sense of humor. \u00a0Yep...that's where I get it from.  \n \nBut as I listen to him talk, I realize that he has this sense of entitlement. \u00a0He thinks that the world owes him something. \u00a0He has little to no respect for women and his favorite way of communication is using foul, offensive language. \u00a0I'm used to it. \u00a0Sometimes, I check him on it. \u00a0Sometimes, I laugh at it. \u00a0I cringe at the least possibility that I will be like him when I get older. \u00a0I don't think I will go all the way there. \n \nMy dad has no religious upbringing. \u00a0He has told my children, there is no God, which really confused them. \u00a0Thanks to my mom, I was raised in Christianity. I try to follow the example of Christ. \u00a0I do treat people with respect. \u00a0I feel so awful for the nurses and staff who are trying their best to take care of him. \u00a0Talking to him about being nice and respectful is futile at this point. \u00a0His will be 83 years-old soon. \u00a0He's not about to change, for the better. \n \nThe funny thing is, when he gets to talking in circles, not connecting thoughts, and having this odd-outlook on the world... I don't loose it, like my sister does. \u00a0She gets so frustrated with him. \u00a0I'm pretty used to crazy talk. \u00a0I live with it everyday. \u00a0I gently let him know how I feel and what I think is inappropriate and what I do not appreciate. \n \nThe better my dad gets each day...the filthier the mouth. \u00a0I fear for the day when he needs others...strangers, nurses, health-workers to take care of him. \u00a0When we can not be there to ensure his daily care and he feels that he can say anything and still be served well.  \n \nLife is one endless stream of taking care of loved ones. \u00a0Children, Mothers, Fathers, Husbands. \u00a0Good thing I have my happy pills and the occasional glass of wine. \u00a0And by occasional I mean --nightly! \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lZVraR72mzc/T4R1oW-GZOI/AAAAAAAAApM/DYdWHGxCQp4/s1600/images-4.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/04/un-happy-birthday.html", "title": "\nUn-Happy Birthday\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 18, 2012", "body": "\n \nA  \"Confessions\" Facebook \u00a0Post last week: \n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0~~Never do something for your Aspergers child with an expectation that it will\u00a0 change\u00a0his mood, make him smile or be gracious. \u00a0Only do it out of the kindness of your heart...or if it's in your job description as parent. \u00a0Otherwise, you will often find yourself disappointed. \n \n \nWhen I came home from California, Blue was not at the airport to greet me. \u00a0He had social plans with his friends from school and he was unapologetic about it. \u00a0That's typical teenage stuff right? \u00a0I was disappointed not to see him, but happy that he made plans to get together with his peers. \u00a0When he finally comes home later that night, he greets me with a big hug and tells me he missed me. \u00a0There is no smile, no change in affect. \u00a0I don't care. \u00a0I am grateful for the hug. \n \nIt doesn't take long before he's angry with me. \u00a0Like try...the very next morning, \u00a0when he wakes us up to ask if we can go out for breakfast. \u00a0 This is the first time I slept in my bed for a week. \u00a0But who's thinking about that? \u00a0  The answer was of course, \"Not today.\" \u00a0By the way, it's raining outside and my pillows are feeling especially soft and my down comforter is cradling my body like a long, lost lover. \u00a0I was in the sweetest dreamland before...scratch the record! \u00a0WAKE UP I'M HUNGRY AND I WANT TO GO OUT! \n \nHe goes downstairs to discover that there is not enough milk for the oversized bowl of cereal he poured. \u00a0This is end of life as we know it. \u00a0It's like a national disaster. \u00a0To top it off, then he discovers that we ate out after the airport...without him. \u00a0How dare we do something fun, while he's out doing something fun...with someone else!? \u00a0 \n \nLater that day, I take him out with me to grab a bite of lunch and run some errands. \u00a0He becomes angry because we're not going to Mc Donalds. \u00a0I have come to loathe Mc Donald's because of how processed and unhealthy the food is. \u00a0I can think of lots of better ways to get high calorie intake like...Red Velvet cupcakes and wine, for instance.  \n \n\"How about you be grateful that you're not eating at home?\" I ask giving him something to think about. \u00a0His mood improves only slightly after he eats. \u00a0I was kind of hoping that we were going to have some happy re-bonding time together. \u00a0 Thus the lesson for the day...don't go having some expectation of a certain emotion .  \u00a0He is far short of happy. \u00a0There are no smiles on his gorgeous face the entire day. \u00a0In fact, after we finish our errands and return home, it doesn't take long for the anger to come out to play with me again. \n \nHe is really not happy that I was away...that his routine was broken...that he had to do things Dad's way for a week. \u00a0\"Do you know how hard it was for me to be without you last week!\" he grumbles! \n\"I'm sorry it was difficult for you. \u00a0But I wasn't exactly on a pleasure trip. \u00a0I was caring for my father who was laying in a hospital bed. \u00a0It wasn't fun for me either.\" \nThis gives him a little perspective. \u00a0He straightens up...a bit.  \n \nI get it. \u00a0He doesn't like change. \u00a0And let's face it, Dad doesn't spoil him the way that I do. \u00a0I guess I've created my own little monsters, by busting my a** trying to make them happy all of these years. \u00a0Even though he did not appreciate  most  of the ways Dad does things, \u00a0before he goes to bed, he makes a point of telling me that Dad got him to school earlier than I do. \u00a0Dad's morning routine works better than mine.  \n \n Wow ! \u00a0Yes...we are now following Dad's routine. \u00a0Well...except for the 1 morning this week that I didn't hear my alarm go off and I was late getting everyone up. \u00a0All hell broke loose! He hates to be late. \u00a0He hates to be rushed. \u00a0He loathes the unexpected...period. \u00a0Seeing as I am not the most organized person in the world, \u00a0sometimes...Sh*t happens, much to his dismay. \n \nI have to say...thus far, I am disappointed with the new medication prescribed by the Neurologist. \u00a0He is far short of a happy camper. \u00a0He walks around here grunting, huffing and puffing, blowing up just about daily. \u00a0You can reign in the meltdowns a little easier, but generally speaking if things don't go exactly the way he wants them to go...he's pissed! \u00a0I don't really want to make major changes to meds with this being the last 6 weeks of school, but damn! Something's gotta give. \u00a0I want my sweet child back! I hope he's still in there somewhere. \n \n \n \n \nBlue made this drawing for his Social Studies teacher \u00a0who taught him about Native Americans. \u00a0He had it matted and framed to give it to him for his birthday. \u00a0Then, he asks me for the 20 bucks to pay for it! \u00a0The kid really does have a good heart and if I must say so myself...he is helluva talented! \n \nWhat did I get for my birthday you ask? A card...bought at the drugstore...by his father...that he graciously signed. I should be grateful right?

{"date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nWorld Autism Awareness day was April 2nd this year. \u00a0I wanted to do some warm and fuzzy kind of tribute to the day, on the day, here on my blog. \u00a0Instead, I was busy living  through  the autism in our family. \u00a0Sunday, the day I would have started to put such a post together, was spent dealing with Red who was very disappointed that his plans fell through with his friend from school.  \n \n \n \nI'm always trying to fix things and make them a little better, a little easier for the boys. \u00a0So when Asperger's Dad announces that he is going out to get some ice-cream...I suggest that he take Red with him, to help get his mind off of his plans. \u00a0Red is starting to perseverate about things not working out. \u00a0He's getting louder and louder, with each repetitive statement. \u00a0My husband is looking at me like I have 3 heads. \u00a0 You're kidding me right? Why do you want me to take him again? \u00a0Oh I don't know maybe a little father and son time.  They go...Red continues his rant. \u00a0Dad even calls in the troops...big brother Slim Shady, to come hang with them for a bit. \u00a0It's not enough for Red to enjoy the time with his dad and his brother. Instead, he spends most of the the time stuck in perseveration land.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, back here at the Ranch (and by ranch I mean my house which seems to be getting smaller and falling part more everyday) ...Blue is getting frustrated with his Science Project.  \n\"It's too hard! \u00a0It's just too much information to sort through on the internet. \u00a0I don't understand anything! Can you just have me excused from it?\" \n NOT! This apparently is a major grade.  \u00a0We can break it down in to steps and get you some assistance, but not just blow it off. \u00a0He begins the shut down process and stays mostly funky about it for the rest of the night. \u00a0He snaps at me. \u00a0He rolls his eyes at Nana. \u00a0Nana snaps at him. \u00a0Oh it's just a barrel of fun! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe goes to school the following day and continues the funkiness with his Special Education teacher who is trying to help him. \u00a0It turns out that he is really much further along than he believes he is. \u00a0However, he is trying to make it more complicated than it has to be. \u00a0In his eyes, what he has done isn't good enough and isn't detailed enough. \u00a0Apparently, his science teacher, you know the person who is grading the assignment...thinks that if he turned it in as is, he would have a 90. \u00a0But that's not good enough for our mad scientist. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen his special education tracking teacher tries to hold him accountable and work with him to complete the assignment, he refuses to listen to her. \u00a0He is argumentative and combative...basically, \u00a0refusing to work and telling her that she is mean and not encouraging at all! When she asks him what she can do better he says, \"You can leave!\"  Really nice! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo I spend World Autism Awareness Day in the Psychiatrists office, trying to process Blue's depression, anger and anxiety. \u00a0Trying to determine if adjustments are needed in medication or if he is indeed in danger of self-harm, because he has been making statements such as, \"Everything is just too hard. \u00a0That's why I just want to end my life. \u00a0I can't take it anymore.\" \n \nIt is determined that he is expressing extreme frustration and depression. \u00a0The Psychiatrist is is less than thrilled that the Neurologist has changed the anti-depressant, anti-anxiety med that  she  had originally prescribed  (which was NOT working and hadn't been for almost a year)  but since I was starting to see some glimmers of hope, \u00a0she decides to increase the number of milligrams he is taking, which is more in line with his weight. \u00a0This, I hesitantly agree to do.\u00a0\u00a0As usual, she also wants to ad an additional medication to the mix ( Vyanse to help with focus and his thought process). \u00a0 \u00a0I take the prescription with the thought that I will go home, research it and decide weather or not to fill it. \u00a0He's already on 2 that I don't feel all that great about.\u00a0\u00a0Have I told you how much I absolutely loathe the medication guinea pig, trial and error process?  \n \nI know there is much controversy about giving children psychiatric medication and I do have some ambivalence about it. \u00a0To say that I have mixed emotions about it, would be an understatement. \u00a0However, when your child is so anxious that he's exploding daily, or hiding in the bathroom all day because of fear of thunderstorms, when the sun is shining. \u00a0When his life is seriously impaired by his depression and anxiety, and he can not work to his maximum potential at school, you do what you have to do to help him! \u00a0I don't give a shit what people think!\u00a0 \n \n \nHe seems to be feeling better as we leave her office. \u00a0He is definitely in a better mood than he was at school that morning when he was being really ugly to his teacher. \u00a0This is what I mean by a glimmer of hope that this med is beginning to work. \u00a0It is a beautiful spring day at about 80 degrees. \u00a0There is a gentle-breeze in the air.\u00a0We go have a late lunch, do a little shopping and go to his favorite place on earth...the Apple Store. \u00a0We have the absolute best afternoon together. \u00a0He is laughing and even joking around a bit. \u00a0Something he seldom does with me these days.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe decide to take a leisurely stroll through the outdoor shopping mall. \u00a0As we are walking, \u00a0Red calls to remind me that he has a PCP (Person Centered Planning) meeting that starts in an hour. \u00a0The PCP is basically a personal goal setting meeting to help Red work on his life dreams. \u00a0I had no idea that he had confirmed the plans for the meeting with our facilitator. \u00a0I have to rush home to host this meeting. \u00a0I will have to write details of this meeting in another post.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe bottom line is that I spent World Autism Day, fully engrossed and Aware that Autism is a big part of our family life. \u00a0It's here to stay. \u00a0I take care of it. \u00a0I try not to allow it to dominate our lives. \u00a0I try to keep it tame, playing in the background, not allowing it to completely take control. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nOn World Autism Awareness day, there was no time for me to become involved in the debate that's going on in the autism community about how we feel about autism, do we hate it, love it, accept it. \nI didn't have time to chime in about what Autism Speaks does or does not do for our kids. \u00a0I was busy taking care of my family, trying to wrangle the autism in to submission...trying to find treasured moments, putting out fires, or at least keep them to a low smolder. \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jsiO2l_tKoA/T3xmQMNQC8I/AAAAAAAAApE/ePDVcCjvwK0/s1600/bluelight.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-autism-awareness.html", "title": "\nWorld Autism Awareness\n"},

Oy Vey! \n \nHe is relentless about talking to ME about it. \u00a0When I finally say, \"You are not ready for the kind of relationship that comes along with sex. \u00a0There is too much emotion involved and you have trouble regulating emotions as it is.\"  \nHis response? \n\"I'm not talking about a relationship...I'm just talking about sex...you know with one of those girls who just goes after anybody.\" \n\"And you think this is going to happen in MY house?\" \n \nOH MY GOD! This boy is so clueless! That was the end of the conversation right there. I was beyond done. \u00a0Yes --he needs to talk to his father, his brother and his uncles. \u00a0He also needs a book and a class specifically for teenage boys with Aspergers. \u00a0God help him! You can bet I'll be signing him up for one this summer!  \n \nThankfully, he started arguing with his brother a few minutes later \u00a0--at least that changed the subject. \u00a0After \u00a0yelling and a coming to blows, a few minutes later -they have a meeting of the minds where they are trying to understand each other's Aspergers quirks. \u00a0Unbelievable! \n \nA few minutes later -Red comes bounding down the stairs to tell me his friend from school is on his way to pick him up to go to Youth Night at his church. \u00a0Whew! Thank you Jesus a night of peace for me! \n \nHe comes home hours later, with a huge smile on his face. \u00a0\"OMG mom! I had so much fun. \u00a0The music was great!

You better be ready by the time I get back!\" \nWhen I pull back up to the house, he comes out immediately. \n\"Why don't you understand mom? \u00a0I am just tired this morning.\" \n\"You say you want a job. \u00a0Yet, you have worked-based learning this morning where they are teaching you work skills and evaluating your job readiness and you decide not to show up this morning. \nYou are showing us, that you are not ready for employment. \nPeople who hold good jobs, push through being tired.  \nThey show up for work...on time!\" \n\"Well...employers are unfair!

Not going to happen. \n \nIt all goes down hill from there. \u00a0What was a great day at school, where he calls me sounding all happy that he did well on his test, then calls me while I am out to ask me to bring burgers, turns into yelling at the top of his voice because his brother won't give up his meal. \u00a0And it gets uglier and uglier until he's absorbed all of the oxygen in the house. \nGuess what will happen the next time he calls me for burgers? \n \nWhen that finally calms down, Blue wants to go to the Grand Opening of the new Microsoft Store. \u00a0It's a week night. \u00a0I've been running all day. \u00a0Dad just returned from a driving business trip. \u00a0He needs a nap. \u00a0I ask Blue to take a shower while dad is resting for 30 minutes. \u00a0He hasn't had one in a few days. \u00a0He's had one excuse after another.

{"date": "Sunday, April 29, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nWarning: This Post is in exercise in self-pity. \n \nI've been a really strange mood lately. \u00a0I want to be alone. \u00a0I don't want anyone talking to me because I'm afraid I may bite their head off. \u00a0I don't want anyone asking me any questions about what I'm doing...what I've been doing...what I'm supposed to be doing. \nYet, when I am alone I'm still not particularly happy.  \nI\u00a0am full of thoughts of self-doubt --constantly questioning my parenting decisions. \nI am feeling bad about what my kids are facing. \nFeeling guilty that the latest medicines that we are trying with Blue -are not working the way that I hoped they would. \n \nI am so happy with my blog and my  facebook \u00a0community. \u00a0I love the work that I am doing in helping others feel less alone. \u00a0But then I start looking at our financial situation and all of the things we can't do because I don't bring in an income, then I start with the guilt. \u00a0We are stuck in the small breaking-down, falling apart house, because we don't have a second income. \u00a0I am driving the 10 year-old car with all of the funny noises, because I haven't done anything to change that. \u00a0I am writing and doing what I love, but I can't brush away the thoughts of feelings of,  you need to get something published. \n You need to be making an income. \n What the hell happened to you? \n You used to be so independent!\u00a0 \n \nI start thinking about my friendships. \u00a0I am blessed to have a lifetime of friends all across the miles, from West Virginia, to California. \u00a0My best friend lives a few hours away in Houston. \u00a0I love her. \u00a0She is my sanctuary. Literally, she provides respite for me every couple of months. \u00a0She is the one person that can say anything to, without fear of judgement and she can do the same. \u00a0We can talk and text message every day with our most hideous, most ridiculous thoughts and feelings and then laugh and make jokes about them. Then days can go by with no contact, but I never doubt our friendship. \n \nI have extremely close friends in California where I grew up. \u00a0I have friends that I have known since I was in middle school, high school friends, friends from my early 20's and so on. \u00a0I am proud of these friendships...how no matter how much time goes by without contact, when we do talk or see each other, it's as if we just got together yesterday. \u00a0There is no animosity about the different directions our lives have taken and how little time we have to get together or call each other. \u00a0I love, value and treasure these friendships.  \n \nMost of my girlfriends from L.A. have at some point taken time out of their lives to come here and we have great visits together. \u00a0Or when I go there, we must see each other and our time together is just...like home, warm and familiar. \n \nThen I have my virtual friends. \u00a0I have developed some great friendships through blogging and facebook. \u00a0People who think about me...send me special notes of love and support. \u00a0People who make me smile on an almost daily basis. \u00a0Women who get EXACTLY where I'm coming from because they too are parents of kids with special needs. \u00a0I can make quick contact with them when it is convenient for me from my laptop or phone. \u00a0In fact, this ability has made it so convenient that I seldom actually have conversations on the phone. \u00a0When I do talk on the phone, I am almost always interrupted by one of my kids, my mother, my husband or even by another phone call...like from the school. \n \nI have somehow let my friendships with local friends dwindle down to next to nothing, \u00a0which I feel really guilty about. \u00a0I wonder if I've lost these friendships. \u00a0Living in Texas has been the only time in my life, where I have actually lost friendships and been disappointed by people who I believed were friends. Sometimes I wonder if it is connected to being a special needs parent. \u00a0Some people don't get-it...don't want to get it...get sick and tired of hearing about it. \n \nI have a group of friends I used to entertain all the time here at the house. \u00a0We would eat, drink, laugh and talk into all hours of the night. \u00a0At some point Blue would become extremely stressed out and ask me, \n\"When are they leaving? \u00a0It's time for everyone to go home so I can go to bed!\" \nAt which point, I would say, \"They aren't in your bedroom. \u00a0Your bedroom is upstairs. \u00a0Just go to bed.\" \n\"I can't!\" \n \nSo slowly the parties have slowed down. \u00a0The invitations have slowed down. \u00a0Lives have taken different directions. \u00a0Friends have had babies, which certainly changes the dynamic and trajectory of your life. \u00a0Others have been promoted on their jobs, family dynamics have changed where both spouses are now working outside the home, which means that time for friends and entertainment has changed. \n \nBut when I'm alone and in deep thought...I question myself. \n Did I do something or say something?\u00a0 \n What happened to our friendship? \n Why am I so paranoid? \n I'm a good friend...when I have time to be one. \n \nI am now taking care of my mother who is living with me. \u00a0Though she is only 72, and has relatively good health, \u00a0she still depends on me to help her take care of all personal business, take her to all of her appointments, both medical and otherwise, take her shopping and entertain her at least once a week. \u00a0Otherwise, she would never get out of the house. \u00a0This takes away from my time to get together with girlfriends. \n \nI am no longer going to workout on a regular basis, which means I don't see my Y -workout girlfriends as often. \u00a0We do get together every couple of months for lunch or coffee and catching up. \u00a0I joined another local recreation center, which is closer to home. \u00a0Yet, I can't seem to make it over there with any sense of regularity.  \n \nThe last time I had lunch with my workout girls, they asked me to come back to the Y to our Yoga and Zumba classes. \u00a0I really want to, but as summer approaches, I doubt seriously if I will have time to work out regularly. \n \nSo basically, \u00a0my life is totally out of balance and I have to figure out a way to somehow close some of these gaps and get my sh*t together. \u00a0All of this while the summer is approaching and I have to figure out ways to keep the boys busy and away from each other as much as possible. \u00a0I'm looking at camps, \u00a0therapists, social groups and vacations. \nOh yeah...and then there is the house and all of the many little projects that need to be done around here. \nIt all seems so impossible.  \nI guess I just have to make a list and try to do one-thing-at a time... \none-day at a time. \nI wonder how many days I have left where I can say that? \nLife is short and yet it seems to be going by so fast! \nIf only I wasn't such a scatter-brained, unorganized, discombobulated mess. \n \n Any advice? \u00a0I'm always dishing it out yet, I'm feeling like my own life is a mess.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DUNB4hg_hlo/T51yisWa0KI/AAAAAAAAAqg/8ZRDP9duBH0/s1600/images-10.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=tn_tnmn"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/04/dear-diary.html", "title": "\nDear Diary\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 25, 2012", "body": "\n \nEditorial note: The past few days have been an absolute circus. \u00a0So this post had to be put on the back burner while I tended to the never-ending needs of my family. \u00a0Finally here is Part 2 of this post \n \nBy fellow Confessions Mama -- Lelinda Faulk \n \n \n \n Accommodations \n \nAfter spending a great deal of time preparing for the IEP meeting which I wrote about in\u00a0 \"Surviving the IEP -Part 1\" ,\u00a0we came up with the following accommodations for my son. \u00a0Note: there are many other accommodations that may be appropriate for your child. \u00a0This is just a good example of a place to start. \n \n \n \n \n \nHe will have access to a fidget item for self-regulation, for tactile reminders, and visual prompts for when he becomes off task and unfocused or if he needs assistance with stemming. \n \n He will have shortened assignments and increased time to complete assignments\u00a0 \n daily assignments will be broken down into shorter two step tasks as appropriate with completion expectations tied to a rewards system (positive reinforcement) \n Implement a transitional warning schedule to help with the transition struggle from subjects, concepts, or assignments throughout the day.\u00a0 \n \n \nI was adamant about  proactive   not reactive communication  on a regular scheduled basis and as needed with myself, the general education teacher and the special education teacher. \n \n \n \n The teacher will send a chart home every day and meet with his special ed teacher every three weeks (if this isn\u2019t appropriate or the concept is brand new, request they meet more often.)\u00a0 \n Teachers cannot and should not use slang, sarcasm, or cycism when giving instruction, expectations or redirection.\u00a0 \n \nHe struggles with communication in the sense of being very literal and often interpreting words to the most common form.\u00a0Very literal request in the simplest form works wonders. \n \n \n \n He will keep a daily agenda book in place for homework (he will write down assignments using assistance of a peer partner, and it will reviewed by the teacher for completion.\u00a0 \n He will have verbal reminders to turn in assignments and a peer partner to assist with functionality throughout the day. The teacher is to closely monitor this relationship and adjust as needed. \n He will have a red card to place on his desk when further instruction or clarification is needed.\u00a0 \n He will have the opportunity to retake any assignments he fails after being retaught the material (His IQ is superior, there\u2019s no reason he shouldn\u2019t master elementary school)\u00a0 \n For standardized testing formal or informal he will take in a less stimulating environment\u00a0and have the opportunity to read the test to himself out loud along with have extra time. (Keep in mind if your child takes ANY modified versions of standardized test he will not be eligible for entry into a university directly after high school. \u00a0They may have to graduate on an alternative plan. \u00a0Depending on your plans, and your child\u2019s goals this is something to think about.\u00a0 \n Written assignments (short comprehension answers) he can verbally give answers to the teacher. \u00a0 \n On written short story or essay assignments he will have concrete topics or a concrete variation of the topics (instead of writing about love or friendship he will write about traits of a good friend or a biography on a person he loves) \n He will not participate in P.E. \u00a0He will obtain and meet his physical education requirement through outside Fitness. \n \n \n \nI think the most important part of the ARD is to  know your rights , and have an idea of some accommodations you\u2019d like to see or try. \u00a0Remember \u201cadvocate\u201d really means pester. \u00a0However, \u00a0you catch more flies with honey than vinegar, so you may have to play nice, yet insistent to get what you need for your child. If you\u2019re unsure...do not be afraid to ask for it. \u00a0The school may not be able to meet the specific accommodation but may come up with something comparable.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nCommunication should not stop with the ARD. \u00a0Keep speaking with your child's team\u00a0regularly.

{"date": "Thursday, March 1, 2012", "body": "\n \nThe following is an e-mail sent to my son's Special Education tracking teacher last night. \u00a0This is a great example of a day in the life of an Aspergers Mom. \u00a0The text in parenthesis are added for artistic effect. The names have been changed to protect the innocent: \n \n \n \n Lauren, \n \n \n \n \nI want to give you heads up. \u00a0We picked Blue up today after tutorials. \u00a0Red was in the car with the intention that we were going to get haircuts. \u00a0Perhaps I should have warned Blue about this. \u00a0He doesn't react well to the unexpected. \u00a0 (So there...it's all my fault -as usual.)\u00a0 \n \n \n \nBasically, we were right back where we left off this morning --him angry at Red for whatever misunderstandings they had yesterday, and still angry with me  (because...well -I'm his mother.)  \u00a0Red was actually trying to be loving and supportive, but nothing either of us could say was right.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe did not want to get a haircut because he wanted to do homework before his friend's band concert. \u00a0I insisted on the haircuts, because they were overdue. \u00a0( His head looked like...as my mother would say, \"a sheep's behind.\")  \u00a0This caused not what I would call meltdown with yelling and screaming but, \"Mom you're not being fare!\u00a0 \n \n\"I'm getting further and further behind in my work because of you!\"\u00a0 \n \n\"You won't let me do homework because you're making me get a haircut!\"\u00a0 \n \n \n\"I hate my life!\u00a0 \n \n That's why I want to just end-it!\" \n \n He went on to have a more specific conversation about why things would be better if he just were not here. \u00a0 \n \n \nOn our way home, Red actually told him how much we all love him, and don't want to here him talking like that. \u00a0Red explained the ramifications of saying such things, and how they can be taken especially at school. By the time we got home they hugged it out. \u00a0I hugged him too. \n \n \n \nLater, he went off to Ben's concert, and came home in much better spirits.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nFrom the research I have done, and consulting with other Aspergers mothers, ( from my blog and  \"Confessions\" Facebook Community ) \u00a0it is very common for our guys to fall-apart at home, when they do so well in school to hold it all together. \u00a0It takes a great deal of energy for them to navigate through the day. \u00a0It's like putting on a mask and doing a performance all day long. \u00a0He wants everyone there to be impressed by him and to like him. \u00a0When he gets home, the performance if over. \u00a0He lets go.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs the evening wheres on and we get close to bedtime...he's just done. \u00a0This is when I here, \n\"I'm such a bad person. \u00a0Everyone hates me. \u00a0I can't be a good family member. \u00a0I'm so stupid, etc.\" \u00a0 (I know...doesn't sound like Blue huh?) \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am walking on eggshells here. \u00a0I'm on the edge. \u00a0The homework battle is one I just can not fight right\u00a0 now, as we go through these medication changes. \u00a0I told him, I'm done with it. \u00a0He needs to get whatever he can done during the school day. \u00a0If can get something done at night, great! \u00a0If not...I can't fight about it, right now. \u00a0It's not worth it to me. \u00a0He needs to understand, we do math at home. \u00a0That's it! No APPS! No Science! NADA! \u00a0Maybe we make it just that black and white for the next few weeks. \u00a0We need to get him through this. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am praying that this med will work, but it could take a couple of weeks, and there are no guarantees of course. \u00a0I absolutely loathe this process.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am leaving town on Friday afternoon.

{"date": "Monday, March 5, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nHow can you write about being an Aspergers mom without addressing the issue of marriage...that is if you make it past diagnosis with your marriage still in tact. \u00a0A lot of men...just can't deal with the amount of time and attention that we as mothers have to spend taking care of \u00a0of the special needs child...and I have 2 of them. \u00a0Via this blog and in my internet autism community, I've met so many moms who have 3 or 4 kids with unique needs, so who am I complain right? \n \nMothering a special needs child ultimately takes time away from time that I would otherwise spend with selfish endeavors, like taking care of own personal needs, having a semblance of a career, \u00a0personal growth and even my own health. \u00a0It definitely takes away from time spent with my spouse. \u00a0After a full day of dealing with the boys, I am left feeling like,  'Hey...he is a grown-ass-man, he can take care of himself.'\u00a0 \nOr can he?  \n \n\"Is there any coffee?\" Which means, \"Can you bring me some coffee?\" \nThen there's \"Honey, what am I supposed to eat for lunch?\" he asks without even looking up from his computer, while tied to his phone on conference call after conference call, when he works at home during the day. \u00a0Seriously, sometimes this man will go all day long without feeding himself. \u00a0Not healthy...at all.  \nOr there's the late phone call from the office, \"Is there anything for dinner?\" \u00a0To which, sometimes reply, \"The kitchen is closed. \u00a0We ate 2 hours ago.\" \nSometimes I wonder if I have the sign \"Food Lady\" tattooed on my forehead. \nLord...don't let the man get sick! Then, I definitely have another child on my hands. \nAs the vows say, \"For better for worse\" right? \u00a0I did say that 18 years ago, who knew what it really meant?! \n \nLately, we are both so spent physically and emotionally from dealing with these boys, recovering from or avoiding meltdowns, refereeing the bickering and fighting. \u00a0Taking them here, there and everywhere. \u00a0There\u00a0isn't much energy left to put into taking care of our marriage. \u00a0We don't live in the most romantically, conducive setting with teens on the spectrum who knock quickly and burst through the bedroom door, and a mother-in-law in the house. \u00a0We can hardly watch a movie together un-interuppted, much less anything else without disturbance. \u00a0 (And I thought it would get easier as they got older!) \n \nMy husband puts a great deal of energy into his career and our personal finances. \u00a0That takes up a lot of his time. \u00a0Sometimes, I think he sees to it personally, that his job takes up  as much of his time as possible . \u00a0He often travels for business. \u00a0I think secretly, he LOVES these frequent get-aways. \u00a0I find myself resenting his freedom to travel regularly, spending evenings out dining on the companies dime, socializing with peers or simply coming back to an empty, quiet hotel room, with a door that he closes and locks, with no threat of anyone bursting through it. \u00a0Who wouldn't love that right? \n \nOther times, I'm glad he's gone. \u00a0It means one less person to take care of. \n \nWe have parenting style difference, to put it mildly. \u00a0He thinks I am a push-over, a softy, when it comes to discipline. \u00a0He believes that Red manipulates me on a regular basis, and that both boys take advantage of my kindness. \u00a0He's right to a degree. \u00a0I can admit that.  \n \nI feel like he doesn't get it. \u00a0He doesn't completely understand their disability. He doesn't have the time or energy to do the kind of reading and research, to attend every school meeting, \u00a0answer the phone calls from school, \u00a0read blogs, research medications, talk to doctors, nurses and therapists about what is going on with our boys. \u00a0He has the life experience of living with them, and his own experience of the way he was raised. \u00a0But is that really enough to raise these boys most effectively? \u00a0He gives these long round-about lectures. \u00a0He uses that \u00a0loud, abrasive, manly tone that sets them off and hurts their feelings. \u00a0Of course, he does not see it this way. \nHe is famous for saying, \"The world isn't going to give them any special treatment! \u00a0They may as well get used to it!\" \nThe other famous line is, \"I'm a man! Not a woman! \u00a0A father...not a mother! I will never be the same as you!\" \u00a0Well...that's for damn sure. \nI know there is a reason why God gave children 2 parents, to hopefully balance each other out. \u00a0I get that whole, \"The hard cold world scenario.\" However, I want peace in my house right now...today and I am willing to do whatever it takes have it. \u00a0Why constantly trigger them into full-meltdown to teach them a lesson about the cold-hard world?! \u00a0I just want some freakin' peace around here. Too often I am left playing the referee between them. \u00a0It's mentally exhausting and leaves me feeling frustrated and sometimes...resentful. \n \nThe way that I have been feeling lately is not conducive to a happy married life. \u00a0If we're not careful, the whole thing can unravel. \u00a0Fortunately, we are both in this for the long haul. \u00a0My husband is not the type to bail on his responsibilities, and neither am I. \u00a0Although I am sure that there are times when we both feel like it. \u00a0I'm the first to admit I dream about having another life. \u00a0A life of freedom and choice, where my time is my own. \u00a0Where the only person I have to take care of is myself. \u00a0I could live where I want to live, do what I want to do. \n \nI can tell that he is frustrated too. \u00a0Last week on Sunday afternoon, he disappeared for the \u00a0entire day and night. \u00a0He went in to the \"office\" to take care of some expense reports and some other \"business.\" \u00a0Problem is...he was gone from 1 p.m. until after 11 p.m. \u00a0No phone call...no text to say, \"I'm still alive.\" \u00a0Nothing!  \n \nAt first I just stewed and simmered, refusing to call him to see when he was coming home. \u00a0Dinner time came and went. \u00a0Helping with homework, refereeing, making sure showers were taken, medicine was dispensed...trying to ignore the hours passing, but starting to fume. By say, 11 p.m. I am livid! \u00a0I mean how nice to be able to disappear for the entire day, while I wrangle your children right? \n \nPart of me begins to worry. \u00a0Did he fall over and have a heart attack at the office. \u00a0No one is in the building. \u00a0It's secured and locked. \u00a0How would I know if he ever even made it there? \u00a0The truth is I don't really know where he is or if he's been in an accident.  \nFinally, I send a text. \u00a0\"Are you still alive?\" \u00a015, 20 minutes pass...no response. \u00a0Five minutes later, I think I here his car. \u00a0A few minutes later, he moseys on up the stairs taking his time. \u00a0He walks through the bedroom door without saying a word...as if this is acceptable! \u00a0Oh hell no! \n \nI light into him like a madwoman! \u00a0He probably thought he had wandered into the wrong house. \u00a0 Who is this crazy woman cursing like a sailor? And what did she do with my wife? \nHow dare him have me worrying like that!  \nI mean...fine you need to disappear for a while. \u00a0Don't we all? \nFine, you don't feel like talking to me. \u00a0That's o.k. too! \nBut how much trouble would it be to send a freakin' text message,\"still here @ the office.\" \n \nThe following day I receive flowers, a sincere apology and a beautiful card. \u00a0The sentiment of the message is this, 'We need to take some time for us, away from all of the things that get us down. \u00a0We need to re-charge our marriage and get back to the most important thing...our love.\" \n \nWe've all heard the analogy of a marriage being like a garden, you have to water it, get rid of the pests, pull out the weeds and make sure that your plants get plenty of sunlight and fertilzer. \u00a0 If you leave the garden unattended, your flowers will not blossom, and your plants will surely wither and die.  \n \nSoon we will be taking a short trip together. \u00a0We will leave our worries and our children behind. \u00a0Of course, I am worried about leaving them. \u00a0But I keep telling myself...as long as they're still alive when I get home, that's all that matters. \u00a0No, they may not be happy while I'm away. \u00a0But they're not happy when I 'm here anyway. \n \nWe have to water our garden, to nourish our marriage and ultimately our family. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ToS5fVilCYg/T1TkcDIch4I/AAAAAAAAAns/3al3PeSlge8/s1600/Unknown.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/03/watering-garden.html", "title": "\nWatering the Garden\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, March 15, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce upon a time in a life far-far away, a mother was able to leave her then 10 and 13 year-old sons at home alone, for a couple of hours. \u00a0A couple of pizzas, movies, and video games were enough to keep them occupied. \u00a0She would only be a phone call away on the cell. \u00a0The senior-citizen neighbors across the street would be available for emergencies. \u00a0If the 13 year-old (Red), was being too annoying to the 10 year-old (Blue), would simply go into the parents room, lock the door and watch t.v. in their bed until they returned home. \n \n \n \nFast forward to age 13 and 16, the boys have evolved into the mindset of testosterone charged, hormonal, teenage boys who have explosive personalities and zero patience for one another. \u00a0Both boys are on the autism spectrum as they've been all of their lives, only now this means that they can and will explode at any given moment when unexpected, annoying things happen. \u00a0They can hardly stand to be in the same house together without fighting about the smallest infractions.  \n \nMommy is sick with an annoying head cold, but her taxi duties are not alleviated just because she isn't feeling well. \u00a0She isn't given any sick days. \u00a0Her wicked mother (Nana) must get to her hair appointment at the local Barber & Beauty shop, which is about 10 minutes away.  \n \nThe 13 year-old boy has just awakened from a pleasant night of slumber. \u00a0He will not be ready in time to go with them today. \u00a0Mommy has decided to take the 16 year-old with her, so that he can get his hair cut, while Nana gets her hair done. \u00a0Therefore, not leaving the two boys together...in the house...alone. \n \nScratch the record....at the last minute, the 16-year-old boy decides that he has to go to the restroom and that he will be a while (if you know what I mean). \u00a0 He had been too busy farting around (pun intended), starring at the laptop for the past 20 minutes, to figure out that he needed to go to the bathroom before it was time to actually leave.  \nAt this point, there is only 10 minutes before Nana's appointment, and Nana absolutely hates to be even 2 minutes late. \u00a0Mommy decides to leave the 16-year-old boy in the bathroom taking care of his business. \u00a0She tells him, she will be back to get him, as she wants to ensure that Nana makes it there on time.  \nThis means that the boys will at home...together...alone, for approximately 20 minutes. \u00a0They are teenagers after all. \u00a0What's the worst that could happen? \n \nThe 13-year-old boy comes down the stairs to prepare his breakfast. \u00a0Suddenly, he realizes that he is not alone in the house. \u00a0His brother is in the restroom. \u00a0 Grea t! \u00a0I thought he was going with Mom!\u00a0 \n \nMoments later, the 16-year-old boy yells from the bathroom, \"Blue can you get the plunger? \u00a0The toilet is flooding again.\" \n Seems simple enough right?\u00a0 \n\"You are such an idiot! \u00a0You flooded the bathroom again!! \u00a0I'm not getting the plunger,\" screams the younger brother! \n\"But you have too get it!\" \n \nRigga ma ro and nonsense ensues.  \n \nBlue the 13-year-old, calls Mom on the cell. \u00a0He is yelling into the phone, not listening or letting her get a word in at all. \u00a0Not that Mommy has much of a voice. \u00a0She is sick remember? \u00a0Mommy hangs up the phone, not hearing much of what he said. \u00a0She is already heading towards home and will be there within 5 minutes.  \n \nWhen she arrives, she parks in front of the house, noticing the front door is open. \u00a0Faintly, she hears some one call, \"Mom\" from behind her. \u00a0It's Blue. \u00a0He is wearing no shoes, but has come from accross the street. \n\"May I speak to you for a minute?\" he asks her very sternly. \n\"I had to get out of here. \u00a0Why did you hang up on me?\" he continues \n\"You were not listening to me. \u00a0You were just yelling into the phone. \u00a0If you had been listening, you would have heard me say, that I was on my way home,\" she replies. \n\"Well...I had to get out of here! Red was trying to strangle me. \u00a0And I was going to call the police, but he wouldn't let me! \u00a0So I ran to our neighbors house!\" \n\"He what?! and you did What!?\"  \nShe listens a little further and the story doesn't make very much sense, which really isn't all that surprising. \n You all are fighting over the toilet plunger! \u00a0Seriously??? And it gets so intense that you have to run to a neighbors house??? \u00a0I've been gone for all of 20 minutes and it got this bad? \u00a0Really?? \u00a0What do I have here...two toddlers? \n \nAs time passes and tempers deminish...she gets a little closer to the real story.  \n \nAfter Blue started screaming, \"I'm not getting the plunger. \u00a0You're such an idiot, etc. \u00a0Red, comes out of the bathroom, pants down, flag-waving, (and by flag, you know what I mean) cursing at Blue. \u00a0 Blue starts calling mom and dad on the cell phones. He then threatens to call the police because Red is cursing and making crude comments. \u00a0 Red comes after him to try to take the phone away so that he will not actually call the police. \u00a0Red has an extreme fear of police officers. \n \n\"So when exactly did he try to strangle you? Well...he just, kind of, tried to grab the phone away from me.\" \n\"Can you show me how he did that?\" \u00a0He demonstrates what looks like Red grabbing around his body, trying to get the phone. \n\"Do you know what strangling is?\" Mom asks. \n\"Yes...it's like um, like...choking?\" \u00a0He demonstrates the choking motions. \n\"So did he ever put his hands on you like that?\" \n\"Well...um...no.\" \n\"But you just told our neighbor that he tried to strangle you.\" \n Our very nosey neighbor! \u00a0The one who likes to talk to everyone in the neighborhood and gossip! \u00a0You just basically accused your brother of a crime, in front of THIS neighbor of all people! \u00a0You couldn't have gone to Ms. C our nice neighbor. \u00a0You know, the one who has her own special needs child and would probably understand. \u00a0The one who minds her own business. \u00a0Nooo! You had to go to the loudest mouth, in-every-body's-business-neighbor! Great! \u00a0This just just absolutely, freakin-great! \n \n\"Well I meant RESTRAIN me, not strangle!\" \n \n 20 minutes! \u00a0Over a toilet plunger?! All of this because you couldn't possibly have gone to get the toilet plunger for your brother. \u00a0 You couldn't have walked away...gone back upstairs to your room, locked your door, called someone else you love and trust to explain the situation, because you were so offended because he flooded the toilet! \u00a0No...that would make too much sense! \n \nMind you...at this point, mama has not eaten an ounce of food, therefore, she has not taken any medicine for her cold. \u00a0Her head feels like it's been blown up like a balloon and is about to pop. \u00a0She is dizzy. \u00a0She has no voice, yet she has to referee this fight, without a whistle! \u00a0She is imagining the whole neighborhood talking about  those crazy people over there!  \u00a0That boy's a ticking time-bomb!  \n \nPatience is non-existent in this frame of mind. \u00a0So of course, she goes off in her own bit of rage saying some very unkind things to her children. \n \nHours later, we all apologize to each other when things have calmed down. \u00a0After Mom gathers herself and gets some food and medicine into her body, she actually laughs at the lunacy of this whole ordeal. Ha ha ha! \nThe boys go back to bugging the shit out of their mother about what they are going to do over the rest of Spring Break and whatever else they can think of. \u00a0 Little do they know, she plans on begging her doctor to check her into the hospital for a head-cold, so that she doesn't have to hear the words, \"So mom are you going to be better by Friday so we can go to Six Flags?\" \n \nLesson learned here: \nNo, you can not leave a 13 and 16-year-old brothers, with explosive personalities and anger issues, on the autism spectrum at home together, alone... not even for 20 minutes. \u00a0That is unless, you want the police to greet you when you return home. \n \nEditorial note: \nNow I will admit that in my youth, my brother and I did fight when my mother was not at home. \u00a0 He did give me Ex-lax and told me it was candy and teased me relentlessly. \u00a0 I did go after him with a steak knife, and ended up cutting my own finger instead of him.  \nHowever, the police were never called. \u00a0And no nosey neighbors became involved...EVER! Luckily the neighbors were full of even more drama than we ever had in our house. \nI just called my dad, long distance...as if he could actually do something about it...over the phone. \nSaid brother and sister now love each other madly. \u00a0That is now that they no longer live together and have their own maddening children.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UMp99SyTDns/T2IBhtcdQVI/AAAAAAAAAn8/44919r2UHL8/s1600/images-1.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/03/adventures-in-toilet-plunging.html", "title": "\nAdventures in Toilet Plunging\n"},

What happened to that fun, independent, social butterfly, life of the party, traveling-the-world, L.A. girl? \u00a0Where did she go?\" How did I end up here in the suburbs of Austin, Texas? \u00a0I don't even LIKE Texas!\u00a0(Sorry you Texas lovers). As it turns out,\u00a0I don't really like suburbs all that much. \u00a0I have to be honest. \u00a0I'm a city-girl at heart. \n \nWill she ever resurface? \u00a0Will I find her again? Or is she a complete gonner? Sayanara! Adios! Good-bye! \n \nEvery once in a while...she comes back to life. \u00a0A few years ago...she went to Italy and she really came alive. \u00a0Occasionally, she will take a trip to L.A....sans children and husband.\u00a0She will tread on old stomping grounds, party with with old friends and family. \u00a0She exhales with a knowing familiarity. \n \nI find her most often in my dreams. \u00a0 She is always in Los Angeles in these reveries. \u00a0She may be married, she may have children, but never...ever...is she in Texas. \n \nMy friend sent me a blessing today about creating a Bucket List which, doesn't necessarily have to be about places you'll go, or things you will do. \u00a0It can be about people you want to meet and spend time with creating lasting memories. \u00a0I would like to spend time with the real me again...not Karen, the mother, or the wife, but Karen the woman. \u00a0I think she will be really good company. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sDv-eneHNvY/TpxySfqfemI/AAAAAAAAAXM/xxCay_PeCH4/s1600/tuscany.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/10/looking-for-me.html", "title": "\nLooking for Me\n"},

Carry On.\" \u00a0 \n \n We now take you back to your regular programming. \u00a0 \n \n --My  Confessions Facebook  status yesterday.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nGood days are few and far between so I have to take note when they happen. \n \nBlue notices it too, \"This is a pretty good day,\" he says while eating his cone of vanilla frozen yogurt. \n\"No way! \nIs that possible? \nYou're having a good day with you OWN family!?\" I tease. \n \nI can't tell you how many times I've heard lately, \"I just can't be comfortable with this family. \u00a0Everyone is always fighting. I'm only happy when I'm with my friends.\" This is pretty typical teenage behavior. \u00a0Thank God for something normal in our life. \n \nOf course, he does not see that HE is one of the main ingredients in most of these arguments. \u00a0He has zero patience when it comes to his older brother's idiosyncrasies and behaviors. \u00a0He feels the need to constantly correct and attempt to parent him. \u00a0He usually can not stand to be corrected or redirected in any way from me. \u00a0He is quite often the one who is blowing a gasket and not doing anything to help create peace in our family.\u00a0But hey...this is not what this post is about. \n \nToday is a real go with the flow kind of day for all of us. \u00a0I go to the doctors office only for her to tell me what I already know, \"You have allergies combined with a minor upper respiratory infection. Keep drinking fluids, taking the meds you're taking and of course, get plenty of rest.\" HA HA! \nI\u00a0ask her if she can write me a prescription for a hotel room. \u00a0If she could...I know she would. \u00a0That's why I love her.  \nMy family insisted that I make an appointment to see my doctor, so I did. \u00a0Before I leave her office I say, \"At least we had this time together. \u00a0This might be the most pleasurable part of my day.\" She laughs because she knows my story. \u00a0She realizes that my children are at home, waiting me to instantly get well, so I can drive them all over town. \u00a0She recommends that I go get a book and a cup of coffee instead of going home. \n \nI take my time getting there, but when I finally do, I put some hot dogs on the grill for the boys lunch instead of going out to buy it, as Red wants me to do. \n\"I'll be glad to take you if you are willing to pay for it,\" I say. \n\"I can't spend MY money on food!\" \n\"Oh...I guess we better eat at home then.\" \n \nAt 4 p.m. Red has an appointment with someone he's selling something to through CraigsList. \u00a0I take both boys and the dog with me to Starbucks to meet this stranger. \u00a0I am actually very proud that Red created the ad with my approval, not listing any personal information. \u00a0He read all of the rules for selling, which at first he said were too hard to understand, but he got through it. \u00a0 And within a couple of days, he had a sale set up. \u00a0Everything goes very smoothly. \u00a0The middle-aged very decent looking man hands Red the 80 bucks. \u00a0Red hands him the box full of stuff and the guy goes on his merry way, with me taking note of his license plate, of course.  \n \nI have my mother to thank for my paranoia. \u00a0She says as we're walking out the door, \"I hope he doesn't stick a gun in your face or follow you home and rob you! \u00a0That's what they do in L.A. you know.\" \u00a0We have Harry our vicious Maltese with us just in case he turned out to be a serial killer. \u00a0Harry would lick him to death. \u00a0Funny, she didn't have anything negative to say when I bought her practically brand new day bed from CraigsList. \u00a0Or that lovely cherrywood armoire for her room. \n \nAfter the transaction goes smoothly, the boys both walk over to OfficeMax so Blue can buy a new mouse pad. \u00a0That's been on his list of things to buy for weeks now. \u00a0They go in alone, while I sit in the car playing Words With Friends. \u00a0Red actually gives his brother a few dollars to help him pay for his goods. This is followed by our trip to Baskin Robbins, where he buys his brother's ice-cream. \u00a0This is HUGE! \u00a0Red is usually terribly selfish when it comes to parting ways with his money. \u00a0His money is usually spent on things for himself...and no one else. Well, he doesn't mind paying for things for a friend, but family? \u00a0That's another story. \u00a0But not today! \n \nThe sun is shining at about 78 degrees on this spring day. \u00a0It couldn't be more lovely, that is unless we were in California, where there would be slightly less humidity. \u00a0But of course, the likelihood that we would have been robbed during our Craigslist transaction, would have been higher. \u00a0I guess life is full of tradeoffs.  \n \nWe sit outside at the a table eating our ice cream. \u00a0 I \u00a0enjoy the breeze while the boys take Harry for a little walk around the grassy area of the outdoor shopping center. \u00a0I can't help but think, 'Wow...my boys, eating ice-cream, going for a walk... together. \u00a0This is a precious moment...one to be savored.' \n \nWhat a difference a day makes.  \n \nEditorial Note: Make sure you read yesterday's post:\u00a0 Adventures In Toilet Plunging . \u00a0You'll see \u00a0exacly what I mean by \"What a difference a day makes.\" It is a stark contrast from today.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=tn_tnmn", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-k-ojGTq3XzM/T2KmPumkUBI/AAAAAAAAAoE/dEfH2HlCuiQ/s1600/Unknown.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/03/31-flavors.html", "title": "\n31 Flavors\n"},

We vow to spend one on one time together, at least 2 to 3 times per week. \u00a0We have to take time for one another, put down the laptop, stop working so much, and make time for us as a couple. \u00a0Otherwise, we become roommates who are co-exhisting for the purposes of raising these high-maintenance children. \n \nI am look forward to returning home, liking and loving each other again, \u00a0spending time together, working on the same team, being a united front, instead of having our own resentments and battles in the background. \u00a0Being a couple, not just parents. \n \nWe leave Las Vegas, united, connected, resolved to make our marriage a priority. \u00a0I'm feeling like I got to spend time with my boyfriend again. \u00a0 It is absolutely, awesome. \n \nCut to the following day, we return home...I am sick. \u00a0My head is full of congestion. \u00a0I have shortness of breath, chills, sore throat, coughing, watery eyes, the whole nine-yards. I need rest. \u00a0The kids are on Spring Break and want to be entertained, driven here there and everywhere. \u00a0They want company over at the house. Work for hubby has piled up from being at the conference the week before so he is working like crazy. \u00a0Basically, the reality of life slaps us in the face...big time.  \n \nWe make it through the week on a wing and a prayer. \u00a0On the weekend, hubby is working on upgrading and fixing the boys computers. \u00a0He takes them out for some guy time, which I appreciate. \u00a0They even meet our eldest son, Slim Shady, and all have dinner together at Red's favorite restaurant. \u00a0Afterward they all go to the electronics store where Red ends up having a meltdown and then brings it home with him. \u00a0 Thanks Dad for all you've done for me...I hope you didn't think I would actually show you any appreciation . \n \nWe have not had more than a few minutes time together since we've been home. \u00a0I think maybe we watched a little t.v. together one night. \u00a0That's it! \u00a0So much for the vows, the resolve, the promises to make changes. \u00a0I pray that we will get back to that, now that I am well, and the kids are back to school from Spring Break.  \n \nThe good news is...we have been more loving, kind, and patient with one another and with the kids since we've been home. \u00a0We have been working on the same team. \u00a0And at least we know, that 18 years later, we've still got it. \u00a0That we are indeed two people who love and respect one another. \u00a0We do still enjoy each others company. \u00a0Minus the stress of raising special needs children, he is still the wonderful man that I married. \u00a0And he still has a pretty hot girlfriend! Ha ha! \n \nI already miss my boyfriend and the feeling of freedom we had in Las Vegas. \u00a0What happened in Vegas didn't stay there. \u00a0We brought the love back home. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rRxMNBsW2Rc/T2i3Tdum3pI/AAAAAAAAAog/z_yLVzoQVeI/s1600/424544_2792814109299_1526808632_1799942_1272532232_n.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5fsJKJaGMdU/T2i2pp6yxVI/AAAAAAAAAoY/GKkjwtOEZaY/s1600/424025_2792797268878_1526808632_1799935_841354803_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/03/leaving-las-vegas.html", "title": "\nLeaving Las Vegas\n"},

But I guess, either the connection is there, or it's not. \u00a0Some people you like, but you don't totally connect with, some people you just naturally feel close to. \u00a0True friendship can not be forced, especially in the teen years, and especially with an Aspie. \u00a0There is no such thing as pretense. \n \nWhen I say to him, \"Blue, Benj has plans already. \u00a0Do you think maybe you're putting him on the spot by inviting yourself?\" \u00a0I get the, \"Mom! Why are you in my business?\" \n \n\"Excuse me, but it is my job as your mother to help teach you social skills.\" \u00a0I don't want his best friend to end up feeling the same way about Blue, that he felt about the other boy a few weeks ago. \u00a0Like,  wow...Blue is inviting himself over again! I don't want to hurt his feelings, so I better say yes. \nOf course, Blue does not want to here this, especially from me. \u00a0 What do I know anyway?  \u00a0He hates to be corrected or redirected...especially, by me. \n \n\"I'm trying to be independent, making my own plans after school,\" he says. \u00a0I can get with that. \u00a0That's great. \u00a0He has always been independent. \u00a0He will get on the phone in a heartbeat and make social plans, which is more than I can say for his 16 year-old brother. \u00a0Red is just now getting the hang of this socially independent skill.  \n \nIt turns out, that Benji is fine with having Blue come over. \u00a0At least that's what he says. \u00a0Of course, he has to ask his parents first.  \u00a0(A step, that Blue often overlooks in his quest for independence.)  \u00a0Benji steps out of the car to go ask his dad if it's o.k. that both friends come over. \u00a0This is when Blue and I are have the conversation about being socially appropriate. \u00a0By the time Benji comes back with his father's approval of the plans, Blue is too unhappy with me. \u00a0He no longer wants to stay. \u00a0He tells Benji that he may come back later, after he cools down and has a snack. \n \nOnce we get home, I realize that Blue is actually really tired. \u00a0He was up late the night before. \u00a0Several nights recently, he hasn't slept well because of thunder storms. \u00a0What he really needs is to come home, have a snack and decompress...alone. \u00a0He plays a race driving game on his newly upgraded PC, has an early dinner, does a little homework and totally forgets about hanging out with his friend. \u00a0He is in bed by 9 p.m. and wakes up with a much better disposition the following morning. \n \nHaving Mom up in his business, turns out to be a good thing.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-f_nsrV2hvq4/T2yN4_oAruI/AAAAAAAAAoo/_JnpTECFAFM/s1600/images-1.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/03/up-in-my-business.html", "title": "\nUp in My Business\n"},

Blow to the gut. \u00a0Heart sinking in to the depths of the ocean.  \u00a0These are words a mother never wants to hear coming out of the mouth of her child. \u00a0I know within my heart that he doesn't really want to end his life, but he wants to end his pain. \u00a0And he wants me to understand the depth of his pain. \n \nBefore we can get out of the car...here comes Red. \u00a0He couldn't wait for me to come into the house to start moaning and complaining. \u00a0I stop him in his tracks. \u00a0\"Look...your brother is feeling pretty bad right now. \u00a0I need you to go back into the house and let me deal with him, and when we come in, I need you not to agitate him and set him off. \u00a0I don't want him to end up in the hospital. \u00a0He's feeling that bad.\" \n \nOf course I get ninety questions before he actually backs off and goes into the house. \n \nI call the Neurologist who is currently prescribing his medication. \u00a0He suggest that I get him to see his Psychiatrist, or take him to the local pediatric Mental Hospital. \u00a0I am so not even trying to here this. \u00a0That place is horrid! \u00a0I had to place Red there once and I vowed never to go back there. \u00a0I don't care if I have to drive a country mile to find somewhere else for help. \n \nBlue can hear my conversation with his doctor. \u00a0He notes the serious possibility of him having to go to the hospital. \u00a0He doesn't want to go there. \u00a0I make an appointment for him to see his Psychiatrist the following day. \u00a0Meanwhile we all treat him with kit gloves doing everything we can to keep him relaxed. \u00a0I don't leave him alone at all. \u00a0Before bed, I have dad rub his back with a GABA calming cream and lavender essential oil. \u00a0We make sure he goes to bed early. \u00a0Having good rest is really important for his mood. \n \nMeanwhile, I am trying to keep Red from ranting about becoming a Professional Videographer. \u00a0He is reading all kinds of information on the internet and comes up with the ridiculous notion that he needs a $15,000. camera to make this all happen. \u00a0A friend of the family has asked him to do amateur video of a small wedding. \u00a0He thinks he can't do it without a professional camera (which he would probably have no idea how to use). \u00a0I have to explain the impracticality of his request while trying to keep him from amping up and disturbing his brother who is already off to bed. \n \nTo prove his point he begins to read to me and his father a good 3 paragraphs of technical writing in support of his need for professional equipment. \u00a0He reads it so eloquently with such fluency, I'm a little taken a back. \u00a0This is the boy who says, \"I can't read! It's too hard!\" \u00a0So when he finishes reading, I stop him dead in his tracks and say, \"Hey! Is that YOU? \u00a0Reading all of that technical information so quickly and easily without making any mistakes? \u00a0So you can read!!!\" \u00a0And with that ....we all give him a round of applause and a standing ovation.  \nHe can't do anything but smile. \u00a0And thank God...he shuts up for the rest of the night! \n \nI crawl into bed, feeling a little sorry for myself, for my children, for our crazy life in this house of insanity. \u00a0I have a glass of wine or 2 as I browse through Facebook and read a couple of blogs that I follow.  \nMy friend Scotty ( John Scott Holman ), a fellow writer and Aspie, writes about being homeless right now and his father taking advantage of him, stealing his money and refusing to pay it back. \n \nI read a blog by my friend Rhonda, of \u00a0 Pugariffic -\"I Hate Autism\"  \u00a0who has a 17 year-old son with autism who is pretty big and strong, a gentle-giant until he looses it, has a meltdown and rages, he physically hurts her, but she refuses to put him in a group home or Residential Treatment because of the barbaric conditions there. \n \nThen I read about my friend Laurie @\u00a0 Adopting Special Needs -There is no Calvary . \u00a0She writes about her adopted daughter 8 year-old Hope who has PTSD, among other things, and rages at any given moment, biting, kicking scratching and hurting her mother because she forgot her pencil in the car. \u00a0She writes how she may have to be placed in a Residential Treatment Facility so that she can no longer hurt the members of her family, all because some sicko physically and sexually abused her when she was younger.  \n \nBefore I close my eyes I am praying for my bloggy autism friends, and my  \"Confessions\" Facebook Community  asking God to continue to give them strength to endure the insanity that we are living through. \u00a0I pray also for my own children, and suddenly realize, my Insanity-ville is not as bad as many others. \u00a0My autism is not your autism. \u00a0It's still hurts when my child is in pain and I can't do anything to magically take it all away. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DNnSJ3merk8/T3XOw5IIw6I/AAAAAAAAAow/3z-l7h5cHu8/s1600/images-3.jpeg", "http://www.facebook.com/JScottHolman?ref=ts", "http://pugariffic.blogspot.com/2012/03/i-hate-autism.html", "http://adoptivefamilyno2.blogspot.com/2012/03/there-is-no-cavalry.html", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=tn_tnmn"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/03/living-in-insanity-ville.html", "title": "\nLiving in Insanity-ville\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2012", "body": "\n \nEditorial Note: \u00a0 This is a revised post that I wrote in September 2010. \u00a0I post it today because of a heated discussion on the decision to medicate on my\u00a0 \"Confessions\" Facebook Community Page \u00a0last night. \u00a0The decision to medicate your child is an agonizing one. \u00a0When you feel like your back is against the wall, and you physically feel the pain that your child is going through, you do whatever you can to make things better. \u00a0I loathe the trial and error process of finding what works. \u00a0But we did find something that made my son's 1st year in middle school successful and happy. \u00a0Now half-way into his 7th grade year, we find ourselves challenged agin with his overwhelming anxiety which leads to depression. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n Unfortunately, \u00a0today we are back to the drawing board. It is my hope that people don't judge other parents for what the choose to do with this heart wrenching decision. \u00a0Personally, I don't really care about judgement. \u00a0If I did...I would never have written my first post on this blog. \u00a0I do what I have to do to help my children, to educate others about our journey, and to help parents of children on the spectrum feel less alone. \n \n Here you go... \n \nSeptember, 2010 \n \nI haven't written much about little boy Blue lately.\u00a0 The truth is, what has been going on is extremely personal and so painful it's difficult to put down in words.\u00a0 It's bad enough that the thoughts and feelings have been swimming around in my head and weighing on my heart.\u00a0 However -if our journey can help someone, it will not have been in vain.\u00a0 This is our story... \n \nBlue has always been my easy child, even though he isn't really easy. I've seen people with \"easy\" children and sad to say, sometimes, I envy them.\u00a0 Blue is unique. He is special.\u00a0 He is a brilliant, deep thinker, who asks\u00a0 questions that I would never think of, much less be able to answer.\u00a0 Even when I do, he tells me that I am wrong.\u00a0 Those \"easy\", ordinary children may be easier to parent, but will they grow up and make the world a better place? Perhaps. My son's brilliant mind, and out-of-box thinking will serve him well in his future.\u00a0 I just have to make sure he makes it there.  \n \nHe has always been challenging, but in comparison to how difficult his brother is to raise, he is a breath of fresh air.\u00a0 He has a good heart, with compassion for others.\u00a0 He is thoughtful -remembering my favorite flowers and making sure that his father would take him out to get them on my birthday.\u00a0 His brother won't even sing \"Happy Birthday\" to me, make or buy me a card unless coerced.\u00a0 Blue comes downstairs on Saturday and Sunday and asks everyone what they would like for breakfast.\u00a0 He starts making homemade waffles or pancakes, whether we want them or not.\u00a0 I love that he wants to cook.\u00a0 I would just rather not deal with the mess.  \n \nIn the past six to 12 months however, this sweet kid can quickly turn into a little venom spitting little monster.\u00a0 That lovely breakfast he's preparing can turn into a meltdown over when to make the eggs.\u00a0 \"You guys think I'm stupid! I don't know anything! Just forget it! I'm not eating! I'm not cooking! Just leave me alone!\u00a0 This is all your fault!\" \n \nHe absolutely loathes the very sight and definitely the sound of his brother.\u00a0 His mere presence in the room can lead to screaming, hitting, and arguing.\u00a0 He has to put on ear plugs so that he doesn't have to hear him chewing, singing or breathing.\u00a0 He wants to control his brother's every move.\u00a0 He doesn't want him \"eating up all of our food!\" He doesn't want him to bite his nails. Typical sibling issues turn into knock down drag out fights, where it's literally like David vs. Goliath, but Blue is so angry that he doesn't care how big Goliath is.\u00a0 He will go up and just whack, punch or kick him, not thinking about what the ramifications could be of attacking someone twice his size, who is also not exactly known for his self-control. We haven't been able to do things as an entire family lately.\u00a0 If we do it's definitely not going to be fun.\u00a0 In fact, we took separate vacations this summer.\u00a0 It just seemed like such a waste of money to go on vacation to have a horrible time. \u00a0\u00a0  \n \nHis tears have been infinite.\u00a0 His anxiety is like an overgrown garden full of weeds.\u00a0 The fear of storms is off the charts.\u00a0 It has become impairing to the point of his not wanting to leave the house for days on end.\u00a0 He is\u00a0 hiding out in his safe-place at the least little threat of showers.\u00a0 There are days he's hiding when the sun is shining.\u00a0  \n \nWe have tried our best to avoid going down the road of medication, but it was becoming very apparent that he could not manage his emotions and anxiety on his own.\u00a0 He is so bright and imaginative, I think my husband feared that somehow his personality would be impacted. \u00a0 There is always a fear and stigma in the back of our minds when it comes to mental health medications.\u00a0 We want to believe that we are strong enough or smart enough to conquer our own problems.\u00a0 The truth is that it is medicine indicates illness.\u00a0 We don't hesitate to treat any physical illness our children have.\u00a0 Why do we hesitate to treat illness of the mind or chemical imbalances? I don't why there is this reticence, but I know that it's there.\u00a0 However when your child in such pain and agony, you feel like you have to do whatever you can to help them. \n \nBlue was evaluated and it was determined that the best option for him would be a low dosage of Zoloft.\u00a0 It is supposed to help with the mood, the anxiety, and obsessiveness that is typical of a child with Aspergers.\u00a0 It was also suggested that we try something else to help him with agitation.\u00a0 I opted out of starting with two medicines.\u00a0 I wanted to go with the one to see how that would help or not.\u00a0 It was a hard enough decision to have him taking anything at all.\u00a0 They did suggest that I keep a close eye on him when he started taking it to ensure that there was no suicidal ideation.\u00a0  \n \n \nI had plans to go away for the weekend with my husband.\u00a0 We had not been connecting lately.\u00a0 Stress levels in our house were palpable. I had been terribly depressed by watching my sweet child unravel before my eyes while feeling helpless to help him.\u00a0 I was walking on egg shells trying not to piss him off.\u00a0 I was constantly on call for breaking up a fight.\u00a0 I was physically and mentally drained.\u00a0 I needed this trip!\u00a0 I informed the doctor of my impending travel plans.\u00a0 She suggested that we wait until I returned to start the med. \n \nWednesday night I had a conversation with the boys about expectations for behavior while I am away.\u00a0 Thursday morning, they actually sent me off with a bang.\u00a0 They were talking to each other and getting along great.\u00a0 I felt good about leaving.\u00a0 That is until I got the phone call... \n \nThe sun was shining as the van pulled into the airport.\u00a0 I was feeling about ten pounds lighter as I walked through the airport doors -and then the cell phone rings.\u00a0 It's the middle school.\u00a0 Blue is in the office with the school Psychologist because of a paper he has written which says he feels like his life is so horrible he wants to end it. Pow! Punch to the stomach.\u00a0 The wind in my sails stopped blowing, the air was still.\u00a0 My heart is pounding like I just ran a mile, minus the endorphins.\u00a0 I'm standing there like a deer in the headlights in front of security.\u00a0  How can I possibly go through and get on a plane? \n \n\"Mrs. W., we've spoken to Blue and he is not backing down about how he is feeling.\u00a0 At this point we are thinking we need to call the county mental health evaluation team to assess him, to see if he needs to go to the hospital.\u00a0  What the hell? He was fine when he said good bye this morning?\u00a0  Suddenly, I remembered, the evaluation process the previous week.\u00a0 They had asked him some very pointed questions about self-harm. He admitted that in anger he has said, \"I just want to kill myself!\"\u00a0 I always thought it was dramatic\u00a0 imitation of his brother who has shouted such things in the past.\u00a0 In my gut, I knew that neither of them really wanted to hurt themselves.\u00a0 They were in pain and felt helpless.\u00a0 It was a way to express how much pain they were feeling.\u00a0 It seemed to me that those pointed questions got him to seriously thinking about ending his life.  \n \nI talked to him over the phone and express to him how much \u00a0I love him -how much his entire family loves him.\u00a0 I remind him of the support he has there at school -how smart he is and how impressed his teachers are with him.\u00a0 \"I know that you're feeling really down right now, but I promise you things will get better.\u00a0 We are going to try that new medicine next week, and it will help you feel better.\u00a0 In the mean time tell me what you need to get you through the day?\u00a0 Would you like to stay with your support teacher in her room today?\"\u00a0 I reminded him of the great weekend he had planned with his best friend -giving him something to look forward to.  \n \nIt takes some work, but after thirty-minute exchange, he seems to feel better and more optimistic.\u00a0 Together, we come up with a plan to get through the day and through the weekend.\u00a0\u00a0 It was still difficult to go get on that plane.\u00a0 My heart was definitely pulled toward home and my son.\u00a0 At the same time, my husband and I so needed to reconnect, and I needed to rejuvenate, before I lost what is left what is left of my own sanity.\u00a0 \nI am a woman on the edge.\u00a0 Like my son's favorite group Linkin Park, sings, \"Everything you say to me, pushes me one step closer to the edge and I'm about to break!\" I have to take care of myself in order to take care of my boys.\u00a0 I also have to take care of my marriage so that my husband and I can work together to parent them as a team.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n \nI left him in the hands of my capable mother who supported him through a difficult few days.\u00a0 I knew that she wouldn't let anything happen to him.\u00a0 I called constantly to check on him -never receiving any positive news, but he was surviving.\u00a0 My heart ached for him.\u00a0 He passed on the opportunity to go spend the night  with his best friend because of the possibility of inclement  weather.\u00a0 He then became angry with my mom and himself  because he felt sad, lonely and isolated.\u00a0 He felt awful about himself  for letting the anxiety control him. I prayed for him incessantly and we both made it through. \n \nOn Sunday our flight was canceled, then another one was delayed.\u00a0 By the time we made it to Dallas, there were no more flights coming to Austin.\u00a0 There was no way I wasn't going to be there when he woke up Monday morning.\u00a0 We rented a car and drove three hours to make it home by 1:30 a.m.\u00a0 We started the Zoloft that morning as planned, and though it supposed to take time to build up in his system, he seemed to be in a better mood when he got home Monday afternoon. \n \nI am ambivalent, optimistic and hopeful. One thing I know for sure...this boy is special beyond measure. As I've heard Oprah say many times, \"His future is so bright it burns my eyes.\" \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=tn_tnmn"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/09/to-med-or-not-to-med-that-is-question.html", "title": "\nTo Med or Not to Med -That is the Question (Redeuax)\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 14, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n\"It's a cold, wintery weekend here in Austin. \u00a0Absolutely perfect weather for napping, snuggling, eating comfort food, watching movies and reading. \u00a0If only I had a family who actually enjoys spending time together.\"  \nThis was my FB status on Sunday. \u00a0I know...funny right? \u00a0Funny, sad and true. \n \nI am this romantic person lost inside of this unromantic life, with these unromantic boys that I live with. \u00a0And for this weekend's purposes...I\"m going to lump my husband into the unromantic category. \u00a0Lucky for him, he has his romantic moments and is generally a wonderful guy. But we all know that no marriage is perfect and we all have an ugly side. \u00a0I am the lucky person who gets to see his, and he gets to see mine...more often than not lately. \u00a0When you live in a stressful environment, sometimes it's hard to be all lovey-dovey and nice. \n \nSaturday is peaceful for the most part. \u00a0I spend most of the day in my pajamas. \u00a0Aspergers Dad takes the boys out to dinner and to Best Buy to look around. \u00a0Blue wants to window shop for his birthday, which is coming up this week. \u00a0 I literally scream hallelujah as I lock the door behind them. \n \nIn the quiet, I get online to play Words With Friends on Facebook. \u00a0Unfortunately, I read the news about the death of Whitney Houston. \u00a0My heart is heavy because of this loss. \u00a0Another great artist who pays the price of high art with her life. \u00a0What is it about the greatest singers in the world that makes them succumb to a life of drugs? \u00a0It's so sad.  \n \nI think of all of the songs of hers that I loved at different times in my life. \u00a0I remember that first video I saw on MTV of her in the blond wig. \u00a0I have the fleeting thought of the \u00a0the boyfriend I was with at the time. \u00a0I think of how sexy I thought she was with Kevin Costner in the Body Guard. \u00a0And \"I will always love you\" was just --epic. \u00a0I think of her during that sad time around 2005, when she did the reality show with her husband, \"Being Bobby Brown.\" \u00a0\"Bobby!\" she would call him in her very street, round-the-way-girl voice. \u00a0We got to see how much she and Bobby really were alike despite the image we had previously been sold.  \n \nNevertheless, her voice was undeniable! \u00a0Her talent, larger than life. \u00a0I was pulling for her in her last \"come back\" album. \u00a0Thrilled to see her in her last interview with Oprah. \u00a0I was hopeful for her...and now saddened by her death. \n \nSunday morning we have a wintery mix of rain, sleet and a few snow flurries. \u00a0I am so thankful that there is food in the house and I don't have to leave. \u00a0My mom has plans to cook dinner for us. Awesome! \u00a0I plan to do laundry and relax.  \u00a0(Yeah...right. \u00a0These people I live trampled all over every last inch of my nerves all day long.) \u00a0 \n \nBlue has become this angry teenager, who disagrees with every word I say. \u00a0He hates to be \"bossed around\" as he says by me. \u00a0Well...excuse the hell out of me for being your mother! \u00a0Red is doing better but he's talking pretty much non-stop. \u00a0You can't shut him up. \u00a0I'm trying to relax downstairs watching my trashy t.v. and suddenly everyone is hungry.  \n \n\"What's for lunch?\" \n\"There's nothing to eat here! \u00a0Well...there's nothing I want.\"  \nI offer a myriad of choices. \u00a0None of it is good enough. \u00a0Blue tries to make lunch so complicated that I just want to scream. \u00a0It's like he tries to see how far he can push me. \u00a0I don't think he's manipulative. \u00a0He just wants things HIS way and hates to be told no.  \n \nWhen I do make Blue and Asperger Dad lunch...they come downstairs and start complaining about what I'm watching on t.v. \u00a0Blue tells me how inappropriate everything is and his father is giving me \"the look.\" \u00a0I call it the Big Pappa look of disapproval.  \u00a0(I have a father baby, and you are not him!)\u00a0 \n \nI turn the television off. \u00a0 I'm pissed! Wasn't I here first? \u00a0I just made lunch for you two and now you're complaining about what I'm watching on t.v. \u00a0You're welcome very much! \n \nI go upstairs to my room. \u00a0Red is in my room watching some loud irritating show. \u00a0He got rid of the t.v. in his own room in one of his minimalist purges. \u00a0His t.v. wasn't good enough because it wasn't an HD 1080p, flatscreen. \u00a0This is just great! \n \nThere is no escape! \u00a0To make it worse...I have no wine in the house!  \n \nLater in the evening, I have to have to help Blue get through a novel for school. \u00a0He loathes this novel and it's violent themes. \u00a0\"The Hunger Games\" is assigned reading for his language arts class. \u00a0I find extreme irony in the fact that our school district gives parents and \"opt out\" to watch the President of the United States addressing children, to encourage them to work hard in school. \u00a0Yet, they assign reading to 7th graders with violent themes. \u00a0Where's the \"opt out\" for that?  \n \nOf course, I am the lucky recipient of his loathing of this assignment. \u00a0Although I am trying to help him, he is talking to me as if I assigned the novel myself. \u00a0 Everything is my fault. \u00a0To top it all off, my mother chimes in taking issue with the way that he is talking to me. \u00a0She lets him know, in no uncertain terms, that he is being disrespectful to her daughter. \u00a0This sends him over the edge. \u00a0I have to corral him up to his room and calm him down. \u00a0 Thanks Mom! I really appreciate your help. \n \nIt's a sad state of affairs when you start to get used to hearing your children saying things like, \"I just want to end my life, because this homework is really stressing me out. \u00a0I'm such a bad person because I take it all out on you.\"  \n \nWe talk through it. \u00a0I assure him, that I love him. \u00a0At the end of the day, no matter what has happened we end with, \"I love you.\" \u00a0That's all that matters. \u00a0He agrees. \u00a0We get through the assignment and hug it out as I tuck him for bed. \u00a0 (This is actually the best part of my day.) \n \nBy the time they all go to bed I self-medicate with a brownie and 2 ounces of milk. \u00a0 I'm not speaking to my husband or my mother. \u00a0I've had run-ins with both of them.  \n \nOh yeah...It's a Wonderful Life! \n \n \n \nHappy Love Day!

{"date": "Thursday, February 16, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nHe ran away again. \u00a0This time he is pretty serious --running out the door with nothing but socks on his feet, daring me to follow him. \u00a0I usually just let him run. \u00a0Isn't that sad to say, \"usually\" in reference to your child running away from home. \u00a0Usually, he runs around the block --sometimes to the corner store to buy some sugar to soothe his nerves. \u00a0By sugar I mean, soda, candy, cookies, ice-cream ...you know teen-age comfort food. \n \nThis time he just runs. \u00a0Cell phone in pocket ...he calls his best friend's mom and asks her can he come to her house, which is a few blocks away. \u00a0He requests that she please not tell me. \u00a0She tells him that he is welcome to come, but she has to let me know where he is. \u00a0He agrees.  \n \nI'm glad that he has somewhere to go when he needs to get away from us. \u00a0I'm happy that he has friends that he can trust and feels comfortable enough with to share the not so pretty side of himself and our crazy life. \n \nShe calls me, and I explain the reason that he is so upset. \u00a0It's anxiety over his birthday. \u00a0He set up this unrealistic expectation for what he wants as a gift. \u00a0When I told him that wasn't going to happen...he was shocked \u00a0--appalled even.  \n\"But that's the ONLY thing that I want! \u00a0There is nothing else! \u00a0You just ruined by birthday! \u00a0My birthday is going to be terrible!\"  \nThis is typical black and white thought. \u00a0It seems to be developing into a trend that we must break. \u00a0This making of lists of these exorbitant gifts that he wants for a given occasion. \u00a0We have to squash it. \u00a0How? Is the question. \u00a0Very carefully is the answer. \n \nIn past years on his birthday, I've been lost as to what to get him since it's so close behind Christmas. \u00a0There was never a \u00a0list. \u00a0He is usually grateful just to go out or have friends over for his birthday. \u00a0It \u00a0all about the celebration of him...not the gifts. \u00a0Now he gets all amped up about what he thinks he has to have! \n \nI ask his best friend's mom to please talk to him about this unrealistic expectation. \u00a0He loves her. \u00a0He thinks that she is a walking angel. \u00a0He will listen to her much easier than he will ever listen to me. \u00a0After all...I am the oppressor! \n \nThey have a nice chat. \u00a0I give him an hour to cool down. I think about packing his suitcase so he can go ahead and move-in over there, since this is such a horrible place. \u00a0Instead, I just bring him a pair of shoes to put on. \u00a0When I walk through the door, he is very apologetic. \"I'm sorry Mom. \u00a0I just had a bad reaction. \u00a0I didn't know better. \u00a0I know I'm going to have a good birthday no matter what.\" \u00a0He hugs me with sincerity. \u00a0 \n \nWhen we get back home, he is actually afraid to apologize to his dad...afraid that he may not forgive him. \u00a0He actually starts tearing up again. \u00a0When his dad enters the room, he leaves the room. \u00a0He comes to me and says, \"I'm scared.\" \u00a0I assure him that it will be o.k.  \n \nSometimes, dad is still shocked by their autistic behaviors. \u00a0He expects a typical reaction from them. \u00a0He has that old-school mentality. \u00a0\"These kids are so un-grateful!\" \u00a0He says angrily.  \n \nThe kids are frustrating and often their reactions are inappropriate, blunt, and appear disrespectful. \u00a0It's our job to guide and reshape their thinking. \u00a0They may have that initially shocking behavior. \u00a0They may over-react to something that happens that they did not expect or that they do not like. \u00a0The way we have to handle it is by addressing it when they are calm and rational. \u00a0Yelling at them or even talking to them sternly when they are upset makes them react with\"fight or flight.\" They definitely will not absorb the lesson when they are in that stage of irrational thought. \n \nBlue especially, is always receptive of learning the lesson once he has calmed down. \u00a0He always feels so bad after the fact. \"I'm such a bad person,\" he will say. \u00a0Sometimes, \u00a0dad tends to forget that. \u00a0He reacts like, \"How dare him! \u00a0Or Are you kidding me!?\" \u00a0He wants to correct them on the spot, when they are spinning up, which makes them spin up more or ...run away. \u00a0And there I am in the middle, playing referee.  \n \nIt's frustrating to me that all these years later, I am still explaining Aspergers to their father. \u00a0He gets it intellectually however, caught up in the moment of their behavior, he wants to react with logic. \u00a0You can't always be logical, in an illogical situation or rational, when the child is caught up in irrational thought.  \n \nParenting these children takes extremely creative thought and a great deal of patience. \u00a0I think that \u00a0a lot of men just want to fix it! \u00a0And fix it quickly! \u00a0And mostly in the same ways that they were \"fixed\" when they were children. \n\"My mother would have knocked me into next week, if I did or said that!\" \nOh really? \u00a0Did you have autism? And how well did that work for you?\" \n \nParenting these kids requires education, thought and effort. \u00a0It takes no effort or thought to just knock a kid into next week. \u00a0When your kids are different...you have to parent them differently. \u00a0The point is for them to actually learn the lesson, not for us to simply assert our authority. \u00a0 As he tells me all the time, \"I'm a man! \u00a0I'm not going to react or sound like a woman!\" \n \nI am immersed in autism. \u00a0I am constantly reading books, blogs, and articles ...looking for answers and insight, trying to figure out the puzzle. \u00a0I read other parenting stories, so I know that these behaviors are not just my kids, trying to get over. \u00a0Some behaviors are typical, things that all kids try to say or do. \u00a0However, their reactions and thought process is almost ALWAYS different. \u00a0And sometimes, solving even typical parenting issues has to be approached differently \u00a0--so that they actually understand the lesson. \u00a0 And it may have to be repeated over and over until they get it. \u00a0This can be frustrating.  \n \nThen we have my mother living here who is trying to understand these kids, but she doesn't completely. \u00a0Of course, she has that old-school mentality. \u00a0I can ignore her judgement. \u00a0I know my kids and their diagnosis better than she does, so I can't let her thought process interfere with what I feel is right. \u00a0My husband will deny this, but I think he plays into her thought process because it backs his up. \u00a0My feeling is, when you are both as educated about autism as I am, when you go to all of the therapy appointments, take the daily phone calls from school, advocate for their IEP's, sit in every planning meeting for them, do the research on medications and everything else that I do...then I'll believe that you know more than I do. \n \nThat's not to say that my husband isn't a great dad. \u00a0The boys do connect with him in ways that they can never connect with me. \u00a0They believe that he is all knowing when it comes to certain things, that they feel I have no clue about. \u00a0They love him immensely and want his approval more than anything in the world. \u00a0Definitely, more than they want or need mine. \u00a0He is my loving partner and he is the only one who can teach them, by example how to be a responsible man, husband and father. \u00a0He still frustrates the hell out of me and I do the same for him. \u00a0 \n \nI think that I am one of the most patient mothers on earth ...and even I lose it sometimes. \u00a0I have my meltdowns --moments where I just want to scream or cry. \u00a0\u00a0In these moments...I am thankful for the village that I have to help me raise these boys. \u00a0I appreciate all of the mothers of \u00a0Blue's friends who help guide him. \u00a0I am thankful for our friends who come and pick Red up and take him hiking or talk to him about girls and self-esteem. \u00a0For my brother and niece -who mentor Red with his video business \n \nThere is an African proverb that says, \"It Takes a Village to Raise a Child.\" \u00a0In this case...it takes a freakin army!\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MXSJT9QqLUE/Tz1CDNew57I/AAAAAAAAAm4/dgaLkwroq1s/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/02/in-village.html", "title": "\nIn the Village\n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 20, 2012", "body": "\n \nThe celebration of Blue's 13th birthday started on Friday morning. \u00a0I have tradition of waking them up with my off key version of \"Happy Birthday.\"  \n \nHappy birthday to you \nIt's 7:32 \nYou're 13 to-day \nAnd I love you too! \n \nHe barely opens his eyes...says, \"good-morning mom,\" but doesn't get up. \u00a0 A few minutes later I come back. \n \nIt's 7:38 \nYou're going to be late \nIt's time to wake up \nAnd eat your pancakes \n \nBreakfast is served with a candle in your pancakes or waffles and I sing again. \u00a0I don't have many traditions, so I hope this is one they will remember and perhaps pass on to their children. \u00a0Scars from my own childhood of not celebrating birthdays because of my mother's choice of religion, make me want to over-do it a bit with my children. \u00a0That doesn't necessarily mean buying them expensive gifts, or having huge parties, but making each birthday special and memorable in some way. \n \nAfter school on Friday, there is a school dance. \u00a0He and his friends have been talking about Valentines Day and this dance for the past 2 weeks during the carpool to school. \u00a0It seems as if the interest in girls is starting to blossom. \u00a0The interest is mostly in it's very early, unrequited crush stage. \n\"I'm really scared to say hi.\" \n\"What if she doesn't like me.\" \n\"Do you think she likes someone else.\" \n\"What if she frowns at me and doesn't say anything?\" \n \nIt's just so funny to listen to them talk, while trying desperately not to get in their business. \u00a0Any and everything I say embarrasses Blue to pieces. . \n \nThe night of the dance I tease Blue...\"Isn't it nice they're having a school dance just for YOUR birthday.\"  \n \nSaturday is an all day \"Destination Imagination\" tournament. \u00a0D.I. is all about teamwork, creative thinking and problem solving. \u00a0All of his buddies from his social skills class @ school are on his team, which makes for a really interesting dynamic. \u00a0I elected Dad to manage the team. \u00a0It's great for him to get a taste of what life is like on the spectrum from these boys. \u00a0It helps him realize that it's not just \"our\" boys who have these behaviors. \u00a0This is autism! \u00a0As it turns out, Aspergers Dad \u00a0is great with these boys. \u00a0If only he could apply an ounce of that patience to Red. \u00a0But as my mother says, \"Red would make Jesus Christ want to scream.\" \n \nDad and Blue are gone all day for the tournament, which would have been nice if Red were not complaining all-freakin-day-long! \u00a0I was ready to jump out of my skin by Saturday night. \u00a0I finally locked my door and went off duty. \n \n \n \nWe have the real birthday celebration on Sunday afternoon. \u00a0I take Blue and his best friends, who are also on the spectrum, \u00a0to a place filled with trampolines for 2 hours of jumping. \u00a0 On to Fudruckers for lunch afterwards, an IceCream cake back here at the house and hanging out for video games. \u00a0Blue's friends are so funny and honest, yet quirky and blunt. \u00a06 hours with 4 13-year old boys on the spectrum and it was a pleasure. \n \nIn stark contrast, a couple of hours at home with 16 year-old Red...and I'm freakin exhausted. \u00a0He is doing better on his new meds. \u00a0For the first week...it was like magic, his mood was so great. \u00a0He is no longer tired all the time and he doesn't appear to be depressed. \u00a0Yet, he is still a handful and then some. \u00a0He claims boredom all weekend long, which in my opinion is mostly by choice. \u00a0He does nothing to make any plans with any of his friends, which he is more than capable of doing. \n \nHe complains about some program on his computer. \u00a0He complains about his graphics card, which has just been upgraded by the way. (Not good enough). \u00a0He complains about every weekend being the same and how BORED he is. \u00a0When prompted to call a friend and make plans to do something, he is so stuck in complaint mode, that he never moves forward to do anything positive to make his weekend better. \u00a0He rants so long and hard that he works himself up to the stage of screaming by the time his dad comes home. \u00a0I suppose he expects that after being gone for nearly 8 hours, working with a team of boys on the spectrum, that his dad would come home and be happy to dive right in to start alleviating his list of complaints.  \n \nI don't really consider this to be a meltdown. \u00a0I consider this to be a behavior issue. \u00a0In other words, I'm bored and unsatisfied and YOU PEOPLE are not doing anything to make it better, so I am going to make you all as miserable as I am. \u00a0WRONG Answer buddy. \u00a0That is not how life works. \u00a0Your yelling and screaming trying to get us to bend to your will is going to get you the  opposite  of what you want.  \n \nHe would calm down and apologize for his actions then a few hours later, he would get right back to complaining. \u00a0I think a big part of his issue was that Blue was having such an awesome weekend. \u00a0He had to do something to take away from that. \u00a0It's been that way since the beginning of time. \u00a0He HATES other people's birthdays. \n \nNeedless to say...I was so glad to put his ass on the school bus this morning \u00a0--I wanted to shout hallelujah and do the happy dance. \u00a0If only I had the energy. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kWiDiMY5igQ/T0JmvYH9gOI/AAAAAAAAAnE/be_X5j8cQjc/s1600/Cole+Bday2012.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/02/13-is-sweet.html", "title": "\n13 is Sweet!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 22, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nI want what I want and you people are not giving me what I want. \u00a0The world revolves around me haven't you heard?  \n \nThe entire weekend is all about\u00a0BOREDOM according to the 16-year-old boy we call Red. \n \n\"My computer sucks! \u00a0I need a new video card.\" \nDad just gave him 2 video cards from his machine. \u00a0Dad got a new mega video card and passed his two perfectly good video cards down to Red. \u00a0Of course, non-job-having Red would prefer the new video card. \u00a0You know...the one Dad got. \u00a0That is Dad...the one who works hard, pays the bills and makes his entire life possible.  \n \nDad's response...zero. \u00a0He's very good at ignoring. \u00a0Which sends him directly to me. (Thanks a lot Dad!) You know, Mom, who knows nothing about computers, but is supposed to somehow be able to control Dad. \u00a0My response? \"Children in Africa play with sticks and empty plastic bottles and they're happy. \u00a0Being happy with what you have is a choice.\" \u00a0What he has works...it's simply not good enough for him. \n \n\"When you don't have a job...you have to be satisfied with what you are given. \u00a0This is no different than it is was for me when I was 16. \u00a0When my parents couldn't give me what I wanted...I had to get a job. It was the same for your older brother when he was 16. \u00a0The only thing we owe you is food, clothing, shelter and education. \u00a0Everything else is gravy...you know, icing on the cake.\" \u00a0What does that mean to him? \u00a0Not much. \u00a0He doesn't want to hear it although, he's heard it many times before. \n \n\"But I don't have a job! \u00a0You guys are being so unfair!\"  \n\"Exactly...you don't have a job, so you don't have a choice, but to accept what we give you and you SHOULD do so graciously.\" \u00a0I may as well be talking to a brick wall. \n \nHe is trying to create his own video editing business, which I commend him for. \u00a0He has a nice video camera, \u00a0editing software, which he taught himself how to use and he has done several jobs, mostly for friends and family members. The latest thing however is, \"I need more equipment and if you wanted to help me with my business...you would buy it for me.\"  \n \nMy response, \"I will be glad to invest in your business when you have some jobs lined up so that I can see a return on my investment.\"  \n\"What do you mean a return?\" \n\"An investment...means someone gives you money for your business and you pay them back, plus a small profit when you begin to make money.\" \n\"Why would I give someone my money? \u00a0They didn't do the job!\" \n\"But if it weren't for THEIR money, you wouldn't be able to do the job.\"  \n \nI try to explain to him that he has to work with what he has until he can make more money or get more jobs lined up. \u00a0Then he can buy better or more equipment. \u00a0I'm not just handing out money for equipment that he will sit in the closet when no business drops into his lap. \u00a0I'm glad that he is at least thinking about making his own money, but again somehow, it falls back on us to spend more money...just because we're his parents. \u00a0This has to be repeated over and over and over again...before he will hopefully, get it. \u00a0  \n \nSo we get the, \"I'm so bored! I can't play my game on my computer! \u00a0You guys are so unfair!\" all weekend long. \u00a0Any redirection such as, \"Play the Playstation. \u00a0Watch a movie or call a friend,\" is met with considerable objection. \u00a0Essentially, he is creating his own boredom.  \n \nI read this timely article,\u00a0 Of Presidents Teens &  Dreams . \u00a0Ronae Jull, the author, hits the nail on the head for so many of our teens today. \u00a0It's like she's living in my house. \u00a0One of the things she says that effects our teens dreams is this sense of entitlement. \n \n \n \"This entitlement attitude has at its base a great self-centered focus: \n \n \u00a0What can you do / give to ME? I deserve it just because I\u2019m alive.\u201d \n \nThe article gives parents advice on how to help our teens grow up and get a reality check. I paraphrase what she says here: \n \n \n \n \n \"Stop giving your teen everything.\u00a0 .\u00a0 START involving them in open conversations about budgeting and economic changes affecting the family. \n Stop putting up with your teen\u2019s selfishness.\u00a0 \u00a0Selfishness is a normal part of development that needs parental help to grow out of.\u00a0 START\u00a0 with clearly defined and communicated expectations for behavior and attitudes. \" \n \n \n Read the entire\u00a0 article \u00a0to see exactly what she says.  \n \nI assign a few chores, which he does extremely well because he wants to be paid. \u00a0He thoroughly cleans his own disgusting bathroom. \u00a0Toilet, floor, counter, sink, mirror, bath and shower. \u00a0He even steam mops the tile for the first time. \u00a0Why should I pay $5.00 for him to clean his own pissy bathroom? \u00a0To shut him up for an hour! \u00a0Desperate times.... \n \nSo he creates this world of negativity for himself and attempts to suck us all into it. \u00a0He rants, he screams, he hates everyone and everything all weekend long. \u00a0All of this is our fault and our problem...not his. \n \nMonday morning, he is suddenly so sorry for his behavior. \u00a0\"But you guys really do make me mad. \u00a0We need to have a family meeting to help us figure out how to get along.\" \u00a0I am working on setting up this meeting. \u00a0However, no family meeting will change the fact that if you choose to not be satisfied with all of your blessings...you will NEVER be happy. \n \nTuesday afternoon he comes home from school, having had a conversation with the school Psychologist, with a whole new attitude. \u00a0Suddenly, he decides to call all of his friends to check in and have pleasant conversations. \u00a0He is kind to his brother. \u00a0He goes out with me for a walk. \u00a0He's a whole new kid, which confirms that the antics over the weekend were totally of his own volition and creation. \n \nOf course the pleasantries come along with an underlying goal. \u00a0He says in the car on our way to the park \"I really need to work on my behavior if I want to go to Six Flags during Spring Break.\"  \n \nAmazing! \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eth73h_aj7o/T0UWMtS1O2I/AAAAAAAAAnM/AyyUgFvYxgM/s1600/images-1.jpeg", "http://ronaejull.com/2012/02/17/of-presidents-and-teens-and-dreams/", "http://ronaejull.com/2012/02/17/of-presidents-and-teens-and-dreams/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/02/boredom-is-for-boring.html", "title": "\nBoredom is For the Boring\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, February 25, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n A little fun- \n \n Red is telling me about a teacher who used to \"yell\" at him. \u00a0Anyone who corrects him and has expectations from him in his eyes, they are \"yelling\". \u00a0This teacher who he is referring to is one who is not known for being the yelling kind. \n \u00a0\u00a0 \n I say to him, \"Honey, you would make Jesus Christ himself yell. \u00a0Help me father! I don't know what to do with this boy! \u00a0He just will not listen!\" \n \"That's not funny Mom!\" he says.\u00a0 \n \n Actually, it's very funny...and probably true. \u00a0I can picture Jesus throwing his hands up to his heavenly father, looking all confused. \u00a0I wish I could draw a little cartoon. \n ______________________________________________ \n We have a very busy day planned. \u00a0First we have his neurology results appointment. \u00a0As it turns out, Red is doing so much better. \u00a0His blood work looks better, platelets are up. \u00a0His EEG was normal. \u00a0The medication seems to be working. \u00a0The depression is markedly better and so is his attitude...especially, at school. \u00a0He is not complaining at school, is compliant and much more social. \u00a0He is not as fatigued. \u00a0He is getting up in the morning with relative ease and getting ready for the bus everyday, on-time! (MAJOR). \u00a0 \n \n Unfortunately, the cognitive testing is disappointing. \u00a0His percentiles are low, but mostly due to slow processing. \u00a0The tests were all timed. \u00a0What he completed, he scored 98% on average. \u00a0The problem is he would only complete 50 to 60% of the questions due to slow processing. \u00a0Even though this is disappointing...it's good information to have, to understand where he is, how he learns and what we need to do to make things better. \u00a0He will need the academic accommodation of 1 1/2 times to complete work and tests. \u00a0 \n \n The Neurologist recommends that he improve his diet, by eating more protein and vegetables and less carbs. \u00a0(No surprise here...shouldn't we all do that?) \u00a0 He also recommends that he get involved in sports activity to help rapid action in his brain. \u00a0More movement will stimulate his brain to get used to moving and reacting faster. \u00a0 I am going to have the school do an OT (occupational therapy) evaluation to see if we can implement some of this rapid action into his school day. \u00a0We also will be signing him up again for swimming. \u00a0 \n \n When we are finally done with our appointment, we are both starved. \u00a0I only had time for coffee and we spent more time than anticipated in the doctors office. \u00a0We go to his favorite restaurant for lunch after the appointment. \u00a0Red would be satisfied with a fast food hamburger, but I want a healthier choice. \u00a0I've got terriyaki salmon on the brain. \u00a0We sit down to order and he is wearing the frowning face, which I'm sure he isn't even aware of. \u00a0I remind him that we are in his favorite restaurant. \u00a0 \n \"Would you sit up and take that scowl off of your face?\" (Don't I sound like a mom? Geez...who is this woman?)\u00a0 \n \"What are you thinking about?\" I ask...kind of afraid of the answer. \u00a0 \n \n He goes into his latest dialog about developing his business and making money. \u00a0He asks me the same questions, that I don't have answers to over and over again. \u00a0 \n \n He tells me he doesn't want to go back to school after lunch. \u00a0We have a meeting. \u00a0We are definitely going. \u00a0At least he won't be in class. \u00a0We order dessert...his favorite, Pizookie (white chocolate macadamia) warm cookie with vanilla ice cream on top. \u00a0He is actually willing to share with me as long as I promise not to eat more than him, which would virtually be impossible. \u00a0This is also an improvement. \u00a0A few months ago we almost came to blows over dessert that he didn't want to share. \n \n The meeting is the follow up 2nd half of his VISIT (transition planning) meeting. \u00a0I don't know how we got so lucky to have the head Transition Coordinator in our school district to not only do our transition meeting, but she also does Person Centered Planning meetings with Red once monthly to help him work on personal goal setting and achievement. \u00a0 Hallelujah! Thank you Jesus!\u00a0 \n \n The meeting is highly productive, very visual and motivating. \u00a0We talk about where he is now, where he wants to go throughout his high school years, and what supports that we anticipate him needing after high school. \u00a0The district will provide support services for him through age 22 as needed to help him transition into work and  independent living! \u00a0 (Hallelujah one more time!)  His vocational teacher, the School Psychologist, Special Ed. Lead and Special Ed. tracking teacher are all in attendance. \u00a0 \n \n Red has apparently made great improvements since he's been at the new high school and even in his vocational classes there is improvement. \u00a0We put together data in black and white among other colors, to paint a picture of where he is, and what he needs in order to get to where he wants to be. \u00a0Mrs. Wonderful, the Transition Coordinator, is encouraging him to start to take control of his own life and to stop leaning on me so much. \u00a0 (Yeah, he's getting pretty heavy.)  \u00a0We put together direct goals of social-emotional, and self-care that he should be doing for himself, including chores and planning his own free-time. \u00a0He was open and participated very well, once he warmed up. He always enters the room like he's going into a torture chamber. \n \n \n \n He comes home after our meeting, and watches a DVD that Mrs. W- loaned him entitled, \"The Next Step -Failure is Not an Option.\" The video was actually put together by a young man with the same goal as Red --video editing. \u00a0Red was really encouraged by all of the stories of these individuals with various disabilities who did not allow that to stop them from becoming successful in life and completing their education. \n \n He has a tendency to play the, \"Woe is me! I have Aspergers, so I can't do it. \u00a0It's too hard,\" card. \n \n \n \n I think the whole idea of transitioning into adulthood scares the crap out of him. \u00a0He has so much work to do to get there. \u00a0He's afraid that it will be too hard. \u00a0That he he won't have any support. \u00a0The truth of the matter is that he will. \u00a0He will have the support of our school district and many other state and federal programs for people with disabilities. \u00a0He will always have our love and support. \u00a0Someday, I want him to be a man --to stand on his own two feet and use his gifts and abilities to take care of himself. \u00a0This will take a lot of work, time and patience. \u00a0And we will be there for him all the way.\u00a0 \n \n This is one of the best days I have spent with Red, in recent history. \u00a0We were together from sun up to sun down and he didn't drive me totally bananas! \u00a0I pray that there are many more days like this to come. \u00a0They are golden.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YnctS92bipQ/T0g_N1BOTJI/AAAAAAAAAnU/6IBvb4_uz1E/s1600/world.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AYtWRpd339Q/T0hJKyINSfI/AAAAAAAAAnc/l86MYBNJNfo/s1600/images-3.jpeg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7YAMOvKbjUg/T0hNlSu6HpI/AAAAAAAAAnk/zlsHhgUuRbc/s1600/images-4.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/02/as-his-world-turns.html", "title": "\nAs His World Turns\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 29, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n Editorial Note: I am republishing this post because of a very ignorant comment that was left on the previous version. \u00a0Now....I could have just let this ignorance go...but then, I wouldn't be doing my job as an advocate for my children and other's with autism.\u00a0 \n The update and response to the comment, is at the bottom of this post. \u00a0Please read all the way through:\u00a0 \n \n Has anyone ever said to you, \"Having Asperger's is not an excuse for...\" in reference to a certain behavior? Well the first time someone said it to me, I just about blew a gasket! \u00a0I wanted to knock this woman into last week! \u00a0She was Blue's 5th grade teacher for a hot second until I pulled him out of her class. \u00a0She told me that Blue was mean and, \"Having Aspergers is not an excuse for being mean!\" \u00a0Well -it may not be an excuse, but it certainly is an explanation. \n \n   \n How about this? \u00a0Having Aspergers means that you can be brutally honest \u00a0--that you don't have the filters to bullshit around. \u00a0You say exactly what's on your mind. \u00a0Now I realize that doesn't always look politically correct, especially when it comes out of the mouth of a child. \u00a0However, a child with Aspergers doesn't have a clue about being politically correct. \n \n   \n How about --having Aspergers means you don't have the  natural ability  to think about how what you're saying or doing makes another person feel, nor does it give you the  natural ability  to  care  about how the other person is feeling. \u00a0Hence, Aspergers (autism) is a  disability! \u00a0 \n \n   \n These things are something that a person with Aspergers has to be taught. \u00a0Because of their rigid brains, they may have to be taught over and over again. \u00a0They may get better at it ...they may not. \u00a0They may get it...but they may never \u00a0totally get it ( or so I've been told). \n \n   \n This past week or so -I've been in a bit of a snit with my son's high-school administration. \u00a0Red has been in a pretty dark place every since Valentines Day. \u00a0Why? \u00a0Of course because he wants a girlfriend. \u00a0 He has no idea what that entails or what that really means. \u00a0Furthermore -he doesn't have a clue as to how to go about making that happen. \u00a0 He wonders through the high-school corridors everyday seeing couples, hugging, and kissing, looking as he says, \"happy\". \u00a0He wants that. \u00a0He wants to be a part of something. \u00a0He wants to feel special. \u00a0He wants connection to is peers. They have our kids in these \"inclusion\" programs, and yet, they are not really included in much of anything besides classes.\u00a0 \n \n   \n So -let's just say that he has been behaving in a way that is totally counteractive to achieving his goal of getting a girlfriend, and maybe even sabotaging making any kind of friends. \u00a0 I've said before that he is his own worst enemy. \u00a0He is displaying some behaviors that make his peers \"uncomfortable\" at best. \u00a0He has had conversations with me that let me know for sure that he \"doesn't get it\" and that are tell-tale that his thought process is completely skewed, negative, \u00a0depressed and not based in reality. \n \n   \n I go to the school and to inform them of his negative thought process \u00a0--that he is extremely depressed and somewhat irrational. \u00a0I am afraid that in his state of mind that he may say or do something that is inappropriate. \u00a0I ask work with him intensely on these thoughts, feelings through social skills and sessions with the school Psychologist. \u00a0I ask that for the short term, he not be unsupervised in any unstructured environments such as the cafeteria during lunch based on his current state of mind. \n Three days later the phone rings... \n \n   \n \"There's been an  incident  in the cafeteria.\" \n How could that be? \u00a0Didn't I just tell you that he shouldn't be without supervision in the cafeteria?\u00a0 \n I was told, \"An Administrative Directive has been issued stating that he can no longer talk to certain students.\" \n Well...good luck with that! \u00a0What the hell does an Administrative Directive mean to a boy with Autism? \n \n   \n   \n I was also told that he was spoken to by the campus officer \u00a0--that \"he handled it really well.\" \u00a0Red told him that he didn't mean what he said \u00a0--that he was just angry. \u00a0He was told that having Aspergers is not \u00a0an excuse for his behavior. \u00a0Once again I say, \u00a0Aspergers is not an excuse....but it certainly is an explanation. \n \n \n Again --most people with Aspergers \u00a0are completely unaware of how their actions or words make other people feel. That part of their brain may not be wired correctly. \u00a0Combine that with, depression, immaturity and lack of social skills. \n \n   \n Yes...he seriously needs to learn about the consequences of his actions and words. \u00a0Having to speak to with the officer scared the bejesus out of him. \u00a0So...yes he probably learned that he can't go around saying whatever the heck he wants to whomever he wants. \u00a0And yes --it's good that he is learning some lessons behind the safety of the walls of his high-school, but could this incident have been avoided? Certainly. \n \n   \n Perhaps we should be spending time intensely teaching him the skills he needs to make friends and maybe connecting him with a group of peers who share similar issues who can support one another, so that they feel less isolated --less alone and therefore not act out inappropriately. \u00a0In fact, because I am so concerned about his social skills and his lack of ability to make friends, I took the step of having him in a private social skills group and individual counseling to support his needs.\u00a0 \n \n   \n The funny thing is, (o.k. so maybe not so funny) --a couple of days after this  incident , I call the school Psychologist, completely distraught because we had just gone through the weekend from hell because Red was so disturbed by the events and by having to speak with an officer. \u00a0I told her, \"I've spoken to him over and over about this and he doesn't get it!\" \u00a0She said to me, \"And he may  never  get it totally.\" This took the wind right out of my sail. \n   \n What I wasn't told by  anyone  including the Administrator who issued this \"Directive,\" was that they had him  sign the documen t which basically admits to wrong doing and threatens him with further disciplinary action should this behavior happen again. \u00a0\u00a0 I didn't find this out until I went through his backpack days later after a phone call I placed to the school asking where it was.\u00a0 \n \n \n   \n You had my 15 year old son with Aspergers who  doesn't get it,\u00a0 sign an Administrative document that will likely go in his permanent school record, with out my consent, consultation, or presence. \u00a0I have a serious problem with that. \u00a0In fact, I've been told that an attorney would have a field day with this. \u00a0 \n   \n Let's just say...currently I am weighing my options. \u00a0And you haven't heard the last of this story.\u00a0 \n \n \n UPDATE:\u00a0 \n \n Blue's 5th Grade teacher made the original comment to me, has since been further educated about Aspergers. \u00a0I did pull him from her class because I knew that she didn't \"get it\". I refused to let my child be tortured everyday, for the entire school year in a classroom with a teacher who was obviously so uneducated about his disability...a teacher who's mind seemed to be closed.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n She made the comment because my son had asked  her  child (who is also was also a student in the 5th grade) \"Is your mom this mean at home?\"  I don't know seems like a legitimate question to me . \n \n \n \n Well, guess who ended up educating her? My son! \u00a0He gave a presentation at our Annual Teachers conference in the school district about \u00a0\"How Teachers Can Help Aspergers Students in the Classroom.\" \n \n \n \n By the end of that school year, they became friends. \u00a0And my \"mean\" child gave her one of his original oil paintings to remember him by. \u00a0He also e-mailed her over the summer to see how she and her son were doing. \n \n \n \n The uneducated comment that was left on my blog  was as follows:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"What about the rights of the other students? Because your son has aspergers, it was ok for him to verbally abuse other 5th graders? Apparantly so because when the teacher pointed it out you had him removed from her classroom. \u00a0 My daughter was in a classroom with a child with aspergers. A great portion of the teacher's time was spent dealing with his misbehaviors, thus neglecting her teaching and the needs of other students. \u00a0 I fear that her she will not meet her potential because the school system is so bogged down accomodating the asinine expectations of people with children with disorders like aspergers. \u00a0 I believe that every child should have the opportunity for an education, but not to the extent that it interferes with the education of others.\" \n \n \n I asked my lovely peeps, mothers of those with autism on my\u00a0 \"Confessions\" Facebook Community Page \u00a0 how they would respond to this obviously, \u00a0uneducated woman. \u00a0I got some great responses. \u00a0Here are a few examples: \n \n \n \n Michelle says, \"would she feel the same way about a student with a more 'obvious disability' (ie in a wheelchair). Would she complain about the teacher helping this child in and out of his desk, etc. because it means less a ttention for her child. This is why we need teachers who are better educated which would lead to students who are better educated which would lead to parents who are better educated in Aspergers/ Autism. Ignorance is the enemy here.\" \n \n \n \n Hope says, \"I don't feel comfortable with the idea that having Aspergers is equated with misbehavior because that's incorrect. My son is a stickler for rules so misbehavior is just that...misbehavior. If it's not children with special needs it would be \u00a0another group she blames for the teacher's divided attention (ex. ESL, physically disabled, etc. etc.) Won't she ask her legislators why classrooms are overcrowded, teachers have eroding job stability and insufficient support, and tolerance isn't taught in schools. This would be more productive than being a blog bully who spews ignorance.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Lisa says, \"because my son has difficulties being socially appropriate in times of stress, children like your daughter have the chance to learn tolerance and compassion instead of growing up to be an intolerant, ignorant bitch like \u00a0their mothers. My son does not choose to have a disability that causes these kind of outbursts, you however chose to sit down and type a rude and ignorant comment on my blog instead of taking that time to educate yourself about Asperger's so that you can be a kinder more understanding human being and be a wonderful example to your daughter. Shame on you!\" \n \n \n \n I really love Lisa's comment. \u00a0It is the most reflective of my feelings after first reading the comment. \n \n The grand consensus is that we all should be working with our school boards, teachers, school administration and legislators to improve our education system for \"all students\". \u00a0Teachers do need support within the classroom so that  all children  can get the best possible education. \u00a0Aspergers, autism and other disabilities are not going to simply go-away, because they are an inconvenience to those who don't walk in our shoes. \u00a0They are not disabilities or behaviors that are chosen by our children. \u00a0We need to be supporting them, and teaching them with compassion instead of blaming them, or their parents.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n This woman may or may not read these responses. \u00a0However, someone will be further educated by reading this post. \u00a0My son has already converted at least one closed-minded teacher. \u00a0I am here to carry the torch.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n And there you have it in a nutshell. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZeEMdSfAWyg/TWsrWy_wmmI/AAAAAAAAAIg/an635ov8iJk/s1600/whats_your_excuse_tshirt-d235723518932866645usn7_210.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=tn_tnmn"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/02/aspergers-excuse.html", "title": "\nThe Aspergers Excuse -Revised\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, October 26, 2010", "body": "\nFirst of all let me first say that I have finally been given a mother's right of passage.\u00a0 Friday morning while sitting in the school parking lot with Red, my 15 year-old son I was told, \"You are the worst mother on earth!\"\u00a0 All I could do was laugh.\u00a0 As a result, he did not have the pleasure of telling me off from the comfort of the front seat of my car on the way home from school.\u00a0 He road the bus!\u00a0 He didn't have the pleasure of my company until nearly bedtime that night.\u00a0 I ran away to a Zumbathon where I literally danced my ass off along with a truck load of stress. I then soothed my aching joints with a Chambord-rita and an appetizer at my favorite hang-out after the gym.\u00a0  \n \n \nI now have proof positive evidence that this child of mine will NEVER...ever , be satisfied.\u00a0 He did it, he saved enough money for his blu-ray drive for the computer.\u00a0 We ordered it for him. You would think that would shut him up for a while -not so.\u00a0 We ordered it Friday.\u00a0 We then got nine thousand questions about where we ordered from, which one we ordered, when will it arrive, why didn't we choose overnight shipping.\u00a0 We finally had him read the printout to answer all of his questions so that he would have something concrete to refer back to for the future redundant questions. \n \nSince he thinks that's in the bag...the disrespectful, loud, annoying behaviors ensued. On Saturday, he decided to clean and organize his room.\u00a0 He is envious of his brother whose room is spotless and organized.\u00a0 One would think this is a good thing.\u00a0 He's cleaning and organizing right?\u00a0 He decided that he doesn't want ANY books in his room.\u00a0 He hates reading...why does he need books?\u00a0 The chair that his friends sit in when they come over has a small tear in it....he must dispose of it.\u00a0 Fine...but I will not be replacing it.\u00a0 He sold his television to his older brother.\u00a0 It wasn't a flat screen.\u00a0 Who needs it? I guess his friends will sit on the floor when they visit and they will watch movies on his computer.\u00a0 He got rid of expensive car models we bought him a few years ago.\u00a0 They are now disposable.\u00a0 Wow! Had to have them then...now -he has no use for these collectibles.  \n \nSomehow, by the end of the day...he needed a new desk, and a shelf for his monitor and keyboard.\u00a0 He also decided he needs a new game controller for his computer.\u00a0 The one he has, \"doesn't work right.\"\u00a0 Can't we just get him a new one.\u00a0 \"Why is dad's computer the fastest in this house?\u00a0 Why can't I have some headphones like the ones Dad has?\" \n \nBy the time Monday arrived we were at, \"I just need a new computer.\u00a0 Can you get me a new computer for Christmas? Why can't you just get me a new...faster computer?\u00a0 It's not fair! Other kids have computers that support all of these new games.\u00a0 My computer is crap!\"\u00a0 Un-freakin-believable! He has the second fastest computer in the house. \n \nWe are trying to teach the value of money by making him save for the things that he wants.\u00a0 That does not however stop him from continuing to ask for more...over and over and over again.\u00a0 He has now behaved his way out of having this blu-ray player installed by his father whenever it arrives.\u00a0 He has screamed and yelled and cursed at all of us including his 71 year-old grandmother.\u00a0 He made our Sunday afternoon a living hell! \n \nDad now insists that he wants a solid week of positive behavior before he will reward him with anything, including installing the player that he has been saving for and wanting for months. This will most likely be a recipe for next weekend being less than peaceful.\u00a0 I guess it doesn't really matter if he gets it or not.\u00a0 He will not be happy for long one way or another.  \n \nI think I hear my girlfriend in Houston calling me.\u00a0 I just may have to go...\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/10/peace-on-earth.html", "title": "\nPeace on Earth\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 27, 2010", "body": "\nI go to the high school today to pick my son up for an appointment.\u00a0 He happened to be in the middle of an \"awesome\" social skills session with the school psychologist.\u00a0\u00a0 She came and spoke to me to tell me how great he is doing at school.\u00a0 His teachers think he's doing great.\u00a0 He's passing all of his classes.\u00a0 They aren't seeing any of the negative behaviors that we saw last year in middle school.\u00a0 Wow! \n \nSo I'm happy that he's doing so well there.\u00a0 I just wonder why I'm seeing such a stark contrast here at home. I mean as soon as he sees me...he totally changes his demeanor and starts huffing and puffing, positioning himself to be angry and sad all for my benefit.\u00a0 His facial expression literally changed right before my eyes as we walked out of the school doors towards the car for his doctor's appointment. \n \n\"Why do you change like that as soon as you see me?\" I ask. \n\"That's because you're mean to me!\" \n What do you mean I'm mean to you?\u00a0 I just saw you and said hello and you totally changed into H.R. Puffinstuff.\u00a0 (Am I dating myself here?)\u00a0\u00a0 \n\"You're right Mom.\u00a0 I'm sorry.\u00a0 It's just that you guys won't give me the things that I want...especially Dad.\" \n \nWe make it to the doctor and I give her the rundown on the past few weeks -the atrocious behavior at home verses how \"awesome\" he is doing at school.\u00a0 What does she do?\u00a0 She tells him that he is being mentally abusive and disrespectful to us and that he needs to get a job to get all of the things that he wants! She also told him if he doesn't get his sh*# together (I'm embellishing here) she has the option to recommend that he be taken out of our home because he is basically being mentally abusive to us.\u00a0 Basically...she scared the sh*# out of him.\u00a0 Do I agree with this tactic? No...not really.\u00a0 Does he need a reality check? Yes...definitely.\u00a0 Did she really mean what she said? I don't know.\u00a0 She told him that she is giving him a chance to treat his parents better.\u00a0 Does he have the capacity to do this? I don't know. \n \nThis doctor is African.\u00a0 Other cultures do not put up with a lot of the crap that we \"Americans\" do.\u00a0 She is a mental health professional, a Psychiatrist.\u00a0 Does she really understand how to approach Aspergers specifically? Well...today, she didn't sound like any book I've ever read or any therapist I've ever been to. \n \nAt the same time, I am dealing with a teenager.\u00a0 The typical teenager gives his parents hell on a stick! My atypical teenager was \"Mr. Personality\" at school and for the rest of the world, and was pretty crappy to us most of the time.\u00a0 He would disagree if he reads this...but it's true.\u00a0 I lived it. I suppose a part of this behavior is a right of passage.\u00a0 It's just intensified times to the tenth power with a teen with Aspergers.\u00a0  \n \nShe also recommended yet another medication...Intuniv, which is primarily used for ADHD for impulsive behaviors.\u00a0 I believe it is a non-stimulant.\u00a0 Ugh!!\u00a0 Another freaking medication.\u00a0 I just don't know if I'm up for it. After giving it some thought on the way home, I remembered that I forgot to tell her that he's been sleeping a lot.\u00a0 Will this medication make him more sleepy? \n \nSuddenly I had an 'ah hah' moment...he's doing great at school, one because \"we\" (his parents) aren't there.\u00a0 Since when do parents deserve any respect?\u00a0 Also, his day is structured with plenty of things to do.\u00a0 He is\u00a0 working really hard to appear typical to his peers.\u00a0 He doesn't have to do that here. He can\u00a0 relax and be his grouchy self.\u00a0 There is no one to impress here!  \n \nLately, he has lost interest in the roller coaster design game (Roller Coaster Tycoon 3) that he used to play for hours.\u00a0 HE's Bored! Boredom drives him to looking on the internet for expensive things to that he thinks will give him something to do.\u00a0 It also leads him to annoy his brother and the dog, and anyone else in earshot.  \n \nWhat he really needs...is more  inexpensive  things to do.\u00a0 We need to keep him busy...or at least busier.\u00a0 Will that help some of the acting out?\u00a0 I think it will.\u00a0 The trick will be finding things that he is willing to do without a fight.\u00a0 (Good luck there!)

From the car I call my behavioral health plan to get referrals for a Pediatric Psychiatrist.\u00a0 There are a whopping three choices in the entire Austin area.\u00a0  \n \n 3:30 p.m. : I stop by Pediatric Psychiatrist office (they are next door to the therapist).\u00a0 I beg for an appointment for an evaluation for my youngest son.\u00a0 His anxiety and explosive levels are through the roof and are definitely interfering with our everyday life and routine.\u00a0 They write down my information and say they'll get back to me. There is a 70 person waiting list.\u00a0 They may give me priority since my older son is already a patient.  \n \n 4:00 p.m. : I sit through a therapy session with the teenager. It is shear torture for the most part. He does have at least one epiphany.\u00a0 He doesn't want his typical friends to see how angry he can get.\u00a0 He walked away from a potentially explosive situation when someone told him he couldn't sit at a particular table during lunch. This is good stuff!  \n \n 5:00 p.m .: Session is over -I call my husband to see if he is going to make it to take the middle schooler to his private art lesson. He says, \"I  think  I can make it.\" I can't rely on  think .\u00a0 I hightail it across town to pick him up myself. \n \nI send husband a text message which says,  \"Dude -don't ever tell me I don't have full-time job!\"  He replies, \"O.K.\"\u00a0  \n \n \n 6:00   p.m . -Pick up and drop off to art lessons.\u00a0 I'm exhausted, overwhelmed, pissed off, stressed out, feeling a little explosive my damn self!\u00a0 I call hubby and ask him can he at least honor the commitment of picking up our son from art lessons.\u00a0 I just want to disappear for a while.\u00a0 He agrees. \n \n 6:15 p.m .-I arrive at happy hour...at my favorite place -alone. I pull up to the bar with the rest of the alcoholics and order a Chambord Rita and grilled shrimp tostada bites.\u00a0 I make small talk conversation with the friendly drunks sitting next to me.\u00a0 It's fun.\u00a0 I'm not the least bit embarrassed that I'm a married woman alone in a bar.  \n \nI send a text to hubby that says, \"I'm at a bar picking up strange men. :-D\"\u00a0 He replies, \"Not Funny!\"\u00a0 It's funny to me.\u00a0  \n \n 6:45 p.m . -While sitting at the bar, a call comes in on my cell from some old friends that I have reconnected with via facebook.\u00a0 They are in Dallas for a fotball game.\u00a0 This is three school friends from my middle school years.\u00a0 They are of the male species.\u00a0 All are handsome and as sweet as ever.\u00a0 All very much married and have children.\u00a0 They remember me as \"k-dub\" the fun girl with no worries.\u00a0 It's great to be taken back to happier days for a moment.\u00a0 This is by far the highlight of my day. \n \n 7:30 p.m. \u00a0 -I leave happy hour and head to the mall.\u00a0 I just don't want to go home and face my family. Spending money usually makes everything better...at least temporarily.\u00a0 Somehow today, it doesn't have much effect.\u00a0 I only buy facial products and makeup.\u00a0 I need it to hide the misery and age on my face.  \n \n 9:30 p.m . -I return home and am glad that hubby took the middle school son to a football game.\u00a0 I hide away in my room getting ready for bed. \u00a0  \n \n 11:00 p.m . -I drift off and sleep like a newborn baby.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/09/adventures-in-delirum.html", "title": "\nAdventures in Delirum\n"},

My high wasn't just the vodka or the amazing music...it was the thrill of having a real, live, adult moment in time.\u00a0 Moments like this make all the details that I have to endure each day, just a little easier to take.\u00a0 I danced because I was happy.\u00a0 I danced because I was free.\u00a0 I was an individual, a grown up...with a life, not just an Aspergers mom. \n \nThis was a culmination for a week that I got to be a grown up on three different occasions.\u00a0 First I went to a movie premier of\u00a0 \"The Dry Land\" an independent Sundance Film, written and directed by a local Texas artist, Ryan Piers Williams, and executive produced by his fiance America Fererra.\u00a0 This was a script to screen event where we had the opportunity to speak with them after viewing the film.\u00a0 I actually had the opportunity to ask the last question of the evening and speak directly to Ryan and America.\u00a0 We had a positive exchange and shared a few moments of laughter.\u00a0 For that moment I felt like, hey, I'm not totally brain-dead.\u00a0 I can actually have a productive conversation with these young artists. \n \n \n \nA couple of days later, my husband and I had an evening out with another couple, where we had drinks,  hors \u00b7 d'oeuvres and pleasant adult conversation about a variety of subjects, sans interruption from children who are wondering why they aren't the center of your universe every waking moment of your life.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n My exuberance at the concert last night was about the realization that my life has its difficult moments, however I am blessed.\u00a0 I have a husband who loves me and stands by my side even when I'm not likable, which is often.\u00a0 We can still have a good time together, forgetting if just for the moment, what an arduous task we have in raising our children.

The program he was in was more like glorified babysitting than making sure he got the absolute best education in the least restrictive setting. \n \nThe high school's goal is to get my son in regular classes as much as possible to ensure that he gets the best education so that he can go on to make a positive contribution to society.\u00a0 We are hoping that he can use his interest in video editing, film and art to have a career in that arena.\u00a0 His options are diminished if he doesn't finish high school.\u00a0 They are diminished if he doesn't develop coping and social skills to deal with people.\u00a0 High school is the obstacle course he has to make it through, in order to move forward with his life, and most importantly...to get out of my house! \n \nHe has come home complaining every single day about how he HATES high school!  \n \n\"No one talks to me! I feel lonely!\" \n\"Only the weird people talk to me!\" \n\"The bus driver can't drive! He almost flipped the freakin bus over and the assistant acts like she's drunk!\"  \n \n \n \nI think this is code for...the driver and his assistant seem a little weird.\u00a0 They are a couple -husband and wife.\u00a0 I  will admit, they are not exactly the most warm and fuzzy people I've  ever met.\u00a0 They're not exactly friendly and I know they have no \"special needs\" training. They don't appear to be very educated...period.  \n \nThis morning he flat out refused to get on the bus to go to school. They did show up early as he was still eating his eggs.\u00a0 He had not brushed his teeth or put on his shoes.\u00a0  How dare they show up early knowing full well that I don't feel like going!  Of course, he had taken his sweet time waking up and getting his breakfast.\u00a0 He also had to take time out to call his brother a few names.\u00a0  \n \n \nHow can I keep doing this for the next four years?! He's twice my size.\u00a0 Iit's really getting past the point where I can  make  him do anything.\u00a0 His father who is more intimidating in stature and demeanor, is traveling half of the time for work.\u00a0 If I am forceful and take away privileges, he melts down -yelling and screaming and wreaking havoc on the entire house.\u00a0 Homeschooling is not an option for me.\u00a0 I would loose what is left of my sanity -not to mention, he needs to develop social skills and he can't do that at home in his room.\u00a0 If I travel down the road of\u00a0 taking him everyday, instead of riding the bus, I then own the battle of getting him to school on time.\u00a0 Why should he rush to be ready for me? He doesn't rush do anything else I ask him.\u00a0 It will be just one more thing for us to fight about.  \n \nI'm reading this new book called, \"The Explosive Child!\" written by Ross Green, Ph.D. Basically he tells you to collaborate with your child to solve problems.\u00a0 Don't simply impose your will upon them.\u00a0 Come up with solutions together, so that he feels like his voice is being heard. That all sounds great in theory, but what the hell do you do when his voice is saying, \"I am\u00a0 not going to school! I want to be home-schooled!\" And let me add, at a very high octave.\u00a0  \n\u00a0  \nHis best friend is homeschooled, so he thinks that's the magic answer.\u00a0 He isn't in the same place as his friend.\u00a0 He is \"high-functioning\" with Aspergers, not bi-bolar with ADHD.\u00a0 He has a specific skill set and a high degree of intelligence, that will be developed further by being in school. \n \nAfter 10 minutes of refusing to get on the bus, I finally told them to leave.\u00a0 I called the school and talked to his Special Education BASE teacher to tell her what I was dealing with.\u00a0 He asked to speak to her and suddenly had a reasonable tone of voice.\u00a0 He quietly voiced his concerns to her.\u00a0 She told him to come on in and they would come up with a viable game plan.\u00a0 He agreed -brushed his teeth, put on his shoes and I took him to school.  \n \nThey say God doesn't give you more than you can bare.\u00a0 All I can say is he must think I'm awfully strong in order to handle these children.\u00a0 I guess he's right.\u00a0 I haven't gone to the looney bin yet.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/08/funny-thing-happened-on-way-to-looney.html", "title": "\nFunny Thing Happened on the Way to the Looney Bin!\n"},
{"date": "Monday, August 2, 2010", "body": "\nIt was a guys day -Dad and all of his boys, including his nephew who was visiting from out town, went to the movies.\u00a0 Even our eldest son '22' tagged along to see the rated G movie. I had been with the crew for most of the week while my husband was on a business trip, so I welcomed the break.\u00a0 I took the opportunity to go out to lunch and see a movie myself.\u00a0 I accidentally left my cell phone at home.\u00a0 I love that quote, \"There are no accidents.\u00a0 God is just remaining anonymous.\" Well, thank God, I wasn't able to receive the phone calls.\u00a0 \n \nWhen the movie ended -'14' promptly stood up and said, \"Let's go!\" Everyone else remained seated to watch the out-takes and extra scenes that rolled during the credits.\u00a0 Dad instructed him to sit back down.\u00a0 He did not comply.\u00a0 Older brother asked him to sit down.\u00a0 He refused and began walking out of the theater.\u00a0 Older brother followed him, and ensues a confrontation where he verbally threatens his younger brother.\u00a0 This does not go over well.\u00a0 You can bet on a  meltdown  type of situation when you make someone with  Aspergers feel  like their  back is against the wall.\u00a0 The over-stimulation is off the charts and they don't handle it well.\u00a0  Meltdowns are part of the Aspergers condition .\u00a0 Sooner or later, they are going to have one.\u00a0 All we can do is try to avoid situations where we know that they will. \u00a0  \n \nNow...I have to say that older brother had recently, and successfully I might add, diffused another situation wherein if '14' had followed a simple direction, it would not have turned ugly.\u00a0 This one involved me.\u00a0 He was given the choice to leave the room, or go outside to join his brothers at the neighborhood park.\u00a0 Instead, he chose to beat on my door until I would come out and talk to him about why he didn't want to go play at the park. \n \nHis aggressive behavior during meltdowns is beginning to get out of hand.\u00a0 My husband and my oldest son, are extremely concerned about the way that he treats me.with utter disrespect.\u00a0 I do not feel threatened  at all .\u00a0  Agitated, aggravated, stressed? Definitely. Yet, they worry because my teenage son is so big, and I am so small.\u00a0 They worry that he will take the aggressiveness to another level while having a meltdown.\u00a0 I am his mother and my instinct tells me that he will not go there. \n \nThe verbal altercation that took place between my two sons was a result of things that had taken place over the past several days.\u00a0 All hell broke loose...22 cursed at and threatened 14, therefore 14 cursed back.\u00a0 I wasn't there thank goodness, but I know it wasn't pretty.\u00a0 Dad was able to coral all parties and to get them calm before anything too bad happened. 22 was quickly able to see that he had handled the matter in the wrong way, that aggressiveness only leads to more aggressiveness. \n \nDad was spent, physically and mentally by the time they all returned home.\u00a0 It was a very upsetting, embarrassing situation.\u00a0 Some of it did take place in full view of my younger son and his visiting nephew.\u00a0 Surely this news will travel and spread throughout the family back home. \u00a0 Questions will be raised, \"What the hell kind of parenting are you doing?\u00a0 Things in your house are totally out of control.\"\u00a0\u00a0 I understand his concern, but people back home probably do not fully understand the breadth of what it means to have a teenager with Autism.\u00a0 Raising teenagers is hard! Our neuro-typical teenage son wasn't a walk in the park. He's 22 years old and still doesn't make the best choices.\u00a0 So you can multiply that by 10 for one with Aspergers and by 20 for having two siblings with it in the same house.  \n \nI can't worry about judgments from others.\u00a0 I don't think anyone out there is the perfect parent with all the answers.\u00a0 Every person's situation is unique and we all have made some questionable parenting decisions.\u00a0 We are all just trying to do our best with the knowledge and love that we have for our children.\u00a0 I don't know a parent out there who has made it through the teen years totally unscathed.\u00a0\u00a0 I mean, don't they all just LOVE school?\u00a0 Oh and dating and sex when they are totally immature, yet hormonal isn't that fun? Let's not leave out the fact that they all think they know everything and we know absolutely nothing! \u00a0 Aren't all siblings just totally in love with one another singing \"Kumbaya\" every night by the fire?  \n \n14 has received a consequence as a result of not following directions.\u00a0 Asperger's  training tells us not to punish him for the actual meltdown itself.   Meltdowns can not be completely avoided.\u00a0 All we can do is try to reduce the  damage. Punishing someone with Aspergers for a meltdown is like punishing someone for swearing when they drop a brick  on their toe. \u00a0  However, what led to the meltdown was not following a simple instruction.\u00a0 Personally, I don't think it's easy for him to follow instructions when he has something else in his mind.\u00a0 Many of his actions and the actions of our younger son are an attempt to control their world where so many things are out of their control and don't work the way they think they should.\u00a0 Unfortunately, their father does not\u00a0 share this view.\u00a0 They live in the real world where rules are expected to be followed, whether we like them or not.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/08/hell-broke-loose.html", "title": "\nHell broke loose...\n"},

We've been through torturous mornings trying to get the teenager out of bed.\u00a0 It takes a good half an hour, full of water squirting, pleading, negotiating, trying my level best not to threaten or beat with a stick.  \n \nSo I'm feeling like crap thinking what can I do to make this easier for them.\u00a0 How can I ease the pain? I know I can not shield them from every growing pain that they will go through, including going to middle and high school.\u00a0 That doesn't mean I don't wish that I could.\u00a0 I put them both through the fire every day because I have no other choice.\u00a0 They need their education and they can't get it from me.\u00a0 I can not do it!\u00a0 They need to develop a tough skin and social skills.\u00a0 That won't happen with mom shielding them from everything difficult and painful.  \n \nEvery day this week, I have received emails and phone calls from with the caller I.D. saying, \"LISD\", which means one child or the others school is calling.\u00a0 Each time, my stomach balls up in a knot.\u00a0  What now?\u00a0  Two of the phone calls were, \"Mrs. Weaver can you come and pick up your son?\" One because, the oldest missed the bus on the first day coming home -two because -the youngest would not get on the bus because of the thunderstorm. \u00a0 All of the other calls and e-mails were in fact positive, informing me of a basically good day from the high school special ed. teacher. \n \nNow of course when they get home I say, \"How was your day son?\" With the ugliest frown they can muster I hear, \"It was horrible! I HATE (long list of everything that they hate)\".\u00a0 I probe for something positive.\u00a0 They just won't give it to me. I have to find out my looking at Facebook to read that the teenager had a better day.\u00a0 He would never just share that with me.  \n \nThe middle school special ed. teacher did call to let me know how impressed she and the rest of the team are with my son.\u00a0 \"He is self-advocating, participating and doing great!

He sent her return email message to give her an update. \n \nSo despite the thunderstorms, meltdowns and fights here at home, they both seem to be holding it together well at school.\u00a0 For that I am both happy and extremely proud.\u00a0 I am also eternally grateful to all of the angels around us that are giving us such love and support!  \n \nWe will make it\u00a0 through the fire...there may be a little smoke inhalation but nothing that will kill us.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/08/kuddos.html", "title": "\nKuddos\n"},

We live in central Texas where thunderstorms are the norm and though we have never been truly effected by a storm, my son's fear is very real.\u00a0 He doesn't like the sound, the vibration, and most of all the lack of control over the situation.\u00a0 He attempts to regain control by hiding out in the bathroom -for hours.\u00a0 And now he hides even at the threat of a storm -even if the chances are only 20%.\u00a0  You just never know!\u00a0  During the summer he would refuse to leave the house for days on end.  \n \n \nHe would like to control EVERYTHING in his life if he could.\u00a0 This is probably because there are so many things that ordinary people have control over, but he doesn't.\u00a0 He can not control his emotions.\u00a0 He can not control his thoughts.\u00a0 He can not turn his brain off at night when it's time to go to bed.\u00a0 He can not control his lack of control! \n \nWhen I arrive, he is pacing back and forth in the hallway near the front door --so focused on the storm he almost doesn't notice that I'm there.\u00a0 He is shaking...oblivious to how he may appear to his peers.\u00a0 It is what it is.\u00a0 There is no chance of him putting up any pretense.\u00a0 He is authentically SCARED! \n \n We make it home with a blanket over his head and his fingers in his ears to block out the sound.\u00a0 He rushes straight to the 1st floor restroom where he finds asylum from the noise and the vibrations.\u00a0 He asks me to bring in his supplies, his IPOD Touch, two pillows, a blanket, and his ear plugs.\u00a0 He turns on the Jackson Five loud to further drown out the sound. \n \n You add the anxiety of the storm to the anxiety of starting a middle school and you get spontaneous combustion.\u00a0 Then you throw in the mix of a pain in the ass brother who is also anxious and angry about his new school situation and you get volcanic eruption.\u00a0 Then you take away Dad who is out of town for the week, and you're left with Mom and Nana who have to coral the circus. Neither Nana or Mom are intimidating or strong enough to break up the physical confrontations, which on the outside are over something as small as, \"He's touching my juice box!\"\u00a0 But it's really about  my life feels like it's totally out of control and you're not making things any better! \n \n \nThey both have therapists one of whom seems to be somewhat effective, the other one is a joke.\u00a0 I called my health insurance plan and we arranged that they see the same therapist, to help them to help me to help all of us!\u00a0 I also found out, because I asked, not because anyone volunteered the information, that I have an additional \"Autism Benefit\".\u00a0 Which means I can actually get some in home behavioral therapy, as well as social skills training paid at 90%.\u00a0 Wow! Thanks for telling me.\u00a0 I am getting on that train today! \n \nIn last nights rant...my youngest son told me that I gave birth to him and I did a terrible job of 'making him' because he has too many problems.\u00a0 Crying -he went on for 20 minutes telling me why it's my fault that he is the way he is.\u00a0 All I could do is ache for him and when he let me, I held him and told him that I love him and I'm sorry for what he is going through.\u00a0 I promised that it would get better.\u00a0 I massaged his back hoping to rub away his pain.\u00a0 I implored him to take deep breaths and let it all go.\u00a0 He did...for the moment.\u00a0 I turned on a funny movie, \"Mousehunt,\" (thank God and HBO).\u00a0 I took immense pleasure in his genuine, enthusiastic laughter.  \n \nBefore he went to sleep I told him that despite how difficult this adjustment to middle school is, he is really doing well. \n\"Your teachers think you're awesome and smart.

That puts him ever so slightly behind the rest of the team.\u00a0 Now this is just a summer \"team\" workout.\u00a0 It's supposed to be fun, help you work on your strokes and your speed, etc.\u00a0 The facility is indoors, yet the 'garage like' doors were open to let in the sweltering heat and humidity.\u00a0 For a parent sitting on the side lines, it was like sitting in a steam room.\u00a0 I was sweating bullets! Watching him only added to the heat in my body. \n \nHe has this totally athletic-looking body, standing at about five foot nine and two-hundred pounds. When coaches look at him they see potential.\u00a0 Not to mention that he is black, living in a primarily white suburb.\u00a0 He is strong, but not exactly well coordinated, although, he is basically a good swimmer.\u00a0 On this first day he looked like a deer in the headlights.\u00a0  'Which way do I run? Huh? What? ' The entire group starts heading down the lane and he's just there...not moving.\u00a0 Like - 'what am I supposed to do again?' \u00a0 Logically you think, ' Well o.k. I didn't really here what the instructor said.\u00a0 I wasn't paying attention.\u00a0 Maybe I should just do what everybody else is doing.'  No he just there holding up the wall.\u00a0 I'm on the sidelines, (luckily far enough away that he can't here what I'm thinking) sending out into the universe,  'Move! Why are you not moving!?' \n \n \nFinally he gets going, but he's definitely not getting what it is they want him to do.\u00a0 Slowly he starts easing his way into it.\u00a0 It's a great workout, but he is physically out of shape, which is painfully obvious by the way he starts out with power but runs out of gas about three quarters of the way down the lane.\u00a0 As they move into the breast stroke, I see how much energy this really takes and I am impressed.\u00a0 I am so glad to see his body actually moving instead of sitting in front of the computer or at the table gobbling down an oversize bowl of cereal.\u00a0 Wow! If he keeps this up, even if he's not the best, or the fastest, at least he will slim down and loose some of the pounds that the medicine and his horrible diet have put on him this past year. \n \nAfterwards, he complains about how tired he is.\u00a0 He's hot and his stomach hurts.\u00a0 I rave to him about how well he did for his first day, how proud I am and what a good workout he had!

Thank you for sharing that with me.\u00a0 I had no idea!\" \n \nRed had told him that he'd been there last month.\u00a0 Which I'm sure made the coach think, ' You've been through a month of training and you still don't get it!?\" \u00a0 I explained to him, that he was here last month for an  \"evaluation\"  not for actual practice or training.\u00a0 Another light bulb went off.\u00a0 ' That explains a lot!'  \n \nThis gave me an idea to write a brief introduction to Red and Aspergers to hand out to the adults who will be working with him in a teaching or coaching capacity.\u00a0 You look at him, you listen to him talk and you think  totally normal kid .\u00a0 Then you see him in action and you wonder, ' What the hell?'  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/07/swim-team.html", "title": "\nSwim Team\n"},

Except for the fact that I couldn't call him either, and I worried continually.\u00a0 I did resist the urge and reminded myself\u00a0 to simply enjoy the peace.\u00a0 Art camp was great for the 11 year old.\u00a0 He enjoyed it immensely.\u00a0 Art has a calming zen-like effect over him, not to mention he is very gifted and continues to improve the more lessons he gets.\u00a0  \n \nAs for the teenager -we are going on week two of swimming and movie camp.\u00a0 He vehemently complains when it is time to go.\u00a0 Aspergers makes transitions difficult, sleep to wake, from computer to getting your ass into the next gear. \"I DON'T WANT TO GO!\"\u00a0 I hear this tune daily, at maximum volume. \n \nSo yesterday, it's time for swimming and I pull out a little ABA (applied behavior analysis) trick.\u00a0 If you cooperate I will buy you Skittles after class.\u00a0 A relatively simple, inexpensive reward.\u00a0 He agrees to cooperate.\u00a0 When it's time to go, I call him and he says, \"O.K.\" I end up calling him 10 more times before he comes down the stairs.\u00a0 We are late because of his delay.\u00a0 He gets down the stairs finally, and then he decides he wants a Pop Tart!\u00a0 A FREAKIN POP TART! Class starts in 10 minutes. \"If you had come down 15 minutes ago, you would have had time for a Pop Tart! Now you don't! Let's go!\"\u00a0 I literally have to block him from the cabinet and insist that he get in the car. He is 5' 9\", 200+ pounds, I am 5' nothing, (I won't tell you how many pounds.) By the time we get in the car, my head is throbbing.\u00a0 I swear I thought about stopping the car suddenly so he would bump his head on the dashboard! I  know...that's really bad, but this is called \"Confessions\" and at least I  didn't do it! This time! \n \n \nThis morning, he did not want to get up for Movie Camp.\u00a0 Why? Well, one -because he's completely ungrateful! Two -because he stayed up too late last night.\u00a0 Did I want to get up this morning? NO! Did I do so anyway? Of course. Did I do this so that I will open up my world and expose myself to something that will help me in my future career? Absolutely not!\u00a0 It takes me 30 plus minutes to get him out of bed. We try the old cold water towel trick. I felt like getting a Super-Soaker Uzi! By the time I dropped him off I had that anxious feeling in my chest -like I wanted to burst wide open.  \n \nSo much for signing him up for a bunch of crap to make it a more peaceful  summer.\u00a0 Next year I will try to find a camp where I can send him for a  month! I don't care how much it costs.\u00a0 I will get a job just to pay for it!  \n \n \nI know...he has Aspergers.\u00a0 These behaviors are to be expected\u00a0 (to a degree).\u00a0 It doesn't mean I have to like it.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/07/moment-of-pain.html", "title": "\nA Moment of Pain\n"},

Let the fighting begin! \n \nFor the past week and a half, the boys have been getting along great.\u00a0 After I had a talk with \"14\" about  Aspergers  and how it shows itself differently in both himself and his brother, he actually seemed to get it.\u00a0 Where '14' has an  extremely sensitive sight , '11' is extremely  sensitive to sound. \u00a0 I explained that while he sees things so well that other people don't even notice, his brother hears things a 100 times louder than most people do.\u00a0 Therefore, the sound of nail biting while it may be ignored by others, grinds on your brother's eardrums.\u00a0 This is why he totally freaks out when there is a thunderstorm.\u00a0 It's like someone is shooting fireworks at close range...indoors! Where as your most people may not pay much attention to your singing, your brother hears every crack in your not so well trained voice.\u00a0 (I didn't actually tell him his voice needs work.\u00a0 I didn't want to spoil his fantasy).\u00a0 I'm usually just so happy to hear him singing.\u00a0 You can't be sad while rocking out to Linkin Park at the same time. It's scientifically impossible.  \n \nSome of their stuff is just plain and simple sibling fighting, but it's exacerbated by their idiosyncrasies and over-the-top reactions.\u00a0 The two of them had a talk and decided that they would try their best to be  good brothers,  as they call it.\u00a0 It's been wonderful.\u00a0 However there must always be some kind of war going on in the house, so the reserved negative energy was directed towards me by \"14\". \u00a0 Hence, the reason I felt the need to get out of dodge last weekend. \n \n Little Boy Blue  was fairly content and agreeable.\u00a0 He was actually having a really good two weeks or so.\u00a0 I attribute that to the fact that his irritating sibling was spending a great deal of time out of the house going to camp and swim practice. In our house, there is seldom peace and tranquility. If there is silence...you wonder when will the next bomb go off. \n \nThis week's explosion belongs to  Little Boy Blue ... \n \nWe have a visitor in the house.\u00a0 Their cousin is here from Baltimore, Maryland. Man is he an awesome kid! I'm like...hey brother-in-law, can I trade? Anyway -At first my little  Blue  child was so happy to have him here, he could hardly contain himself.\u00a0 Of course, he wants to have total control over the agenda and really would like to not have his brother involved -at all. He has been ready to fight at the slightest infraction. \n \nTo top it off -we've had rain, threat of rain and thunderstorms for the past two days.\u00a0 Forget about it...he's miserable.\u00a0 He hasn't wanted to leave the house.\u00a0 He is a nervous, anxious wreck.\u00a0 He is making the  thunderstorm anxiety  bigger and bigger with each passing storm.\u00a0 He hides in the bathroom with the fan on, music playing and earplugs in his ears.\u00a0 We have even found him with complete camp set up in the middle of\u00a0 the night sleeping in the bathroom! Pillow, blankets, sleeping bag, etc.\u00a0 I implore him to stay in his bed. I try my best to distract him and keep him focused on other things.\u00a0 But once the lights are off and everyone is in bed, if he hears the slightest sound in the middle of the night, he's out of that bed and in the bathroom with the door locked! \n \nThe big boys went to Six Flags today with big, big brother \"22\".\u00a0  Blue  gladly sent them on their way for a day of roller coaster riding.\u00a0 I tried to get him to go out to lunch, which ordinarily is something he loves to do. After much discussion he agreed to go. As he was getting dressed he heard thunder.\u00a0 All bets were off.\u00a0 I even offered to take him to the Apple Store, which is his very favorite place on earth, -he even turned that down. \n \nHe is stir crazy, anxious, ready to fight, and just plain old blue.\u00a0 What is a mother to do?

{"date": "Thursday, December 3, 2009", "body": "\nIt started as a cold, but sunny, beautiful December morning. I woke up thinking about my mother's problems, which I won't get into detail about.\u00a0 I called her before I went to bed to see how her day went so it was the last thing on my mind before I went to bed.\u00a0 Let's just say, I'm concerned about her physical and mental health.\u00a0 She is being too stubborn to do anything about either one, but she doesn't mind complaining to me about both.\u00a0 She won't go to the doctor, she won't take anything over the counter that could possibly conflict with her prescribed medications.\u00a0 I don't get it.\u00a0 But, there isn't much I can do about it.\u00a0 I have my own issues to deal with so I have to let it go for now. \n \nNot long after both boys were off to school, the phone rings.\u00a0 It's a school district number.\u00a0  Great! Who forgot what...I think to myself.  The numbers have all changed this year, so I don't know them by heart.\u00a0 What I do know is that there is usually an issue, a problem, or a challenge of some sort to go along with the ringing telephone.\u00a0 It turns out that Cole is in need of a breathing treatment because he's wheezing.\u00a0 He'd only been at school for maybe an hour.\u00a0 I guess he didn't notice any tightness in his chest before I dropped him off.\u00a0 If I were an organized mom, I would have filled out the form and had his doctor sign it so that the nurse could give him the breathing treatment.\u00a0 Organization is not one of my gifts.\u00a0 I dash around looking for his extra tubing for the nebulizer, and/or for his extra inhaler.\u00a0 I find neither.\u00a0 I run over to the school and administer the medication myself.\u00a0 I do take the time to fill out the form and fax it to the doctor so that the next time...I don't have to make the trip. \n \nI come back home to clean myself up to run errands.\u00a0 As I am making my way out the door, the phone rings again.\u00a0 It's the school district.  What now?  This time it's the middle school -the school psychologist no less.\u00a0 \"I'm just calling to share information about a long conversation that I had with your son this morning.\"  When it rains...you know the rest! \u00a0 This conversation took place with the campus police officer.\u00a0 They are trying to make him understand that he can not keep bothering (basically harassing) this other student, because she will no longer be his friend.\u00a0 The Psychologist hoped that the officer's presence would make an impact on his thinking.\u00a0 However, she's afraid that it didn't.\u00a0 \"I am really beginning to believe that he can't help what he's doing. He does not have the ability to just let it go.\" At the same time, if he doesn't he could find himself having a real problem.\u00a0 As time goes on and he is in high school, or in a work environment, he will have to realize that he can not control other peoples thoughts and feelings, much less how they behave and whether or not they want to be friends or anything else with him.\u00a0 It's like he's living in his own world and he wants everyone else to live in it.\u00a0 You know that Frank Sinatra song, \"My Way\" well, that's the way he wants everything, despite the fact that it is impossible. \n \n Well... thanks for calling to share! You've just made my day! I'm wish I had a solution for you and for my knucklehead son, but I don't.\u00a0 I can not reach inside his brain and turn a switch to make him more reasonable.\u00a0 His therapist hasn't been able to, neither has his teacher, and neither have you obviously!\u00a0 \u00a0  She wasn't calling me for answers, just to keep me inform, which I really appreciate.\u00a0 Well...sort of.  \n \nThe problem is, that he can not wrap his mind around why this young lady has just decided not only to not be his friend anymore, but she doesn't speak to him and continues to be friendly to everyone else.\u00a0 \"I didn't do anything wrong.\" Which of course, is debatable, but it doesn't matter.\u00a0 He didn't have to do anything wrong for the girl to simply change her mind.\u00a0 Isn't that a girls right? Well in this case, the young lady's issues, don't have much to do with him.\u00a0 They are her own issues, from her past.\u00a0 However, as far as my son is concerned, they are very abstract and don't make any sense.  \n \nSo I finally get to run my errands and have a spot of lunch, which proved to be my most peaceful moment of the day.\u00a0 It's pretty cold outside and I had a delicious bowl of potato soup, before I high-tail it over to the elementary school to pick up my youngest.\u00a0 I see him walking across the yard, with no jacket on (the first thing I notice because it's freezing).\u00a0 As he gets closer, I see that his eyes are full of tears...real ones, not those synthetic ones that he puts on for my benefit with regularity.\u00a0 He gets in the car and breaks down.\u00a0 \"I just want to be normal so those kids will stop being mean to me.\u00a0 I wish they could just understand me. Why do I have to have autism?!\"\u00a0  \n \nMy heart is literally breaking...inside I ache for him.\u00a0 I try to remain calm and not let him see how upset I am. I am having flashbacks of this same conversation with his older brother at the exact same age, the difference being is that we didn't know at the time that he had autism.\u00a0 We just knew he had ADD.\u00a0 We didn't know anything about Aspergers.\u00a0 We both knew that he didn't fit in.\u00a0 \"I just want to laugh and have fun, like the rest of the kids.\u00a0 I just want to be happy,\" he said as he cried and fell into my arms.\u00a0  \n \nThrough his tears and holding mine back, I hug him and tell him that I love him. I tried to assure him hat he is so special and so smart.\u00a0 It's just too bad that those mean old kids don't get it. What's more, anyone who is mean to you isn't worth being friends with.\u00a0 Focus on the kids who are nice, who are understanding and sympathetic. At this age boys are trying to be assertive and cool, but they really don't have a clue.\u00a0 They will make you feel bad, because of their own insecurities.\u00a0 Of course at this point, that's an abstract concept that he doesn't understand.\u00a0 I hope he will some day soon.\u00a0 All he knows is that he wants to fit in today! \n \nI asked him if he wanted to go inside and talk to the school Psychologist. At first he said, \"That's not going to help. Nothing can help.\u00a0 It's my nature.\u00a0 She can't change my nature.\"  Uggh....another stab to my heart!  I calmly reply, \"Maybe together we can come up with some ideas to just make it easier for you to get through the day.\"\u00a0 He accepted that -at least for now. \n \nIt was just an ordinary winter day in my life.\u00a0 A day to be grateful that although we don't have much, I am so thankful to be present to support my sons.\u00a0 I am glad that when the phone does ring, I am there to take the call.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2009/12/when-it-rings-it-pours.html", "title": "\nWhen it Rings it Pours\n"},

It's very definition --a rest or relief from work. Not. When your job is taking care of children, and you have to take care of two children with Asperger's who do not deal with change easily, there is nothing relaxing or relieving about it.\u00a0 In fact, it is more work because you have to deal with them outside of their area of comfort. \n \nWe went to visit grandparents (my husbands dad and his wife). Their cousins also joined us at one point, so there were a lot of people sleeping in one house.\u00a0 Cole who is hypersensitive to sound, had a hard time sleeping on several nights. He doesn't want to sleep next to anyone, which makes juggling the space around even more interesting. Eating someone elses cooking is always a challenge, since they both have sensory issues when it comes to food. Then you have the grandparent's old school mentality, \"We don't believe in making all these different meals. All you have to do is...blah, blah, blah. He ate for me. It was no problem. Are you giving in to that?\"\u00a0 Of course no one is watching as they are literally gagging from the texture of mashed potatoes.\u00a0 \n \n \nThe good news is they did respond positively to their grandparents.\u00a0 I don't know if it was fear of what may happen if they didn't do as they were told, or just a greater desire to please them and look angelic in their eyes.\u00a0 Of course, that makes me look at myself and question weather or not I am actually doing a good job parenting them.\u00a0 Why can't I get them to eat their vegetables without the look on their faces as if I'm feeding them worms? Do I give in too much? They know I love them as much as the day is long -so are they taking advantage of me -playing me like a song on the radio? Probably to a degree.\u00a0 \n \nSo since we've been home, I've been cooking more and insisting that they at least eat a few bites of their vegetables.\u00a0 I am trying to make their meals a little healthier and cutting down on the fast food.\u00a0 No matter what I do, they still are not on their best behavior for me.\u00a0 I suppose that I can count it as a blessing that they do know how to pull it together with extended family and friends.\u00a0 No matter how I change my parenting style, they will always know that I am their mother and will feel more relaxed to be their most terrible selves for me exclusively. \n \nMost people share the best and the worst part of themselves with those who love them the most.\u00a0 It's a part of that unconditional love that we share.\u00a0 Aren't I lucky?\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/01/family-vacation-oxymoron.html", "title": "\nFamily Vacation -the Oxymoron\n"},

You can't use it.\" \n\"Um...excuse me. \u00a0I can't use my own laptop. \u00a0Surely, you're mistaken. \u00a0I will  think  about letting you use it after you get your breakfast.\" \n \nMoments later, he finally decides on pancakes and sausage. \u00a0He begins the process of making Bisquick (in a bottle) pancakes. \u00a0First he pours in the milk. \u00a0I taught him to use milk, not water. \u00a0It makes them taste a little better. \nHe grumbles, \"Ugghh!!! I always pour too much milk! It's past the line.\" \n\"No worries. \u00a0It usually needs a little extra milk anyway,\" I say. \nNext he attempts to put in a tablespoon of raw sugar. Some of it spills onto the counter. \n\"Ugghh! I'm always spilling everything!\"I\u00a0come over and pick up the bisquik bottle. \u00a0I pick up the same spoon, tilt the head of the bottle over the sugar container and spoon in the sugar. \n\"You see this way, if you spill any. \u00a0It goes back into the container.\" \nHe frowns and rolls his eyes. \u00a0\"I need the vanilla!\" \n\"You do? \u00a0That's nice.\" She's unsure if this is a demand, a request, or just general information. \u00a0Surely, it couldn't be a request with the tone of voice that he is using. \n\"Well...do we have any?\" \n\"Yes we do. \u00a0It's in the pantry.\" \nHe gets it out of the pantry. \u00a0He starts to pour the vanilla into the cap of the vanilla bottle. \u00a0I stop him in his tracks, attempting to avoid another disaster. \u00a0I pour it for him. \n \nI can sympathize with his grumpiness, in part because I have a bit PMS myself. \u00a0I've been especially grumpy for the past few days. \u00a0In fact, if had this personality all month, \u00a0I wouldn't \u00a0like myself very much. \n \nBlue is stomping and grunting at every possible turn ...fussing about anything and everything. \n\"I'm going to record you, so you can hear how grumpy you sound.\" \n\"This is private!!!\" \n\"Yes...you're right. \u00a0It's my own private hell. Thank you very much.\" \n \nHe tries to open the sausage package. \u00a0He can't get it open fast enough. \n\"I can't do this! I give up!\" He storms around the kitchen huffing and puffing. \n\"Can't you just do this for me?!\" he says in a nasty, directive tone. \n\"Um...if you can just change your tone and speak to me respectfully. \u00a0I'll be glad to help you.\" \nHe is perfectly capable of doing this himself, but in his agitated frame of mind, I know it will only go from bad to worse. Once he corrects his tone and asks nicely, I agree to take over for him. \u00a0No...we can not work together. \u00a0That would be a disaster. \n \nFinally, I finish up and he sits down at the table to eat. \u00a0The attitude slowly creeps back up. \n \n\"This food is really escalating me!\u00a0I hate this syrup! It pours too fast!\" \n Yeah...that was my attempt at cutting out high fructose corn syrup. \u00a0I bought authentic, very expensive maple syrup. Of course, he hates it. \u00a0He is used to Mrs. Buttersworth.\u00a0 \nHe moans and groans showing contempt for the meal that I helped him prepare. The angrier he gets the more problems he seems to have. \n \n\"You know...when you fight with the food it has a tendency to fight back!\" I say and laugh at my own \u00a0joke. \u00a0The grumpy teenager is not amused. \n \n \nHe finally finishes eating. \u00a0He takes his paper plate and throws it into the trash can. \u00a0As he storms out of the kitchen he says, \"If this kitchen were a restaurant...I'd only give this breakfast 2 stars!\" \n \n \n \n\"Wow! \u00a0Well that's rude. \u00a0I tell you what...next time I won't help you at all.\"\u00a0 \n \n\"No! I didn't mean you. \u00a0I meant the kitchen ...like if this were a restaurant.\" \n \n\"Yeah...but I am the cook in this restaurant.\"\u00a0 \n \n\"Well...that's not what I meant!\" he yells. \"You turn around everything that I say!\" \n \nYeah...sure. \u00a0I turn it around.  \n \nHe finally goes up the stairs and his phone rings. \u00a0He yells down the stairs, this time his voice actually sounds a little more pleasant.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\"J is on the phone. \u00a0He wants\\ to know if you can drop us off at the movies later.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n\"Tell J. that you've been extremely rude to your mom. \u00a0And when you turn that around, you will call him back. Because right now, I'm not taking you anywhere.\" \n \nMeanwhile, I make myself a few pancakes and warm up the now room temperature sausage. \u00a0Mmm mmm! \u00a0Delicious! I enjoy my breakfast in peace. \u00a0In fact ..I give the\u00a0meal 4 stars, including and especially, the expensive, 100% pure maple syrup. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SrY5Qzoc5ag/Udr-sXBZwCI/AAAAAAAABPA/4fQQGCszDHg/s1600/images-3.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/07/grumpy-teenager-makes-breakfast.html", "title": "\nGrumpy Teenager Makes Breakfast\n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 7, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n Editorial Note: This is a post was previously published about 2 years ago. \u00a0It is basically What to do during a meltdown and also what NOT to do. \u00a0I received a comment on this post today from a Mom who said this helped her get through a tough morning with her son. \u00a0I hope it helps you as well... \n \n ~Karen \n \nA few months ago I attended a parent training on how to deescalate a meltdown in a child with autism and other special needs behavior issues. \u00a0Well this morning all that training went straight out the window. \u00a0I did everything I wasn't supposed to do as Red was building himself up into meltdown mode. \u00a0The result was spontaneous combustion. \u00a0It was like adding flame to the fire in order to put it out. \u00a0Somehow, \u00a0that never works. \n \nI've just been so sick of his disrespectful attitude and part of me believes he should know better by now. \u00a0I mean no matter how many times you yell, scream and become obnoxious, it is not going to get you what you want. \u00a0If what you're doing is not working for you...don't you think you should try something else? Well that would be logical and Red in his animated, fixated, meltdown state is anything but logical. \n \nThis morning he started in on me about having a friend come over for the day. \u00a0He immediately sabotages his chances by telling me that I'm mean and unfair...loudly, more than once. \u00a0I was done. \u00a0I swiftly told him that it was not happening, no friend would be coming over today, and if he kept going he would loose another privilege.  \n \nHe felt like he'd already lost the battle of getting what he wanted, so why should he stop? \u00a0He kept going and going until chairs were on the floor and a closet door was being run into and pounded with his fist. Privileges? \u00a0Lost, hasta la vista, sayanara, adios! \n \nIn this middle of his antics, he informs me that he has seen meltdowns worse than this at school. \u00a0I don't give a flying u-know what, what he's seen others do at school. \u00a0This is not acceptable in my house.  \n \nI lost it! \u00a0I started to hear Bill Cosby in my head, \"I brought you into this world...I can take you out!\" \u00a0I remembered once hearing an African-American mother say, I believe it was on Oprah, \"You always have to make your kids believe that you're a little bit crazy!\"  \n \nI felt in this instance, I had to let him know that I wasn't taking any crap from him just because dad wasn't home. \u00a0I don't usually go there...but I went there. Wrong answer mom. \u00a0This kid has autism. \u00a0In the moment, I completely lost sight of that.  \n \nWhat started off as manipulation, and his regular bitching and moaning, was turning into a meltdown. Now there are many things I could have done at this point to keep this situation from escalating. \u00a0Once around this point, I just gave him a big hug, which completely threw him off, and stopped him right in his tracks. \u00a0I didn't do this this time. \u00a0I was too pissed off --too emotional. \n \nIf dad was here, by his stature and the mere sound of his voice, he would be able to move Red into the safety of his room where he could destroy his own crap. \u00a0Unfortunately, Dad is not home and Red is in my living room where there are many breakable items. \u00a0What do I do? \u00a0I grab a belt, not really having intention of having to actually use it, but to make him think that I would in order to get him into his room. \u00a0Again -wrong answer mama. \u00a0When he wouldn't move, I had to make good on my threat. \n \nNow -I know that I can't really hurt this boy who is twice my size. \u00a0So what I was really doing was making him feel like he was under attack \u00a0-that his back was up against the wall...literally. \n \nThat is exactly what I was  instructed  during my training  NOT TO DO!!! \n \n Here is what you're supposed to do during an Aspergers meltdown as the educated adult: \n \n1) \u00a0Remain in control, when they are loosing control, in hopes they will respond to your calmness. \n \n2) \u00a0Empathize with them, let them know you understand how they must be feeling. \u00a0(Even if you don't agree with it.)  \nFor example: \u00a0\"Are you feeling _____? What are you _____ about? \u00a0So you're feeling _____? \n \n3) \u00a0Keep your voice soft they will be more inclined to listen to you if you're speaking softly. \u00a0Don't be antagonistic. \u00a0i.e. telling him you don't give a flying -you know what. \u00a0(I didn't actually say that, but I did say a barrage of other things and used a few curse words to highlight and put an exclamation on my point.) WRONG! \n \n4) \u00a0Give them the opportunity to think about what they are trying to accomplish. \u00a0This should slow them down. \u00a0For example: \u00a0What have you tried? How well has that worked? What are you willing to do? This puts the creative problem solving into their court. \n \nI did none of the above. \u00a0I did the  opposite  of everything above. \u00a0This took the meltdown to a whole new level. \n \nAfterward, he calms down and says to me, \"When you grabbed the belt...I felt like you were attacking me? \u00a0Can you please not do that next time?\"  \n \nHe also said, \"I know I was wrong, but I'm not going to say I'm sorry because you're probably not ready to accept it.\" \u00a0He's learning! \n \n\"You're right, I should loose my privilege to talk on the phone today. \u00a0Maybe talking to (this particular friend) does get me too wound up. \u00a0Maybe I shouldn't talk to him as much.\" Ya think??? \n \nIt's amazing how logical he is when he is lucid. \n \nGuess I \u00a0could say the same for myself.  \n \nThese are my \"Confessions.\" \u00a0It takes a lot of humility to be able to tell this truth here. \u00a0I do it in hopes that I can help some of you when you go through a meltdown with a teenager with autism. \u00a0Hopefully, you will do better than I did in this instance. \n_____________________ \n \n This training was given by a special education trainer in our school district. \u00a0 Sama Training \u00a0is Satori Alternatives to Managing aggression.

{"date": "Wednesday, July 3, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n The Tale of 2 Dinner Parties tells the story of two different parties and two very different sides of of my \u00a017 year-old autistic son, Red.\u00a0 He can present as a mature, creative, loving, and caring soul.\u00a0 He can also be an argumentative, impulsive, loud, ball of teenage angst, attitude and defiance.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Depending on the circumstances his insecurities can get the best of him --thus bringing out the competitive side of his nature. When he feels like he is not winning at this self-imposed competition,\u00a0 we see more impulsiveness, lack of self-control and attention-seeking behaviors.\u00a0 This side of him is exacerbated when he is surrounded by his entire, immediate family, his little brother who takes every opportunity to point out his flaws and his father, who demands his respect. He competes for the alpha-male position with his dad and his brother.\u00a0 Me? I just generally annoy him and require him to do too many things that he does not want to to.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n We can also see this side of him in the high-school environment where he is surrounded by peers. \u00a0There, we also see this self-imposed competition. \u00a0He wants to be like everyone-else and sees himself as different, and therefore --unhappy. \u00a0Subsequently, we see a lot of negative behaviors. \u00a0The only way to keep him out of the downward spiral is to have him heavily engaged in positive activities, that add to his self-esteem, \u00a0such as working with peers with more severe disabilities or being engaged in his first love, video-editing. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n In is the second Tale of a Dinner Party, we are invited to the home of one of my fellow autism bloggers Phat Jaye of  \"Find My Eyes\"  .\u00a0 Jaye has two children, precious Jade, age 3 and Jack who is 6.\u00a0 Jack is on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum, with many behaviors and ways similar to the way Red was at Jack's age. \u00a0 We thought it would be a great idea to get the two boys together in hopes that in some ways they would identify with one another.\u00a0 I also love meeting children on the spectrum because of the unique way that they see the world.\u00a0 Each one of them are like precious snowflakes --specially created human beings. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Jaye and I met online through a bloggers group on Facebook.\u00a0 We connected almost instantly.\u00a0 We are both kind of witty, smart-ass writers who are willing to reach out, share and help a fellow autism parent in whatever way that we can.\u00a0 I will also admit, I have always enjoyed having males as friends in my lifetime.\u00a0 However, the opportunity to do so has dwindled\u00a0 since I got married, moved to Austin and became a full-time mother.\u00a0 I work at home. \u00a0I write and provide personal care services to my children, my mother and my husband. \u00a0I do get involved in volunteer opportunities, most of which leave me surrounded by women. What can I say?\u00a0 I love my sister/friends and have many that I am extremely close to\u2026but sometimes, women come along with drama that I don't need in my life.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n Me and my friend Phat Jaye!\u00a0 \n \n \n After connecting with Jaye, reading his blog and getting to know his 6 year-old son Jack, I also wanted to meet the woman behind Jaye --his wife Julie.\u00a0 They seemed like an awesome team of parents who are doing everything within their power to meet the needs of their children.\u00a0 This includes Jaye being a work-at-home dad while his wife Julie works as an attorney. \u00a0Julie and I also became personal friends on Facebook, thus getting to know each other a little better. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Me, Julie and Princess Jade \n \n \n I have quite a few friends, both male and female who work at home so that they can be more readily available to their children. \u00a0This includes my brother who does a helluva job playing soccer dad to his two-youngest children.\u00a0 What can I say?\u00a0 I love a fella who is man enough to put his children first.\u00a0 It's not easy putting your own career goals on the shelf for a while, so that you can be there, front and center for your kids.\u00a0 A man who takes care of his kids and who cooks!\u00a0 Now that is sexy! I think Jaye cooks. \u00a0I've seen pictures of his grilling prowess. \u00a0 \u00a0He didn't cook the night we came for dinner.\u00a0 But I still love him!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n So back to the party \u2026when we first arrive, Jaye gives me a big old-bear hug.\u00a0 I introduce him to Red and I meet 3 year-year old Jade, the woman in charge of the house.\u00a0 Julie hasn't come in from work yet.\u00a0 Jack is chillin in his room, with his IPad after a hard day of summer school and behavior therapy. \u00a0I can't wait to meet him!\u00a0Dad prods him to come out and say hello, which he does with a bit of hesitation.\u00a0  I mean who cares about company when you've got your IPad right?  Shortly afterwards, Julie comes home and we hug like old-girlfriends.\u00a0 I fall in love with her. Instantly.\u00a0 The warmth of her heart shows in her smile and in the way that she greets me.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n We pop some wine and everyone sits down at the table to eat together.\u00a0 Julie and Jaye are engaging conversationalist.\u00a0 What is really awesome, is that they engage with Red about high school, friends, and his interests in art and video editing.\u00a0 Jaye identifies with Red's hatred of all things high-school, telling him that he really didn't get into the people all that much when he was there and couldn't wait to get out.\u00a0 He tells him that college was a much better place because he started to meet more like-minded people who shared many of the same interest. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Me? I am fascinated by Jack and Jade, their youth, and innocence.\u00a0 I try to engage in conversation with them.\u00a0 They are both beautiful redheads, Jack with blue eyes, and I believe Jades were a shade of hazel green.\u00a0 Julie and Jaye made sure that Jack plugged in to us and engaged in conversation with Red.\u00a0 It was a touching moment when Red told him, \"I have autism too.\" It was kind of like\u2026it's cool man.\u00a0 No worries. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Now don't think that this party was completely behavior free.\u00a0 Like Red, Jack does not always appreciate parent directed activities.\u00a0 He wants to do what he wants to do.\u00a0 I love the fact that once Julie came through the door, she took over with the kids.\u00a0 It wasn't like\u2026I worked all day.\u00a0 I'm tired.\u00a0 You've been home all day.\u00a0 You deal with the kids.\u00a0 They didn't just allow the kids to do whatever they wanted, and not do what they did not feel like doing, to include socializing. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n When Jack starts getting upset because he wants his IPad and doesn't want to talk anymore.\u00a0 Julie takes him to his room, and has a little chat with him.\u00a0 When he returns, he has a few questions for both Red and I.\u00a0 He asks them, actually makes an effort to make more eye-contact, and awaited our answers.\u00a0 Once he is done, Julie is\u00a0 all too happy to give him his Ipad back and he is\u00a0 just as happy to get it. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Huh!  I think to myself.\u00a0  This is what I mean what I say parenting looks like.\u00a0I gotta get me some of that!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n No doubt, this is a benefit of the behavior therapy that they have on board at this early stage in Jack's life.\u00a0 We didn't have the benefit of the proper diagnosis and early intervention therapy for Red or Blue.\u00a0 They both had speech therapy, as they were speech delayed.\u00a0 They also had some Occupational Therapy, early on to address some developmental issues.\u00a0 However, Red wasn't officially diagnosed with autism \u00a0until age 12, in the 6th grade.\u00a0 Blue was diagnosed shortly thereafter, at the end of his 4th grade year. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n After Jack goes to his room, Julie and Jaye give Red the floor to talk about whatever his heart desires.\u00a0 We talk about everything from high school, to music (rock & roll, heavy metal, and of course, Christian rock).\u00a0\u00a0We talk\u00a0movies, videography, editing and art. \u00a0Jaye is a published writer, I beg him to show us some of his work. \u00a0We talk about Red's goals post high-school.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n We even discuss a little religion.\u00a0 Yep! Red has to bring his Christianity into almost every conversation.\u00a0 When it comes to Aspergers, there are no taboo subjects, no filter on what comes out of his mouth.\u00a0 But it is fine. \u00a0We all roll with it. I am just thankful he doesn't bring up girls and sex!\u00a0 That is in the forefront of his mind these days. \u00a0Much to my dismay, he brought this up at our last  dinner party  \u00a0with friends.  Ugh!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Red revels in the positive attention.\u00a0 He presents as a mature, creative, thoughtful and caring soul.\u00a0 This is the other side of his personality -the side that I hope will prevail someday.\u00a0 There was no anger\u2026no competition from his brother, or his father for attention.\u00a0 It was all about him, Jack,\u00a0 and of course the boss lady, princess Jade.\u00a0 Julie and Jaye saw Red as a peer role model for their son Jack. \u00a0 Can you imagine that? My son? \u00a0A peer role model!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Red with his new friend Jack \n \n \n This is the side of Red I hope to see more of once he graduates from high-school.\u00a0 He is such a great person when put into the right environment.\u00a0 He seems to do so much better socially with adults, or with people who are younger than him.\u00a0 Julie and Jaye took the time to get to know him.\u00a0 They showed sincere interest in the way that he sees the world.\u00a0 They asked him to draw for them and sign the drawings that he made. \u00a0 He showed them one of his editing projects online.\u00a0 They praised his work. They didn't seem to mind his dominance in the conversation.\u00a0 They got their words and questions in when they could.\u00a0 They were patient.\u00a0 They were kind.\u00a0 These are traits that he won't find in the average peer of his age. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n And I must say, he is blessed with a couple of really good friends, who do get him.\u00a0 They love and accept him for exactly who he is.\u00a0 He is also blessed with a number of adults in his life, who stand with him and behind him.\u00a0 They look at him as a loving soul\u2026with a good spirit.\u00a0 They see beyond some of the behaviors, they actually understand some of the anger.\u00a0 They don't judge him. They mentor him and let him know that he is okay the way that he is.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Before we leave, Jack and Jade are dressed for Bed, but they come out to say their good-byes.\u00a0 Jack has a burst of energy and he is jumping up and down, talking excitedly, I think it was something about the moon or the stars.\u00a0\u00a0Before we head to the car\u2026he gives Red and I a great.big.hug!\u00a0 My night is made.\u00a0 Yes. \u00a0We have certainly made some new friends.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Thank you Julie, Jay, Jack and Jade for loving and accepting my son.\u00a0 We will be here to watch Jack grow into his full-potential as an adult on the spectrum, who will be more than okay because he has parents like you behind him.\u00a0 I hope that sooner than later, you will be able to see Red do the same.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n You can read more about Jaye's perspective on meeting Red  \" You've Got A Friend In Me\" here.  \u00a0 You can also follow\u00a0 Find My Eyes on Facebook . \u00a0Tell him I sent ya!\u00a0 \n \n You can also read about the\u00a0 First Dinner Party here.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://phatjaye.blogspot.com/", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LnHtYKKwtL4/UdRgjPzhmPI/AAAAAAAABOg/Cpzgsy7btJM/s612/1004727_4943709080329_1840921540_n.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vRsBKu0luYo/UdRgp4hOeLI/AAAAAAAABOs/qqeWZGXAfKA/s612/1003838_4943721840648_800239496_n.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h3rxjmKKiO4/UdRgvQ8mC0I/AAAAAAAABO0/Hiln6qspxNo/s480/1013410_4943714240458_968530623_n.jpg", "http://phatjaye.blogspot.com/2013/06/youve-got-friend-in-me.html", "https://www.facebook.com/FindMyEyes?fref=ts"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/07/a-tale-of-two-dinner-parties-part-ii.html", "title": "\nA Tale of Two Dinner Parties -Part II\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 30, 2013", "body": "\n \nI laid my head down on the table in the middle of the sandwich joint. \u00a0I just couldn't hold it up any more. \u00a0I couldn't hold myself together one moment longer. \nMy heart heavy, my chest tightening -I just needed to take a moment.  \nWhen I lifted my head, a guy comes over to my table... \n\"Can I take that for you mam?\" he said, looking at the sandwich basket on the table.  \n\"Sure...go ahead. Thank you,\" I reply. \n \nThen I saw him. \u00a0My tall, handsome husband appeared out of nowhere wearing his new sexy, tinted glasses (yes I find glasses sexy) and just enough of a smile on his face to tell me his thought ~ I know I am what you need right now. \u00a0 He appeared in this moment, just as I was about to fall apart. \n \nHe called me just as I was leaving my last errand. \u00a0He wanted to check on me as he was driving back into town. \u00a0I told him I was going to grab a bite and where. \u00a0He had stops to make and was tired from his drive from Houston. \u00a0I didn't expect him to come, but I was so glad that he did.  \nHe never looked so good to me, as he did in that moment. \nWell maybe he has. \u00a0He seems to get more handsome with maturity. \u00a0Whatever the case may be ...it sure felt like my perfectly, handsome knight had arrived to rescue me. \n \nHe sat down in the booth right next to me and said, \"Something told me to come to you.\" \nWith that the tears that had been fighting, began to fall. \u00a0They poured from my eyes. \u00a0I was able to let it all go. His presence was just what I needed to allow me to let it all out. \n \nI let it happen again. \u00a0I have buried myself underneath the avalanche of my children's needs. \nI'm feeling like I can't breathe. \nI'm gasping for air.  \nI'm trying to hold it together for them. \nI am aching for them. \nI'm turning front flips and back flips to keep Blue's level of stress down, and no matter how much I do ...it's.never.enough. \n \nI know deep down that I'm doing way too much. \u00a0Again, I have cut off my entire life, seldom seeing friends, minimal exercise, and very little writing. Not much of a life -at all. \nWe have had the occasional quickie date night whenever we can sneak one in between drop offs and pick ups. \u00a0Even the date nights are often cut short to run home to some minor catastrophe.  \n \nAs a mother, it's so hard to see my child so miserable, feeling so bad about himself, feeling so unaccepted in the world, feeling so out of control.  \nBlue says things like... \nI want this pain to stop. \nWhy does my life have to be like this? \nWhy doesn't anyone like me? \n \nThey both need me to listen to them. \nThey need to vent. \nThey need to process their feelings every.day.all.the.time.  \nI am on overload! \n \n \nIf I say nothing they get angry.\u00a0 \n \nIf I say too much...they disagree. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \nI try to help ...I'm helping the wrong way.\u00a0 \n \nI just can not fucking win! \n \nWhen I balk or say, \n\"I can't take anymore!\" \nBlue ends up with hurt feelings. \nHe starts crying and says, \"I don't mean to hurt you mom. \u00a0I'm such a terrible person.\"  \nThis\u00a0makes me want to suck it up and let him dump on me more, but... \nI'm human. \nI have limits.  \nHe has to know that. \n \nSo on this day, in this moment, in the arms of my knight, in the middle of a freakin' sandwich shop ...I was able to have a good, cathartic cry.  \nI was assured that I am loved. \nI am enough.  \nIn fact, I'm more than enough. \n \nThis is love. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mgbb1O5H2uw/UnEe8kKoqiI/AAAAAAAABU0/5hfeffn45Ro/s1600/knight.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/10/my-knight.html", "title": "\nMy Knight \n"},

{"date": "Thursday, May 2, 2013", "body": "\n \n I have a best friend and kindred sister that I've never met in person...at least not yet. \u00a0We met through this blog a couple of years ago. \u00a0We became Facebook friends. \u00a0We e-mailed each other privately. \u00a0She started sending me these wonderful blessings --very uplifting messages that she writes and sends out to a large e-mail group of people that she has met along her path of life. \u00a0Her writing is filled with love, wisdom and humor. \u00a0I feel warmth in my heart and a sense of peace after reading anything that she writes. \u00a0She inspires me to be a more loving being.\u00a0 \n \n I encouraged her to turn her blessings into a blog. \u00a0You can check out her writings at  \"My Cloud of Peace\" . \u00a0 \n \n Elena is the mother of 3 fascinating, very special boys, two teenagers who drive her nuts, and her youngest, G3 is now a 4th grader. \u00a0All of the boys have these wonderful names that start with G. \u00a0G3, is diagnosed with ADHD and Aspergers. \u00a0 \n \n I've never met G3 either, but I have come to love him as one of my own because of his beautiful, brilliant mind, \u00a0his keen sense of humor, and his fearlessness. He is going to be one of those people who changes the world someday, in fact he already has changed my world. \u00a0He is already\u00a0 following in his mama's footsteps. \n \n I bring to you my friend  Elena. .. \n \n \u00a0 \n \n When Karen said, \u201cYou should be a guest writer for my blog\u201d, I was cracking up\u2026 what could I possibly write about that would be as fabulous as the things she writes? \u2026 She suggested I write about the new school program that G3 is in\u2026 hmmmm? I still wasn\u2019t convinced... the program is so wonderful that there is nothing eventful or funny to write about.. I have no communication with the school or the teachers\u2026 except for the little slip of paper G3 brings home daily that gives a conduct \u201cgrade\u201d for the day\u2026 that\u2019s it.. no phone calls.. no emails.. no drama\u2026 nothing\u2026 \n \n It took me an entire year to get G3 evaluated\u2026 every time he was sent to the office and written up and suspended, I requested an IEP, but nothing would ever happen\u2026. He was suspended 47 days and was failing 3rd grade.. fortunately, in Florida, they have a State-wide test called the FCAT that assesses whether a student has learned everything that he needs to know to pass\u2026 so, technically, a kid can be an \u201cA\u201d student and still score poorly on the test and would have to take remedial classes to pass\u2026 OR.. as in G3\u2019s case, a kid can have \u201cF\u2019s\u201d on their report card and score 3 (it\u2019s a 1-5 scale with 1 being the lowest) and be promoted to the next grade\u2026 well, G3 scored 4.. so, he was on his way to the 4th grade.. hurray!! .. NOT... he needed help, I needed help, but no one was helping us.. all they kept saying is, \u201che is so brilliant, we don\u2019t understand what the problem is..\u201d .. really? You don\u2019t understand? He has a diagnosis from a Neurologist that says he has ADHD combined type and Aspergers\u2026 what\u2019s not to understand? He needs accommodations.. \u201cOh, okay, well, we have to document that in order to request an IEP\u2026 we\u2019re going to tolerate his behavior during the evaluation period and not suspend him ..\u201d \u2026.. \u201creally? Gee, thanks\u201d \u2026 \n \n So\u2026 that\u2019s exactly what happened\u2026. And we endured the torture\u2026. he was doing everything possible to get suspended.. and I was listening to the \u201cplay-by-play\u201d of how horrific he was behaving\u2026 how none of the other students were able to learn anything with him around\u2026 how it was just totally unacceptable.. how he was depressed.. how I wasn\u2019t consistent with him.. how I was too \u201cfree-spirited\u201d \u2026 and on and on\u2026 but, we sucked it up and got the IEP meeting\u2026 I couldn\u2019t stand these people already\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to hear anything they had to say about my kid\u2026 and they had a lot to say\u2026. And all the while, my child with his hoodie on and his head down listening to \u201ctheir\u201d assessment\u2026 all I kept thinking to myself was how lucky they were that I was tired of fighting them\u2026 I just wanted him out of that school\u2026 \n \n Another teacher joins the meeting towards the end\u2026 like an \u201cAmbassador of Goodwill\u201d \u2026 she explains this \u201cspecial\u201d program to us\u2026 the kids are held accountable for their behavior\u2026 they work on a \u201cpoint\u201d system that fluctuates like the stock market\u2026 there are 2 teachers and an aide for the 9 students in the class\u2026 I\u2019m thinking, \u201cStop talking woman.. of course we are going to that program and like right now, please!!!!.. There are only 2 elementary schools in Miami-Dade County that have this program\u2026 we chose the school where the District Psychologist visits so that G3 wouldn\u2019t feel as if he was totally \u201calone\u201d at his new school.. at least he would know her.. and he liked her, which was a plus\u2026 \n \n \n \n He, of course, was apprehensive, but when he arrived to a classroom of 9 boys, who all love \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed\u201d.. well\u2026 He was in heaven!!\u2026 Yeaaaay!!! \u2026. I, of course, was apprehensive, but when I picked him up and he wouldn\u2019t stop talking about all the \u201cpoints\u201d he received for his good behavior... and how cool his \u201cnew\u201d friends were\u2026 and how he loved his THREE teachers\u2026 YES\u2026\u2026 Amen. Amen. He was finally where he was supposed to be\u2026 Anyway, I decided to write this because tomorrow, May 2nd, is \u201cTake your kid to work day\u201d (oh that\u2019s fun..lol\u2026. let\u2019s be real.. it\u2019s a day off for every one\u2026. I get the field trip form and I say, \u201cG3, you can stay home with Papa\u2026 he would love that..\u201d \u201csure, Mama\u2026. I can play games all day\u201d \u2026 (That was last week) \u2026 Yesterday, I ask him if he turned the field trip form in and he said, \u201cNo, Mama.. I am going to school because only one friend will be there and I don\u2019t want him to be alone.\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026 Hmmmm\u2026 well, alright. Today, when I pick him up, I comment it to his teacher and she said, \u201cWell, NO ONE turned their field trip forms in\u2026 G3 convinced them ALL come to school\u2026 I feel so blessed\u2026 lol\u201d \u2026(I think she was being sarcastic) but I responded, \u201cOh, Ms. May... I feel so blessed, too\u2026 my child loves you so much that he WANTS to come to school and WANTS all his friends to come, too\u2026. Last year, at this time, he cried every day because he NEVER wanted to go to school\u2026 so, thank you for all that you do\u2026 you have made a huge difference in his life\u2026\u201d \u2026. She just kind of stared at me for a moment and then said, \u201cYou know, I really love what I do... thank you for reminding me.\u201d \n \n Wow, I have written a lot\u2026 and I guess all I really wanted to say was\u2026 There is hope\u2026 do not give up\u2026 everyone has a place in society\u2026 and with determination, you can help your child find their place\u2026 there are good people and teachers and other kids who will \u201cget\u201d your kid\u2026 and they will love them\u2026 and they will want them to succeed\u2026 your child can be happy.. you can be happy\u2026 I know it\u2019s hard to imagine\u2026 and believe me, not every day is an \u201cA\u201d day, but the slate is wiped cleaned\u2026 and the next day, everyone begins with the same opportunity to have an \u201cA\u201d that day\u2026 the program works\u2026 since G3 has been in that school, he has received the \u201cPerfect Attendance\u201d award for two grading periods!!! \n \n Last week, I met a woman at tumbling that was having the same kind of issues with her son\u2019s school \u2026 I gave her all the information about our new school.. all the contact information for the District Psychologist\u2026 all the email addresses.. everything that I could to help her\u2026 and at the end of the week, she said, \u201cThanks.. I\u2019ve made some calls\u2026 I written some emails\u2026 and I have HOPE now.\u201d \u2026. \n \n \n \n \n \n Awesome, right? That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about for us\u2026.

{"date": "Thursday, May 30, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \nIt's a Sunday afternoon. \u00a0Hubby has taken Blue to a day at the car races. \u00a0Red has gone to church. \u00a0My mom is out of town and I have the entire house to myself. I am completely enjoying the peace and quiet until ...Red bursts through the front door. \n \n \n \nAfter months of not attending this particular church because of not getting along with a friend there, he finally went back to say goodbye to the Youth Pastor, who is moving away to another church. \u00a0He had finally stopped perseverating on the lost friendship and his focus in attending this church was simply to say his goodbyes. \u00a0He has never had an outburst of anger in a church environment so we believe this is a fairly safe move. \u00a0Apparently, we were wrong.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs soon as he sees his old friend, he was instantly triggered into negative feelings and anger all over again. \u00a0This friend in particular, is also on the spectrum. \u00a0He is very high-functioning, making good grades, driving, and he has a girlfriend. \u00a0As far as Red is concerned he is also \"popular\" because he knows a lot of people. People say hello to him and he has good enough social skills to engage in a small-talk exchanges with a lot of people. \u00a0Red looks up to this kid because of his ability to overcome the many limitations of his disability. \u00a0Because this boy has been involved in the church extensively for a number of years, he receives a great deal of attention there. \u00a0Red was quite frankly, enamored by this, and became rather fixated on the friend and wanted to be \"like\" him. \u00a0This of course, made the friend feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed to say the least.  \n \nYes -this friend has a lot going on and is functioning very well. \u00a0He does however, have Aspergers and a great deal of anxiety. \u00a0Although he may appear to have it all going on, he still has his quirks and it appears to me that one of them is that he likes his friends ...but some of them he would like to keep at a comfortable distance. \u00a0He doesn't want to hang out all the time. \u00a0Sometimes, he needs to just decompress and be alone. \u00a0Red does not know how to handle this. \u00a0He takes it all personally and feels rejected and angry. \u00a0While being a very nice young man, Red has pushed and pushed him into a corner until he reacts in a manner that is not exactly nice. \u00a0Remember, he has Aspergers too ...not a whole lot of filter and when your back is against the wall, there's no telling what you may say. \n \nWhen Red bursts through the door all pissed off and ranting...I put on my active listening ears for a while and then, I try to help him slow it down so that he can see all sides of the story. \u00a0Finally after an hour or so, he seems to calm down. \u00a0To get him to completely forget about this for a while, I offer to take him out to lunch. I'm starving and he has given me reason to want a margarita...stat! \n \nOver lunch, he begs me to take him to an electronics store. \u00a0\"Mom PLEASE!!! I'll do anything. \u00a0This will help me keep my mind off of this situation.\" \n \nAmazing mom that I am ...or complete idiot (you choose) I indulge him. \u00a0He has been begging to go to this store for weeks. \u00a0I have turned him down every single time. \u00a0Today ...I give. \n \nI send him inside, while I wait in the car for him to look around. \u00a0I actually fall asleep while I'm waiting. \u00a0 Over an hour passes when I wake up and realize he is still inside. \u00a0I start calling his cell phone. \u00a0No answer. \n \nFinally, he comes out. \u00a0He looks like he is livid! \u00a0 What??? I waited almost 2 hours in this car for him to look around in this store, which is supposed to make him feel better and he comes out, looking more unhappy than he did when he went in!  Now I'm livid! \n \nWhat happened? \u00a0While inside the store he started thinking about said lost friend and decided to give him a call. \u00a0They had words ...unpleasant words. \u00a0Why? Because he pushes and pushes and bangs his head against the concrete trying to fix the situation, but ultimately, makes it worse.  \n \nWhat do I do? I lose it! \u00a0When he starts ranting about this conversation he had, I cut him off. \u00a0\"You mean to tell me I waited for 2 hours in this car for you to look around in the store, which is supposed to get your mind off of things and instead, you call this dude and come out even more upset!!! What the hell? Will you EVER learn? Everyone has talked with you about this situation and everyone is telling you the exact same thing! Me, your dad, your therapist, your pastor, your REAL friends and you just don't f-ing get it!!!\" \u00a0 Oh yeah ...I was real supportive. \n \nBy the time we get home ...he agrees with me that he WILL NEVER get it! \u00a0So guess what? He decides he may as well just die right now. \u00a0He makes an overt threat to harm himself and is not backing down no matter what I say. \u00a0I hesitate and try to bring him back to reality. \u00a0No luck. \u00a0I end up calling 911.  \n \nOfficers show up. \u00a0They talk to him. \u00a0They process this situation with him as another set of officers had done a few months before. \u00a0It's becoming a routine of sorts. \u00a0I think by the time he leaves my house, I will be on a first name basis with the entire police force of our small city. \u00a0Isn't that pathetic? \n \nYep ...when the officer comes in Red asks him, \"Do you know so and so and so and so? (Other officers on the force.) Yeah, they're friends of mine.\" \u00a0In other words... I have connections. \u00a0Don't take me away.\u00a0 \n \nIt's almost like an attention thing ...a positive reinforcement. \u00a0He gets a whole audience full of people to listen to him and tell him everything will be o.k. \u00a0I really didn't want to call them for precisely this reason. \u00a0But then, if something happened and he really did harm himself, I would feel like absolute shit for the rest of my life. \u00a0It is my job to protect him ...even from himself. \n \nThis time however, the officer wasn't quite as warm and fuzzy as some have been in the past. \u00a0I told him straight out some of the crap that was coming out of Red's mouth before they got there, because of course, by the time they came he was a model citizen. \u00a0The officer told him sternly, \"You are 17 year-old and in the state of Texas you are considered an adult. You can be held responsible for the things you say, even in anger. \u00a0Saying, XYZ can get you arrested or you can end up in the hospital and then you, your mom and dad lose control of the situation. \u00a0Trust me ...you don't want that to happen.\"  Imagine that. \u00a0My 17 year-old son who acts like a 13 year-old boy, being considered an adult by the state. \u00a0Ludicrous!\u00a0 \n \nRed admitted after the fact, that what the officer said scared him. \u00a0I can only pray that it scared him enough. \u00a0There are no guarantees when it comes to this boy. \u00a0None! \n \nWe followed up with his therapist the following day. \u00a0The therapist explained again the permanence of such a decision and how it would effect all who love and care about him, and that is a big group of people. \u00a0There are so many who love and care about Red. \u00a0There are so many family members and mentors who are heavily involved in his life, who would be devastated if his life was lost. \n \nI don't know how I will handle this situation the next time...hopefully there will not be one. \u00a0I am human. \u00a0I reacted emotionally. \u00a0I just get so tired of doing, doing, doing --everything I can to give them an ounce of happiness and sometimes if feels like all for not.  \n \nI wrote on Facebook that day as I sat in the parking lot, \"What kind of mother sits in her car for hours and ends up taking a nap while her kid looks around in an electronics store?\" \u00a0Answer. \u00a0An idiot! \u00a0I sure feel like one for going above and beyond for them when in turn, they don't think about me or how I feel. \u00a0Instead, they are thinking about some idiot person who doesn't want to be their friend anymore.  \n \nFor all of my frustration I know that their journey is full of excruciating pain. \u00a0I ache for their lost childhood happiness and innocence. \u00a0It has been stolen by autism and the depression that has come along with it. \u00a0So I keep marching on ...doing what I do the best way that I can on any given day.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AamGLG9L-5o/UaeDRmK1DfI/AAAAAAAABM8/CpHnHwTQkwc/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/05/911-nights.html", "title": "\n911 Nights \n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 25, 2014", "body": "\n \n This morning's meltdown was brought to you by...bullying at school yesterday and not enough sleep!\u00a0 \n \nI have noticed lately that Blue is actually getting up much better in the mornings for school. \u00a0Meltdowns have dissipated. \u00a0Anger is minimal. \u00a0Tardiness is just about non-existent. \u00a0In fact, he has been doing a better job of getting up and getting moving in the mornings than his older, 18 year-old brother. \u00a0This was not always the case. \u00a0There have been times where Red was the one winning at this battle. \n \nImagine my surprise this morning when I was met with an angry yell from behind a closed door. \"MOM! MOM! Why did you wake me up so late?!\"  \n \nI didn't even answer him. \u00a0I refused to talk to my children from behind closed door. \u00a0You want to talk to me? Open the door and walk yourself in here to see me. \u00a0He continued yelling. \u00a0In order not to disturb my mother and my husband who were still sleeping, I called his cell phone from mine and said, \"I will not be yelled at from behind a closed door.\" \n \n\"What!? I'm going to be late! \u00a0This is all your fault!\" And on and on and on. \u00a0When he paused for a breath I replied calmly, \"You're wasting additional time by laying there ranting instead of getting up and getting ready. If you were 5 minutes late getting up, you are now turning it into 10 or 15 minutes by arguing.\" \n \nI could continue to god into details of the rant. \u00a0It wouldn't make any sense, because it didn't make any sense. \n \nI've told them both zillions of times that it is not my responsibility to get them up. \u00a0I am more of an insurance policy to make sure that they do. \u00a0I know ...I shouldn't even be that! \u00a0But I'm dealing in the reality of my situation. \u00a0They both have a hard time transitioning from sleep to awake. \u00a0This battle isn't new. \u00a0There are periods of time, when they are successful. \u00a0It really depends on what's going on with their bodies, medication, how they are actually sleeping, and quite frankly, how they are feeling about school at the moment.  \n \nI hope to win the war someday. \u00a0Key word here is  HOPE ! If you've been following our journey for a while, you know that nothing in our world is simple, as simple as solutions may appear to be. \u00a0I'm not new at this. \u00a0This is just one of our unfortunate truths. \n \nSo it turns out that he was indeed not late for school. \u00a0He had time to eat breakfast and get to school on time. \u00a0He told me at the breakfast table, that he really just wasn't motivated to get to school --a place where he is tortured everyday.  \n\"I mean some days are good, but yesterday I was bullied by that same kid. \u00a0So I am not looking forward to today.\" \n Ah hah! Lightbulb!\u00a0 \n \nThis kid is someone with behavior issues. \u00a0He seems to get a big kick out of pushing people's buttons. \u00a0He has been suspended, sent to the alternative school, he is in a behavior program now, etc. \u00a0The boy's behavior is just atrocious. \u00a0He is basically behaves like an asshole. \u00a0I've talked to Blue about this numerous times. \u00a0His teacher has addressed the issue. \u00a0We are working to get Blue to see that this is not about him. \u00a0It's about the kid getting a kick out of being an asshole and pushing his buttons. \u00a0The more of a reaction he gives the kid, the happier the kid is.  \n \nBlue is not that kid who will scurry away from the bully. \u00a0He will stand up and curse the kid out. \u00a0He has no fear. \u00a0He gets angry. \u00a0That anger may transfer into behavior at home. \u00a0We are working on that through therapy and with his social skills teacher. \n \n \nI could try to completely shelter him from the problem ...switch the classes around, push harder to get the kid kicked out or disciplined harder. \u00a0I could pull Blue out of the high school and put him in a charter school or home school. \u00a0But the truth is, in high school and in the world, there is always going to be some asshole who can't keep his mouth shut. \u00a0I want Blue to hopefully learn how to filter other people's behavior. \u00a0I am hoping to get him to see that it's not about him. \u00a0The problem is indeed something that is going on with the other child. \u00a0His bullying behavior is mostly all mouth. \u00a0There is something going on in this kid's life to drive his behavior in this direction. \u00a0In other words, I am asking for a bit of tolerance from Blue. \u00a0That may not be practical, but the truth is, the world is full of assholes. \u00a0We can't put them all in a black hole somewhere, as much as we would like to. \n \nOn the way to school I also discovered that, he had been up part of the night because of a stomach ache. \u00a0I am thankful that he didn't wake me up. \u00a0He just dealt with it. \u00a0So there's that. \u00a0But lack of sleep would help explain the extreme grumpiness. \n \nThe interesting thing is, on Friday I am leaving town. \u00a0My flight is early in the morning. \u00a0I didn't tell him yet, that he will be completely responsible for getting himself up and out the door that morning. \u00a0I have to tell him this at the right moment. \u00a0My mother will be there to help, but she is not me, and she does not drive. \u00a0He will have to be ready for our neighbor to pick him up. \u00a0I pray that he gets enough sleep that night.  \n \nI am sure that without me around, he will rise to the occasion. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dVjMy9KfwgE/UwzMQacWtSI/AAAAAAAABbc/CcQTFZA6AlY/s1600/1545998_576875709055340_1667568437_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-world-is-full-of-aholes.html", "title": "\nThe World is Full of A**holes\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 15, 2014", "body": "\n \nMy sister from another mister, LeAnne wrote the following essay about shopping for school supplies. \u00a0You know that awful thing that we all dread doing around this time of year. \u00a0She shared it with our private Facebook Support Group last week. \u00a0I thought it was so perfect, helpful and of course hilarious, I wanted to share it with a wider audience here at  Confessions . \n\u00a0 \nLeAnne is the mother of five children with a variety of needs from ADHD to ASD. \u00a0 You read that right 5 children!  Her son Chistopher wrote a hilarious and honest essay last year about  Aspergers and Physical Education  . \u00a0He\u00a0allowed me to share it here. \u00a0After reading it, \u00a0my son Blue thinks Chris should start his own YouTube channel. \u00a0 \"Life According to Christopher.\" \n \nLeAnne is author of\u00a0 Swimmin' in Alphabet Soup \u00a0a wonderful blog where she shares stories about her unique family. \u00a0I admire her strength and most of all her ability to laugh through the craziness that is her life. \n \n \n \n School Supply List - The REAL List \n \n \nBuying school supplies for five minions, ranging from a senior in high school to a fourth grader, is a huge undertaking. Add in that two minions have attention deficit disorder and two are on the autism spectrum and it becomes a chore that ranks right under childbirth without medication. Because I'm a giving person who wants nothing more than to help my friends whenever I can, I'm going to share my school supply shopping plan of attack and the items you actually have to buy. Heed me friends, I've done this for a lot of years and I've now got it down to an exact science! \n \n The most important rule in tackling the supply list shopping is to NEVER let a child go with you! It adds 4 hours and $200 to the total cost. If you don't take my advice I don't want to hear your whining when you get home with half the list, a case of wine and a migraine. \n \nIt is best to divide and conquer, to shop in waves so to speak. Tackle the adhd lists first: \n \n Pens and pencils \u00a0- Triple the amount listed, buying the least expensive #2 pencils and ballpoint pens available. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES send the amount on the list to school the first day. If you do, you will start day 2 of school with a child telling you they have no pencils or pens and raiding your extra supplies! \n \n One Binder and Folder \u00a0- The list for middle school and high school students will say to have a folder for each subject. DO NOT WASTE THE MONEY buying that many. Your child will stuff every single flippin' paper in ONE folder, if you're lucky enough to get them to use one folder, or jam rumpled papers in their backpack for you to dig through searching for the form that HAS to be turned in the next day or the world will cease to exist. \n \n The Biggest Spiral Bound Notebook You Can Find \u00a0- Loose leaf paper? Are you a masochist?!?!! Trust me, it is an accomplishment worthy of a chocolate fountain and free flowing champagne if your child can find assignments and notes in the one huge notebook. Giving them loose leaf paper is just asking to be on a teacher or principal's speed dial. \n \n The Sturdiest Calculator you can afford \u00a0- If they are on sale and you can swing it, buy three. And for the Love of all that's Holy, buy the extended warranty! \n \n Sharpie Marker, Black \u00a0- Use this to plaster your child's name on EVERYTHING, including their jacket/coat, backpack and maybe even their arm. Hey, laugh if you want but I've seen too many \"No Name\" papers to run the run the risk that he might not remember who he is...... \n \nNow, wave one is finished so take a day or two break and celebrate! Right after you hide everything you bought. DO NOT give school supplies to your adhd child and expect them to get into their backpack. YOU put them in the backpack the night before school starts, then hang the backpack (and lanyard if they wear one) on the knob of the door they use to leave in the morning. \n\u00a0 \nWe're ready for Wave 2 - The autism student supply list: \n \n Pencils & Pens \u00a0- Price is not considered for these. You know just like I do that he/she will use only ONE exact type and brand of each. Bite the bullet and buy them by the crate. Seriously, if you don't and get the call saying \"He/She is refusing to work because they don't have the RIGHT pencil/pen\" I will not feel badly for you. HIDE THESE from everyone else in the house. If you have a safe, lock them away. Again, trust me, it's for your own sanity. \n \n A HUGE Binder and folders \u00a0- A folder for each subject is good. Just remeber that at no point during this school year can the color, texture, look or feel of these folders change. Plan ahead and buy in bulk. One little rip in the pocket will be cause to curl into a fetal position and lament the loss so be prepared to replace folders at the first sign of any wear or tear! \n \n Loose Leaf Paper \u00a0- My advice is to clean the store out. Those little paper things on the side of a sheet torn from a spiral bound notebook are the enemy! It will take your child three times longer to make the paper \"perfect\" than it will to complete whatever assignment is on the paper. Not to mention the erasing holes in the paper, which leads to the paper being tossed and starting over, which leads to using MORE paper..... \n \n Calculator \u00a0- Make sure it is the EXACT one on the supply list. Your child will check and compare and woe to you if it doesn't match. Again, buy two or three - once they use it they will likely refuse to EVER change brand/model so have a stock pile. \n \n White Out \u00a0- Buy it by the gross. \n \nOnce you've bought all this, watched your child thoroughly examine each purchase and determine it is \"right\" you can load up backpacks with their guidance. Because everything will have an exact spot where it MUST go. Put the loaded backpack in \"their spot\" - you know, the spot in your house where if anyone else places something World War III commences and pour yourself a glass of wine or cup of coffee to celebrate a job well done. \n \nBest of luck this school supply shopping year! Remember, it could be worse - it could still be summer vacation and the grocery bill that goes along with that. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://swimmininalphabetsoup.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-real-list-guest-post-by-leeanne.html", "title": "\nThe REAL List  -Guest Post by LeeAnne Klopp Owens \n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 21, 2014", "body": "\n \nEaster Sunday in my house is really not a big holiday. \u00a0We never were the family who dyed eggs. \u00a0That was a tradition I missed out on as a child raised as a Jehovah's Witness. \u00a0With my boys being the handful that they were when they were little, I just never went there. \u00a0Instead, I would buy the plastic eggs, fill them with candy, coins, and money and hide them all over the backyard, or inside the house, depending on the weather. \n \nIt's not a holiday that we often spend with extended family, because it falls in April. \u00a0If we see family, it's for Christmas or during the summer. Although, I did spend one with my brother a few years ago because it was near the time of my birthday, which I often spend in Los Angeles without the boys. \u00a0Ordinarily, it's just us, here in Texas.  \n \nBack in the day when we used to have local friends who were almost like family, we would combine our family dinners, which was fun. \u00a0Since then, for reasons that don't really make sense or add up, we have been dismissed from the close friend status. \u00a0 Personally, I think to know me is to love me. \u00a0How could anyone not want to be my friend and want to have me around as often as possible. \u00a0I'm pretty freakin awesome ...I think. \u00a0Crazy yes. \u00a0But also awesome. \n \nWe have other friends here, that I could have made the effort to invite over yesterday, but I didn't. \u00a0Why? Because entertaining has become an overwhelming task for me. \u00a0I already don't want to cook for the unappreciative heathens, who are my children. \u00a0You know, I slave all day, then they come downstairs and tell me everything that they don't like, and what looks disgusting. \u00a0I never know how they are going to be behaving, fighting or how much stress I will be under. \n \nSometimes, the more people around, the worse the behavior when it comes to my boys, my husband too for that matter. One might believe that they love an audience to perform for, but perhaps it's just their Aspergery ways. \n \nI woke up regretting that I had decided to cook. \u00a0I felt pressured by my mother who was thinking about what we were going to eat for Easter dinner over a week ago. \u00a0The idea of going out sounds nice, but it's usually disastrous when we take the whole family. \u00a0As I looked on Facebook at all of the fun family gatherings, or some people doing less traditional things like hanging out at the zoo, I secretly wished I was anywhere but here, doing anything but cooking. \n \nWe spent this Easter Sunday alone ...just our immediate family. \u00a0I cooked a very basic meal, which everyone enjoyed except for me. \u00a0It's hard to enjoy a meal after I've slaved over it for hours. I made a gorgeous ham, macaroni and cheese, sweet potatoes, asparagus, and yeast rolls. \n \n \n \n My ham was so purrty \n \nI spent most of the day wondering if my father was alive or not. \u00a0His caregiver had called on Saturday \u00a0and left a message to say that he wasn't sounding like himself. When I tried to call back, I got no answer for hours on end including most of the day on Sunday. \n \nI ended up sending the local police to his apartment. \u00a0He didn't answer the door. \u00a0A neighbor told the officer, he had just left to go to church with his daughter. \u00a0First of all, he doesn't go to church ...ever! Second of all, I am in Texas, he's in California. \u00a0My sister who is in California has not been able to catch up with him for days. \n \nI finally got a call around 5 p.m. from the caregiver. \u00a0He is indeed alive, but not doing well. He did indeed go to church with her. \u00a0That within itself tells me for sure, he is NOT IN HIS RIGHT MIND! \u00a0I felt awful that he was spending Easter alone, without any family. \u00a0None of us have a key to his apartment, because that's the way he wants it. \u00a0He has isolated himself, and is mad at most of his children. \u00a0He refuses the kind of help that my siblings and I have tried to give him. \u00a0The whole family situation in L.A. is just a disaster. \u00a0I am sad and disillusioned with the whole thing. \u00a0This is just not who I ever imagined our family to be...ever. I hate that I'm not there to piece everything back together. \u00a0But the truth is, I can't change grown ass, stubborn people, no matter how much I would like to. \u00a0I have my own set of problems right here that I can't seem to fix. \n \n \n \n Me and Hubby Chillaxin on the couch after dinner \n \nWhy can't everyone just be like me? \u00a0When it comes to people that I love, I just can not hold on to anger and pettiness. \u00a0I let it go. \u00a0I move on. \u00a0I try to accept people for who they are, no matter how crazy that may be. \u00a0Yes, we will have disagreements, we may get pissed at one another, but after a while, I just let it go. That is, unless I never really loved you all that much in the first place. \u00a0Holding on to anger just doesn't feel good.  \n \nSo it was a quiet, rather lonely, disillusioned with people, kind of Easter Sunday. \u00a0Even though it was boring, because we didn't have any company or family here, at least the boys were not fighting. \u00a0They did enjoy the meal. \u00a0We enjoyed church service right here in our living room via the internet. \u00a0The service touched my husband's heart enough that he managed to let go of some of his anger with Red. \u00a0They actually had some pleasant conversation. \u00a0No one complained hardly all day. \u00a0And the very best part is ...my dad is still alive and  I never put on a bra the entire day.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-q10MjmYsag0/U1U9Opz8eeI/AAAAAAAABgg/gDVixHP7GOc/s1600/10247811_10201713872718366_2358922271222533800_n.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AVms0ymPjbg/U1U9py9RKtI/AAAAAAAABgo/3KkRXN36X6k/s1600/988875_10201714706459209_5089004760187517756_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/04/dear-diary-its-easter.html", "title": "\nDear Diary, It's Easter \n"},
{"date": "Monday, March 17, 2014", "body": "\n \n\u00a0 Bullies don\u2019t always go away just because they\u2019ve been busted and are punished repeatedly for their behavior. \u00a0  Unfortunately, a few weeks ago I wrote the post \u00a0\u00a0 \"The World is Full of A**holes\" , which tells the story of a bully that Blue has been dealing with this year in high school. I told you all then that Blue is not afraid of the bully. \u00a0  For that matter, there are not many people in the world that Blue is actually afraid of. \u00a0  He has this fearless personality going on, which is ironic since he can be a very anxious person.  \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo on this particular day this bully decided once again to screw with Blue.\u00a0 Blue is not one for ignoring an asshole.\u00a0 He is one who will give you a great big reaction when you push his buttons.\u00a0 This makes him a great target for someone who is looking for a payoff for their asshattery.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n The kid decided to follow Blue out towards the busses, name calling and pushing him along the way.\u00a0 Blue turns around and doesn\u2019t hit the kid, instead he hawked up a great big loogie and spit in the kids face!  Ouch! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSure enough, Blue comes home that afternoon and begins acting out, fighting with his brother.\u00a0 In the process, his feelings about what happened during the school day come up.\u00a0 He told me exactly what had happened with the bully.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u201cI spit on him.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n *Really? You went there? You? Mr. Germaphobe, spit your DNA and all of your germs on another person? Wow kid! \u00a0You\u2019ve got balls! (I didn\u2019t say the balls part, but I sure did think it!)\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI knew instantly, that although Blue\u2019s retaliation may pay off in the form of the kid finally leaving him alone, his choice would probably come back to bite him.\u00a0 If administration got wind of what Blue had done, he would surely be punished for it. \u00a0When I encouraged him to talk to his Social Skills teacher the next day about what happened, he declined. \u00a0He knew he was wrong, and would probably be in trouble.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n So, I am in California, enjoying a leisurely morning before I go to visit my father, when my phone rings.\u00a0 It\u2019s the high school on the caller i.d.  Duh duh duh duh!  Yep.\u00a0 The shit hit the fan.\u00a0 There was yet another incident with the bully and after further investigation, Blue\u2019s transgression was reported.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u201c\u2026I can understand Blue\u2019s frustration, but we have to send a message that next time he should go towards a teacher, instead of handling matters himself,\u201d says the Assistant Principal.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u201cReally, because he has reported these incidents several times in the past to teachers and nothing has stopped the child\u2019s behavior.\u00a0 In the heat of the moment, what would make him think that would make a difference this time? Quite frankly, I understand his frustration as well. That's why when he told me about it, and he told me about the same day it happened, I chose not to punish him for it.\" \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo the bully got a few days of in-school suspension, (sitting alone in a room with a teacher all day) while Blue got 2 days of lunch d-hall sitting in the AP\u2019s office for 25 minutes. \u00a0Not a major punishment really, since Blue doesn\u2019t eat in the cafeteria anyway. \u00a0He usually eats in a teachers classroom with a few other kids. \n \n \n \n\u00a0Did this send a message to Blue? Perhaps.\u00a0 Did it send a message to the a**hole bully? Who knows?\u00a0 \n \nThis past week there were no further incidents. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI spoke to Blue about perhaps transferring to a charter school specifically for math and science, where there would be more serious students like him and less bullies. \u00a0He investigated the possibility by looking at the web-site and Code of Student Conduct with his friend J., who is also on the spectrum. \u00a0When he got back to me, his answer was an emphatic, \"No Mom! I'm not doing that!\" Number one, he wants to have the same science teacher that he has now for AP Chemistry next year. \u00a0They have a great relationship. \u00a0She gets him since her boyfriend has Aspergers as well.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nNumber 2 he said, \"I would rather fight with the kids who are jerks, than go to a school where you have to where a uniform and they have so many rules, you may as well be in \u00a0prison. \" \n \n \n \nSo there\u2019s that. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe lesson here for Blue's Mom ...this kid can take care of himself. Stop worrying so much. \n \np.s. Blue did have a couple of therapy sessions regarding bullying and the appropriate reaction to help deescalate the situation and not give a big reaction.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/03/in-your-face-bully.html", "title": "\nIn Your Face Bully! \n"},
{"date": "Saturday, April 19, 2014", "body": "\n \nThe last few days have been hell around here. \u00a0At first I blamed it on the full moon. \u00a0When that came and went, I didn't know what to blame it on. \u00a0Am I living in Twilight Zone or what? \n \nThe Hubby was out of town most of the week, and it seemed like Red was taking full advantage over that fact. \u00a0Every night he started ranting and raving over one thing or another. \u00a0He's been stuck on what a family of sinners we all are. We all curse like sailors! \u00a0None of us are Christian enough. He wishes he had been born into a \"real Christian family,\" with a father who is a Pastor. He's been in and out of being almost manic. \u00a0He certainly isn't grounded in reality. \n \nWe don't curse any more than he did a year ago, before he went and became perfect. If he hears a curse word come out of my mouth it's out of shear frustration with his behavior. Everything is extreme with him, black or white, all or nothing. \u00a0No one can live up to his level of perfection, including himself. \u00a0But of course, he never looks at himself. \u00a0It's much easier to blame and criticize the world all around him. \n \nHe seems to be angry for no apparent reason. \u00a0He is depressed. \u00a0He has feelings of aggression towards me and his father that he has not acted on, but they are there, boiling under the surface. \u00a0It amazes me how he goes out into the world and puts on this happy-go-lucky facade. \u00a0Well, maybe not happy, but at least not angry or manic. \u00a0When he comes home ...my Lord! He changes into Mr. Hyde. \n \nThen we have Blue, who can be aggressive. \u00a0The one person in the world who pisses him off just enough, and he feels safe to hit is of course, his brother. \u00a0Blue has been back on a bit of a anxious, agitated, anger roll lately. \u00a0He's fine at school. \u00a0He's great when it's just the two of us alone. \u00a0In fact, we've been having some great times together and some awesome conversations. \u00a0However, when you put him into the mix here at home, with Red and we have a great mix for explosions. \u00a0Blue wants to control the world. \u00a0He really wants to control his brother. \u00a0He feels like his brother is clueless, because he doesn't think the same way that he does and he really wants to straighten him out, by yelling at him and trying to control his every move. \u00a0 Yeah! That's really going to work. \n \nMy Facebook status from 2 days ago... \n \n \n \"I love each and every member of my family...individually. It's just when they're together ...I don't like any of them. \n \n \n \n #Iknowhorribleright ? \n \n #loveisbetterthanlike \" \n \nHubby comes home from the business trip. \u00a0When I tell him of the antics that have been going on while he's been gone, he is pissed to put it mildly. \u00a0He has so had it with the disruption to our lives caused by Red. \u00a0He would really like him out of the house yesterday. \u00a0Of course it's just not that simple.  \n \nIt's really hard to remain calm when your teenager is being, belligerent, loud and extremely disrespectful. \u00a0I'm sure it's even worse if you are a man who works hard and believes he deserves a certain amount of respect. \u00a0Unfortunately, Red just doesn't have any respect to give, not to anyone in this family. \u00a0Especially, if you challenge him and become aggressive when he is already feeling aggressive. \n \nHe only respects authority when he feels that they have something of extreme value to take away from him. He respects his job, because he doesn't want to lose it. He wants the money. \u00a0And he actually likes his job very much. \u00a0He rushes to show up on time, like I have never seen him rush in his life! He's a model citizen while he is there.  \n \nHe respects police because he knows that they can take away his freedom. \u00a0So he never crosses a line with them or when he thinks they may become involved. \u00a0I think here, at home, he really and truly feels like he has nothing to lose. \u00a0He can not seem to grasp the fact, that he could very well lose the privilege of living here. We have proven that this can happen. \u00a0Our oldest son lost the privilege of living here when he no longer wanted to respect our home, or our rules. \u00a0He had to get to steppin'! Get his own apartment. Yes. He had struggle harder than he would have if he was able to continue living here.  \n \n \nThe ranting and raving got so bad the other day, I actually texted his pastor and asked him, if he knew anyone in the church who would let Red come and stay for a while. \u00a0He said he would look into it, but it's doubtful.  \n \nAnyways, it's just been a circus around here. \u00a0We've been going from one rant to another. \u00a0If it's not Red ...it's Blue. \u00a0Blue takes out his frustrations on his brother and vice versa. \u00a0Much of this is typical sibling crap, it's just on steroids because of their levels of anger.  \n \nThen of course, we have my mom here who just can not manage to keep her 2 cents out of anything. \u00a0She gets upset, and hold's a grudge whenever Red opens his mouth and pours out a bunch of nonsense. \u00a0She takes everything they say and do personally. \u00a0She has no life outside of this house, so it's almost like she thrives over the constant conflict ...spewing out personal insults to make matters worse. It's like managing a freakin' kindergarten around here. \n \nAnyways, that's my rant. \u00a0I had to get this out of my system so that I can go back to playing the role of Mother Theresa, instead of the raving lunatic that really am.  \n \nI will leave you all with this ...this morning as the boys are arguing over everything and nothing at all, I said this to Blue, \n \n\"Arguing with Red is like arguing with a big, thick rock with no cracks in it. \u00a0You are never going to get through to him. \u00a0You are never going to change his mind, so why waste your energy?\" \n \n*This actually holds true for a lot of people.

Who am I kidding? I know I don't have time for that. So last week, I bought her a beautiful plant. \u00a0Since she was in my dream last night, I knew that I had to visit her --today. No excuses. \n \nThe boys are having a snack and watching Sponge Bob, together, almost peacefully. \u00a0I think it's a good time for me to make a quick exit to my neighbors house. My mom is at home, of course. \u00a0I'm going over for 15 or 20 minutes. \u00a0They will be fine. No problem, right? Right? \n \nAs I am leaving Red whines, \"But where are you going? I want to come.\" \nReally? \n\"Come on dude. \u00a0I'll only be gone for a few minutes. I don't know exactly how she's doing. \u00a0I want to visit her by myself.\" \n Why I need to explain this...I have no idea. \n\"But I want to pray for her!\" \n\"Great. You can pray for her from right here. \u00a0I'll be right back.\" \n \n15 minutes later, there is a ring at my neighbor's door. \u00a0Guess who? Not one, but both boys. \u00a0They are panting as if they've been running. \u00a0I notice an object in Blue's hand. It's a bar-b-q spatula -a large one.  \n \n\"I'm sorry mom but I just wanted to come over here and see Ms. C. and Blue was chasing me,\" Red says panting and trembling.  \n\"Mom! You told him not to come over here, so I was trying to stop him! He just doesn't listen!\" \n \nWhat.the.hell?! \nReally? \nImagine these two huge teenage boys, chasing each other across the street, one with a spatula in his hand, \u00a0yelling at his older brother. \u00a0\"GO.BACK.HOME! You need to learn how to listen!\" \n \nMy neighbor's husband is also standing at the door. \u00a0Yeah. I'm slightly mortified. \nI separate the boys and ask Blue to please go home. \u00a0I can't send them both together, obviously. Blue objects at first, but finally agrees to go. \n \n Well, neighbor! I hope you were up for a little excitement! \u00a0No that's not just your pain meds kicking in. \u00a0That's my real life crazy, following me to your house! \n \nShe invites Red in. \u00a0She tells him to calm down. \u00a0He prays with her. \u00a0She is touched by his gesture. \u00a0It was a beautiful moment actually. \u00a0After a totally, ludicrous one. \n \nWe make a quick exit. \u00a0I return across the street where Blue is waiting ...spatula still in hand. \n \nHe proceeds to tell me loudly how much of an idiot his brother is -and that was one of the nicer words he used. \u00a0Oh, this is before I can even make it through the front door. \u00a0Oh yeah. \u00a0He is yelling and swearing loud enough for all of the neighbors to hear in the front yard.  \n \nThe only thing that finally shut him down was when I told him, the neighbors just might call the cops because he is disturbing the peace! \n \nAfter things simmer down, I remain in the front yard to do a little raking, and weeding. \u00a0I only had 2 neighbors, stop their cars to ask, why I was breaking my back when I have 2 big teenage boys who live here, for free! \n \nOh neighbors ...you have no idea. \n \n \n \n Watching the Sunset after the drama \namethyst & reiki gemstones for protection from the crazy. \nBelieve it or not I'm at peace. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ztHEGzbQx0Q/UyuWZBpA27I/AAAAAAAABcU/9zTZm0I6txk/s1600/IMG_20140320_192657.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/03/love-thy-neighbor-kill-thy-brother.html", "title": "\nLove Thy Neighbor / Kill Thy Brother \n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 15, 2014", "body": "\n \n \n \nI love my boys with every fiber of my being, but some days they are so hard to like. \u00a0I know how difficult life must seem to Red right now as he faces the realities of adulthood. \u00a0Change is hard for the average human, for a teenager with Aspergers, change can be excruciating and therefore, very painful for those who love them the most. \n \nAt 18, most kids are excited about the possibilities of independence. Who wants a parent around always telling you what to do, when to come and go when you no longer feel like a child? \u00a0Red wants the best of all worlds. He wants to remain at home. \u00a0He's afraid of leaving. \u00a0Yet he feels, that it's us, his parents who need to do all of the changing in order for us to get along. \n \nI have written before about him being the\u00a0 Annoying Aspergers Christian .  \n \nHis latest sermon is about how we should \"never curse\" because cursing is a sin. \u00a0Well, so is disrespecting your parents but you do that every.single.day. \n \n\"But you guys shouldn't try to get revenge just because I'm not respectful.\"  \nUm. What? We don't have the time or energy to put into revenge. \n \nThe reality is that actions have consequences. \u00a0If you run around yelling, demanding, and causing problems, we will not be going out of our way to do anything for you, besides provide the basic necessities of life. \u00a0That means no extra rides, here and there. \u00a0No stopping to pick up fast food for you. No money for movies and entertainment. \n \nIf you are relentless in your preaching and judgement, don't expect that we will not get exasperated at some point.  \n \nCan you imagine having your Pastor living in your house, for free and having him judge every single move make? \u00a0Oh and by the way, this Pastor is a bit of a fraud. \u00a0He has not fully studied the word of God. \u00a0Most of his knowledge comes from what others have told him, of course with their own spin on it. \u00a0He picks and chooses scriptures that he wants to enforce, without knowing the complete context of said scriptures, all while not walking the walk himself. \u00a0You are an adult who has studied the word of God completely and you have enough life experience to know how to apply your faith to your life. Does it sound like fun? This is what I'm living. \n \nWhat I try to get him to see is his own behavior. \u00a0He is continuously yelling and screaming about what we need to stop doing. \u00a0Yet, he will not stop and remove himself peacefully, when we have told him in a calm voice, that we no longer want to discuss the subject. \u00a0When I have had enough and have asked him repeatedly to stop, but he won't, then he just may end up being cursed out! Now if he wants to avoid the wrath of my anger, simply leave the room! Walk away! You can not keep poking at the beehive and expect not to get stung at some point. \n \nI am human. \u00a0I have feelings and emotions. \u00a0I can only stay calm and in control for so long. \u00a0And believe me, I am the most patient mother he could have EVER been given.  \n \nPart of the issue is that he wants what he wants exactly when he wants it. \u00a0 This of course, is not always practical. \u00a0The other part is that he craves attention. \u00a0The other, other part is that he often does not know what to do with his free time. \u00a0So he comes into a room and expects to be entertained. \u00a0If he does not get the reaction that he is looking for than he gets louder and louder, or annoys the dog until he's yelping. \u00a0Better yet, he starts in on a subject that he knows we do not want to talk about, repeating himself over and over again, revving himself up, until he gets some kind of commotion going. \n \nHe has never been particularly aggressive, but there are moments where he towers over me with clinched fists, aggressively, and loudly, blocking my way so that I can not leave a room or he will not leave a room.  \n \nSomething has got to give here. \u00a0I don't know how much longer I can not continue like this and my husband's fuse is even shorter than mine.  \n \nThe good news is, that he continues to do well in all other settings including his Adult Transition Program. \u00a0He is now working 10 hours a week. \u00a0He goes off to events with his church, consistently.  \nI'm sure all while telling everyone who will listen what a horrible, sinful, cursing like sailors, family he has to live with. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-reuJOQ5NQKE/U023Hs1ZoaI/AAAAAAAABf8/SBjAvhP2Lx8/s1600/983616_617379381671639_7987063653888469779_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/04/living-with-aspergers-christian.html", "title": "\nLiving with the Aspergers Christian \n"},

In fact, I don\u2019t think I even knew what autism was or how big of a spectrum it actually is. \u00a0This was 1999.\u00a0 \n \nI knew nothing of this wandering scenario that I would eventually face again as the years went by.\u00a0 \n \nFor so many families, the child isn\u2019t found within a five or 10 minute period.\u00a0 For many, they are never found alive.\u00a0 This very well, could have been our family. \u00a0 \n \nToday, April 1, 2014, in a virtual candlelight vigil, we remember the many children with autism who have lost their lives after wandering.\u00a0 \n \nFrom the  Facebook Candlelight Vigil April 1, 2014 Event Page... \n \nThe Kennedy Krieger Institute reported in a 2011 study that up to 48% of all children with autism will engage in wandering behavior or \"elopement,\" which is defined as the tendency to leave a non life threatening space and enter into a potentially dangerous one, and is a rate 4 times higher than their neurotypical siblings. \n \n \n \nThe Krieger Institute also reported \"35% of families with children who elope report their children are \u201cnever\u201d or \u201crarely\" able to communicate their name, address, or phone number by any means.\" \n \n \n \nIn 2012, the National Autism Association reported that \"accidental drowning accounted for 91% total U.S. deaths reported in children with an ASD ages 14 and younger subsequent to wandering/elopement.\" \n \n \n \nThis vigil is being organized to spread awareness of the very real issue of wandering behavior in autistic children and the unspeakable tragedies that can, and have occurred as a result.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nPlease join us in respectful remembrance of the children who have died. \n \n \n \nFor more information on keeping our children safe visit\u00a0 autismsafety.org \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p1WvvctM_P4/UztLZg6b8aI/AAAAAAAABfM/kDma_NwG73Q/s1600/1524641_675424152520301_1932668773_n.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/events/593656577387389/", "http://www.autismsafety.org/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/04/wandering.html", "title": "\nWandering\n"},

I'm hungry can you please bring me something to eat?!\" \n \nThere is plenty of food that he can easily prepare for himself at home, he would rather not. \u00a0He would rather dial my phone 28 times in a row, yelling and screaming asking me to bring him something. \n \nNo...I do not answer my phone 28 times. \u00a0I actually have to turn it off so that I can focus on driving. \u00a0The amount of energy he is wasting on this tirade is much more than he could have ever spent on actually cooking. \u00a0Which, in the end is exactly what he ends up doing anyway. \u00a0These antics are just the beginning of what will be a two-day tirade of terrible behavior and bad decisions. \n \nThe following day, my adopted little girl is sick --too sick to go to school. \u00a0Her mother needs to be at work, so I have her come to my house to rest. \u00a0She has a terrible fever that keeps coming back and she is just wiped out.  \n \nIn the middle of the day, the phone rings and you guessed it --it's the high school. \u00a0I hear the voice of one of the Assistant Principles on the line.  \u00a0Just absolutely freaking great! \u00a0So glad to hear from you! NoT! \n \nApparently, my son decided to use a few choice words with her in an area where other students could hear him, with absolutely no shame to his game. \u00a0 As I am listening to the horror story on the phone, my heart is palpitating like an African drummer is inside my chest having a party. \u00a0 I can't believe what I'm hearing is true of the boy who has been doing so well in the past several weeks at school. \u00a0He has been so busy helping the kids with disabilities. \u00a0He has made a new friend. \u00a0He's been spending time laughing and having a good time with other boys in his program. \u00a0Teachers have been rallying around him, trying to keep him focused on positive activities. \u00a0What the hell else can we do to help him --to love and support him? \u00a0Nothing! \u00a0I have ...we have given him our all. \n \nEverything seemed to be going so well. \u00a0Why is this anger resurfacing seemingly out of nowhere? \n \nThe rest of the afternoon I am in a fog. \u00a0My mind is not clear at all. \u00a0I am driving around running errands not really knowing where I'm going, or what I'm doing. \u00a0Clerks in stores are asking me questions. \u00a0I am oblivious ...like huh...what? \u00a0My ears are still feeling like I'm on an airplane, or in a tunnel. \u00a0They are plugged up from allergies. \u00a0Between that, and this extra layer of stress, I am walking around on earth feeling like I'm in an alternate universe.  \n \nMy mind is racing with thoughts. \u00a0I know that my husband is leaving to go on a business trip this evening. \u00a0I'm feeling guilty that Red has not been to see his therapist lately. \u00a0The private therapist was just becoming too expensive and I haven't found him a new one yet. \u00a0I know he needs to process what has just happened at school and nothing I say will mean one freakin thing to him. \u00a0I am imagining an evening in hell. \u00a0Not only that, I am really angry with him. \u00a0I know that nothing I will say will be objective or teachable. \u00a0I am too emotional for that. \n \nI can just imagine the fireworks when he walks through the door. \u00a0Skye is laying on my couch shivering with fever in and out of sleep. \u00a0Then Blue coming home from school at the same time and who knows what kind of drama will walk in the door with him. \u00a0I can see Red going off the deep end shooting off his mouth with lord only knows, what kind of language. \u00a0Blue will be trying to parent him, telling him how ridiculous he is being. \u00a0It will be a nightmare. \n \nI send a text message to his Pastor and friend from his first church, where he was baptized. \u00a0I ask him if he can possibly come to talk to and pray with Red when he gets home from school. \u00a0He agrees to come by shortly after Red will get home. \u00a0LIFE SAVER! \n \nRed comes home angry as expected. \u00a0Threats of dropping out of school are flying out of his mouth. \u00a0Then he starts with the blame game --blaming everyone else for what happened, etc. \u00a0I stop him in his tracks when I tell him Pastor R. is on his way over. \n \nWe are in the driveway talking when Pastor R. pulls up. \u00a0He walks over, gives Red a huge hug and says, \"Rough Day huh?\" He asks me if it's o.k. for the two of them to go for a walk. \u00a0In that moment I am overcome with gratitude and emotion. \u00a0How can I feel so stressed and blessed at the exact same time? \n \nThey walk, talk and pray for over an hour.  \n \nMeanwhile, girlfriend comes to pick up Skye whose fever has now spiked to 103. \u00a0As she is taking her to the car, she starts crying. \u00a0It was like she held it together all day long. \u00a0As soon as she saw her mommy...she lost it. \u00a0I have never seen this little angel crying. \u00a0It breaks my heart, as if I am not already an emotional wreck. \n \nBlue has also just arrived home in time to witness Skye's tears. \u00a0It saddens him too. \u00a0He asks me to come, sit and talk with him on the front porch. \u00a0The next thing I know, tears are streaming from his eyes as well. \u00a0He tells me how bad he is feeling about himself, and that he just feels overwhelmed by everything in his life. \u00a0I hug him and try my best to stay strong for him. \u00a0I know that when I cry he gets even more emotional and confused, but boy is it hard to hold in all of the emotions I am feeling. \n \nIn the back of my mind I am thinking .. .what else can happen today? \u00a0How much more can I take? \u00a0 A little lightbulb goes off. \u00a0  This boy is clearly depressed, in fact maybe more so than he has been in a long time.  \u00a0This is the third time I've seen him weep in a week's time. \u00a0This isn't normal. \u00a0I have to figure out a way to help him through this. \u00a0My load is getting heavier by the minute. \n \nI save my pity party for later. \u00a0I call my husband on the phone, both of us in our cars, bluetooth to bluetooth. \u00a0Me ...driving home after dropping Red at church, Hubby...on the road to Dallas for a business trip. \u00a0I just lose it completely with him. \u00a0Every emotion that I have been feeling throughout the day all comes boiling over out of my heart and through my eyes...the tears roll. \u00a0Hubby listens, lets me vent and yell and yes... even blame him. \n \nWhen I am done, I take a breath or ten. \u00a0After hanging up with him, I sit in my car trying to pull myself together. \u00a0I think about everything I've just said to him. \u00a0Most of it wasn't very nice. \u00a0A few minutes later, I call him back and apologize. \u00a0Even in this moment of extreme stress,\u00a0I am thankful that I have him as my partner. \u00a0In the middle of my feelings of being overwhelmed and sad, I feel the blessing of having him to go through this with me. \n \nI remember my teenage years with such fondness. \u00a0Sure there were painful moments...break-ups with boyfriends, longing for independence from my strict mother, being teased because of my big nose. \u00a0I still remember the sting of that. \u00a0I did not however, have the social issues that my kids do. \u00a0I had a lot of friends and a lot of fun. \u00a0Adolescence for me was one of the happiest, most carefree times of my life. \u00a0It just breaks my heart to watch them go through such pain and anguish during a time in their lives that should be full of joy.  \n \nA mother just wants to see her child be happy and carefree. \u00a0I don't think that's too much to ask. \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y9B2CCYoMdU/UT1WhqgoRVI/AAAAAAAABCE/xNy5US5TTtM/s1600/images-1.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/03/fog-in-alternate-universe.html", "title": "\nFog In an Alternate Universe\n"},

These are two boys are some of the sweetest boys I know. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Over the past year or so ...something happened and she has mellowed. \u00a0She bought Red and his friend these mini-speakers for their IPods for Christmas. \u00a0Then one day after Red and his friend had a difficult day, I saw her get out of her seat and hug my boy. \u00a0And then they bowed their heads and prayed. \u00a0It brought tears to my eyes. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Since then, I have seen her reading a scripture to the boys before they took off from in front of the house. \u00a0This from the woman who used to take off before he could barely sit down! Another day, when he had not ridden for a few days, because of difficulties at school, she actually got out of her seat, off the bus and met him in the driveway with a great big ol' hug. \u00a0I think it's safe to say ...something has happened. \u00a0They have bonded and made quite a connection. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Now yesterday, she actually walked all the way up to the front door! She was almost dancing with happiness to see him. The woman seemed so happy, I thought to myself, I want some of what she's taking! She was almost too happy! Red had missed riding the day before. I opened the door and thanked her for being so nice to him. \u00a0She said, \"We love all of the kids who ride with us...but this boy is so special!\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n This was my Facebook Status after our encounter:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n O.k. now the bus driver is walking all the way up to the door. She would have come on in if I invited her. She really loves my boy! #ALittleLooneyIThink \n \n \n \n One of my fans was actually offended by this. \u00a0So I replied to her... \n \n \n \n \"If it makes you feel any better ...I am MORE than a little looney!\" \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Here is what I wrote two years ago about Red and his Drunk Drivers...\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\"I don't want to ride with those  Drunk Drivers !\"  That is the phrase of the month for Red, my 15 year-old son. I think he loves the way it rolls off his tongue, the melodic sound of it  - drrrunk drrivers .\u00a0 He must love it because he makes a point of saying everyday, several times a day.\u00a0 It's one the many things that he does that drives me nuts. \u00a0There has to be something inside him that compels him to repeat things so often. I've read that people with autism do something called \"scripting\". \u00a0They get some sense of comfort from repeating certain phrases or words. \u00a0It's often something they've heard on a favorite movie or television show.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nWe made this deal. \u00a0If he is ready on time, I take him to school and pick him up.\u00a0 If he is not ready that morning on time, he will not have the privilege of riding in my car (torturing me with your meaningless conversation about all of the things you want me to buy for you) on the way home. \u00a0Instead -he has to ride the bus home with those \" drrunk drrivers!\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThis was one of those, \"I'm just too tired!\" days.\u00a0 He takes a half an hour to get out of bed.\u00a0 To top it off, this time he actually came down the stairs, not dressed and laid on the floor in front of the refrigerator -I believe for the effect of pushing my buttons.\u00a0 I don't say a word.\u00a0 I just step on him on my way across the kitchen. \n\"Oops! Didn't expect their to be a body on the kitchen floor.\u00a0 Sorry.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen we pull up to the school he never gets straight out of the car.\u00a0 I can have five cars pull in behind me, kids get out and are going through the front door and he is still sitting there.\u00a0 That's when he decides to strike up a conversation about what he wants to buy, what he wants me to buy, why he needs it so badly, why I don't seem to understand why he needs it so badly.\u00a0 Or he goes into a rant about why I'm so mean -or why I don't care about his feelings.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n If I'm so mean, why are you riding in my car instead of on the school bus? \u00a0Why am I not in bed, or at the gym instead of sitting here listening to you?   \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSometimes, I just get out of the car myself.\u00a0 I start walking my dog Harry, so that Red no longer has an audience for his rant.  \n \n \n \nSince he sat in la la land at the breakfast table after he finished eating, then took 15 minutes to go upstairs and put his shoes on, and would not get out of the car once we got to school -he had the privilege of riding with the  drunk drivers  home from school today.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWonder if he'll be on time tomorrow?  \n \n P.S. Red is now 17 and in the 11th grade. \u00a0Most mornings he gets up on his own, makes his lunch and is ready on time for the bus. \u00a0I would say he does this 95% of the time. \u00a0That is a big improvement. \u00a0So for those of you fighting the morning routine with your autism kiddos...I want you to know there is hope!\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QhX3chMxao0/UVRbQ6_yxvI/AAAAAAAABF0/6qn8mGk2S7E/s1600/Unknown-3.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/03/drunk-drivers.html", "title": "\nDrunk Drivers\n"},

So a kid who is taking AP math and Science and getting A's would be reduced to minimum plan because he doesn't get figurative language and can't pass some stupid, subjective, standardized Language Arts test? Um. Hell no!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n He will pass.\u00a0 They just try to scare the shit out of them and make the test seem harder than it is, so they will end up passing.\u00a0 This within itself, pisses me off.\u00a0 But what about those students who can't pass it? This is ridiculous!\u00a0 The state of Texas Department of Education needs to hear from this big mouth mama, and from you too if you have a kid with an I.E.P.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n If it came down to them changing his graduation plan, there would be a law suit.

{"date": "Tuesday, February 4, 2014", "body": "\n \n \n \nI just wanted to let you know that your show, \"Parenthood\" is surely the best family drama television show ...ever. \u00a0I'm not just saying that because it features, not one, but two characters with Aspergers --an adult played awesomely by Ray Romano \u00a0and a teenager, played extremely well by Max Burkholder. \n \nI'm not saying that because my entire life happens to revolve around autism and Aspergers. \u00a0I live it breath it. \u00a0I have two teenagers who keep me very much aware of autism every, single, day of my life \u00a0and the show happens to depict the kind of things that families like mine go through on a daily basis. \n \n \n \nI'm not just saying this because I was interviewed for an article in 2012, entitled  \"Autism In Pop Culture\" \u00a0 about this very same show. \u00a0You (Mr. Katims) were also interviewed for this article. \u00a0I'm sure it was one of hundreds of interviews for you. \u00a0For me, it was one of the highlights of my year. \u00a0It was featured in the Canadian Huffington Post and various media outlets. \u00a0 No shameless self-promotion here.\u00a0 \n \nSo, this past weekend ...I was doing my hair, which takes hours (because I have dreadlocks). \u00a0This gave me an excuse to be isolated in my room, with my door locked. \u00a0Otherwise, the boys, who don't do boundaries all that well, will come bursting in and start talking ...endlessly. Then I can forget about focusing on television. \n \nWhile twisting my locks, I was able to catch up on my DVR'd episodes of \"Parenthood. \u00a0Once I got started watching, I couldn't believe how long I had waited to catch up. \u00a0Every episode was better than the last. \u00a0There were so many layers, so much emotion, right down to the most recent episode, \"You've Got Mold\". \n \nI think it really was the best episode yet. \u00a0It was so good in fact, that I am actually praying that the powers that be, never cancel this show. \u00a0I mean ...ever! \u00a0 Do you hear that NBC powers that be?\u00a0 \n \nHow can the entire world not be watching this show...every week?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nYes. Sometimes the show is pretty sappy, sad and over the top emotional. \u00a0Jesus! That Christina character can cry her eyes out at the drop of a hat. Well last season, she had every reason to cry. \u00a0A kid on the spectrum, who is a handful, a daughter in college, a freaking baby and to top it all off --she \u00a0 had cancer. \u00a0I thought the emotion of it all would kill me for sure. \u00a0It certainly made me a little less whiney about the battles I face everyday with my own two teenagers with Aspergers. \n \nWell ...as you know, Christina beat cancer. \u00a0But she still cries on almost every episode. I think she needs a few visits with a therapist and little prozac. \u00a0At least she did get a little relief from the medical marijuana. \u00a0 I wasn't jealous at all there. What me? Smoke marijuana? Never!\u00a0 \n \nThe show is also funny. \u00a0Love that Crosby! \u00a0He's always good for a laugh. \u00a0I love the relationship between him and Jasmine -a mixed race couple on primetime t.v.! \u00a0I mean come on! How awesome is that? \n \nThe show has themes of art, music, politics, teenage love and pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse. \u00a0I mean what angles doesn't the show cover? \u00a0 \n \n \n \nYes. They solve problems in a rather grandiose manner. \u00a0Like in the latest episode, (my personal favorite, originally aired 1/23/14) \u00a0Christina decides to look into actually  s tarting a school for kids on the spectrum.  \u00a0Us regular folk, in real life might try finding a charter, private or homeschool when we find that our children's needs are not being met and/or they're treated like crap and bullied in public school. \n \nI'll give you a break because this is after all -a drama. Therefore, their problem solving skills must be well ...dramatized. \u00a0Don't we all want to start our own school? \u00a0Quite frankly, I'd be happy to have the social skills aid who came to the house to work with Max during Season 1. Yeah, most of us can't afford that.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI know my friends in my online support group, have actually talked about starting a whole commune of families with autism. \u00a0Imagine if you will --everyone in the community  gets it . \u00a0They know the daily challenges you face. \u00a0They are supportive. \u00a0Our kids are accepted and understood. \u00a0They always have peers to play with who don't bully them for being different. \u00a0Mouths don't fly open every time your kid curses or tantrums in public during a meltdown.  \n \nWe have all have coffee and cocktails together. \u00a0 Not at the same time, but you know what I mean. \u00a0 While we're fantasizing, all of the dads bake cookies and do crafts with the kids, while us moms are discussing therapies, medication and our latest battle with school administrators. \n \nOh wait a minute! There would be no stupid school administrators trying to get over on us, \u00a0by giving our children minimal services, that probably won't help the child's actual education. \n \nBy the way, that depiction of the I.E.P meeting on the show with Christina and her friend was spot on! \n \nThe child was clearly brilliant, but the school had no idea what to do with her because well ...she was different. \u00a0She probably has some behavior issues, which other kids would find disturbing or disruptive. \u00a0Yet, her educational needs clearly could not be met in a restrictive, special education environment, where most of the other students don't have her learning ability. \u00a0None of the teachers could actually challenge her. \u00a0So instead, the administrators throw mom a bone, like extra-time with the case manager, which of course will do nothing for her child's actual education. \n \nThis was such a realistic scene for so many of us. \u00a0I couldn't believe I was actually seeing an I.E.P. meeting on primetime t.v. \u00a0It was awesome! \n \nThe scene reminded me of one of the worst I.E.P. meetings of my life. The Administrator turned to me after I had given her a letter from my child's Psychiatrist. \u00a0His doctor was recommending a different setting for him or a one-on-one aid. \u00a0This woman actually turned to me and said, \"His doctor doesn't know him the way we do. \u00a0She doesn't work with him on a daily basis.\" \n \n Excuse me ...but did you go to medical school? Bitch please! You are messing with the wrong mama! \n \nA few months later, \u00a0I turned their world upside down when I decided to take him out of the school all together. \u00a0All of a sudden, all kinds of help and supports came out of the woodwork.  \u00a0 Was it my persistence or the fact that I have a very big mouth and a blog, that many people in the district actually read?  \u00a0Maybe it was the various law suits that the district was already facing. \u00a0Or maybe it was the fact that I seem like one of those moms who would pursue due process, and have them pay for my child's private school. \n \nI ended up getting what I needed for my kid, despite that Administrator. \u00a0As a matter fact, when I was done, their entire special education department at the high school got turned upside down. \u00a0They got a new Department Lead and got rid of a lot of dead weight. \u00a0I think we were the first domino that knocked that house of cards down. \u00a0Many parents don't have the time and energy I put into our situation. \u00a0Their kids end up losing. Which means society as a whole ends up losing. \n \nBack to my fantasy. \u00a0Everyone in our commune, including the teachers and administrators are all well trained in autism, Aspergers, anxiety and how individual our children's education plan actually needs to be. \n \nCome on Mr. Katim are you taking notes? \u00a0You could at least make this a dream sequence for one of your episodes. \n \nWell, I'm not going to get into the fact that I could slap Joel for being so mad at Julia over what? \u00a0A kiss? Really. \u00a0You're breaking those kids hearts over a kiss? \u00a0That is total crap. \n \nI may or may not be living vicariously through Camille, who has been traveling all over Italy painting, while leaving her needy husband, Zeeke at home. \u00a0 You go girl!  They are obviously growing apart after all of those years of her making sacrifices for everyone else in the family and not paying much attention to her own needs or wants. \u00a0No...that's not realistic at all!  Hello! that will be me in a few years, if I'm not careful. \n \nBut seriously Mr. Katims, and the rest of your producing and writing staff. \u00a0Thank you for bringing our kids, our families, autism and Aspergers onto your platform. \u00a0I know that those of us in the trenches of the autism community are watching. \u00a0We hope that many others are being educated and entertained in the process. \n \np.s. If you need an Aspergers writing consultant for the show ...I just may be able to squeeze you in to my tight schedule. \n \nSincerely, \n \n~Karen, An Aspergers Mom \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/27/autism-in-pop-culture_n_2369681.html"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/02/dear-jason-katims-writer-of-parenthood.html", "title": "\nDear Jason Katims, Writer of Parenthood \n"},

Well ...who doesn't love a good selfie and a major waste of time taking pictures of yourself? \u00a0No. \u00a0That's not it.  \n \nWhat attracted me to the project was the pictures of the other women doing the project. \u00a0I love browsing through Instagram and Facebook, seeing these pictures of real women who are different from me and yet, the same as me. \u00a0I feel this connection to them. \u00a0Like somehow I know them because, they are me. \n \nI am a lover of people and of their stories. \u00a0A writer by nature, whenever I see someone, I wonder what their story is. \u00a0These pictures, give me a little snippet of their story. \u00a0I leave the rest to my imagination.  \n \nTheir pictures say... \n \nI am a mother.  \nI am a wife. \nI am a lover. \nI am gay. \nI am a friend. \nI am a sister. \nI am a daughter. \nI love my dog. \nI am tired. \nI am happy today. \nI am sad tomorrow. \nMy cat is my bestie. \nHaving a good hair day. \nBad hair day. \nI am silly. \nI can laugh at myself. \nI am crazy! \nI am funny. \nI am bored. \nI am fat. \nI am sexy. \nI am an artist. \nI have wrinkles. \nI am a writer. \nI don't care! \nI am beautiful. \n \nWhen I first started taking my selfies for the project, all I could do was look at my imperfections.  \n \nJesus my nose is huge! \nLook at the bags today. \nUgh! The skin is horrible. \nWhat happened to my youth?  \nYuck...that's my bad side. \nI'm too tired for this. \nGetting sick of myself. \no.k. I quit. \n \n \n Tired ...just before I fall asleep\u00a0 \n \nEvery time my kids or my husband sees me taking one, they think I am completely nuts. \n \n-Mom you take way too many pictures of yourself. \n-You're not hot mom.  Yeah thanks kid. \u00a0Who asked you? \n-Great there she goes again with the selfies. \n-Mom, why do you keep posting your pictures on Facebook? \n If you only knew they're on Instatgram and Twitter too.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOf course, the thoughts run through my mind... \n \nPeople are going to think you're so full of yourself. \nWhat an attention whore. \u00a0 Yep. \u00a0Damn skippy. \nO.K. now I'm getting sick of myself. \nSame place...same thing. \nGet creative!

How else can I cope with the ups and downs of my life? Honestly, the ups seem few and far between these days.  Maybe it's all in my head...maybe it's not.  All I know is that I'm working really hard to  be nice to the people I live with and it's not easy.  That would include my two sons, Red age 13 (need I say more) and Blue age 10.  Then there's my big kid...Hubby, age -let's just say forty something. I sit here in a local coffee shop -avoiding them.  I just dropped off Blue to Art Camp, dropped the Harry (my cute little Maltese)  off at the groomers. Red is probably still asleep. Hubby is working, and grumpy, so why should I rush home?\u00a0 \n \n We live in a suburb of Austin, TX where it is hot as hell right now.  I'm sure it will be somewhere in the 100's today and guess what...the air conditioner went out this morning.  So do I want to go sit in the heat until the repairman gets there? I do not. There is always some form of controversy in our house.  Last night it was Red bugging the crap out of me to get his dad to help him with something he screwed up on his computer.  I am always an advocate...always a mom and always see my children differently than their father does.  I guess that's why god created two parents.  I am the peacekeeper, caregiver and life manager.\u00a0 \n \n My husband is the disciplinarian, nitpicker, hell-raiser.  I also discipline, but in a much kinder, gentler way.  My mother was a screamer. \u00a0I found that ineffective and irritating.  The first time I speak, I use a calm voice.  It's only when I have to continually repeat myself that I get much more audible.  I am working really hard at keeping our differences in parenting styles quiet in front of the kids -but it isn't easy. We are often from different planets and speak different languages.  That can make communication quite difficult. Of course this is all my opinion.  I'm sure if hubby had a blog -he would have a few choice words about my parenting habits.  In fact, he shared them with me last night.  \"You always let them off the hook. You make too many excuses for them. You are a crutch!\" and I could go on -but I won't.  I heard more than I wanted to last night.  Last night was one of those nights that I asked myself -why did I get married?  It looks so much better on t.v. and in the movies.

No freakin' way! \u00a0 When he said, love, honor and obey, I nearly choked. \u00a0Should have had that part taken out. \u00a0Y ou got the wrong girl if you think I'm going to obey my husband. \u00a0I didn't even obey my parents!  Hence the huge amount of Karma I'm receiving right now. \n \nI was 29 years-old when we got married and even though that's not that young, I had no idea what the hell I was getting myself into. \u00a0I did know this ...I found a man who loved me. \u00a0He was honest and trustworthy. \u00a0He was honorable. \u00a0He had custody of his 5 year old son. \u00a0What man does that? Steps up to the plate and is the primary caregiver to his child. \u00a0A responsible, trustworthy one. \u00a0That's who. \u00a0He was everything that my father was not. \n \nOur marriage has been through a lot of ups and downs. \u00a0Good moments and moments where we wanted to kill each other. \u00a0Moments when I couldn't imagine being married to him a moment longer. \u00a0Moments where we fell in love all over again. \u00a0Moments where we I'm sure we both regretted our decision to marry each other. \u00a0And then finally, moments where we learned to accept each other for exactly who we are, and not who we want the other person to be.  \n \nOver this weekend, hubby went up to Dallas with my young cousin, to meet 2 of my other cousins for the Cotton Bowl. \u00a0Mizzou vs. OSU. \u00a0My cousins are alumni of Mizzou. \u00a0I was happy for him to have the chance to go have a \"guys\" good time at the big game with the fellas. \u00a0It was basically a 27 hour trip up, from Austin, tailgate party, game, spend the night and back the following morning. \u00a0Mizzou won! A good time was had by all. \u00a0Great! Wonderful. Right? Right! \n \n \n \n Handsome Hubs & My good looking Cousins \nMizzou vs. OSU\u00a0 \n \nOf course, I'm here holding down the fort with the boys. \u00a0Hubby comes home tired. \u00a0He takes a nap while I go out to grab a late lunch with my mom and Blue. \u00a0Next it's on to grocery shopping.  Woo hoo! Fun right?  \u00a0Towards the end of shopping, hubby texts me and says, I'm going to go out and grab myself a bite, maybe watch a little football. \u00a0Oh and by the way, at 9 there's this party for T. \u00a0(It's a guys version of a baby shower, with golf, no gifts and plenty of drinking.) \n \n Really now? You just got back from the trip to see the big game and now you're going to a party the very next night? \u00a0Wow! Must be nice! \u00a0 So yeah. \u00a0I was kind of pissed and I had to at least call him on it. \u00a0He felt guilty and by the time I got home from the store, he decided to play the martyr and not go. I insisted that he go ahead and go. I didn't want to be  that girl  -who holds on to her man like he's in high school and needs permission to do everything. \n \nYou see, when I was in my 20's I had a boyfriend. \u00a0He was my first love. \u00a0Our relationship lasted for several years until he moved away to go to medical school. I would freak out when he wanted to do things without me. \u00a0Ultimately, the relationship fell apart. \u00a0Was it the timing? We were too young? \u00a0I'll never know for sure.  \n \nFrom that experience, I decided, that once I got married, I am not going to be  that  girl . \u00a0The girl who is so insecure, that she falls apart every time her man wants to have fun that does not include her. \u00a0I want a man who  wants to be with me  because he  wants to be , not because I insist. \u00a0An adult should not be treated like a cage bird. Everyone needs a little room to fly. \n \nMy thought once I got home from the grocery store was basically this ... if your first inclination is that you want to go out 2 nights in a row, take your ass right on out. \u00a0If home is not where you want to be ...I don't want you here. \u00a0 I can do fine all by myself. \u00a0I will be here when you get back. \u00a0And when I get ready to go do my thing ...I will fly and I won't look back. \n \nI trust my husband. \u00a0We have both been trustworthy in this marriage. \u00a0I'm not saying that he has been a perfect angel or at least flirted with, or looked at another woman ...in fact, I'm sure that he has. \u00a0I  know  that I have! \u00a0Flirting is in my DNA (thanks Dad). \u00a0But we always come home to each other -faithfully. \n \nShould the day come, where he no longer wants to do that ...it will also be his choice. \u00a0I am not  that girl  who feels the need hold on tight. \u00a0I may rag him and give him a bit of a hard time, here and there. \u00a0He may do the same to me. \u00a0But the truth of the matter is ...if he wants to be with me ultimately, he will be.  \n \nFor 20 years come this June, being  this girl  has worked. \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DCNcK1GpbRw/Usrb3X50u8I/AAAAAAAABZs/erDkwZEkKB8/s1600/1501835_10152101756633750_797546854_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/01/not-that-girl.html", "title": "\nNot That Girl\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 14, 2014", "body": "\n \nWhen we are in the the trenches of raising our Aspergers children, we run into difficult periods. \u00a0This can be said of raising any child, especially during the teen years. \u00a0As parents we wonder, will we EVER get through this? Will this child ever be a person I can stand to be around for more than 15 minutes? \u00a0 Maybe that's just me. \u00a0It's probably you too if you're willing to admit it.  It may sound terrible, but to be brutally honest, the teen years are rough.  \n \nThere are times, when I just want to hide in my bathroom with the door locked, with my laptop and a glass of wine. \u00a0Yes. In the bathroom. \u00a0You see my bathroom is inside of my bedroom. I can lock my bedroom door and then lock the bathroom door for extra security. \u00a0I turn on the fan and wallah! I can't hear a thing.  TMI? Oh well.\u00a0 \n \nSomedays, I don't have the energy for another fight. \u00a0 Like when they are talking a million words per minute, without ceasing. \u00a0When they come across as rude, disrespectful, \u00a0know-it-alls. \u00a0I know it's not really about me. \u00a0It's about the pain that they are experiencing. \u00a0It's about what's going on inside their own heads. \u00a0But it  feels like it's about me  and it hurts. \u00a0Sometimes, the barrage of negativity and the woe is me, my life sucks, mentality is too much to deal with.  \n \nI'm in the throes of this with Blue. \u00a0Finally, in this 18th year of life I see in Red, \u00a0there is hope. Though he has a long way to go to really grow up ...geez he has come such a long way! \n \nIf you've been following my blog for a while, you got to know my friend and fellow Aspergers mama  Kathleen  when she wrote \u00a0 \"If You Really Knew Me\" A guest Post\u00a0 \u00a0 back in September of 2013. She is a\u00a0 mother of three handsome, amazingly unique young men with different abilities. They are ages, 13, 15, and  20.  Her boys have an alphabet soup of diagnoses.  \n \nA few days ago, she wrote a lovingly honest update on her son 15 year-old son Jay who has Aspergers. I think is worthy of sharing with all of you. \u00a0Without further ado...here she is. \n \n By Kathleen Johnson \n \n I have been bragging on my 15 year-old son sooooooo much lately. \u00a0Seriously, things were soooo bad not that long ago and now they are sooo good now, that I can't help but be in a state of amazement. He is definitely growing up. I never thought I would be able to genuinely say, I enjoy his company, but I do!\u00a0 \n \n For me, with 3 boys, my favorite child changes from time to time. At any time I usually can't get enough of one of them and my Aspie is that one these days! He watches his shows\u00a0 with me in my room, he is chatty Kathy with me. He has been waking up on his own and in a super mood.\u00a0 \n \n I have been telling him for years his hands are super rough (like he works for a living with them). He is lotioning them regularly because he said he doesn't want his future wife to have to deal with it. \u00a0He has been brushing his teeth and showering regularly without being prompted. \u00a0His gross hygienic habits seem to be a thing of the past. He has been keeping his room clean and has been generally cooperative with me and his father. \u00a0This is very out of ordinary. He isn't as overbearing with his older brother. They can have a regular conversation without anyone flipping out. That's huge! Also, I asked him if he plans on going to college. He said of course. When asked for what, he said homicide detective or forensic anthropologist. I told him with his mental health history, I'm \u00a0not sure of homicide detective is an option. \u00a0He told me he had spoken with the career counselor at school (his special needs school) and she said that should not prevent him. \n \n I am so flippin happy for his growth I just can't begin to convey to you all how far he has come!!!\u00a0There is hope!\u00a0 \n \n But I have to say this... it wasn't until after the worst of puberty was behind us and equally important, as I see it is that he has been off all pharmaceuticals since May 2013. On Amino Acid Therapy and orthomolecular medicine (supplements) only.  I feel like I can breathe...like the feeling you get when you put the hyperactive baby down for the nap and they actually fall asleep. \n \n \n \n \n Jay \n \nEditorial Note: Amino Acid and orthomolecular supplement therapy may not work for everyone. \u00a0I tried this recently with Blue and because he is in the middle of puberty, and with his body's current chemistry, \u00a0aminos alone did not work for him. I will say that it is definitely worth investigating. \n \nI hope that Kathleen's update brings you hope for your child. \n \n ~Karen \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LhupjHjYyf4/UtV7bcjC82I/AAAAAAAABZ8/7nzofLROZcQ/s1600/999985_10200639133153403_1648198430_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/01/there-is-hope.html", "title": "\nThere is Hope! \n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, October 8, 2013", "body": "\n \nI got one of those phone calls from the school. \u00a0If you're an autism parent you know exactly what I'm talking about. \n \nActually, the first call was from Red. \u00a0Seeing his name on the caller i.d. is almost as bad as seeing the high school's number during the day. \u00a0The last thing I want is a call from either of them.  \n \n\"Mom. \u00a0I need you to come get me. \u00a0I'm really pissed off. \u00a0I just left the AP's office...\" \nThe strange thing is -his tone was not belligerent. \u00a0His language was very lucid. \u00a0Everything he was saying made perfectly good sense. \u00a0He wasn't happy about the situation but he wasn't over the top either. \u00a0Less than a year ago, this very same phone call would have had me running over to the school because he was threatening to harm himself. \u00a0Any encounter with a police officer, if not self-initiated sends him over the moon. \u00a0And this was a substitute campus officer -not the one he knows and is actually pretty fond of.  \n \n\u00a0Today, he was still on earth -not happy, but not totally losing it either. \n \nI however, was pissed! \u00a0I had to play the roll of cool, calm, and collected, so that he would remain in control. \u00a0But I could have kicked that Assistant Principal right in the ass if I had been close enough. He called Red in and had the campus police officer there to \"explain\" how certain things work out in the \"real world.\" \nThe A.P. is also a little wimp and was probably afraid of the big bad, black teenager with autism. \u00a0Red might lose it, so he better have the officer there to intimidate him. \u00a0Red has lost it before. \u00a0Violence? No. That is not in his character. \n \nA student filed a complaint that Red was making him feel uncomfortable, because he kept going up to him saying, \"You need to stay away from my friends.\" Said student wants Red to \"stay away from him.\" \n \nDoes this student have that right? Absolutely.  \nDoes Red fully comprehend that? \u00a0I can't tell you that for sure. \nCan Red control how he feels, this jealousy and envy for this other student? No. \u00a0He can not. \nCan Red control his impulse to go up and talk to this boy every time he sees him? \u00a0So far...the answer is \u00a0No. \nThis behavior has been an ongoing problem, stemming from Red's insecurity, low self-esteem, unhappiness, and feelings of being disliked and unaccepted in the high school culture. \u00a0 These are \u00a0common feelings for students in high school with Aspergers. Blue has only been there a few weeks and he already feels like an outcast.  \n \nAs the mom ...I have to teach Red the ways of the world. \u00a0Although, he would like the world to operate according to his rules -that is not going to happen. \nI tell him, that although he can not control his feelings, he  has  to control his actions. \u00a0People who can not control their actions, end up losing some of their freedoms. \n \nIn the adult world, Aspergers is not an excuse. \u00a0It may be a  defense , but not an excuse. \u00a0In other words, in the real world you can be arrested, and have a trial for your  actions . \u00a0Your attorney can argue, that your compulsive behavior is a result of your autism -that autism and A.D.H.D. makes you have difficulty with impulse control. \u00a0Will that excuse your behavior? Probably not. \u00a0There will be some consequence. \u00a0After all, he is black ...and this is America. \u00a0He already has a strike against him. \u00a0Autism just compounds the problem. \nThere is already the consequence of an arrest and paying for an attorney for your defense. \u00a0So, do we really want to go there? Absolutely not! \n \nI pray that he is learning these lessons in the relatively safe environment of the high school. \u00a0And I do mean relatively. \u00a0Who knows how much mental damage this freaking school is causing him everyday. \u00a0It is safe in that what happens there, unless completely illegal, does not land you with such consequences. \n \nNow...why was I pissed? \u00a0Because the asshole A.P. called me after the fact, of calling Red into his office and having a police officer there to intimidate him. \u00a0He knows damn well, he should have called me beforehand. \u00a0We've been through this before. \u00a0I've laid him out before. \n \nWhen he called me and asked me, \"How are you doing today?\"  How do you think I'm doing? I'm pissed!   Red has already called me and said, he wants to drop out of school ...you asswipe!\u00a0 \n \nGranted -Red is 18 years-old now. \u00a0He is supposed to be legally responsible for himself. \u00a0Is he mature enough to know what that means? \u00a0Not really.  \nNo -I did not file for guardianship. \u00a0I want to give him the opportunity to take care of his own life. We did however have him sign a Power of Attorney, so that I can help him with legal, medical and financial matters, if he is unable to do so himself. \u00a0This includes, if he doesn't fully understand what is being asked of him.  \n \nWe just signed the Power of Attorney last week and it is not on file with the school yet. \u00a0You can bet your ass -it will be put on file today! \u00a0Yes ...I let the AP know that I would be getting a copy of it electronically from my attorney, so that I can put it on file today. \u00a0And yes, if you know what's best for you, you will call me before you call my son into your office the next time. \u00a0Otherwise, you may be getting a visit directly from my attorney! \n \nMeanwhile, I had to make my 3rd trip over to the high school for that day, to bring Blue some medicine for the nebulizer. \u00a0I decided to have a chat with the campus officer, to find out exactly what kind of chat he had with my son. \u00a0He explained, that the definition, of harassment/bullying has recently been expanded to include, annoying another student. \u00a0HA!! \u00a0Annoying is the very definition of Aspergers! \u00a0You expect a child with Aspergers not to annoy another student. \u00a0That's rich!  \n \nHe basically told Red, that these kind of issues can lead to real problems in a public location other than the school. \u00a0In other words, this is a behavior that we need to break, before it causes him any real problems. I get that. \u00a0I'm totally  with  that. \u00a0In fact, in a sad way, I am glad these kinds of issues are being addressed now, so that we hopefully never encounter them after we walk out of the doors of that freakin' high school. \n \nThe really exceptional news is that Red processed through all of this extremely well with his therapist yesterday afternoon. \u00a0He actually accepted responsibility for his actions. \u00a0He was calm, cool, and very mature about the whole thing. \u00a0This.is.a.miracle. \u00a0Maybe he really is growing up. \u00a0Maybe he is starting to  get it . \n \nThe real kicker was later that day, \u00a0we picked his friend up. \u00a0When he got in the car Red told him, \"Man let's not talk about so and so anymore. \u00a0It's a real trigger for me. \u00a0If I bring him up again, I want you to slap me!\" he said as he laughed. \u00a0\"And if you bring him up, I'll slap you!\" \n \n Editorial Note: \n \n \nThis is something I had to write about instead of talk about on my\u00a0 YouTube Vlog\u00a0 . \u00a0Have you checked it out by the way? \u00a0You really should!\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjVW6HlQDolGAGPYZuU11Q"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/10/still-on-earth.html", "title": "\nStill on Earth \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 24, 2013", "body": "\n \nConfession: \u00a0I am seriously contemplating how I can possibly take a vacation away from my kids. \u00a0I'd love to have a month ...but I'd take an overnight.  \n \nIn my delusional mind, I always thought once the boys became teenagers, it would be a breeze to get away to do grown up things. \u00a0Once my mom moved in with us ...I thought it would be even easier. \u00a0Built in kid-sitting right? Only NOT! \n \nWhen your teenagers are high maintenance and volatile with the tendency to explode and fight, you can't always walk out the door, drive away knowing that it will be just fine. It may actually turn into holy hell within a matter of seconds. \n \nSunday was the most peaceful day I've had in quite a while. \u00a0The days the kids are at school, are not that peaceful. \u00a0The phone always rings with some crap or another. \u00a0There is driving, running around from place to place, putting out fires, taking them to appointments, to work, to church, maintaining a household, etc. \n \nOn this Sunday however, Red spent the night with a friend and would not be returning until the evening. \u00a0Blue went to a youth festival at a friend's church. \u00a0The sun was shining, the air was crisp. \u00a0I sat on my chase lounge, near the window of my bedroom, sunbathing, writing and browsing facebook. \u00a0 I took a long, hot, delectable bubble bath, before going out to meet a fellow blogger/autism mama friend,\u00a0\u00a0Author of\u00a0 Balanced Imperfection \u00a0for dinner. \u00a0She was in town for one night only. \n \nI left with the confidence that all ducks were in a row. \u00a0The kids would be at home minimal time, before having to go to bed. \u00a0Vitamins, \u00a0meds and dinner for everyone was all lined up. Easy breezy, right? Dad and Nana can handle it right? Right? \u00a0I mean for God's sake...I deserve a freakin break! Me time is becoming more and more infrequent every.single.day. \u00a0This is ridiculous! \u00a0My kids are 14 and 18. \u00a0We have 3 adults in the house? \u00a0Why should I have to be so tied down that I can't even go out to dinner with a girlfriend? \n \nIn fact, this was my status on FB just before I left. \n \n In the peace and tranquility of this Sunday afternoon, I sit I think, I write. There are no children in my house at the moment. I will be leaving before they get home to have dinner with a blogger, mama, friend of mine. I have an ah hah moment ... I need to leave them more often. They need to figure out how to live without my presence, and deal with each other, and their father more. When\u00a0 I'm gone, I need to really be gone. Unavailable for complaint. No access. It's not as if they are any happier when I'm present. In fact, I present them with constant opportunity to lay all of their burdens on me. It's not that they will appreciate me more when I return. It's that I will appreciate me more when I return. \n \nWhile I was smiling for this picture... holy hell broke lose! \n \n \n \n Me and Monica\u00a0 \n \nWhile academics come pretty easily for Blue, anything physical is extremely difficult. \u00a0He has always hated P.E. because of the noise, the crowds and the competition. \u00a0Sports and physical activity is just not his thing. \u00a0He made it through middle school P.E. by the grace of God. \u00a0He had the most phenomenal coach ever as his teacher. \u00a0He didn't tolerate any bullying or putting other students down. \u00a0He and Blue became fast friends. \u00a0In fact, Blue even became his Teacher's Assistant during his 8th grade year.  \n \nSo for high school he chose JROTC as his physical credit, because of the recommendation of a friend. \u00a0Thus far, it has been a real love/hate relationship. \u00a0It has been the source of much anxiety, and several meltdowns. Most meltdowns have been a result of the uniform and inspection days. \u00a0Other's have been related to feeling like crap because he is the slowest runner in the entire squad ...by a lot! \u00a0This wreaks havoc on his self-esteem.  \n \nThere was an incident last week in which they were playing a football game on  Fun Friday . \u00a0 Ironic huh?  \u00a0His team was losing badly. He felt like he sucked and it was all his fault. \u00a0This conjured up all kinds of self-doubting emotions, which he decided to link to a teacher from middle school. \u00a0He felt so overwhelmed that he shutdown and ran away from the game and started crying. \u00a0Yep...crying where peers could see him, which made him even more mortified when he realized what he was doing. \n \nOver the next few days, this anger built up in his mind and somehow it also got tied into his father. \u00a0They've been butting heads a lot lately too. \u00a0I think in some ways he blames his father for some his problems and feelings, because they are so much alike. \u00a0He needs someone to blame for his lack of self-esteem. \u00a0All of these worries, problems and imperfection, couldn't possibly be his fault.  \n \nSo when I left Sunday night for dinner...the shit hit the fan big time. \u00a0One thing led to another and there was a major meltdown, which included some aggression and very nasty words towards dad. \u00a0When I arrived home after dinner, Blue was exhausted and had fallen asleep. The following morning, the first words out of his mouth were, \"You left! And this is all your fault!\" \nHe was still exhausted, mentally and physically. \u00a0He ended up not going to school. That morning, you could cut the tension with a knife between him and dad. \u00a0It was bad. \u00a0So bad that it frightened me.  \n \nI need my teammate to help me through these teen years with the boys. \u00a0The problem is they are at such odds, it makes it more difficult for dad to parent. \u00a0It ends up leaving everything on me, and I end up feeling resentful towards all of them. \u00a0Dad ends up with pretty negative feelings. \u00a0It's a horrible, downward spiral for the entire family. \n \nWe end up in a 2 hour family therapy session where we worked out some of these thoughts and feelings. \u00a0It was not fun, but it had to be done. \u00a0The therapist told me and dad that sometimes we have to let the boys vent their frustrations, without judgement, without trying to teach a lesson, \u00a0or trying to fix the problem. \u00a0No lessons are learned when an Aspergers child is angry. \u00a0There are no fixes to the issue that will come from an outside source during a fit of anger. \u00a0In the midst of anger, everything we say to the angered person, can feel hurtful to them. \u00a0Can you believe that? \n \nOne of my friends on the spectrum told me this about anger, \n \n \"As an aspie myself, I totally understand the frustrations of being misunderstood. Trying to relate or cope when no one understands life from your point of view. Many NTs try v ery hard to understand, but it's difficult to understand unless you know the mindset. When we hear your words, even the empathy from you hurts during those times, because we do not feel understood and don't think anyone can understand what we are feeling, so it is at those times where everything hurts...even the loving kindness that you are showing. Please don't take it personal. It is just our way of dealing with everything. We love our family so much and feel so safe that you become our punching bag in a way because we know in all things that we do you will not hurt us... I'm so sorry that you feel pain. Keep trying calming methods, they will eventually work for you.\" \n ~Jackie Pilgrim \n \nThis is not to say that we can not teach them lessons or help give them the answers that they desperately need. \u00a0It's all about timing. \u00a0Many lessons will come to them by the example of the way that we live our lives. \u00a0Others can be taught when the mood is right, when their minds are ready to receive. \u00a0A lecture or debate when the child is already upset and confused is only going to exasperate them, and make them more angry. \u00a0Fight or flight will kick in and they will end up lashing out in one way or another. \n \nThe therapist also encouraged the boys to accept our answer of no, with the explanation of why, and not to continue to carry on all of these extended debates.  \n \nI thought we made it through the family crisis, when on Tuesday morning Blue had another major meltdown over the ROTC uniform. \u00a0This was the first time he was to wear his dress jacket for inspection. \u00a0He had no idea how to put everything together properly. \u00a0It took him over 45 minutes to get dressed. \u00a0When he finally came downstairs,  he had on the jacket, with no shirt, with\u00a0the tie around his  naked  neck!  When I told him he is supposed to put the shirt on underneath the jacket, he flipped! It sounds funny and it was. \u00a0But It was also very ugly.  \n \nKeep in mind, this is a kid who likes to wear jogging pants and t-shirts most of the time. \u00a0He is being asked to wear this very uncomfortable, although quite distinguishing, uniform and then be inspected for perfection! \u00a0That's a lot of pressure. \n \nHe ripped off the uniform and threw it to the ground! We both nearly decided that ROTC was not worth the many meltdowns that he's having as a result. \u00a0I was actually, the main culprit telling him to just forget about it! \u00a0(Bad parenting moment ...I know). In the heat of the moment we were both extremely frustrated.  \n \nAfter taking a deep breath, I realize, \u00a0the thing about parenting when your children become teenagers, is many things are no longer  your  decision. \u00a0You are merely a consultant in their lives. \u00a0They really do have to make their  own  decisions when it comes to interests, activities, classes to take, what to major in, \u00a0and so on. \u00a0I even extend that to their spiritual beliefs. \u00a0It's not about what I believe anymore. \u00a0I really do want them to make their own choices and be comfortable in doing so. \n \nWe ended up in the School Psychologist's office for yet, another therapy session. \u00a0She was brilliant! \u00a0She got to the root cause of his thoughts and feelings and helped him figure out what he needed to do about it. \u00a0She got him to figure out what supports and resources he could connect with to help him through his ROTC issues.  \n \nHis Commanding Officer is really an awesome guy, and a wonderful resource. \u00a0They decided that Blue will now take his uniform to school and get dressed there in the ROTC building, where he will get whatever help that he needs.  \n \nAs far as his physical/exercise and drill issues, he will put in the extra work and effort to improve slowly. \u00a0It will have to come from inward motivation to do better. \u00a0The unit is really a supportive place full of students who want to help each other. \u00a0It really isn't a typical judgmental, competitive environment. \u00a0It's all about teamwork. \u00a0He is a part of something good and everyone there wants him to succeed.  \n \nWith the Psychologist, he determined that he has just has to stop dragging around the negative weight and baggage from the past, and the negative voices inside of his head. \u00a0He will use his energy to move forward and continue to improve. \n \n \n \nHe ended up wearing his uniform instead the next day -successfully. \u00a0In fact, he ended up making rank and -received his first promotion. \u00a0He got two pins to put on his dress jacket.  \nI think he felt proud of his uniform. \u00a0He didn't really want to take it off once he got home. \n \nHere's another FB Status I wrote as a reminder to myself last week... \n \n Dear Aspergers Mom, Just listen. Do not try to fix it. \n \nSometimes, we all need reminders. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://balancedimperfection.blogspot.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-faoUZJ2EfWQ/Umk3eRvM4wI/AAAAAAAABUE/AhbdbsCkbDk/s1600/Monica+.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pUNVJ5rv6O0/UmlE1LvM75I/AAAAAAAABUk/1jduU5O-YbQ/s1600/Dress+Uniform+.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/10/jrotc-death-of-me.html", "title": "\nJROTC the Death of Me \n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 21, 2013", "body": "\n \nThis summer I wanted to go to Paris for my husband's 50th birthday. But, with Red quickly approaching his senior year of high school and his 18th birthday, we decided that it would be a better to invest our money in him and his future. \u00a0We want to do whatever we can to help prepare him for independence. \u00a0We are pushing him towards his potential to hopefully, get him ready for the world beyond the safety of these doors and his mommy.  \n \nI'll admit it. \u00a0I am his crutch. \u00a0He would like me to be the other half of his brain so that he doesn't have to think. \u00a0I want him to live a full-life. I want him to use all of his own brain-power without me to fall back on. \n \nI always thought I looked forward to the day he would turn 18 and then graduate. \u00a0The truth of the matter is I.am.scared! Freaking out really. \n \nMaturity wise, he is nowhere in the ball park of being ready to be an adult with all of the responsibility that it brings. \u00a0 There are so many details about life that he just does not get yet. \u00a0His decision making process, impulsiveness, and different way of seeing the reality of the world leaves him with so much more to learn. There are so many social nuances that simply escape him. \u00a0This is autism. \n \nI\u00a0am terrified about the potential of his first real male/female relationship --his first heartbreak. \u00a0It's bound to happen right?\u00a0I watched my now 25 year-old son go through it. \u00a0He was clueless as I watched heartbreak heading toward him like a gigantic meteor. \u00a0It hit him hard, as it does most people the first time your heart is really broken by someone who you  think  you love. \u00a0He did get over it, of course...eventually. \u00a0He doesn't have autism, yet to this very day, he continues to make one bad judgement after bad another, one decision always dumber than the last.  \n \nWatching my older son make so many bad judgements only compounds my worries for Red. The older one has taught me that no amount of good parenting in the world, changes the bad decisions that an immature person can make. \u00a0Red is a smart, talented kid as far as common sense? \u00a0He has some gaps -little missing links that will make his day to day decision making process just that much harder.  \n \nThis is especially true when it comes to social and emotional relationships. \u00a0Red does not bounce back well from rejection. \u00a0He has experienced so much of it already in his young life, from simple friendships with both males and females. \u00a0He does not get over it easily when someone is done being friends with him. \u00a0He fixates and perseverates. He wants to fix whatever it is that he  thinks  he did to make things go wrong.  \n \nThe truth of the matter is, it may or may not be anything that he did. \u00a0Relationships are not easily \"fixed\". \u00a0 Sometimes, it's just the nature of people --especially, immature people who change like the weather, and have no loyalty, or energy to give a person who is different and doesn't fit in seamlessly to their social norms. \u00a0Let's face it. \u00a0People can be crappy.  \n \nSo we try to keep Red busy --keep him focused on the positives. \u00a0We redirect his energy toward activities that will help him survive each day and in god-willing, help him with his future. \u00a0He loves his church...or I should say churches. (He goes to more than one.) \u00a0He loves his video shooting and editing projects. \u00a0He also loves working with kids with disabilities.  \n \nI found a sleep away summer camp this year that would incorporate many of the things that he loves, and some things that he has never experienced. \u00a0This camp is about 4 hours away from \u00a0home, with no phone calls home allowed. \u00a0 Yay me!  It is a Christian summer camp designed specifically for kids with learning differences and social difficulties, like ADD, ADHD, High Functioning Autism and Aspergers.  \n \nI can not say for sure exactly what he is experiencing while he is there. \u00a0Nor will I disclose the specific location of this camp since he is still there. \u00a0I will write more specifically about his experience when he comes home and can tell me about it. \u00a0I can say for sure that I am so happy for him to have this opportunity. What a blessing! \nIn the mean time...these pictures are worth a million words. \n \n \n \n Snorkeling \n \n \n \n \n Appears to be some form of Martial Arts \n \n \n \n \n Kayaking\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Blue is not happy that Red found an audience for his singing! \n \n \n \n \n Red with one of the Camp Counselors \u00a0Visiting from China\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oVYJwzjAXnk/Ueszb0vjQEI/AAAAAAAABPg/pr3jZozD0g0/s1600/Kendal+Camp+1.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QOwJfWTwpT4/Ueszfu_xxRI/AAAAAAAABPo/7ofThaCH-5Y/s1600/Kendal+Camp+2+.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3pair8EvDuQ/Ueszk9IQcRI/AAAAAAAABPw/FrIVw-NMm5k/s1600/Camp+3.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-skkXKjxE4QI/Ueszp4bMHQI/AAAAAAAABP4/nAO8Apjnhb8/s1600/Camp+4.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yUQ8b4x1AEE/UeszuN55RNI/AAAAAAAABQA/CzeAG9vHefI/s1600/Camp+5+.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/07/this-one-time-at-autism-camp.html", "title": "\nThis one time at Autism Camp....\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 11, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \nThis week I had not one but two I.E.P. meetings to attend...one for each of my boys. \u00a0The two meetings could not have been more different, just like my two very different boys who are both on the autism spectrum. \u00a0These two boys being raised in the same environment, by the same two parents are as different as black and white, night and day, fire and water. \u00a0They may have some things in common ...but their mindset and belief systems are on opposite ends of the spectrum. \n \nFirst up was Red's meeting. \u00a0He is 17 years- old, in his junior year of high school. \u00a0The goal of this meeting is to discuss goals to get him through graduation. \u00a0We also discussed  transitioning  him out of the high-school setting as soon as possible. \u00a0Not only do we want to get him off of the campus soon,  per my request and his doctors suggestion, we are actually cutting the length of his days down immediately .  \u00a0The accommodation puts him on a 3/4 day schedule, in order to cut down on some of the unstructured time in the hallways, and lunchroom.  \u00a0These seem to be the times that cause him additional stress and it is when he gets into the most trouble. \u00a0He gets frustrated with peers when things don't go as he thinks they should. Social issues during these times seem to make him completely lose focus in the classroom setting. \u00a0He ends up getting in-school suspension and dealing with clueless Assistant Principles for discipline which by the way, \u00a0is never productive. \n \n \n \n I requested that a representative from the district's special education department attend our meeting, primarily because of the issues we have been having with school administration  and the way they have been attempting to handle disciplinary measures. They seem to exacerbate his issues, rather than making them better. \u00a0They want him to sign these bullshit agreements to not talk to certain students. \u00a0A couple of weeks ago, I had to stop him from signing such an agreement. \u00a0I literally burst into the A.P.'s office just as Red was about to go over the moon with anger, which would end up turning to rage in our home environment. \u00a0Of course, the assistant principal couldn't give a shit about that!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI followed up with an e-mail documenting that in no uncertain terms, is Red to sit down with any Assistant Principle or Administrator and sign documents without my presence in the future. What happens is Red\u00a0turns around and perseverates on the document itself, the Assistant Principal, and how unfair it is, \u00a0rather than focusing on the behavior that caused him the problem in the first place. \u00a0Thus creating more negative behaviors and less focus on education. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAdmittedly, part of the problem is a lack of respect on Red's behalf. \u00a0He does not seem to recognize or care about the authority of Vice Principals. \u00a0He seems to see them as an annoyance. \u00a0He has no problem marching right up to them to tell them how he feels about something, not realizing that he is creating a \u00a0more antagonistic environment for himself. \u00a0A few days of in-school suspension after cursing at one of the AP's or a peer, does not seem to change any of the behaviors. \u00a0Yet, \u00a0he seems to realize that's all they've got. \u00a0They can't really hurt him. \u00a0This is not painful enough to deter the behavior.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, he totally respects the authority of his special education team of teachers because he knows they really care about him. \u00a0They are on his side, \u00a0in his corner ...even when he is having a bad day. \u00a0He also respects the authority of the campus Resource Police Officer. \u00a0First of all, the officer has taken the time to get to know him, and will give him cool down techniques, instead of antagonizing him when he's already upset. \u00a0Red also has enough sense to realize that getting a ticket for disturbing the peace, verbal assault, or possibly going to jail for destroying school property ...is definitely not a consequence that he wants!\u00a0 \n \n \nWe start the I.E.P. meeting with Red in the room, discussing his feelings about his current school year, and what he feels he needs as far as support for the following school year. \u00a0He is mostly talking about social issues...very little to do with academics or goals for his future. \u00a0He just wants to get out of there. \u00a0High school is pretty much an exercise in torture for him. \u00a0Although, he has a lot of positives in his day, and he has come so far, he still has a tendency to focus on the negatives.  \n \nOne of the biggest positives is his work with students with more severe disabilities. \u00a0 In fact, as we were \u00a0walking down the hallway before his meeting, he sees some of his special friends in wheel-chairs, \u00a0or those who don't communicate much verbally. \u00a0He goes up to them, gives them a huge hug, a smile and introduces them to us. \u00a0He actually ends up leaving his meeting early to go on a field trip with these students.  \n \nWe set up his schedule for next year. \u00a0He will complete all high-school credits necessary for graduation by January. \u00a0He will also only be on campus half-days. \u00a0Hopefully, he will be employed the other half of the day. \u00a0He will also be involved in the 18 Plus social skills program that the district offers. \u00a0The last semester of school will he will be completely in 18 Plus services. \u00a0He will then walk the stage with his peers in June to receive his diploma.  \n \nNow I have the joys, of working on other transition issues for him. \u00a0We will need to file for guardianship before he turns 18. \u00a0I just do not see him being responsible enough to make financial and/or medical decisions for himself at the age of 18. \u00a0For example recently, when we received his lab results telling us that he needs to watch the saturated fat content of his diet, he tells me that's ridiculous!  Yes son...the scientific, medical lab results are ridiculous! \u00a0It's a conspiracy even.  \u00a0The idea of changing his diet is not something he wants to face. \u00a0Changes period, are not the friend of many people on the spectrum. \u00a0The thought of change causes anxiety and for Red an automatic answer of - NO! \n \nI will also be applying for Social Security Disability before he turns 18 in hopes that he can start receiving benefits once he turns of age. \u00a0That should help with some of the expenses of college or receiving some professional training, so that hopefully someday, he can become independent and get the heck out of my house! \n \nAlthough I walked into this meeting somewhat nervous and ready for a fight, it went really well. \u00a0On the way out the Special Education District Representative gave my husband her name and phone number and asked us to call her anytime if we were having difficulty with the high-school administration. \u00a0She also stopped by the A.P.'s office and had a chat with him to express our concerns. \n \n Editorial Note:  3/4 or half-days is a possibility as an accommodation depending on your child's circumstances. \u00a0My son is on modified curriculum, which makes it much more feasible. \u00a0Otherwise, it may extend the period of time in which they complete courses required for graduation. \u00a0Ask your doctor or therapist if you think this is something that would truly benefit your child.\u00a0 \n \n Click Here to go to \"I.E.P.'s Part 2\" \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X-3LQlTPwTE/UWb2qjY5d6I/AAAAAAAABG4/yXcdPDXeVow/s1600/Unknown-5.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-tale-of-two-ieps-part-1.html", "title": "\nA Tale of Two I.E.P.'s -Part 1\n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 12, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \nBlue ran his entire I.E.P. meeting! \u00a0The kid is a freakin' rock star! \u00a0In the beginning he made all of the introductions. \u00a0He then followed the pre-planned agenda and fully participated in the plan for his transition into high-school. \n \nLike I said in  Part One  of this post ...the difference between Blue and Red is like the difference between night and day! \u00a0Not only does he have a road map for his transition into high school ...he has a plan for college and graduate school. \u00a0He stated during this meeting that he wants to become an Industrial Engineer! \u00a0Hell-looo! \u00a0This profession requires a minimum of a Bachelors Degree, however he would like to get a Master's Degree as well. \u00a0Then he says, \"If I'm really lucky...I wouldn't mind getting a PhD.\" \n \nHe tells us all how he felt about his progress in the past year and followed up by asking me how I felt about it. \u00a0He then asked me what my concerns were. I told him that I think he has made a great deal of progress this year. \u00a0He has grown and matured. \u00a0I am very proud of the self-advocacy skills that he has developed. \u00a0My biggest concern is his level of anxiety and stress at the end of the day. He is so wound up by the time he gets home, I see a different kid than his teachers see at school. \u00a0I see meltdowns and falling apart over homework. \u00a0Some days, he is so worn out from making it through the school day that he has nothing left to give at night - especially, for 2 or 3 hours worth of homework. \n \nHe then goes around the room, asking the same question of his Language Arts teacher who is in attendance, his Special Education tracking teacher, and the School Psychologist. \u00a0After everyone gave their reports, \u00a0he asked his Special Ed teacher what his other teachers (who were not in attendance) thought about his progress this year.  \n \nThe reports from all of the teachers were glowing -even from the Pre-AP Math teacher from hell. \u00a0He has no love for her ...and because she comes across with a very flat affect, and is not warm and fuzzy by any means, he thinks that she doesn't like him. \u00a0Not only that, not to long ago, she made an attempt not to give him one of his accommodations (extra-time). \u00a0He had to advocate for himself and go above her head to make it happen. \u00a0He didn't appreciate that at all! \u00a0I celebrated the fact that this boy who was afraid of his own shadow in 6th grade, is now standing up to a teacher who was trying to make him feel bad about getting the accommodations that he is entitled to by a legal document. \u00a0 Hah! Take that! \n \nHis Science teacher said he has \"superior skills in science, participates well and asks really good questions.\" \n \nHis Math Applications teacher (who helps with math practice and techniques) also gave a wonderful report, \u00a0 encouraging Blue to please come and see him one on one for tutorials more often, because he \"loves to see the way that his mind works.\"  \n \nWhatever kind of math they are doing at this point, actually requires a lot of creative thinking...outside of the box. \u00a0Where it's all about how you find the answer and showing your work, rather than the actual answer itself. \u00a0 I'm glad he doesn't need my help with this! \u00a0I am clueless when it comes to Algebra and beyond. \n \nI took special note that his History/Social Studies teacher said, \"He is a brilliant kid with a heart of gold.\"  Be still my heart.  \u00a0I had to remind him of this as soon as we got home that afternoon when he started in on the negative self-talk.  Woe is me. \u00a0I'm such a horrible person. \n.  \nThe most negative thing that any teacher had to say was that, \"He doesn't seem to give himself credit for being such an incredible student. \u00a0It's hard to watch him struggle internally when he is actually doing so well.\" \n \nWe talked about his schedule for next year. \u00a0He will continue with AP Geometry, Spanish 2, and AP Human Geography. \u00a0He had some apprehension about taking AP Language Arts because of the novels that will be assigned. \u00a0Reading and interpreting long works is not his strong suit. \u00a0Although, he scored  commended  on state testing in reading, the passages read in a state test are short.  \n \nHis Pre-Ap Language Arts teacher \u00a0was there to cheerlead him --recommending that he stick with AP Language Arts in high school. \u00a0She basically told him, there will be a lot of knuckle-heads in regular Language Arts and he will become exasperated with them. \u00a0The students in AP are more serious-minded like Blue. \u00a0So, it's kind of a trade off. \u00a0You could have the easier class, but he would be trading it for the stress of dealing with kids who are loud and playing around in class. She was thrilled when he decided to give it a try. \n \nI requested the presence of the Special Education Lead/Counselor from the high school to attend the meeting. \u00a0She also brought along one of the math teachers who also works with the local community college in the office of Students with Disabilities. \u00a0She was able to inform us all of the types of accommodations that will be available to him in college, so that we can structure his accommodations in high school along the same lines.  \n \n Accommodations~ \n \n \n We fought for \u00a0-the ability to get audio books to help him have multi-sensory reading experience. \u00a0The teacher this year actually provided them herself. \u00a0Next year -it will be his job to find the audio book, because that's what he would do in college. \n He will also have extra-time (up to 2 days) to complete assignments. \u00a0 \n He will have\u00a0a study-hall period worked into his schedule, which will also include a social-skills component. \u00a0He will have an hour and a half, every other day to work on completing assignments so that hopefully, he will have a little more down time at home to decompress. \u00a0 \n He will have assistance with breaking assignments down into chunks, so that he doesn't become overwhelmed and shut down. \u00a0 \n \n \nMost of these accommodations Blue actually asked for himself. \u00a0I am so proud of the fact that he knows exactly what he needs in order to be successful. \n \nThe last thing I fought for was an  OT Evaluation  for Blue. \u00a0Red is working with a wonderful  Occupational Therapist  at the high school who has gone above and beyond to help him with so many ADL's (activities for daily living).  \n \nBlue needs help with emotional and stress regulation. \u00a0I think that he needs a way to release some of his stress throughout the school day so that he doesn't come home so wound up. \u00a0An assessment will look at his strengths and weaknesses. \u00a0Therapy can include strengthening cognitive skills such as memory, following directions and paying attention to detail. \u00a0It will also assess his physical skills like coordination, strength and endurance. \u00a0Blue also has still not mastered tying his own shoes.  \u00a0He can do advanced math ...but can't tie his shoes.  \u00a0An Occupational Therapist should be able to help him with that. \u00a0I have tried everything I know how to. \u00a0He just gets frustrated and gives up. \u00a0( And of course, it's all my fault!)\u00a0 \n \nThe middle school I.E.P. Coordinator tried to give me this song and dance about him not really needing the evaluation. Another teacher spoke up and said that Occupational Therapy is usually only for physical issues. \u00a0They said the reason that Red receives services is because of how his pencil grip slows him down in writing. \u00a0 Um...I don't think so. \u00a0It's so much more than that. \u00a0 \n \nThe bottom line is that we walked away with my requested evaluation. \u00a0Before the meeting, I called Blue's tracking teacher to find out about the possibility of getting one. \u00a0Immediately, \u00a0she called the Occupational Therapist who would do the evaluation. \u00a0She agreed to do it ...no questions asked. \n \nIt never ceases to amaze me how you can sit down at these meetings and people can try to block services that are available to your child. \u00a0They give you that blank look like,  what are you talking about lady?   We don't do that. \u00a0 They seldom come up front and offer all accommodations and services that are available. \u00a0It's like  the policy is, 'Don't know...don't tell.  \u00a0Instead of , 'Whatever we can do to help.'\u00a0 \n \nAll \u00a0in all ...I would say that both meetings went very well. \u00a0They were completely different meetings, for completely different brothers on the autism spectrum. \u00a0We walked away with everything that I feel that both of them will need for the coming year. \u00a0But if not, you can bet your bottom, we will be sitting down at the beginning of the next school year to make any necessary adjustments. \n \n Here's to kicking ass and taking names and getting your child what he needs and deserves! Cheers! \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lcXK2CoAei0/UWg_6m6voWI/AAAAAAAABHI/xtoTg5zTNxs/s1600/images-2.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-tale-of-two-ieps-part-deaux.html", "title": "\nA Tale of Two I.E.P.s Part Deaux \n"},

Blue had his orthodontic appointment at 10 a.m. \u00a0Afterwards, we had breakfast together at a local diner. \u00a0We came home so that I could get Red all packed up for camp.  \n \nFor Blue, there would be no friends over for the day. \u00a0Everyone is unavailable, for some reason or another, rather it be traveling with family, or ordinary family obligations. \u00a0This means it's a day for him to chill here at the house. \u00a0As much as I love to chill, here at home ...he hates it! \u00a0He doesn't know how to relax. \u00a0He's a full-fledged teenager, Aspergers or not, who wants to socialize with his friends at every possible, free moment. \n \nI am busy washing clothes, labeling them, running up and down the stairs, getting Red's trunk packed for the Autism Summer Camp that he will be going to the following day. \u00a0A few years ago, I looked at these camps and only dreamed of sending him to one. \u00a0They are so expensive! \u00a0We fall somewhere in the middle, making too much money for scholarships, but hardly able to afford this luxury. \u00a0Hubby and I decided to sacrifice our vacation for 2 for his 50th birthday, in order to be able to send Red to this camp. \u00a0He is so close to 18 ...we are putting all of our money on getting him ready for adulthood. \u00a0We are hoping and praying that every step we take, will help him grow, mature, and get a grip on reality! \n \nThis mama washed brand new clothes, underwear, \u00a0and sheets, out of the package, so that they would be April fresh when he put them next to his skin and on his bunk. \u00a0I had to buy new, twin sheets, because he has a queen bed here. \u00a0Blue has a full. \u00a0I pray that those sheets will get used again very soon when one of them goes off to college. \u00a0I bought the twin extra-long kind, just in case. \n \nWell of course, through out the day there is one fight after another, one melt-down after another, over simple things. \n \nBlue -Why do you leave the bathroom door cracked when you use it? \u00a0Close the door! \nRed -What difference does it make? \u00a0Stop being so bossy ...telling me what to do! \nBlue -Stop making so many mistakes! \nLater that day Blue tells him -You don't know shit from honey! \n* Yeah...thanks a lot Grandfather. \u00a0You taught your grandson these fine words while he visited you this summer. \n \nRed hunches up his shoulders in his tough guy, I'm-gonna-kick-your-ass stance. \u00a0Blue does not back down.  \nFighting ensues. \nIt's ridiculous. \n \nLater, Blue melts down because Windows 8 isn't working correctly.  \n\"Technology never works the way it's supposed to! Damn this Windows 8!\" \n \nI actually make him come and watch television. I miss those days when Disney movies were the best babysitter ever. \u00a0Now I can almost never get Blue to sit down and watch t.v. or a movie here at home. \n \n\"Sit down! I mean it! You're going to watch a movie or a t.v. show until you laugh damn-it!\"  \n \n What mother has to make her child watch television? \u00a0An autism mother...that's who!   \n \nHe would rather fight with the computer and be angry than to literally change the channel and zone out with a little television. \u00a0I make him watch an episode of the Big Bang Theory. \u00a0 Love that show! You can't watch it and not laugh. \u00a0Well...I can't anyway. \u00a0 \nAfter the episode, we found a movie on HBO that he had never seen ... Cowboys and Aliens . \n \nHe was actually distracted for a while, until he made cookies and couldn't enjoy them because his teeth were hurting from the earlier ortho appointment. Then it was meltdown city all over again! \n \nIn between all of the packing, refereeing, and meltdown wrangling ...I would periodically check Facebook hoping for some quick laughter with some of my friends. \u00a0You know...to lighten up the heavy mood in the house. \u00a0Only towards the end of the evening, I started to see the posts. \u00a0\"Zimmerman Found Not Guilty.\" \n \nUgh, I felt it down in my gut. \u00a0I was not surprised, but disappointed. \u00a0I did watch parts of the trial thanks to my mother,  Mrs. T.V. Court Shows . \u00a0She watches them like it's her job and she is getting paid. \n \nPerhaps the case was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. \u00a0However, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind, that the young man did not have to die that night. \u00a0He did not have to be shot in the heart. \u00a0In the end...God will be the final judge. \u00a0There are no winners in this situation. \n \nI ache for my own young-black men, who can be and have been, profiled at some time in their lives. \u00a0Assumptions have been made because of the color of their skin. \u00a0It's happened at one point or another to every single-black man that I know, including my husband and brothers. \u00a0My brother was once harassed right in front of his very own house while washing his car ...a black man, in a white neighborhood, washing a fancy car. \u00a0 How dare him!  They actually hassled him, because he didn't have an I.D. \u00a0 Who has an I.D. when you're outside washing your freaking car!?\u00a0 \n \nOn top of the fact, that racism that is still very much alive in America, my boys also have a hidden disability. \u00a0They have autism. They see the world differently. \u00a0They have issues with explosive anger and depression. \u00a0They have low self-esteem in some ways, because of constantly fighting the battle of feeling different.  \n \nWe live in a county in Texas that is known for putting poor whites, and young blacks behind bars at the drop of a hat. \u00a0I fear the day that they encounter the police and assumptions are made, before there is an opportunity to explain who they really are and why they behave in certain ways. \n \nOn the very day of this verdict, I found myself explaining to Red why you can't say certain things because they will be considered a valid threat, even if you don't really mean it.  \n \n\"You're 17 years-old...you will be held accountable for things that you say, even in anger. \u00a0You never want to end up in a situation where a police officer, an attorney or a judge has to determine your fate.\" \n \nI swear for the love of me...he honestly could not wrap his mind around these facts. \u00a0He does not get it! \u00a0I don't know if he will ever get it!  \n \nI try to teach him about personal responsibility for his actions and his words. \u00a0He will come back at me and say things like, \"Well that's just not fair! Why are police officers so mean? \u00a0Why are judges so selfish? These laws are just unfair!\" \u00a0He really does not get how cruel and unjust the world really is. \u00a0He does not automatically receive the value that he assumes he should have. \u00a0He doesn't even seem to understand that he has to live by the rules of the world, not by the rules that are in his head.  \n \nBut you see...that is autism. \u00a0He lives inside of his head...inside of his very own world. \u00a0The problem and the reality is, that he also lives in America. \u00a0He lives in the state of Texas, where the color of his skin, \u00a0compounds the microscope that he is under. \u00a0Chances are ...if he ever gets into a legal situation, his disability may or may not be taken into account. I can't walk in his shoes...I can't be with him all of the time. \u00a0I can't protect him from the reality that is America. \n \nAs I tuck Blue into bed on this night, he says to me, \"I'm so sad Mom. \u00a0I'm so tired of being angry. \u00a0I hate when I upset you. \u00a0I'm just tired of this.\"  \n \nMy heart is especially heavy. \u00a0I want to take away his pain. \u00a0I want him to be happy and be able to see and feel the blessings of his life. \u00a0All I can do is say, \"You're going to be fine. \u00a0We just have to get through these teenage, hormonally imbalanced years. \u00a0It will get better.\" \n \nI tell him that I love him before I say goodnight. \u00a0I feel blessed that he has both myself and his father in this home, together, raising him, loving him, rooting for him. \u00a0In reality, I don't know if that will be enough to keep him safe...to help him make it in this unjust society. \u00a0I can't tell him my deepest fears. \u00a0He has enough of his own. \n \nMinutes later, I bribe Red into bed. \u00a0\"If you want me to make a nice breakfast for you tomorrow...you will go to bed now. \u00a0Otherwise, you can have cold cereal before you go off to camp.\" \n \nHe gets in to bed...and I give him the hug that he has been asking for all day. \u00a0He asks for hugs at least 20 times during the average day...usually, at inappropriate times, for no other reason I think than to bug the shit out of me! \u00a0I am trying to teach him about boundaries and space. \u00a0He is twice my size and weight, and he wants to swallow me up in smothering hugs. \u00a0I don't like it...it becomes annoying, especially when it's hot or I am in the middle of something that requires focus. \u00a0Some day, there will be a girl, who may or may not welcome all of these hugs, and he will have to learn to respect that. \u00a0It starts right here with me. \n \nBut on this night...the night of the Trayvon Martin / George Zimmerman verdict. \u00a0I think of Trayvon's mother who can no longer hold her teenage son in her arms. \u00a0I give Red the hug that he has been wanting and that I am so blessed to be able to give him. \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rSHwQu2TH_M/UeMD5y17wGI/AAAAAAAABPQ/dnJhXXYjHMs/s1600/1063761_10200330442688213_1601174132_o.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/07/on-this-night.html", "title": "\nOn This Night...\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, April 16, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nYou think that once your children are no longer babies, your sleepless nights are over. \u00a0Nothing is normal when it comes to my life. Nothing.  \n \nI didn't even plan on doing a blog post today. \u00a0I have too many other things to do. \u00a0But I woke up with my mind overflowing with thoughts and memories of my dream last night. \u00a0I was in a resort with my family and there was a fire. \u00a0The property was surrounded small fires that eventually turned into a big fire. \u00a0And guess who was trying to put the fire out? \u00a0That's right...it was me. \u00a0Because that's what I do you know...put out fires. \u00a0 Add that to my resume of jobs that I don't get paid for . \u00a0Firewoman.\u00a0 \n \nSometimes I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with my17 year-old son. \u00a0I have never been in an abusive relationship with a man, \u00a0but I think this must be what it feels like. \u00a0He dumps all of his crap on me. \u00a0He pushes me to the limit with all of his drama and each and every whacky, off the wall thought that he has to share with me. \u00a0I bare the brunt of the anger that he does not show the rest of the world. \u00a0The rest of the world only gets a taste of it. \u00a0I get the whole seven course meal! No wonder my appetite is so off these days. \u00a0I forget to eat sometimes probably because my mind is so full. \n \nHe is in the process of grief and anger over loosing a friendship. \u00a0Who cares that he actually has more friends right now than he has ever had in his life? \u00a0It's the elusive one that seems to count more than everything. \u00a0It means nothing that he spent the weekend hanging out with two friends having a complete blast. \u00a0He comes home angry about a friend who no longer wants to hang out with him. \u00a0 How in the hell does this happen . \u00a0Why can't he see his blessings? It doesn't make any sense. \u00a0This isn't normal! \u00a0But nothing in my life is normal. \u00a0Nothing. \n \nWho has a local cop on speed dial to come over and talk to her son who is acting out of control? Me. \u00a0Who has a police officer sitting at her kitchen table talking to her son because he was so angry earlier that evening that he wanted to storm out of the door and walk over to his ex-friend's house to make him talk to him? \u00a0He wants to show-up at someone's home ...uninvited and angry. \u00a0What is that going to get him other than the boy and his family thinking that they made the right choice by staying away from this boy? \n \nHe dumps every negative thought and feeling on me, using every curse word in the book for going on 2 days now...until I'm at the point where I no longer want to be in my own home when he is here. I want to run away, which I actually attempted to do Sunday night. \u00a0He begged and pleaded for me not to leave. \u00a0He loves me. \u00a0He needs me. \u00a0He promises to listen to me from now on. \u00a0\"What can I do Mom? I'll give you every dollar in my wallet if you won't leave. \u00a0Don't give up on me Mom.\" Abusive. Relationship. Not. Normal. \n \nHe sits there in front of our officer friend saying all of the right things. \u00a0Repeating the same words that I've said to him over the past couple of days, as if he has internalized the thoughts and knows the right thing to do and feel. \u00a0He is the exact complete opposite of the hate spewing monster who has been parking in my bedroom for days, refusing to leave...refusing to give me any space...any peace \u00a0Shooting me over an over with a barrage of negativity until my head is splitting and pulsating in pain. \n \nTo put icing on the cake...at 2 a.m. \u00a0I am awakened because the other son, Blue, knocks on my door to tell me he has to use the restroom. \u00a0 What in the hell does that have to do with me?  \u00a0He wants to use MY bathroom instead of his --the one that he shares with his brother. \u00a0It may not be clean enough for him. \u00a0I refuse to get up. \u00a0I send him packing back to his own freaking restroom! \u00a0I lay in bed listening to the sound of the toilet seat\u00a0slamming.  \n \nThe next thing I know...there is another knock at my door. \u00a0I think I flooded the toilet. \u00a0 Really?!?!  Nothing is in my life is normal. \u00a0Nothing. \n \n \n My Dog Harry Sleeping on his back. Nothing is Normal. Nothing. \n \nAfter this last interruption ...I lay awake listening to my husband's heavy breathing. \u00a0Thinking thoughts that my boys have shared with me over the past couple of days. \u00a0Sleep evades me.  \n \nBefore Bed, Blue tells me about feeling rejected by his best friend because he invited another friend over to spend the night. \u00a0Blue has been wanting to spend the night with him for weeks and \"he has excuses or blown him off.\" \u00a0I remind him that friends are not exclusive. \u00a0He also has other friends that he spends time with. \u00a0He can not choose or command that his best friend spend time with him and only him. \u00a0The problem is, Blue's self-esteem has been in the crapper for a while now. \u00a0He is depressed and extremely sensitive. \u00a0And of course ...I feel his pain.  \n \nThis is what I lay awake thinking about this morning when I should have one more hour to sleep. \u00a0But I can't. \u00a0Because nothing in my life is normal. \u00a0Nothing.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-T_dw4guLIBw/UW1QL1KpJiI/AAAAAAAABHc/JKtIdyGgvOw/s1600/IMAG0399.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/04/nothing-is-normal-nothing.html", "title": "\nNothing is Normal.

{"date": "Monday, April 15, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I am thrilled that Today's post is from one of my favorite writers -a daddy blogger\u00a0 \"Fathers for Autism\" \u00a0 he also has a wonderful\u00a0 Facebook Page \u00a0which is Simply A Must Follow. \u00a0The love that he has for his children shines through every word that he writes. \u00a0You just know that he is raising two children who will be wonderful citizens of the world when they grow up.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n My son fell asleep in my lap, exhausted from his day. \n \n I may not have too many more years of this...him wanting to cuddle with Daddy. I know I should cherish this moment, but I can only think about today's events. \n \n I watched him be big brother to his older sister today. \n \n Her challenges with autism have aged him, making him more patient, wiser. \n \n I looked at his sleeping face, relaxed at last, and saw something I hadn't seen all day. I saw the face of a 5 year old boy. He seemed so much older earlier... \n \n Nothing out of the ordinary happened today, just a typical day in an autistic household, but I saw something in his eyes and demeanor that made me both sad and proud. \n \n He got it. He understood. \n \n His sister was watching a movie and it was time to leave. Shark Tale. She'd seen the movie 100 times, so it wasn't a new or particularly special experience. Of course, a movie doesn't need to be new to be important and it doesn't need to be special to be meltdown-worthy. \n \n I said my daughter's name and clearly she knew my intent because the scream of \"NO!\" happened before I could finish the sentence. She shut her door and began to decorate her walls with the marks of flying objects. \n \n Then it happened. \n \n My son calmly walked into the room, unconcerned with his sister's anger. He walked over to her and said \"We can watch the movie together tonight. Would you like to play with my video game in the car?\". \n \n He repeated this a few times until she heard, understood, and accepted the offer. My son kept a calm tone and posture the entire time. \n \n 5 years old. \n \n Later that day, she had taken the iPad from him during his turn. They get a limited amount of time with it and have to take turns. He didn't reach out, didn't whine, didn't get upset. He simply walked next to her and said \"Can I watch you play, since you took my turn and then you can watch me play during your turn?\". She nodded. I picked my jaw up off of the floor. \n \n My pride in my son is well founded. He is becoming an extraordinary person due, in no small part, to his sister. \n \n It makes me sad, however, that they aren't simply playing, fighting and competing with each other. Typical siblings. \n \n He will never know that. \n \n His life is one of defending against teasing and worse, learning to be patient, and living in a household unlike any of his friends. He will likely learn leadership, empathy, and sense of charity. \n \n His innocence, though, is lost forever. \n \n He's seen the looks the other kids give his sister, he knows what they mean. He doesn't understand why they fear her, mock her, condemn her. She's simply his sister. He doesn't know her any other way. \n \n I hope he always has the same loyalty, love and acceptance for her. I hope he chooses to continue to shepherd and guide her through the world. I hope his need to be her champion remains strong. \n \n \n I can't ask him to always be there for her, especially when I'm gone, but I really hope... \n \n \n I am Guest Posting today over at\u00a0 Phat Jaye's -Find My Eyes .

I just found myself working harder to try to understand where he\u2019s coming from.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He still says insensitive things without thinking, isn\u2019t able to recognize human emotions (i.e when I am pissed off or hurt) unless I tell him, and is extremely difficult to drag out of the house unless necessary.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s very frustrating most of the time, so I vent.\u00a0\u00a0I vent to him and to those I trust, and I try to deal with it in whatever way gets me through it. I tell him exactly how I feel and how it often feels as if I am raising two special-needs kids instead of just one.\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s unflinchingly honest with his feelings, so I am the same way with him.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he chooses to stay home instead of going out with us, I try to make the best of it and enjoy my time out with our son as my date.\u00a0\u00a0The questions and comments still annoy me, but at this point I am so used to it and the people who invite us to functions are used to seeing us show up as a twosome instead of our whole family.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n It\u2019s not all bad, this being married to an Aspie business.\u00a0\u00a0For one thing, since they\u2019re pretty much incapable of being phony in any way, you always know where you stand with them.\u00a0\u00a0They don\u2019t just say things because it\u2019s the polite or socially acceptable thing to do.\u00a0\u00a0When they do or say something nice, you know it\u2019s genuine and not just an empty compliment that people sometimes feel they have to.\u00a0That\u2019s something I appreciate about him and always tell him so.\u00a0\u00a0Another benefit is that since he\u2019s very focused on details, he often is able to see things that I don\u2019t, especially with respect to our child.\u00a0\u00a0Our son has a more classic form of autism but my husband can often understand why he\u2019s upset and heading towards a meltdown, whereas I am not always able to.\u00a0\u00a0He is, in a sense, the autism whisperer in this household. \n \n \n \n Every marriage or long-term relationship has its challenges to face.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve heard of situations that make our differences seem like nothing.\u00a0\u00a0He is who he is and I am who I am:\u00a0\u00a0the same person who went into this marriage with the best intentions and the highest of hopes.\u00a0\u00a0It takes work like everything else in life but there are times, not all the time, mind you \u2013 that it is worth it. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://mamaneedscocktails.blogspot.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Its-500-somewhere-right/245848365548768", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XfJuF941kWI/UW8Xxe8pfhI/AAAAAAAABHo/Xp7XdHZPXEE/s1600/family.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/04/marriage-autism-guest-post-by-renee.html", "title": "\nMarriage & Autism  -Guest Post by Renee  \n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 23, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Guest Post by Jennifer Lynch- \n \n \n Editorial Note: \u00a0Jennifer is a single mother of 3 boys ages \u00a012, 7, and 6. They all have ASD anxiety, SPD, ADHD. \u00a0Her eldest also has schizoaffective disorder, her middle son has OCD, Tourette's, and her youngest also has ODD. \u00a0Jennifer is one of our \"Confessions\" Autism Mama's who always participates on our  Facebook Page \u00a0 and private group. \u00a0She has a wealth of knowledge and a background as a Psych nurse. \u00a0Since her middle son received diagnosis, she has not worked outside the home. \u00a0Jennifer is also on the autism spectrum.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Jennifers Boys\u00a0@ Eagles Stadium \n \n \n Transitioning times in school are difficult for any child, more so for a child on the autism spectrum. Going into High School, Middle School, and Kindergarten a parent is faced with a lot of choices. These choices come with no manual. Fortunately, as a parent, you are your child\u2019s most staunch advocate and know your child best. \n \n \n \n This is where we open with my son, age 12 and entering middle school next school year. He has been in every setting thus far and this will be his 8th school. \n \n He got picked up for services by EI (early intervention) for not talking at 2. Graduated into the public pre-school program, and just kept moving up. Kindergarten was full inclusion. It was a great year. So great we did it again! To give him some maturity time, develop speech. It helped. First grade full inclusion another great year. And then the problems started snowballing. Work got hard. Socially inept, we had disciplinary issues. Then attention problems. Before long we are adding medications, and behavior plans. And more services -Social Skills group. Now we are looking away from the LRE (least restrictive environment). We had one triennial that was so dismal we had an IEE (individual education evaluation) just to be certain these scores were right. Well essentially they were, but his needs weren\u2019t being met. Schools a lot of times offer the minimum. Not what they qualify for, you have to fight for that. \n \n The settings in a nutshell are \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, and \u2018C\u2019. An \u2018A\u2019 setting is regular education with up to 20% pull out support, \u2018B\u2019 is up to 40% pull out support, and \u2018C\u2019 is more than 40% pull out and referred to as self-contained. \n \n In an \u2018A\u2019 setting, it\u2019s full inclusion. Up to 1/3rd the class is NT (neurotypical developing). There are two teachers. In an Autism program, 1 teacher is Autism certified, the other regular education. In a non-Autism program it is a regular education teacher and special education teacher. \n \n In a \u2018B\u2019 setting, it\u2019s full inclusion. Same 1/3rd ratio of NT students, same teachers. It\u2019s just more support in small group instruction with the special education or autism certified teacher. \n \n Now for the \u2018C\u2019 setting. In middle school my son can be pushed in for Math and ELA (English Language Arts). Also recess, lunch, and specials. A lot of people argue against \u2018C\u2019 settings because there isn\u2019t exposure to typical peers. Maybe so in some programs but that shouldn\u2019t be the case. \n \n For my son, this \u2018C\u2019 setting will offer him a class size of 12 with 2 teachers. Push in for math and English. NT exposure for lunch, recess and specials. Life skills he won\u2019t get in regular education. If the goal is independent living, then this is where he needs training. All the kids have Ipads. This also isn\u2019t provided in the regular education setting. My son has significant writing and speech delays and processing issues. He can keep his Autism classification and continue full day ESY (extended school year) yet be in the \u2018C\u2019 setting that isn\u2019t Autism program so none of these kids have that social deficit. Every state has their own qualifications on programs for special education. My state of Delaware has Diploma and Certificate of Performance. He can stay DCAS which is diploma track on the \u2018C\u2019 setting if we choose. Though it\u2019s quite unrealistic to think he will meet the standards to qualify for a diploma. He can continue working towards a G.E.D. and stay in school until 21, and hopefully in the next 9 years the programs will change to meet the demands of the children that are up and coming. Vocational training in the \u2018C\u2019 setting is important too. Getting a job without a diploma, we will just have to cross that bridge later. I spent years trying to coerce the school to take my son into the Autism program as he was floundering in the regular education setting. Finally they took him in 5th grade (3rd assessment attempt). Now I\u2019m sending him back to the feeder school. The team thinks I\u2019m batty, and changing my mind which is nothing further from the truth. To keep him in the Autism feeder he\u2019d be in a class the size of 4-6, with all classified Autism, it\u2019s fixed, only choose diploma track or only Alt (alternative program), no pick and choose flexibility. One size doesn\u2019t fit all, just because you have an Autism classification does not mean necessarily that the Autism certified program will offer the best stuff for your kid. Ours in middle school offers self contained with no flexibility and only 4-6 kids and no shot at push in or taking the diploma track. And also no Ipads and no Wifi. Well that sucks! No, we don\u2019t want that Autism program anymore but we shall keep the classification. Our feeder school is around the block with kids he\u2019s known for \u00bd his life. So many benefits, and I don\u2019t see the cons. No brainer really. \n \n My advice is look at every program every transition year. To convince your team, get professional letters. I had ready made letters from developmental pediatrician saying he can\u2019t handle changing classes 7 times a day, he needs life skills for independent living. He needs an AT (assistive technology) assessment for the dysgraphia. \u00a0I got Physical Therapy script from the neurologist stating that he wants an assessment. Don\u2019t just ask for PT, speech or Occupational Therapy. \u00a0Its easy for them to say no. Come prepared with documentation from a doctor ...then they almost can\u2019t say no. Or if you ask and they say we don\u2019t think he/she needs that, then go to plan b. They are too afraid of due process. That gets things moving. We take it as it comes, choose the best option for my son, \u00a0and continue zig zagging our way, navigating through the public school system on the road less traveled. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=tn_tnmn", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-obndWlwjOuM/UXajudE6c8I/AAAAAAAABH4/2urlUSR6sEo/s1600/J'sBoys.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-road-less-traveled-public-school.html", "title": "\nThe Road Less Traveled: Public School Settings and Autism\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 24, 2013", "body": "\n \nI'm good for telling my boys, when they feel sadness and depression for no apparent reason, to just change the channel. Do something different to get your mind off of your worries. \u00a0Watch a funny movie. \u00a0Listen to good music. Go do something physical. Count your blessings! \u00a0Your life is so full of them. \u00a0The past few days, I've needed to take my own advice. \n \n \n \nI have a friend who is going through an excruciating time right now. \u00a0I've been there to encourage her to get off the couch. Get busy! Eat! Go to the beach! Go for a walk...do something...anything. \u00a0All the while I'm dishing out this advice, I'm feeling like crap myself. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe thing is I have absolutely no valid reason to be sad, or down. \u00a0In fact, I have some pretty damn good reasons to be happy. \u00a0Red is away at camp right now. \u00a0That means no daily phone calls to say... \n \n -Mom I'm hungry. What am I supposed to eat?\u00a0 \n \n -I'm bored!\u00a0 \n \n -I am NOT going back to that high school next year! \u00a0 \n \nNot only is this an investment in him. \u00a0Truthfully, it is also an investment in my sanity. \u00a0There is no bickering and fighting with between the two boys. \u00a0No bickering and fighting between Red and my mom. \u00a0They both seem to get a kick out of pushing each other's buttons.  \n \nAlso, Hubby took off on a trip to see his father for a few days. \u00a0So technically, that's two less hungry men to cook for, and worry about. \u00a0The only boss I have in the house is Blue. \u00a0And even he has been keeping himself pretty busy, with his own social agenda. \u00a0Of course, I am on stand-by, beck and call for transportation, but at least it's only for one child and not both.  \n \nI'm blessed right? \u00a0Right!\u00a0Hell! I should be dancing on the ceiling! \u00a0But the truth is...I haven't been dancing at all. \n \nSo yesterday I sat down to write this pity party blog post -whining about every thing I hate and why I'm sad. \u00a0When I finished writing I went to bed. \u00a0As I lay my head on the pillow, I think to myself ... you are the biggest whinny baby! \u00a0You should be happy! Karen -you are focusing on the negatives, when actually you are blessed.\u00a0 \n \nWriting is so cathartic. \u00a0From writing down my feelings yesterday...I figured out how pathetic I was being. \u00a0I was also able to figure out what it is that's giving me that feeling of ...ugh, something is missing.  \n \nI have more time on my hands than I've had in a long time. I have peace in the house and I don't know what the hell to do with it. \u00a0I'm just not used to it. \u00a0It is not my normal.  \n \nInstead of keeping myself busy doing fun things or anything for myself, I've been still sitting around at Blue's beck and call. \u00a0I've also been working on some long neglected projects in my house. \u00a0I've been doing some deep cleaning and organizing. \u00a0Not exactly fun stuff. \u00a0At the same time, what a blessing that I've been able to finally get to it. \n \nAnother thing that is missing ...is my partner in crime -my husband. \u00a0As much as he drives me nuts when he is here. We do still manage to have fun together. \u00a0Especially, when we can get time to ourselves. \u00a0I miss him right now. I miss him more than I usually do because I'm usually too busy to miss him. \u00a0I think it's making me a little sad that he's off vacationing, while I'm here doing all of the things. \u00a0The mostly boring things. \u00a0I'd rather be with him. \u00a0On the other side of the coin --he totally deserves this time with his father. He works so hard and doesn't do a whole lot for himself. So I should be happy for him right? Right. \n \nThe other thing I figured out from writing is \u00a0that I'm coming down off of a high, after spending a few weeks in California, in the cool breeze -hanging out with my friends and my family. \u00a0There was hardly ever a dull moment. \u00a0And when there was a dull moment -I was happy to just rest. There is so much to do there and there are so many people that I love. Being at home is a natural high for me. \n \nThe truth is ...I really do not like Texas.\u00a0I hate that there is no escaping the heat here in the summer. \u00a0My backyard is luscious and green right now, but I can't go back there and enjoy it because of the heat and mosquitos. \u00a0No offense Texas lovers, \u00a0but I am and always will be a California girl. \u00a0It hits me about this time  every year  when it is excruciatingly hot. \n \nThe only difference this year from others, is that I'm usually too busy to think about how much I hate it here. \u00a0But with things being a little more quiet than usual, my mind keeps drifting back to that little itch. \u00a0I'd rather be at the beach. \u00a0I'd rather be anywhere but here, giving kids and my mother rides to camp, to friend's houses, \u00a0doctors and the freakin' grocery store. \n \nAfter reading through my pity party post ...I decided that I needed to look at my blessings instead of my problems. \u00a0I need to sincerely appreciate this quiet time in my life. \u00a0I now have an extremely clean bedroom. \u00a0I mean every corner and crevice has been covered, much better than any maid service ever would. \u00a0I have re-organized all of the cabinets and drawers inside of my freshly, deeply cleaned \u00a0master bathroom. \u00a0I got rid of so much clutter. \u00a0I now have room for everything. \n \nAah...cleansing breath. \n \nSo this morning I woke up and decided to approach the day in a different way. \u00a0Here is my Facebook Status from this morning... \n \n ~Today I choose to focus on solutions rather than problems.\u00a0 \n On Courage rather than fear.\u00a0 \n Make it a positive day... \n And don't forget to laugh...even if it's at yourself. \n \nAnd I have chosen to do just that! Oh...and I finally got my hair colored. \n \nHere is one reason for me to smile today. \u00a0I haven't seen Red look this happy in ....forever! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fl-_pBoJhuQ/UfB05k9afdI/AAAAAAAABQQ/X7BITQaLJ2s/s1600/camp6.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/07/you-are-uninvited-to-my-pity-party.html", "title": "\nYou Are Uninvited to my Pity Party\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 24, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Editorial Note: Today's Guest Post is brought to you by Paul, another member of my  \"Confessions Facebook Community\"  .  Paul and I have never met personally, but I can tell you that he is a gentle spirit and an essential, positive part of our supportive community.  He offers us insight as someone who is on the spectrum himself, as well as being a married father of two children with Aspergers, a business owner and homeschool teacher for his son.  You will be touched and amazed by his story.  Without further adieu...  \n \n ~~~~~~~~ \n \n \n \n My Aspergers story actually started back in 1971, although I wasn\u2019t fully aware of it for most of the last 42 years. \u00a0I was one of those undiagnosed kids with whom autism rode shotgun as a silent partner throughout most of our lives, undetected by most of society and not fully realized until well into adulthood. \u00a0Had it not been for Aspergers beginning to show itself in the lives of my own kids approximately 7 years ago, I might have gone my entire life without ever knowing what Aspergers was at all. \n \n As a child growing up undiagnosed in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, without the benefits of early diagnosis, IEP accommodations, behavioral therapies, or the blooming awareness we enjoy today, life wasn\u2019t always a perfect picture. \u00a0In fact, it got pretty ugly sometimes. \u00a0What I\u2019m sure I looked like from the outside was a very socially awkward teenager with no ability to self-regulate, an explosive temper, poor executive function skills and no filter to speak of whatsoever. \u00a0What few self-taught coping skills I had seemed to center mostly around imitating the behaviors of others, and unfortunately those \u2018others\u2019 were mostly the types of people who should never be imitated at all. \u00a0I often found myself on the wrong side of those who loved me and seemed to have a knack for hurting them more than anyone else. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I also had a way of finding myself frequently engaged with law enforcement as well, and had been arrested at least a half-dozen times by the time I was 19. \u00a0To say the least, I had some behavior challenges. Most of the years between being a teenager and young adult, when most kids are applying for college and planning for their future, I had managed to work my way into a solid 5 year federal prison sentence at a US penitentiary in southern California. \u00a0 ( Note:  This part of my life is really a whole \u2018nother blog...much too long to get into here...but if you\u2019re a parent raising kiddos you think are maybe on a similar track...feel free to contact me anytime! \u00a0I\u2019ve got a few good insights and am always willing to talk about it! ) : ) \n \n More importantly than any of that though, as I grew into a young man with what was yet undiagnosed Aspergers, I was able to overcome those challenges and turn it all around for good. \u00a0The years between 22 and 26 were ones of tremendous change and growth for me because of some unlikely individuals that really reached outside their comfort zones and invested heavily into my life. \u00a0I didn\u2019t deserve this help, I didn't ask for it, but they didn\u2019t let any of that stop them anyway, and their actions became a huge catalyst for change. \u00a0I walked out of prison almost 15 years ago to the day - April 29, 1997 - and I have never looked back. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n In the years that followed I was able to get married, start a family, have two beautiful kiddos, own my own business and enjoy a successful career in landscape architecture and project management. \u00a0My kiddos, both with Aspergers, are now 10 and 11 years old. \u00a0They are the best things about me, and the reasons behind everything I do. The most recently written chapters in my life have seen me shift careers into working for a local area non-profit organization that exists solely to help special needs children and their families, take up advocating for autism services and education, and also beginning to homeschooling my own son. \n \n \n \n \n Paul and his Beautiful Family \n \n \n It\u2019s easy, knowing what I do now, to look back and see the fingerprints Aspergers has left all over my life...and not all of them are bad. \u00a0Some are extraordinarily beautiful. \u00a0Truth be told, the vast majority are positive. While I recognize that things might have been very different for me had I gotten an early diagnosis or known some of the things about AS that we know today, I also don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s fair to place all of the blame for my early struggles squarely on having it. \u00a0Challenges, struggle, mistakes, bad decisions, not getting things we need, facing consequences...these are issues that everyone in life deals with regardless of your neurological standing \u00a0A life without Asperger\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean a life free of conflict or bad times. Those things will find you no matter what. More than that, I feel like Aspergers gave me the tools and strengths that I ultimately needed to help overcome many negative situations. \u00a0I consider it a blessing. \u00a0And that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s fun or that it\u2019s not frustrating and maddening or enough to drive you wonky some days...because we all know it  is  all of those things and more, but what I am saying is that I truly feel like my life is better off from having been touched by Aspergers than I would have been by not having it at all. \n \n Along the journey of these past 41 years, I\u2019ve picked up many things here and there from people much smarter than myself. \u00a0They\u2019ve sown into my life without the thoughts or hopes of anything in return, and if I could pass on even just \u00a03 of those things closest to my heart to any parent, child, adult or other person dealing with Aspergers and autism in anyway, this is what I would say: \n \n Serve others \n \n Have you ever noticed that the happiest people you see are generally the ones who are doing something for someone else? \u00a0The ones who are giving selflessly and investing of themselves into the lives of others? \u00a0The ones who offer encouragement and plant seeds of hope without any expectation of receiving back anything in return? \u00a0Be that person. \u00a0Encourage others, walk beside them, and share your experiences. \u00a0I wish I was a smarter guy and could tell you exactly why this works...but the simple truth is that I can\u2019t. \u00a0I just know that it does. \u00a0Somehow there is power in setting aside your own problems and conflicts and struggle, and turning your focus toward helping others through theirs instead. \u00a0Serving others has been something I practice with my children regularly, from homeless shelters to mowing yards for elderly folks to carrying grocery bags at a store...again, I don\u2019t know why, but the blessing you receive in a situation like that is far greater than any you give out. \u00a0It works. \n \n Fear is a liar \n \n Fear will cripple and paralyze you faster than anything else. It\u2019s relentless. It will seek to isolate you, fill you with doubt, and leave you feeling helpless. \u00a0Fear might tell you that you\u2019re alone in your struggle. \u00a0It might tell you that everything is your fault. \u00a0It might tell you that you\u2019re not capable of changing anything. \u00a0Fear says it\u2019s too late; there\u2019s nothing that can be done. Fear will tell you that people won\u2019t understand you, that you\u2019re alone, and it will ridicule you to no end. \u00a0Fear will make you feel embarrassed and insecure. Don\u2019t believe it for a minute. Fear is a liar and a thief. \u00a0Surround yourself with positive people who speak truth, share experiences, and walk alongside people who support and understand you. \u00a0Learn encouragement and forget judgement. \u00a0Challenge fear at every turn; make it prove you wrong. \u00a0Find new ways, breathe new life. \u00a0Try new things and don\u2019t be afraid to fail. \u00a0Toss the rule book. \u00a0Forget how things have always been done. \u00a0Explore options. \u00a0After all, if the fear speaking to you is right, then what have you got to lose? \u00a0When fear says \u2018quit\u2019 or \u2018why even try\u2019, that\u2019s exactly when you should stand up and thrown in everything you have. \u00a0The fight is worth it! \n \n Celebrate what is \n \n Everyday. \u00a0Every little thing. \u00a0Celebrate it. \u00a0Be grateful for small things and never take them for granted. \u00a0Small things become big things. \u00a0Focus on the positives and develop those first. \u00a0Point out what a person does right, and be willing to leave alone sometimes what they do wrong. \u00a0I\u2019m not saying ignore it, or refuse to deal with it. \u00a0We should always be committed to making progress and positive change, but I\u2019m saying don\u2019t wait until a certain trait, issue, challenge, struggle or anything else is perfectly resolved before you celebrate it. Any progress, any victory, and small step forward is cause for big celebration in the world of autism. Gratitude is a beautiful and powerful thing. \u00a0It can overwhelm troubles and bad attitudes like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen.  \n \n You all in this community bless me everyday and I\u2019m humbled to be a part of it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Many thanks to you all : ) \n \n \n \n \n I can only hope that one day my boys will be as successful and inspirational like Paul . Thank you again for sharing your story with us.  You can best believe...this is one story that I will make sure my  children and my husband read.  ~Karen \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=tn_tnmn", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_5Tt83eXk4/UXgCRDh_blI/AAAAAAAABIY/4gpWpcr0wGM/s1600/PaulsFamily.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/04/my-aspergers-story-guest-post-by-paul.html", "title": "\nMy Aspergers Story -Guest Post by Paul \n"},
{"date": "Friday, April 26, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n Guest Post~ \n \n \n \n I am excited to bring you today's post, written by Molly, one of our Confessions autism mamas. \u00a0She is the mother to \u00a0a 4th grade boy with Aspergers. \u00a0He was diagnosed near the end of 2nd grade.\u00a0\u00a0This is their story of learning to play team sports. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Where we live there are many sports opportunities and we have tried many of them.\u00a0\u00a0You don't know if you're going to like it if you don't give it a try, right?\u00a0\u00a0Most seasons are just a few weeks long for the young ones so you haven't lost much if you don't enjoy the sport you picked.\u00a0\u00a0One of the first things we tried was soccer.\u00a0\u00a0For the preschoolers it is parent/child together skill building with a few scrimmages.\u00a0\u00a0This went OK for us as all the preschoolers were just as clueless and uncoordinated.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n A couple years later we got to team soccer where each week we had a practice and a game.\u00a0\u00a0He wanted to go to soccer each week, but wasn't really \"into it.\"\u00a0\u00a0Practices were fine because there were many adults working in small groups with the kids.\u00a0\u00a0There was always someone available to give a reminder or take the time to practice a skill with the kids. So many of the kids were simply not that\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0good at the sport yet either.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n At the games my son would often be unsure where he was supposed to go next. He would look to the coaches for suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking back he responded better when people would show him rather than give verbal instruction.\u00a0\u00a0He would play his part of a quarter a couple of times and then be \"just done\" with the game for the day.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was assessed and diagnosed just after the soccer season ended that year. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n After diagnosis, of course I did alot of\u00a0\u00a0research.\u00a0\u00a0One thing I learned was that kids with Aspergers just don't play team sports well.\u00a0\u00a0That was fine for other kids, but mine wanted to play team sports.\u00a0\u00a0I was determined to find a way to make this successful for him.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n The following year he decided to try basketball. Unfortunately basketball is a fast-paced game and my son is a slow processor.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Most boys from our school played in a different league; we didn't know many families on this team and they didn't know us.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the coaches before the season began to ask how we could work together to help my son play basketball.\u00a0\u00a0Imagine my surprise & delight to find out that one coach was a SpEd Phy Ed teacher and the other was an Autism Specialist!\u00a0\u00a0Together we made accomodations to the game that both allowed my son to be successful and allowed the rest of the\u00a0\u00a0boys to have a good season. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Books \n \n We went to the library to find books about basketball.\u00a0\u00a0When we got to practice, my son had an idea about the game and the vocabulary of the game.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Simplify Positions \n \n The league encouraged every kid to try every position.\u00a0\u00a0This was simply too much processing for my son.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We settled on teaching him just 1-2 positions to play for each game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He knew he could expect to be in one spot when the team was on offense and another spot when on defense.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This is also realistic of team sports as kids get older - players are often guards or forwards but not both.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Adapting Plays \n \n Our coaches were teaching the boys to run plays in their games.\u00a0\u00a0They made sure that my son's role in each play was about the same.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not very effective at outsmarting the opposing team, but it helped my son successfully execute his part in the play.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Breaks \n \n This league was a no substitution league - the purpose was for every player to get an equal amount of playing time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each player was to play a full quarter at a time - way too much for my son.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He would play a few minutes at a time before he needed a break.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coaches & I learned to read the signs that a break was needed.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone wanted to give him as much playing time as he could handle.\u00a0\u00a0He would start the quarter, play a few minutes, take a break, then finish the quarter.\u00a0\u00a0Before each game we would talk to the officials to explain the situation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They were always flexible and allowed us to make these substitutions.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Visual Cues \n \n One thing we know about kids with Aspergers is that visual cues are a huge help.\u00a0\u00a0But how to make visual cues for basketball?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coaches, my son & I worked together to create hand gestures to signal actions.\u00a0\u00a0We also brought along a small white board to write or draw cues for the game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was a spot on the court that looked like\u00a0\u00a0a block.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If my son was to go to that spot, we would pat our heads - block heads.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he was to go to the \"elbow\" on the court we would touch our elbows.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When calling plays we would write a symbol for the play on the white board and hold it up.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0When the messages were received my son would flash a thumb up. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n We also used hand gestures to gauge his need for a break.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could flash us a thumb up, down or in the middle to let us know how soon he would need a break.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both the coaches and officials had a clear-cut way to know when a substitution would be needed.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Teammates \n \n We couldn't have asked for a better team.\u00a0\u00a0The boys learned to be tolerant and helpful to my sons struggles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parents were supportive of the accommodations made.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We never did a big lesson in Autism awareness, but let the boys know a bit about why we were having my son do certain things in practices or games.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course the boys knew my son was different.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Near the end of the season things began to \"click\" for my son.\u00a0\u00a0During one game my son knew exactly what to do.\u00a0\u00a0He went to his spot and got ready for someone to pass the ball to him.\u00a0\u00a0The ball came his way.\u00a0\u00a0He turned, dribbled and took a shot!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I was stunned to look over in the stands to find every parent on our team cheering for my son.\u00a0\u00a0Some were so proud of him that they had tears in their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0The game was delayed a few seconds while his teammates congratulated him.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n We finished out the season feeling successful at team sports, proving to ourselves that kids with Aspergers CAN do anything with the right support.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lzDSeGMASpI/UXqpBTaLOSI/AAAAAAAABIw/9ccTNAPcs3U/s1600/Soccer.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P_-FOHy9Gpc/UXqpQFKi7XI/AAAAAAAABI4/q1vLaPxNKzw/s1600/BBall.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/04/aspergers-and-team-sports.html", "title": "\nAspergers and Team Sports -Guest Post by Molly\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, April 30, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n\u00a0 Editorial Note: As we wrap up Autism Awareness Month, I bring to you our final Guest Post for the month of April... \n \n \n Cindy is one of our Confessions, autism mama's. \u00a0She is the mother of\u00a0 two amazing boys one of whom is confirmed to be on the spectrum and has\u00a0 an interestingly formed left hand, and one who might have ADHD. \u00a0Having children teaches us who we really are. \u00a0Having children with special needs teaches us love and compassion beyond any other experience in life. \u00a0Here is the story of how Cindy's special boys have changed her forever. \n \n \n \n My oldest, M is my Aspie with a 'different' hand. The very first thing I learned from him is that people are not their disability. \u00a0Different is not always bad- in fact it is often amazing! This boy was brought up to believe that his left hand was one of many outward signs that God made him special- just like I have dark curly hair and hazel eyes. He internalized it so much that when we were last at the hand Dr he told the Dr,\"no! That is a way God made me special!\" without looking up from the DS screen! I almost started laughing then and there! \u00a0 \n \n \n \n My boys both had physical challenges growing up, they had many therapies a week- and through that I learned that I grasp concepts of OT and PT very well. I guess I am a good student. \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \nMotherhood has shown me that I am capable of loving more than I ever thought possible-2 babies are more love!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Being their mom has shown me that I can find a creative solution to just about any situation! I am creative! (I used to draw, paint and sculpt. They all stopped when I learned to crochet and cross stitch.) \u00a0I have always encouraged my kids to be creative and try new art techniques- even finger painting with your knees! They brought my creativity back into my life. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n My little guy, A, has taught me so much about forgiveness and generosity. He will forgive you if you apologize. If you don't you are out of luck. And if you asked for it nicely, he would even share a favorite book with you! They had a fundraiser for the earthquake victims in Haiti a while back- and A was so excited about giving his dollar so he could wear a hat in school that he couldn't stop grinning! A cheerful giver lives here! He taught me that even things I need to give to, there is a joy in having enough to give \u00a0 \n \n \n \n M has taught me an amazing amount about finding my strengths. He is amazing at science, computers and ART- takes after his Mom I guess. His life has challenged me to re-examine who I am and where my strengths lie. \n \n \n \n One of \u00a0my creative outlets for a while was in making the boys birthday cakes. One looked like Blue's house from Blue's Clues, Elmo, Thomas the Tank Engine, Power Ranger, Death Star and I am sure I missed one or 2. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I have learned that I am a very creative person and that when my creative outlet is not available, I get downright irritable ! \n \n \n \n ADHD means: playing video games and having a coherent conversation actually can happen! \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Hypersensitive hearing is great for correcting people on the phone. It is also excellent in knowing who just pulled into the driveway or locating a cat \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I learned how to love by watching both of my boys with our cat, Yoda, and with each other. They both want to have the cats attention. But M wants to give the fur baby a full body hug and Yoda is not inclined to accept that as a hug. A wants to pet Yoda. And Yoda loves them both. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Cindy's Boys \n \n \n \nMy Boys bicker- they are preteen and teenaged- but they always look out for each other when the other one is upset. They check in with each other when they get home from school, and before bed. Just a ,\"Hi Bro\" but it is very meaningful.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I have learned that it does not all have to be perfect! And that I will never be this elusive perfect person no matter what. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I learned that the schedules I made for them as small children have prepared them for adulthood. We do not have too many rush around mornings- especially my Aspie! He turned 15 last year and he just started being responsible. \n \n \n \n I have leaned that I can survive on 6 hours sleep or less! Don't recommend it but I have achieved much in that state. I\u00a0 now understand the term 'silence is golden!' A is a little chatterbox so when he quiets down I am relieved. \n \n \n \n Special is the right word to describe my boys ...courageous, happy, and handsome. They have brought me back to life and they are my real life heroes! May blessings follow you wherever you go! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n1O11d9pOds/UYAuPvfdZVI/AAAAAAAABJQ/RNq7we12QZE/s1600/image_1367354753674758.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/04/how-my-kids-have-helped-me-grow-guest.html", "title": "\nHow My Kids Have Helped Me Grow -Guest Post by Cindy \n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, June 19, 2013", "body": "\n \nA friend posted this list on my Facebook group over the weekend. \u00a0I forwarded it to my husband as a reminder of exactly what Aspergers is. \u00a0I think that sometimes when we live in the spectrum each day...when it hits us so close to home with our children, we can forget that they are not always simply trying to be difficult. \u00a0Many of their personality characteristics and behaviors are indeed a part of the diagnosis. \u00a0As much as we would like to magically change some of their behaviors through discipline, education and therapy...many things come from their different way of thinking. \u00a0Some things may never change, no matter how much we bang our heads against the wall trying to control them and get them to fit in to the norms of society. \n \nWhat is Aspergers? \n \n \n Image Courtesy of RabbiPaul.blogspot.com \n \n \n \nBelow is a fairly exhaustive list of Aspergers characteristics; however, keep in mind that no two Aspies are the exactly the same, and no single Aspie has ALL these traits. If you suspect your child or partner has Aspergers, the best thing you can do, as a parent or spouse, is arm yourself with information about this disorder. \n \n Personal / Physical\u2014 \n \n\u2022 Being \"in their own world\" \n\u2022 Can engage in tasks (sometimes mundane ones) for hours and hours \n\u2022 Can spend hours in the library researching, loves learning and information \n\u2022 Clumsiness \n\u2022 Collects things \n\u2022 Doesn't always recognize faces right away (even close loved ones) \n\u2022 Early in life they often have a speech impediment \n\u2022 Eccentric personality \n\u2022 Excellent rote memory \n\u2022 Flat, or blank expression much of the time \n\u2022 Highly gifted in one or more areas (e.g., math, music, etc.) \n\u2022 Idiosyncratic attachment to inanimate objects \n\u2022 Intense focus on one or two subjects \n\u2022 Likes and dislikes can be very rigid \n\u2022 Limited interests \n\u2022 May have difficulty staying in college despite a high level of intelligence \n\u2022 Non-verbal communication problems \n\u2022 Difficulty reading body language, facial expression and tone \n\u2022 Preoccupied with their own agenda \n\u2022 Repetitive routines or rituals \n\u2022 Sensitivity to the texture of foods \n\u2022 Single-mindedness \n\u2022 Speech and language peculiarities (hyperlexia) \n\u2022 Strong sensitivity to sound, touch, taste, sight, and smell (e.g., fabrics, won\u2019t wear certain things, fluorescent lights) \n\u2022 Uncoordinated motor movements \n\u2022 Unusual preoccupations \n\u2022 Word repetition (they may frequently repeat what you've just said) \n \n Social Interactions\u2014 \n \n\u2022 Can obsess about having friends to prove they\u2019re \u201cnormal\u201d \n\u2022 Desire for friendships and social contact but difficulty acquiring and maintaining them \n\u2022 Difficulty understanding others\u2019 feelings \n\u2022 Great difficulty with small-talk and chatter \n\u2022 Has an urge to inform that can result in being blunt or insulting \n\u2022 Lack of empathy at times \n\u2022 Lack of interest in other people \n\u2022 May avoid social gatherings \n\u2022 Preoccupied with their own agenda \n\u2022 Rigid social behavior due to an inability to spontaneously adapt to variations in social situations \n\u2022 Shuts down in social situations \n\u2022 Social withdrawal \n \n In Relationships (mainly pertains to Aspergers men)\u2014 \n \n\u2022 Can often be distant physically and/or emotionally \n\u2022 Can stop putting any effort into relationship after a time, and doesn\u2019t understand why she then stops giving too \n\u2022 He can be very critical and takes it personally if she won\u2019t wear something he likes, or wears something he dislikes \n\u2022 He can become quite defensive when she asks for clarification or a little sympathy; the defensiveness can turn into verbal abuse (usually not physical abuse) as the man attempts to control the communication to suit his view of the world \n\u2022 He has a hard time saying \u201cI love you,\u201d showing physical affection; as a result it is difficult to find out if they do love you \n\u2022 He will do what he thinks is best for the both of them but seldom talks to her about her feelings or opinions \n\u2022 His attention is narrowly focused on his own interests \n\u2022 If she tries to share her love for him, he may find her need to \u201cconnect\u201d smothering \n\u2022 Men with undiagnosed Aspergers often feel as if their partner is being ungrateful or \u201cbitchy\u201d when she complains he is uncaring or never listens to her \n\u2022 Often are attracted to another purely because they are attracted to him \n\u2022 Often times they will make no motions to keep a relationship going (be it friendship, or something more) \n\u2022 They won't call, and you might not see them for days; that doesn't mean they don't care \n \n Positive Aspergers Traits\u2014 \n \n1.

Focus and diligence \u2013 has an ability to focus on tasks for a long period of time without needing supervision or incentive is legendary. \n \n3. Higher fluid intelligence \u2013 scientists in Japan have recently discovered that Aspergers kids have a higher \u201cfluid intelligence\u201d than non-Aspergers kids. Fluid intelligence is the ability to find meaning in confusion and solve new problems. It is the ability to draw inferences and understand the relationships of various concepts, independent of acquired knowledge. Experts say that those with Aspergers have a higher than average general IQ as well. \n \n4. Honesty \u2013 the value of being able to say \u201cthe emperor isn\u2019t wearing any clothes.\u201d \n \n5. Independent, unique thinking \u2013 people with Aspergers tend to spend a lot of time alone and will likely have developed their own unique thoughts as opposed to a \u2018herd\u2019 mentality. \n \n6. Internal motivation \u2013 as opposed to being motivated by praise, money, bills or acceptance. This ensures a job done with conscience, with personal pride. \n \n7. Logic over emotion \u2013 although people with Aspergers are very emotional at times, they spend so much time \u2018computing\u2019 in our minds that they get quite good at it. They can be very logical in their approach to problem-solving. \n \n8. Visual, three-dimensional thinking \u2013 some with Aspergers are very visual in their thought processes, which lends itself to countless useful and creative applications. \n \n \n \nThe source of this information is written by Mark Hutten, M.A, and can be found in the link below. \n \n The Aspergers Comprehensive Handbook  \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TCJTyQghA2g/UcHyYv4qeDI/AAAAAAAABNM/posGLSSvzkg/s1600/images-1.jpeg", "http://www.myoutofcontrolteen.com/Aspergers-Handbook"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/06/what-is-aspergers-comprehensive-list.html", "title": "\nWhat is Aspergers? -A Comprehensive List \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 10, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \nI was fortunate enough to be asked to  review the book  the children's book \"Spaghetti is not a Finger Food and other Life Lessons\" by Author Jodi Carmichael last month for Little Pickle Press. \u00a0Today, I am pleased to have the privilege to interview the arthur as a part of the Blog Book Tour. \n \nIn  Spaghetti  the author\u00a0uses humor and vivid imagery to take the reader through an elementary school day in the life of Connor (the main character) \u00a0who appears to have Aspergers.  \n \nAs a mother of two boys on the spectrum, reading the story reminded me of many of the stories I would here \u00a0from my own children each day about the challenges they faced during their elementary school days. \n \n \n Jodi tell me something most people don't know about you?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I have ADHD, with a side order of anxiety. I was only recently \u201cofficially\u201d diagnosed, but I\u2019ve had my suspicions for quite some time. A friend of mine, about 5 years ago, gave me some ADHD pamphlets and suggested I would find them interesting. When I read them, I said, \u201cOh my gosh \u2013 this is me!\u201d All she said was, \u201cI know.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I guess there\u2019s truth to the saying, \u201cIt takes one to know one.\u201d \n \n \n \n Have you always had a love for writing?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Yes, I have. When I was in 7 th  grade I wrote this long, dramatic novel for my classmates. Every few days I\u2019d read the girls another chapter. It was called, \u201cToo Young to Die.\u201d It was about a boy dying of cancer. They loved it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I remember the teacher rolling her eyes and being highly critical. It was crushing and I pushed my writing dream aside. After the encouragement of my mom, who enrolled and paid for my first online writing course I started writing again. That was eight years ago, and from the moment I started, I\u2019ve been hooked. \n \n \n \n What inspired the idea for this book?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n The main character Connor woke me up, just before midnight on Boxing Day, 2007, telling me all about his day at school - in detail. I zipped downstairs to my computer where I madly typed all he had to say. It was the coolest thing that has happened to me as a writer. I later turned, what I call \u201cConnor\u2019s Rant,\u201d into a chapter book.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I have ADHD, so some of his personality is a bit of me, but I also did a lot of research to make sure his characteristics were a true reflection of a child with Asperger\u2019s. And then to make doubly sure I was correct, I had two child psychologists review my manuscript.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n What did you hope to achieve by writing it?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I hope it will bring understanding, compassion, acceptance, and inclusion for people with Asperger\u2019s. I hope it will give kids on the Autism Spectrum a thrill to see someone they can relate to, triumph, and become the king of the school.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n As well, I have absolute zero tolerance for bullying. Often kids that display \u201cdifferent\u201d behaviour at school quickly become targets. My hope is that if kids understand why their classmates are acting differently or unusually (and if we get to these kids at a young enough age), we can nip the teasing and bullying in the bud. \n \n \n \n \n \n Is Connor a fictionalized version of someone in your life?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Yes and no. He really is his own person \u2013 in my imagination and now in eBook form. However, I seem to be a magnate for kids that are different or are having trouble fitting in. I\u2019ve done a lot of classroom volunteering and have recently taken a position as a school secretary and we are just drawn to each other. Having ADHD, I think helps. I just \u201cget\u201d those kids. \n \n \n \n Did you ever actually follow\u00a0a child on the spectrum through a school day or did you come up with these scenarios based on stories your own child told you? \n \n \n \n No, Connor told me his day and then I imagined the details, using his \u201cvoice.\u201d \n \n \n \n In your research for the book did you find such a supportive staff in an elementary school like Connor had in the book i.e. the principal and Ms. Rossetti?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I think most schools strive to be the best they can be \u2013 with strong staff and leaders working together to provide every possible support they can for each student. My experience with my own kids has been outstanding. As well, the school I work at is phenomenal and I feel privileged to work there. The teachers, the resource team, the administrators are all caring, loving, and supportive. \n \n \n \n With  Spaghetti , I wanted to showcase the best of all teachers, because that is what we all want for our kids and what every child deserves. \n \n \n \n You seemed to really get inside of Connor's head to let us see how he processes thought.\u00a0 How he jumps from one idea to the next.\u00a0 How were you able to do that?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Every writer has their strengths and weaknesses. I am very good at \u201cvoice\u201d \u2013 telling the story from a character\u2019s point of view. I struggle more with plot. I think a bit like Connor as well; I have a lot of thoughts bouncing around my head. All. The. Time. That\u2019s what makes writing a great outlet for me. \n \n \n \n What will your next writing project be like? \n \n \n \n I have a few on the go! One is a YA Romantic Comedy, called  Who Needs Romeo \u2013 A Tale\u00a0of a Modern Day Juliet  and I was recently accepted into the Manitoba Writer's Guild's Sheldon Obermen Mentorship Program as an apprentice. \u00a0With my mentor, Carolyn Gray, I get to work on  Who Needs Romeo  intensely for the next 5 months. \u00a0We will focus on my arch nemesis - plot.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n My other project is a middle grade book and I\u2019m in the research stage. It\u2019s based on my Grandfather, who was a fascinating man. He was a genius, but didn\u2019t speak until age 7; a Rhodes Scholar; Studied Law at Oxford; and a pilot in the RAF out of London. When asked what he did in the war, he only replied, \u201cI ran rum for the Queen.\u201d His war records keep getting sealed. The war ended nearly 70 years ago, which makes me ridiculously curious.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n What happened? Why can\u2019t we know? What if three kids discovered the secret?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I can hardly wait to get started\u2026 \n \n \n \n Where can we find more of your writing? \n \n You can follow me on my blog\u00a0 Writing And Other Life Lessons \n \n \n \n Jodi Carmichael, Author \n \n \n \n \nYou can get your own Kindle downloadable version of  Spaghetti is Not a Finger Food  \u00a0by clicking\u00a0 Here \n \n \n \nTo get more information about this and\u00a0other books available from Little Pickle Press click\u00a0 HERE \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VACBXy1dwbs/UO4gwkmM-0I/AAAAAAAAA8c/a18W5dzEcvw/s1600/Spaghetti_Cover_small.jpg", "http://blog.littlepicklepress.com/2012/12/book-review-spaghetti-is-not-finger.html", "http://writingandotherlifelessons.blogspot.com/", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-r6J_rZOFdcw/UO5S5vcJ2DI/AAAAAAAAA80/SF31bGvkJJ4/s1600/Jodi+looking+at+camera1.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/Spaghetti-Finger-other-lessons-ebook/dp/B00ADVR54U", "http://www.littlepicklepress.com/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/01/blog-book-tour.html", "title": "\nBlog Book Tour \n"},

I am enjoying every single minute...bathing in the warm son as I am cooled by the gentle, ocean breeze. \n \nMy very close friend Mary invites us all over for dinner at her place, where we can relax comfortably, and visit as long as we like. \u00a0I figured this would be more fun than meeting in some stuffy restaurant, where children would be forced to behave for an extended period of time.  Ha! Good luck with that! \u00a0 \n \nOur other partner in crime Jenny, and her family are also in attendance. \u00a0We all want to catch up and see how each other's children have grown. \u00a0We also want the kids interact and socialize with one another.  \n \nJenny, Mary and I met when we were all just about 20 years-old. \u00a0Jenny and I were dating twin brothers. \u00a0Mary dated the twin's best friend at the time. \u00a0Well, we left those fellows behind, but we have remained very close for over 25 years. \u00a0I will admit that I am extremely jealous that Jenny and Mary get to spend way more time together seeing as they live in the same area. \u00a0Distance however, does not effect the place both of them and their families hold in my heart. \n \n \n Me & My Girls, Jenny and Mary \nholding pictures of ourselves in our party days \n \nIt is great to visit with my friends. \u00a0When we get together it's like time has not passed and we pick right up where we left off the last time we were together. \u00a0On the other hand, for me ...it was also a bit like a dinner party from hell. \u00a0Even vodka wasn't enough to stifle the nerves that Red trampled on.  \n \nI brought along my nephew. \u00a0All of the kids had a good time swimming in the icy cold pool. \u00a0Once we came upstairs to Mary's condo for dinner...hell started to break loose. \u00a0Blue takes every opportunity to push Red's buttons. \u00a0It may or may not be his intention. \u00a0But he is one of those people who knows everything and always has to let you know that you.are.wrong. \u00a0And when it comes to Red ...Blue is quite often right. \u00a0Red knows it and hates this -with a passion! \u00a0The disagreements get even more elevated when there is an audience.  \n \n \n Red, Blue and their Cousin, my nephew \n \n \nOn top of Blue ...pointing out Red's every flaw and error in thinking, my nephew also deems it necessary to comment on Red's weight and how he needs to lose some of it, in front.of.everyone. Red starts to get more and angry. \u00a0He gets louder and louder.\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm starting to get really pissed off Mom! \u00a0I feel like hitting somebody! \n \nI separate him from everyone for a few minutes to get him to calm down. Yes. \u00a0I put my 17 year-old son, in a time out. \u00a0In a corner. \u00a0In a chair. And told him not to move or talk. \n \nLater, after dinner...we go back outside to get in the jacuzzi. \u00a0This is a condominium complex. \u00a0There adults and children of various ages in the water. \u00a0My girlfriend asks Red a few simple, innocent questions and the next thing I know...he's on a roll, telling them about every fit of anger he has had in recent history. \u00a0How the cops have to come out to our house. \u00a0Oh and the kicker...somehow he he gets around to telling them that he likes to look at really hot girls! Yes...you read that right. \u00a0For everyone to hear including an 8 year-old boy, \u00a0my girlfriend's 14 year-old daughter, and her 60 something year-old mother.  \n \n \n The Entire Gang -Nerves shattered at this point... \nJust before smiling for this picture, I was ready to murder somebody! \n \nLuckily, for me ...my girlfriend Mary is a social worker for the local school district and works with kids with a variety of special needs and behaviors. \u00a0Jenny has also worked in group homes, and currently works as a Respite Care Worker for children with severe autism. \u00a0They also read my blog and so of course, they know all of our business anyway. \u00a0 But still!  \u00a0He says, it as if this is an everyday occurrence, so casually.  \n \nI have found him looking at inappropriate material and parental controls have been put on devices. \u00a0I do realize however, that it is not something that we can totally control. \u00a0He is 17. \u00a0He is a boy and this is the modern world, full of technology. \u00a0Where there is a will...there is definitely a way. \u00a0But yeah...I was pretty mortified. \n \nToo many triggering factors came into play in this situation... \n \n competition with brother, basic sibling rivalry along with a little button pushing \n fatigue from traveling and\u00a0from staying up late with his cousin, then getting up early in the morning \n anger -cousin making remarks about his weight \n attention seeking from the adults in the situation ...especially from me.  \u00a0I mean how dare I try to have a good time catching up with some of my oldest dearest friends. \n competition with dad being present and being in charge of the music playing, which is mostly R&B\u00a0\u00a0 \n lack of social skills -wants to play his own music ...that no one else wants to hear.  \u00a0Hardcore Metal in a room full of mostly middle-aged black people, who may like a little rock and roll, but metal? Um...no.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI finally ended up giving him his mood stabilizing medication along with some  Neurobiologix Calming-Cream . \u00a0I wish I were getting paid for talking about this...but I tell you it worked. \u00a0He calmed his ass right down and we didn't hear another angry word come out of his mouth. \u00a0Instead, a few minutes later, we received apologies for his behavior. \n \nAs we shared a glass of wine over dinner Jenny asked me if I drink wine everyday. \u00a0My answer? \"No some days I drink wine...other days...tequila.\" \n \n********* \n \nAfter 10 days of way too much togetherness, \u00a0we put dad and Blue on a plane to go back to Texas. \u00a0Hubby decided he wanted to spend part of his time off with his family. \u00a0So they went back home to check on my mom. \u00a0And the following day, they would go on to visit his mom in Baltimore, Maryland. \n \nThe next day, I was invited to dinner at the home of a fellow autism blogger Phat Jaye from \u00a0 Find My Eyes .  (Yes. \u00a0I am one of those crazy people who meets people on the internet and then goes to visit them in person. \u00a0I have lived to tell about it ...3 times so far. \u00a0Of course, in the end, it may be the death of me. \u00a0But at least I will have had fun and met some wonderful people along the way. \u00a0By the way ...my mother hates this about me. \u00a0My husband ain't exactly thrilled about it and the rest of my family, thinks I am completely nuts. \u00a0I'm not saying they're wrong. ) \n \nJaye and his lovely wife Julie, wanted to meet Red. \u00a0I was very hesitant about taking him after our last fiasco of a shindig. \u00a0I swore the night of Mary's dinner party, \u00a0I would  NEVER again  take him around my friends in a social gathering, at least not with the whole family. \u00a0Since then, I gave this some deep thought and realized there were many contributing factors to his horrid behavior.  \n \nSince, they wanted to meet him and it would be the two of us ...thus taking away a number of the triggers -competition for attention, button pushing, etc. I thought just maybe it might be o.k.  \n \nMy nephew actually asked to come with us, I decided against it. \u00a0I wanted Red to be able to focus on the friends we were meeting, especially Jack, Jaye's son. \u00a0Of course, I also had no idea what Jack and his sister would be like. \u00a0 Would another child in the mix add to the anxiety of meeting new people?  \u00a0I didn't want anyone to be overwhelmed. \u00a0This was good decision making on my part.  Yeah...despite my fried brain cells, every once in while -I can make a good decision. \u00a0 \n \n \n Me and my friend Phat Jaye of Find My Eyes \n \n \nWell it was more than o.k.

{"date": "Friday, January 11, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Editorial Note: This post is written by an Aspergers Mom I met through my  Confessions Facebook Community . \u00a0She has been experiencing some really difficult times with her son. \u00a0He is now 18 years old ...an adult, so he is even more difficult to manage. \u00a0She can't be sure if he is taking medication or not. \u00a0He is big, and strong and can not be made to do anything. \u00a0\u00a0Everyone's journey is different. \u00a0Her experience is different from mine but I'm sure not all that different than many other parents. \u00a0 \n \n I keep an open mind and never discount the feelings of other parents raising kids on the spectrum. \u00a0I do not judge their thoughts or feelings ...because I don't march in their shoes. \u00a0If you line up a group of Aspergers kids ...each and every one of them will be different. \u00a0That is why it's called a spectrum. \u00a0I see that in my own life with two children with the same diagnosis, who could not be more different. \u00a0 \n \n Today I share her thoughts with you. \u00a0It's raw and it is the reality of this Aspergers mom and many others...\u00a0 \n \n Aspergers Awareness Moment \n I love and adore my son unconditionally but autism has cruely robbed us of who my child used to be and what he could\u00a0become. \n \n I remember him as a giving, loving, intelligent, affectionate and happy child. and then I started noticing things\u00a0that were not normal, things that were against his nature....so I took him to countless of doctors. \u00a0They all told me\u00a0different \u00a0things, none of which I accepted...until I read about Aspergers.\u00a0 \n \n Aspergers is cruel and mind boggling, it is\u00a0never ending and there is no cure.\u00a0 \n \n Everyday that we have to walk on eggshells to prevent meltdowns in which he can break\u00a0windows, mirrors and china cabinets with his bare hands and even worse, harm himself because he gets so angry at himself\u00a0for losing control. \n \n You see he has no choice in the matter...once he loses it...Aspergers takes over and he becomes an\u00a0obsessive, selfish, impulsively violent man-child and honestly...it is scary to watch. \n Everyday I dread the phone ringing in case there is bad\u00a0news about my son \n Everyday I worry is today the day he goes over the edge? \n \n I try to see his soul. \u00a0I \u00a0think back to when he was a baby when he was all those loveable things. \u00a0I hold on to those memories for dear life. \n I need to...in order to cope...to give him encouragement...to praise him everyday and to love him. \n \n Everyday I hold on to those memories in order to stay\u00a0strong for him. \u00a0I wonder if those things are deep within him buried deep down inside and no one can reach them...not even\u00a0him.\u00a0 \n \n I t's difficult to watch him beat himself up over the times he loses it. He knows what he does is wrong and hateful and he feels so bad afterwards. \n He struggles to reach in deep to find himself as he used to be...to remember how he used to be. But he cant find himself. \u00a0He is lost\u00a0to Aspergers. \n \n So you see autism can be cruel. \n \n I try to look at his soul and the way I do that is to remember him as a baby\u00a0everyday to get through another rollercoaster day of uncertainty and fear.\u00a0 \n \n So now you know why I hate aspergers with all my\u00a0might.\u00a0 \n \n I want my baby back. I want to be affectionate with him, to praise him to show him love...yet he doesnt feel these\u00a0things, they are lost to aspergers.\u00a0 \n \n I want him to hug me back, to give me a sunshine smile like he used to. \n \n I want\u00a0to hear him say I love you mom without being prompted.\u00a0 \n \n I want him to feel emotion, to be happy with himself, to achieve new\u00a0goals.\u00a0 \n \n I want him to live without fear and embarrasment because he knows he's different. \u00a0He longs and tries to be like\u00a0everyone else and it hurts to watch him not succeed. \u00a0 \n \n It hurts to watch other kids make fun of his efforts to fit in.\u00a0 \n \n \n It's\u00a0hard to watch adults stare at him without compassion, wondering what the hell is wrong with him.\u00a0 \n \n I wonder what will\u00a0become of his future. \n I can guide him and teach him but I never know when Aspergers will come to rob us again of another step forward.\u00a0 \n \n This is why I HATE autism and Aspergers. It has taken my son away from me and those who love him.\u00a0 \n \n I\u00a0love him without question...unconditionally, but I have to remember who he really is...that sweet innocent baby that\u00a0I held in my arms not so long ago.\u00a0 \n \n So no...I do not feel blessed to have been cruelly robbed of my son.\u00a0 \n \n I have learned so\u00a0many things...but I have also experienced such deep heartache that its difficult to breathe sometimes. \n \n I feel hatred\u00a0\u00a0towards Autism and Aspergers. \n \n ~ Another Aspergers Mom \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uPhF1ncD6nc/UPBbYzujgiI/AAAAAAAAA9U/rv0_aaXT5uM/s1600/images-3.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/01/another-aspergers-mom.html", "title": "\nAnother Aspergers Mom \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 17, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nI could use this post to tell you the depressing story of how me and Red went through 3 therapy sessions in one day, one with the School Psychologist, another with the Psychiatrist and one with the Behavior Therapist. \u00a0How Red did a great job of processing through and accepting responsibility for his behavior with all of these professionals ...only to totally dump on me all the way home in the car back at square one. \u00a0Square one ...where he goes back off the deep end like he doesn't get it at all and he starts blaming everyone and their mother for why he got into trouble at school.  \n \nI could tell you how I completely lost it in the car as I listened to his bullshit, thinking about all of the time, money and effort I am putting in to helping him only to have him dump on me as if I've done nothing. (I know this isn't really about me ...but still. \u00a0I can only take so much.) I could tell you how I laid into him in the car --pulled up to the house and told him to get out so that I could leave because I couldn't take another minute of his negativity. \u00a0How he walked into the house and slammed the door so hard that one of my pictures fell off the wall and broke.  \n \nI could tell you how his father barreled down the stairs and took over where I left off laying into him about his behavior to the point where my mom thought he might have a heart attack. \u00a0Then Red goes up stairs and puts one of those F*#% this and that statuses on Facebook. \u00a0How it was so bad that relatives started calling us to find out what the hell was going on. \n \nI could tell you how my brother called from California and talked Red down ...back to reality. \u00a0He tells him how much his entire family loves and supports him and how he should be grateful for all of his blessings. \u00a0How Red then takes the F*#% the world status down from Facebook and apologizes to all of us. \u00a0And how so many people came out to support him on Facebook and via phone calls to let him know that they have his back. \n \nBut all of that would be so boring. \u00a0It would be so --the norm for us...and you've heard it all before. \u00a0So instead, I will tell you how life is looking up again and how funny this conversation was on the way to school today with Blue and his middle school friends, who are also on the spectrum. \n \nOne of the twins has been down in the dumps lately about a girl who is not responding to him the way that he would like for her to. \u00a0All teens have these girl issues. \u00a0I've been through this before with my typical son. The difference here is \u00a0the fixation aspect, and the lack of communication skills to actually get try to convey how they are actually feeling about the girl. \u00a0Their is this tendency to want to skip from A to Z without all of the steps in between. \u00a0If the girl smiles at them, and is cordial they think this is a cue that she wants to be his girlfriend. \u00a0He is sad, because he really would like this girl to be his best friend and/or girlfriend like yesterday and that does not seem to be happening. \u00a0He is also really sad about the fact that she is also friendly with so many other boys and takes it very personally. \n \nWhen we are carpooling, I try to keep the chatter light and cheerful, hopefully taking his mind off of his worries during our travels. \u00a0This doesn't always work. \n \nBlue -Are you guys going to spirit night at the high school tonight? \nTwin 1 -Yeah...I kind of forgot about it. \u00a0But I guess so. \nTwin 2 -What electives are you going to take? \nTwin 1 -I don't know...maybe football. \nMe -Football? What about band? (The twins are both in band now.) \nTwin 1 -I don't know. \u00a0Maybe I should play football so...you know...I can get some bigger muscles. \nBlue -You don't need to do that. \u00a0Why are you doing that? \u00a0To get girls? \u00a0You don't want the kind of girls that want you only for your muscles. \u00a0That's not the way to get girls. \nMe -Well...it is one way. \nBlue -Mom!!! I'm talking to my friend. \nMe -I'm just saying. \nBlue -If you play football you have to act stupid and all cool and not be yourself and that will not get you the right girl. \u00a0Trust me...I know what I'm talking about. \nMe -Not all football players are stupid. \u00a0I had many friends who were football players in high school and they weren't stupid. \nBlue -Mom ...we're not talking about 50 years ago when you went to high school! \n Wow! I'm not at all insulted by that. \nTwin 1 -Remember what we talked about last night? Keeping the peace with your mom. \nBlue -Yeah...but she makes it hard. \n Last night Blue ran away to the twins house because he says there's too much fighting in our house. \u00a0Now of course -the fact that he can't mind his own business and always has to have the last word has nothing to do with that right? \u00a0I mean ...it's all  our  fault....everyone except for him.\u00a0 \n *I hope you all get my extreme sarcasm here.\u00a0 \nTwin 1 -I think it will be good if I get more muscles. \nBlue -You're not going to get the right kind of girl doing that. \nMe -What about band? \u00a0You're really good at playing your instrument. \u00a0There may be lots of cute girls in the band. \nTwin 1 -I doubt it. \u00a0Not the right ones. \nBlue -Mom! I'm trying to talk to my friend here. Believe me I know what I'm talking about. \u00a0 Because afterall...he has all of the girls right? \u00a0I mean he has so much experience. \u00a0Me? I was just born yesterday ...I mean 65 years ago because I went to high school 50 years ago...according to my son.\u00a0 \nMe -Oh. \u00a0Sorry. \u00a0I forgot ...I don't know anything. \u00a0I'll stay out of it. \n \nLuckily for them, it is now time to get out of the car. \u00a0We're at school --where Blue ...Mr. Know Everything can now hold class without me interrupting.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B0DLcbWE1nA/UPgcZSd0oBI/AAAAAAAAA-E/0PTheuzl4FE/s1600/images-5.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/01/carpool-conversations.html", "title": "\nCarpool Conversations\n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 28, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThis weekend was 10 times better than last. \u00a0Red spent the night with a friend. \u00a0Blue hung out with a friend. \u00a0Daddy (or as I call him these days Rico Suave) and I went on a date. \u00a0 I call him Rico Suave because he has recently lost over 30 pounds and he thinks he's hot! And he is.  \u00a0To top it all off...I took a day for myself and spent Sunday afternoon at a reasonably priced day spa, with my phone turned off.  \n \nWhen I turn it back on... of course, there is a message from Red: \n\"I had a really good time with hanging out with my friend last night and I really am looking forward to the field trip tomorrow. \u00a0So yeah...this was a pretty good weekend. \u00a0I hope you're having a good time wherever you are.\"  Nice! \n \nWhen I sneak in the house...all is quiet. \u00a0Unbelievably, the two boys are behind closed doors in Red's room, hanging out together. \u00a0There is no fighting. \u00a0 I said unbelievable right!?  This lasts until right before bed time. \u00a0I stay hidden in my room because  who am I to disturb the peace? \u00a0  \n \nBlue comes in and tells me how \"mean and old-school dad was today.\" \nRed comes in and gives me every detail of his time with his friend. \n \nOne of the things he tells me ...I really did not want to hear --some foolish young boy's mischief they got into. \u00a0Honesty is not always the best policy. \u00a0Some details, a mother should be spared.  I spared my mother a ton of details in my teen years. \u00a0 I tell him that the behavior was on the immature side and that I hope he will make better choices in the future. \u00a0 Well...what did I do that for?  This completely changes his mood. \u00a0He goes over to the dark side. \u00a0He's feeling bad about his choice, but also a little defiant at the same time. \n \nWhen I go to tuck him into bed (yes he is 17 and I still tuck him in...we call it  My Time. \u00a0And most nights he will not go to bed without it. ) \u00a0He is going off on a dark negative path of thoughts, which he has to verbalize. \u00a0I want to run screaming out of the room. \u00a0He begs me not to leave. \u00a0He wants to talk...he wants me to engage all of this negativity. \nI tell him, \"I will stay if you want to pray. Other than that...I'm leaving.\" \n Prayer is a language that Red understands and respects ...much more than anything that I can ever say to him directly.\u00a0 \n \nHe chooses to pray... \n \n Dear Lord, \u00a0 \n \n We thank you so much for the blessings of this weekend.\u00a0 \n I am especially grateful for the time I got to spend by myself to help me relieve so much stress that has been building over these past few weeks. \u00a0 \n We are also thankful for the time that Red got to spend with his friend, and for all of the true friends that you have blessed him with over this past couple of years. \u00a0 \n There was a time not that long ago, when he didn't have as many real friends in his life that truly care for him and accept him for exactly who he is.\u00a0 \n \u00a0(I then list every friend)\u00a0 \n Thank you for all of the adults in his life who love and support him\u00a0 \n For the teachers (I name them all)\u00a0 \n and especially Mr. M -who came to our house this weekend, just to bring Red the field trip forms\u00a0 \n He told Red that he can call him anytime he needs to talk. \u00a0 \n What a blessing he is.\u00a0 \n We thank you for the field trip that he will go on tomorrow, where he will be in a role of leadership ...helping others with disabilities. \u00a0 \n There are many kids who don't have the support or positive direction that Red does. \u00a0 \n They are out there floating aimlessly, being teased and harassed. \u00a0 \n Some of them end up wanting to hurt themselves because they feel so helpless. \u00a0\u00a0 \n Help Red to see how blessed he is by his support system, and not to see it as some sort of restriction.\u00a0 \n This support helps keep his mind engaged with positivity.\u00a0 \n He is busy helping others who look up to him, and who really care about him instead of spending time focusing on those who don't care about him at all. \u00a0 \n Please keep him focused on the positives in his life...for you have given him so many.\" \n \nWith this prayer he turns to me, smiles and asks for a hug.  \nThe negative vibe is gone...at least for the moment.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KmvlMlcWMfo/UQajnertvII/AAAAAAAAA_Q/F_exBMHJ6e0/s1600/prayer.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/01/last-nights-prayer.html", "title": "\nLast Night's Prayer\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 24, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nIn these days of bullying, school shootings and negative images of Aspergers in the media ...schools are looking at security and their liability, before they look at what is best for the child with the disability. \u00a0In fact, even before this era...often times they do what is best for them or what is easiest, instead of what is best for the child on the autism spectrum. \u00a0School administration is worried about budgets and staffing issues, test scores, school funding and not always at what is really the best thing for the child who is different, who causes them more work. If you are not paying attention, you can best believe that your disabled child will fall through the cracks.  \n \nUnfortunately, Red does not have the full capacity to advocate for himself. \u00a0He is 17...but doesn't have the mentality of a 17 year old. \u00a0He doesn't know what's best for him. \u00a0He spends so much of his time fixating on non-essential matters that he doesn't have a whole lot of mental energy left over for anything else. \u00a0He can and will speak up ...however I have to be his advocate. \u00a0I have to be the voice of reason that he doesn't have the ability to be right now. \n \nRed is a 17 year-old, black male with Aspergers. \u00a0He stands about 5ft. 10 or 11 and weighs at least 200 pounds. \u00a0He attends a school where he is definitely a minority. \u00a0He has a behavior pattern \u00a0--when some one treats him nicely, \u00a0he sees them as a good friend...he gets fixated on them or their group of friends because he wants to be a part of the in-crowd. \u00a0He wants to be loved and accepted. \u00a0His intensity makes them feel uncomfortable and then they reject him. Then the fixation grows deeper.  \n \nHe may start to behave in ways that make peers feel even more uncomfortable. \u00a0He may be looking at them from across the room ...glaring. \u00a0He may approach a crowd and then not say much...which to them looks weird. \u00a0There may even be days when he slams his hands on a table, against a locker or a slam a door because he is feeling angry and rejected. \u00a0Then he posts these feelings of anger and rejection on Facebook. \u00a0F-life! \u00a0Everyone hates me! \u00a0I'm so F -ing angry. \u00a0Nobody understands me etc. \n \nHas he ever been directly aggressive? No. \u00a0Has he ever put his hands on another peer inappropriately? No. Are these behaviors a direct result of his disability? Yes. \u00a0Absolutely. \u00a0Does this behavior need to be addressed and modified? Most Definitely. \n \nWe have tried many things to curb this behavior --social stories, social skills classes and groups, individual therapy, prayer, talking with his pastor, talking with his real friends, and male family members. \u00a0Is he connecting the dots? \u00a0So far ...the answer would be a resounding  no . \n \nThe school is becoming exasperated with the behavior an the fixation because it involves other students. \u00a0One of which is a young princess who cries every he looks in her direction or she sees him in the lunch room or the hallway. \u00a0He has said and done some things to make her uncomfortable in the past. \u00a0When he was told to stay away from her completely ...he did. \u00a0A few months later she comes up to him and says, \"You don't have to totally not speak to me. \u00a0I mean we can still be nice to each other.\" They become friends again ...then he does something to weird her out. \u00a0And it's on again...she is back in the AP's office crying about the big, bad, black, angry looking wolf! \n \nWhat should the school be doing? \u00a0Trying to create a more inclusive environment...educating students about tolerance and inclusion. \u00a0When they see a student who is depressed, lonely and different create ways to make them feel better about themselves instead of vilifying them ...creating some one who is increasingly angry and misunderstood. \n \nI am sick of them calling me about this. \u00a0I am sick of him giving him \u00a0consequences \u00a0because of this particular peer freaking out. \u00a0Does his focus need to change? \u00a0Absolutely! \u00a0Is the way to do that by isolating him and continually giving him consequences that he sees as negative? No! \u00a0Is any of that changing the fixation? Absolutely not. \n \nWhen we meet yesterday ...it is their idea to put him in a more isolated area so that he doesn't cross paths with this group of peers at all? \u00a0Nah! \u00a0Sorry y'all! \u00a0That's not going to work for me. \u00a0He has a right to be in the hallways and lunch room as much as anyone else. \u00a0I'm sorry if his mere presence from across a room makes you uncomfortable. \n \nWhat we are going to do is create a situation to get him involved in a positive activity so that he can break this pattern of fixation. \u00a0For the next two weeks...he is going to be placed into a role of leadership socializing in the mornings before school with the kids with more severe disabilities who he already helps during a class period. \u00a0They know him ...they love him...they look up to him. \u00a0He can other wise to hang out in his first period class where there are also some good friends that he interacts with well.  \n \nI sell this to Red as this is a way to start off your day feeling good about yourself, instead of walking around aimlessly, focusing on peers who don't really give a crap about you. \u00a0This will change your focus and make you feel good about yourself. \u00a0I asked him to trust me. \u00a0\"I am on your side. \u00a0This is just like the social skills group you didn't want to go to because you were scared. \u00a0It was different. \u00a0You didn't think you would like it. But you thrived and made some real connections with people that you maintain to this day.\" \n \nHe will continue to go to lunch and have time to socialize with peers during that time. \u00a0I asked him to focus on the peers that he knows well and who reach out to him. \u00a0\"You are not to go up to that group of peers who never approaches you...at all!\" \u00a0He agreed and seemed to understand. \u00a0  \n \nI also told the staff if he tries to engage about this particular student, your response should be to redirect him. The script will be \"We are not going to talk about that. \u00a0Who can you hang out with \u00a0or what can you do to make yourself feel better?\" \u00a0There will be no back and forth dialog about this particular peer and what he thinks she is doing to make his life miserable. \u00a0The dialog will be about what can  YOU  do to make your life better. \n \nI put together a plan and a solution without even really giving them a whole lot of input. \u00a0I wrote it all down in black and white. \u00a0And this is how we are going to roll for the next two weeks. \u00a0We will see how it goes. \n \nAnd guess what? \u00a0I'm not done yet. \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L688uAPNfJY/UQFlSA0mKUI/AAAAAAAAA-4/I8Dk8ZnyWT0/s1600/images-5.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/01/wrangled-those-fers.html", "title": "\nWrangled Those F*#%ers! \n"},

You see...I had been floating through the day thinking all was relatively well and now...this. \n \nThe boys have been going at each other a little more than usual lately...if that is at all possible. \u00a0Red has been more impulsive. \u00a0Blue -a little more anxious because it's the first week back to school. \u00a0Neither one of them seem to have the capacity to mind their own business. \u00a0And they both seem to feel safe taking out their feelings about the rest of the world on each other. \u00a0Silly me, I scheduled therapy for both of them back to back. \u00a0Blue is scheduled to be picked up 10 minutes later for his appointment. \u00a0In fact, I have already called the office at the middle-school to have him come down and meet me.  \n \nI have to go to the Assistant Principles office to retrieve Red. \u00a0I can hear his voice from outside the door. \u00a0He is agitated. \u00a0I go inside and listen to much of what is non-sense spewing from him. \u00a0The A.P. gives me the run down of what took place according to statements. \u00a0Blah blah blah, blah blah is what I hear. \u00a0I've heard it all before. \u00a0It's the same kind of crap that I have been dealing with since middle school. \u00a0Perhaps even 5th grade. \u00a0When will he ever get it!? \u00a0This is what I am spending hundreds of dollars in therapy for and he still doesn't get it!  \n \nSure things are better. \u00a0He is a little more in control than he used to be of his anger. \u00a0At least now he's not yelling and cursing at people ( well not often ) ...but his behavior and social skills are still behind the curb. \u00a0He is so angry that on the way out of the building he slams the door open. \u00a0I am coming out of the other door. \u00a0If it weren't for my quick reflexes the damned door could have knocked my glasses into my face or broken my freaking teeth! \n \nAt this point I call the middle school and tell Blue to go back to class. \u00a0\"I'm sorry but your brother is having a near meltdown over here and I don't want the two of you in the car together.\" \n\"O.K. I understand.\" \nI have to cancel his therapy appointment. \n \nI won't get into the details of what exactly happened with Red. Let's suffice it to say it has to do with \n-being impulsive \n-misinterpreting social cues \n-wanting to feel included in a group and feeling left out \n-wanting to feel loved an accepted but going about it in the wrong way  \n-not connecting the dots as to how some of his behaviors can make other people feel \nAnd at this point I am weary that he may NEVER be able to connect those dots. \n \nHigh school can be torturous for a lot of kids. \u00a0You don't know who you are. \u00a0You're just trying to fit in. \u00a0For him ...torture is putting it mildly. \u00a0High school for my Aspie is like an alien world where he has no idea how to relate to it's citizens, who by the way, speak another language. \u00a0He tries to speak the language but somehow they still don't understand him. \u00a0They know he's from another planet and most of them do not accept this foreigner into their culture. \n \nHe has taken so many steps forward in the past year. \u00a0His conversation skills have improved probably by 90%. \u00a0He is taking Theatre Arts and I think he has learned to play the role of having socially acceptable and socially \"expected\" conversations.  \n \nHe has become very close friends with another young man who is on the spectrum, who seems to do very well socially. \u00a0Through this friend, Red has started going to a new church where there are many peers from his high-school and surrounding area high-schools. \u00a0He has gotten pretty good at \"playing the role\" of a \"hard core\" Christian. \u00a0I am sure that his faith has been strengthened and he really believes in trying to follow the example of Christ. \u00a0At the same time, I think that he sees this role as a way to make friends and influence people.  \n \nYou see before, he didn't know what to do or say...what to talk about. \u00a0Now he follows the Christian script. \u00a0That's what he does...he follows scripts --using words from movies, t.v. shows or from other people that he is impressed by. \u00a0It used to be his older brother. \u00a0In fact...he still hangs on to some of his lines. \u00a0He thinks his brother is so cool and after all ...he knows how to get girls. \u00a0They may be the wrong girls...but they are girls nevertheless. \u00a0Sometimes he uses the lines of his father, especially when he is trying to correct his younger brother. \u00a0Lately, he sounds very much like his new Christian friends. \n \nYep he's playing a role because his own personality has not gotten him very far socially. \u00a0How hard must it be to not be able to be yourself all day long? \u00a0How much energy that must require. \u00a0Not only that...he is looking for a rather instant payoff. \u00a0By smiling and being socially appropriate ...he is looking for girls to come up to him and like him, hug him...maybe even want to be his girlfriend. \u00a0I mean why not? \u00a0He is good looking, dresses nicely ...he is playing the part of a totally cool kid. \n \nHe wants people to totally forget about the negative, angry, intense person that he used to be, not all that long ago. \u00a0That person whose ugly head still comes from underneath the surface occasionally. \u00a0Forget about the barrage of negative, angry messages he put out as his Facebook statuses, when he is angry ...talking about how his life sucks and F*#% this and F*#% that!  \n \nNow I'm a nice guy! Can't you all see that?!!! Like me damn it! I want to be popular. \u00a0Oh yes...he's actually reading articles on the internet about how to become popular ...as if there is really some magical formula that gives you charm and charisma, that makes you funny and endearing. \u00a0I mean maybe there is even a magic pill for it! \n \nThere has been a lot of positive feedback from his new attitude. \u00a0There are a lot of people who smile at him and say hello, they exchange cordialities. \u00a0 The kids that he helps with more severe disabilities absolutely LOVE him. \u00a0He does have more friends than he has ever had in his life. \u00a0And I'm talking about good friends ...the ones who know the real him and reach out to him and hang out with him on a regular basis.  \n \nUnfortunately ....he seems to have his eyes set on this particular core group of kids who look like they have it all. \u00a0They look like they are having the most fun. \u00a0They are certainly the prettiest girls and he actually knows some of these girls from his past and they are nice to him. \u00a0But they are not skipping from A to Z to go out with him or be his best friend. \u00a0He seems to have no idea what's supposed to actually happen between A and Z in order to build a relationship with someone of that nature. \u00a0Despite the social skills classes and therapy.  \n \nWhen he is putting on this super nice guy performance and he doesn't get that instant gratification ...that pay off that he's looking for...that desire turns in to anger and self-loathing --exacerbated feelings if .. \u00a0they don't think I'm good enough...I must not be good enough. \u00a0I will never be good enough!\u00a0 \n \nThen we have the impulse control issue....going up and saying something inappropriate or doing things that may others feel uncomfortable...that component of unexpected behavior. \u00a0Then the next day or the next week ...he is surprised somehow that everyone is not going to turn around and be his best friend as a result of his own behavior.  \n \nWe also have the lack of perspective and self-responsibility. \u00a0When they don't show him that expected pay off of best friendship or he gets into trouble because of some unexpected behavior...it's all their fault. \u00a0 If \u00a0they just tried better to understand him, or if they just knew, what he goes through and how sorry he is. \u00a0All he wants is to fit in. \u00a0That's all he is trying to do. \u00a0Why is he then in trouble for just trying to make that happen? \n \nIt's ironic is that one of his favorite scripts that he says to his brother at least 3 times a day is, \"You need to learn how to take responsibility for your actions!\" Yet ...he seems unable to do that himself. \n \nNow ...he is a perfectly nice kid...in fact, \u00a0just the day before this punch in the gut \u00a0--a teacher is crossing a parking lot to say to me... \n\"I just wanted to tell you that I have been at this school for 15 years ...and I have never seen such a breath of fresh air as your son. \u00a0He is so kind and he has made just so much improvement in the past year. \u00a0He's just incredible! \u00a0I would have to sit down with you and just make a list of all of the wonderful things I see him doing.\" \n \nThis was less than 24 hours before I picked him up to find out he was in the Assistant Principles office. \u00a0Yes ...it felt like a punch in the gut. \u00a0It took the wind right out of me and left me feeling completely deflated wondering will he ever get it? \u00a0Will he ever connect the dots? \u00a0Will he ever be able to make it in the real world because despite his gifts and abilities his social inequities can end up just blowing him out of the water. \n \nI try my best to remain positive ...but when you get punched, \u00a0it takes you a few minutes to just feel the pain, maybe even cry so that eventually, you can catch your breath.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qCD0jQ8b8bw/UPV0OrSi2PI/AAAAAAAAA9s/le_43HTohzI/s1600/images-4.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/01/2-steps-forward-punch-in-gut.html", "title": "\n2 Steps Forward -Punch in the Gut \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 30, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n\"I thought everything was going great until I got dragged back into this Freak Show!\" \u00a0~The Avengers \n \nThis is the line Red said to me this morning when I woke him up for school. \u00a0He is still angry, sad and disappointed that his friend ...someone who he considers to be one of his best friends, un-friended him on Facebook last night.  \n \nThe thing is ...the kid has Aspergers. \u00a0Red looks up to him and thinks he has this perfect life. \u00a0Red sees him as being popular. \u00a0Why? Because a lot of people speak to him every day. \u00a0The reality is that he has grown up as the son of a Pastor in this community. \u00a0Therefore, a lot of people know him. \u00a0What does that mean really? A lot of people reach out to him...some of it real...some of it superficial. A lot of people have high expectations for his behavior and he is often being watched, or has responsibilities simply because of who his parents are. Could that overwhelm him at times? \u00a0He's also taking all regular education classes, and maybe even some advanced classes. \u00a0What does that mean really? Perhaps, he is stressed out by the level of expectation or self-imposed need for perfection. \u00a0He has a girlfriend, which in Red's eyes is the key to happiness. \u00a0What does it mean really? \u00a0That's another relationship...another set of expectations...another layer of drama, perhaps. We don't know because we're not inside of his head.  \n \nWe do know that he has Aspergers. \u00a0That he sees the world differently. \u00a0Things may seem bigger than they really are to him. \u00a0His view of things could be skewed. \u00a0He could have a great deal of anxiety. \u00a0Who knows? \u00a0Everyone is different! \u00a0Right down to the two brothers who live here in our house. \u00a0They are very, very different. \u00a0In fact, Blue's personality may be somewhat like Red's friend.  \n \nBlue is ridden with anxiety and misinterpretation of social cues. \u00a0A teacher busts him surfing on the internet when he is supposed to be reading a novel. \u00a0In his mind, she now thinks that he is the most horrible person ever! She\u00a0 hates him and wants to have him killed . \u00a0A bit extreme you think? \u00a0Yeah...but that's what he said to me just yesterday. \n \nThe truth is Red can be high drama. \u00a0Because of his social inequities, he gets into lots of situations with peers. He has lots of high and low emotions. \u00a0His friend probably feels a need to rescue him ...a lot. \u00a0That may be too stressful for him. \u00a0I don't know. \u00a0I can only guess. \u00a0I know that he is basically a good kid and I don't think he would do anything to hurt Red purposefully. \u00a0He is probably just drowning and trying to save himself. \u00a0Nevertheless, for Red ...this sucks. \u00a0Which means for me ...it also sucks. \u00a0As his mother of course, I feel his pain even though I put up the good front and try to paint the sunny side picture for him. \n \nI had just talked Red down off of the bridge of self-hatred and anger about other situations at school. \u00a0I think I almost convinced him that my plan to have him engaged in positive scenarios and situations is to help him, not to treat him like a baby.  \n \nI tell him how he has been swimming in a big pool everyday, \u00a0when he walks through that high school trying to get people to notice him, hoping to find acceptance into a group of people who could care less about him. \u00a0How he is using every muscle in his body to swim in that pool and yet, he is not getting the results that he wants from his actions. \u00a0He is frustrated, and becoming angry because what he is doing IS NOT \u00a0WORKING! \u00a0It's like banging your head up against the wall. \u00a0I am trying to get him to change his focus so that he will not feel so frustrated.  \n \nI try to convince him that what he is looking for ...is not in that big pool. \u00a0Skulking around through hallways is not going to find you that good friend or special relationship. \u00a0That is going to be found in a smaller group, perhaps in a class or maybe the workplace. \u00a0Maybe he will find it at church. \u00a0He certainly isn't going to find it walking around through hallways, putting on a facade ...a fake personality, just so that he will be socially accepted.  \n \n\"If you do find a girl and you're not being yourself...after a while...the truth of who you are will come to light. \u00a0And then what do you have? Nothing ...except the drama of breaking up with that girl.\u00a0Be yourself and when you relax into yourself and love exactly who you are...the right relationships will come.\" \n \nHe softens his stance a bit as if he gets it --for the moment. \u00a0Until late that night, when he is supposed to be in bed. \u00a0I hear footsteps above me. \u00a0Why is he still awake? Well, \u00a0he's on Facebook and he finds out that he has been unfriended. \u00a0 I'm really hating that he's even on Facebook at this point. \n \nThis morning as I drop him off ...I ask him, \"How do you think you should handle this situation today?\" \n\"Maybe I should wait until church tonight and talk about it there.\"  \n\"That's a brilliant idea son. \u00a0That's exactly what you should do.\" \n \nI encourage him to realize that whatever his friend is going through, please remember ...it's not all about him. \u00a0\"Try to be supportive. \u00a0You can let him know that your feelings are hurt without cursing him out. That would only damage your relationship more.\" \n \nI can only pray that he will keep all of this in mind throughout his school day.  \n \nThe social world of high school feels like a gigantic cesspool that he is swimming in. \u00a0It is like this for so many kids ...or as he calls it \u00a0--a real  Freak Show .  \n \nI can't wait to get him out of there... \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ABe6MzcOGcY/UQlRJwnf_lI/AAAAAAAAA_o/CMGBIRIbwkQ/s1600/images-7.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/01/high-school-freak-show.html", "title": "\nHigh School Freak Show\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 12, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThere's nothing better than being awakened from a pleasant slumber by a full on meltdown at midnight. \n \nBlue bursts through the door, \"Mom! Can you please tell Red to stop singing?!\" \n \nReally? Is this really happening? \n \n \n \nI am sleeping. \u00a0I beg him to please to talk to his father, who is awake! \n \n \n \nA few minutes later, he's back, \"Dad won't help.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nReally? Really? \u00a0I am pissed! \u00a0I have been awakened 3 times now in the past hour!\u00a0 \n \nWhen they first got home from the basketball game --the one that Red did not want to go to, by the way, he came into my room wanting to tell me all about the good time he had. \u00a0 \n \n Hello! I am sleeping! \u00a0Tell me tomorrow. \nDoes he leave? No! My television is still on which encourages him to sit down. \nI turn it off and ask him \u00a0again to please leave my room \u00a0...three times before it finally clicks. \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nA few minutes later Blue is in my room to say ...I don't know --hello or something. \u00a0I don't really know or care. \u00a0I am trying to sleep. \u00a0He gets the hint much quicker and leaves the room. \u00a0 \n \n \nNow this \u00a0-- Can you tell Red to stop singing? \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI lost it! I get up I'm yelling at everyone. \u00a0I yell at Red to stop singing. \u00a0I yell at hubs because he didn't get his ass up off the couch to handle the situation. I yell at Blue to go to bed and get over it. I am cursing them all under my breath. \u00a0I go back to my room and slam my door! \n \nNext thing I know Blue's door is back open...he's yelling, \"There is a mosquito in my room!\" \n Jesus help me!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nDad finally gets up off the couch to handle things ...which means yelling at Blue, \"Get in the bed now!\" Not listening to what he is trying to say about the mosquito. Before I know anything Blue is in full melt-down. \u00a0Yelling, screaming and yes...even cursing. \n \nSo much for going back to sleep. \u00a0I catapult back across the family room, passed dad damn near knocking him over --and he's a big guy.\u00a0 Thanks so much for handling it by making it worse. \n \nBlue is trying to call the 911 to get him out of this house. \u00a0I grab him, hugging him, telling him to take some deep breaths and just calm down. \u00a0I don't allow any talking just breathing --cooling off.  \n \nWhen he is finally calm enough to get undressed, I hugged him and told him not to think, just breathe and try to get to sleep. \u00a0 \n \n \nEveryone goes back to their quarters...dad feeling crushed and defeated returns to the couch downstairs, Red to his room and me to mine. \u00a0The deep slumber is over. \u00a0I am wide awake. \u00a0Adrenaline is pumping through me. \u00a0I lay awake thinking about what just happened.\u00a0 \n \n \nIn the heat of the moment ...I wasn't thinking about was the fact that Blue had been gone for more than 24 hours. \u00a0He spent the night with his friends. \u00a0Got up early, hung out with them and played all day. \u00a0Then Dad picked him and his friends up to go to this basketball game.  \n \nThe initial trigger to this meltdown was his brother singing as he was trying to relax and get ready for bed. \u00a0The underlying trigger was pure exhaustion. \u00a0It you dig down underneath the exhaustion, there was also little bit of a let down coming back home after all of that fun. \u00a0It's like when he was younger and we went on vacation to spend time with family, coming back home to reality made him sad. \u00a0Heck ...it made me sad too. \u00a0In these adolescent years, sadness has turned into anger and rage. \n \nAt home there are the annoying parents always telling him what to do and what not to do. \u00a0There's the annoying brother who loves to sing and script dialog from movies and television shows. \u00a0Then there is this intense need to have complete control over his environment and the inflexibility to adjust in order to acclimate to an environment that is less than perfect.  \n \nI lost it and yelled at everyone. \u00a0I lay in bed feeling bad about that. \u00a0I had yelled at my husband in front of everyone and then he ended up taking the brunt of Blue's meltdown. \u00a0I know how sensitive he is. \u00a0He usually takes the things they say and do during meltdowns personally. \u00a0I know he is thinking,  I just took these assholes to a basketball game and now they are at home fighting, and end up yelling, screaming and cursing. \u00a0They are so ungrateful!  \u00a0He isn't thinking about Blue is just being overwhelmed and exhausted. \n \nI've been told in the middle of a meltdown,  \"I HATE you!\"  \u00a0I know that they love me...they are just angry, seeing red and not thinking clearly. \u00a0The boys have never get physically aggressive with me during a meltdown. \u00a0Of course, I don't back them into a corner in the middle of it. \u00a0Sometimes I walk away. \u00a0Other times, I may just give them a hug or try talking to them gently. \u00a0Talking never works. \u00a0 When they are getting to out of hand, and refuse to leave an area, their dad will come to my rescue, so to speak. \u00a0He doesn't like what he feels is disrespect coming from these boys towards me. \u00a0He is my knight. There is something about them all being these alpha males who can't back down when emotions are high that can make things get out of hand and get really ugly. \n \nI spent hours awake feeling bad for the part I played in this episode. \u00a0I felt bad for all parties but was able to piece together where the breakdowns happened in hopes to avoid them all the next time. Hubby and I talked in the wee hours of the night when he finally came to bed about exactly what happened and what we can try to do the next time. \u00a0I try to reassure him that he is an awesome dad, and he has to know that a good part of what is going on is simply autism and adolescence. \u00a0It's not personal.  \n \nNo wonder my beauty is fading. \u00a0I can't get enough sleep. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \n I love it when you comment and even more when you share my post. \u00a0Thanks... \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mvDgbGW88nw/URpiXT3sUlI/AAAAAAAABAA/zK58M5xOHdo/s1600/images.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/02/no-more-sleeping-beauty.html", "title": "\nNo More Sleeping Beauty \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \nIt's simply amazing how quickly everything can turn to shit. \n \nIt's a beautiful day. \u00a0There were no phone calls from school. \u00a0Red comes in the door in a relatively good mood. \u00a0There is a girl ...he tells me. \u00a0\"I have a crush on her. \u00a0She's really cute. \u00a0She always speaks to me and gives me a hug.\" \n \n Great!  I think to myself. \u00a0I never get excited about the girls because a little crush can quickly turn into a fixation that I will spend hour upon hours listening to conversation about. \u00a0Then I have to deal with the fall out when it all goes wrong. \u00a0I just let him talk, trying not to pass any negative judgement, out loud anyway.  \n \nHe needs a haircut today. \u00a0I interrupt his ongoing one-way dialog to ask him to get ready to go, and while were at it --he should change so we can go to the gym. \u00a0He changes, but then pulls out my laptop to show day this video series called, \"Six Pack Shortcuts\" that he definitely needs to purchase. \u00a0He has the entire sales pitch memorized and we have had to listen to it over and over and over again on and off for the past 6 months.  \n \nWe have had countless conversations telling him that he can save his own money to buy this video set. \u00a0We pay for a gym membership. \u00a0What's more ...he can go run around the neighborhood for free if he wants to loose weight. \u00a0Furthermore, he does not show any consistency to working out, so there is no reason for us to invest any further in this endeavor. \u00a0We have told him this hundreds of times. \u00a0He is still trying to sell us on it. \n \n\"But you guys don't understand! \u00a0This is the shortest way to get tight abs.\" \u00a0Any exercise at all is shorter than sitting in front of your computer waiting for it to happen, which is what he is the most consistent at doing. \n \nMeanwhile, Blue is telling me that he wants to go with us to get said haircut, but what he really wants is to go somewhere to grab dinner and then do homework at Starbucks. \u00a0He's being quite insistent about going out and a bit on the rude side, I might add. \u00a0This leaves a bad taste in my mouth and really makes me feel like making a quick dinner and taking him to the library instead of someplace where I will have to spend money for unhealthy food. \n \nRed is getting lost in his rant about \"Six Pack Short Cuts.\" He can't stop until he gets himself all worked up. \u00a0When he comes downstairs, Blue gets into the mix of telling him basically to get over it. \u00a0He is regurgitating everything that his father just said and that I have said in the past. \u00a0 He is the third parent after all. We really need his help, because his older, bigger brother will definitely listen to him and not his parents! ONLY NOT! \u00a0 \n \nThis is when all hell breaks loose! Both boys are yelling, slamming hands on the table, getting in each other's faces. \u00a0I attempt to cut it all short by telling them both, we aren't going anywhere! Why would I take the two of them out of the house when they are behaving this way.  \n \n I can't tell you all how fun it is to have two testosterone-enriched, teenaged boys with Aspergers, both going off the deep end at the same time! \u00a0This is why I keep a vodka supply in the house!\u00a0 \n \nBlue is livid! \u00a0I send him out to the garage to sit in the big chair we have out there, where he can cool off. \u00a0The garage door is open and the sun is shining. \u00a0He loves to take sunbaths. \u00a0It usually relaxes him. \u00a0Not today! He tries to run away. \u00a0He always wants to leave and go to his friend's house. \u00a0Of course, he calls me on his cell phone to tell me what he's doing. \u00a0I cut it short. \u00a0Told him he could go for a walk to cool off, but not to his friend's house to go have fun after his behavior here. \n \nWithin the hour ...Blue is with me in my room, processing his feelings. \u00a0 I am billing him $125.00 an hour for my therapy services.  \u00a0The bottom line is he is tired...again. \u00a0We started this conversation at 6 p.m. \u00a0By 6:30 he is fast asleep ...for the night. \n \nHe left a ton of homework undone. \u00a0This was a part of his trigger. \u00a0At the end of a long day of focusing and skipping over landmines at school, some days he just doesn't have it in him to do another 2 hours worth of homework. \u00a0He wants modifications and then he doesn't. \u00a0I think his teachers are drilling him with, \"They don't make modifications in college.\" \u00a0Which in fact, is dead wrong! \u00a0You can get modifications in college. \u00a0Not to mention how you can adjust your schedule in college so that you don't feel overwhelmed. \n \nIn middle-school they are packing these kids down with homework because they are under pressure to get so much taught before state testing. \u00a0 Do I give a crap about state testing? \u00a0No I do not!  \u00a0He will fly through the tests. \u00a0So personally, I don't see why he needs to be stressed out with all of this busy work when the main point is that he is learning and doing exceptionally well with his grades. \n \nThere is a fine line between his overprotective mother stepping in on his behalf and allowing this stress to go on and allowing him to advocate for himself. \u00a0The teachers don't see what I see at home. \u00a0Nor are they aware of what a stressful environment this house can be to work in at the end of a long day. \u00a0They don't live with his brother who comes home in the evening and can go off in a rant at a moments notice, which then sends Blue into the depths of hell. \n \nI sent him to school this morning without a lick of homework done. \u00a0He does have extra-time in his I.E.P. (individual education plan). \u00a0He will have to deal with his teachers today ...advocating for himself. \u00a0He will have to let them know what happened last night and I hope that they will work with him. \u00a0He is always afraid to talk to them. \u00a0\"What if they get mad at me?\" \n \nI always tell him the same thing. \u00a0\"They will get over it.\" \u00a0  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \n I love your comments... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ozekY9nVWVc/URu8TMA0CkI/AAAAAAAABAY/sqRR3G9-wkk/s1600/Unknown.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/02/it-happened-like-this.html", "title": "\nIt Happened Like This...\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 26, 2013", "body": "\n \nI had a weekend of freedom and have spent the past two days paying for it.  \n \n \n \nRed participated in a retreat with his church. \u00a0He spent the nights in a host home with other high school boys. \u00a0They traveled to and from the church for worship and socialization and \u00a0then spent Saturday doing a service project. \u00a0They made lunches for the homeless and then went into downtown Austin to meet them and pass out lunches to them.  \n \n \n \nTears filled my eyes on Saturday night when he called me to tell me about what he had done that day. \u00a0He was absolutely beaming about helping these people. \u00a0\"I went up to this guy who was living under the freeway. \u00a0I shook his hand and asked him where he was from. \u00a0He was from Michigan. \u00a0Mom! It was so awesome to help these people!\" \u00a0He felt really good and proud of himself. \u00a0I was so proud and happy for him. \u00a0I thought to myself, maybe this is his calling. \u00a0Maybe the way to fill up his emptiness is by serving others. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nFor me, it was a weekend of peace. \u00a0There was no,  'Put the dog down! Stop fighting with your brother! \u00a0Enough with the singing already.' \nThere was no one knocking on my door early in the morning or late at night wanting to talk. \nI thought about him often, wondering what he was doing at certain moments of the day. \u00a0 Is he talking their heads off and driving everyone crazy? \nI quickly dismissed the thought ...just so glad to have my own slice of quiet time.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe spent most of Sunday afternoon when he got home sleeping. \u00a0I had to wake him up to eat dinner, worrying that he may not be able to get back to sleep for the night. \u00a0He does. He passes out without me having to ask him to go to bed.  \n Yay me! \u00a0More rest! Let's pain in the ass.   \nThat is, until Monday morning when it is time for school. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nOf course, he does not want to get up. \u00a0He makes it to school however, shortly after arriving he got into a major argument with his special education teacher. \u00a0He did not want to follow directions. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI end up picking him up from school early. \u00a0Mama bear instinct told me ...the day wasn't going to get any better. \u00a0I couldn't focus on anything anyway. \u00a0I kept wondering when the phone would ring. \u00a0 What did he do now to dig himself in deeper . \u00a0He had run out of one of his medications (my fault I guess). \u00a0I figured that he was still really tired from the weekend.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt turns out that he slept in a chair at his host's home because he thought it would be more comfortable than the floor. \u00a0Which means, he probably got little to no sound sleep for the 2 and a half days he was there.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe came home after I picked him up and passed out, sleeping deeply from 11:30 until 2:30 p.m. I took him in to see his doctor. \u00a0After his appointment we got a bite to eat. \u00a0He came home and slept from 5:00 until 8:30 p.m. He then went back to bed by 11 p.m. He slept through his alarm at 7 a.m. refusing to \u00a0get up for school. \u00a0I didn't have the energy to fight him. \u00a0My new motto is this... \n \n \n \n It's your life! \u00a0 \n \n If you want to live it in a box ...you don't have to do anything.\u00a0 \n \n People who live in a box don't have to go to school or to work. \n \n They don't have any responsibilities. \n \n They don't have to be on time for anything. \n \n They don't have to try when things are hard. \u00a0 \n \n They don't have to deal with life and getting ahead. \u00a0 \n \n They can just live in the box. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n You don't have to worry about having the latest electronics.\u00a0 \n \n There's no HDTV, \u00a0computers or cell phones in a box. \u00a0 \n \n No worries about finding a girlfriend, unless she wants to live with you in the box. \n \n You don't have to pay rent or a car note. \u00a0 \n \n You don't have to cook for yourself. \u00a0 \n \n You can depend on the kindness of strangers to come down to your box and hopefully, give you lunch.\u00a0 \n \n You know...just like you did for those nice homeless people this weekend in downtown Austin. \n \n \n \nTonight we have a PCP (Person Centered Planning) meeting scheduled, where all of his support system shows up here at our house to help him set goals and plans for his life. \u00a0All of these people show up on their own time, they are not getting paid. \u00a0His friend and ex Pastor comes. Last month his Video Tech mentor came. \u00a0This time three of his teachers are scheduled to come. \u00a0Also, the top Transition Coordinator for our school district is his Facilitator. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe plans this meeting, sets the schedule and invites those that he wants to help him. \u00a0He really loves the attention that he gets during this process. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThis morning, he sits at the kitchen table complaining. \u00a0\"I hate school! \u00a0If it weren't for you making me go...I wouldn't!\" \u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe is already an hour late. \u00a0I ask him, \"So you don't want to go to school? Would you like me to cancel this evening's meeting? \u00a0People who live in a box don't need to set goals. \u00a0I can just call everyone and tell them life is too hard. You don't want to go to school. You've given up. \u00a0They don't need to waste their time coming over here tonight.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe made it to school ...finally. \u00a0Once he was there, I received this text message ... \n \n \n \n\"I apologize for my behavior this morning. \u00a0I was really tired and cranky. :/ I may need to start taking 5 hour energy in the mornings.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI missed Yoga today since I spent a good part of my morning getting him to school. \u00a0By the time I wrapped dropping him off and speaking with the school Psychologist (making plans for helping him get to school on time and make the right choices once he gets there for his 17 year-old self)...my  free-time  for the day is half-way over. \u00a0By  free time,  I mean the opportunity to exercise, write, grocery shop and get my gray hair dyed. \u00a0Yes...it's getting more gray by the minute.  \u00a0Hmm...I wonder why?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI will also preparing the house and snacks for his meeting this evening. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt turns out he doesn't want to live his life in a box after all. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-monYBsa15WI/US0Kh8ubJFI/AAAAAAAABBU/gxb6e8A08xQ/s1600/PCP.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/02/life-in-box.html", "title": "\nLife in a Box \n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, January 22, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \nWhen God created mothers and fathers...mars and venus raising a child here on planet earth ...I suppose the hope was that the two totally opposite beings would somehow balance each other out, the result being a well balanced child who grows up to be a successful adult. \n \nThe truth is in the trenches ...it's hard as hell. \u00a0I know this isn't my original thought, I'm sure I read or heard it somewhere, but I can't remember where. Anyways, I wrote it as a facebook status a few days ago... \n \"Raising children is about the most unromantic thing a couple can do together.\" \nSome disagree with me and that's o.k. \u00a0Apparently, they don't have my kids. \u00a0Don't get me wrong...I think having a baby is romantic. \u00a0Hell...babies are romantic. \u00a0They smell good. \u00a0They smiles are so pure. \u00a0They don't talk. \u00a0But eventually, they grow in to teen-agers and there is NOTHING romantic about raising teenagers. \u00a0I would venture to say ....raising teens on the spectrum makes it difficult to the 10th power. \n \nSay you get married in your twenties. \u00a0I was 28. \u00a0I had absolutely no idea who I was as a person. \u00a0I don't know ...maybe my husband knew who he was. \u00a0He had been married and had a five-year-old son, \u00a0so he had some idea of what it meant to be a parent. \u00a0Neither of us knew what it would be to parent children with special needs.  \n \nI had a real romanticized view of what marriage and motherhood would be. \u00a0I raised my step-son for a while and before I knew it, my first-born turned into a terrible 2 toddler, whose language we did not understand and the next thing I knew it I was pregnant again. \u00a0As we moved into my second pregnancy, we were starting to realize that my first born (Red) ...was not quite developing as he should be. \u00a0I had never imagined the possibility of raising a child with special needs. \u00a0It wasn't a blip on my radar. \n \nCut to now...my stepson is out of the house at age 24 (but he still has not grown up). \u00a0We have two teen-age sons at home who are on the autism spectrum. \u00a0They are stubborn as hell. \u00a0Who knew??? Right? Dealing with their anxiety, depression, hormones, defiance, rebellion, autism thought processes and generally pain-in-the-ass adolescence...is a bit much. \u00a0Raising them is stressful. \u00a0Disciplining them is hellacious. \u00a0All of this is intensified when parents are not on the same page. \n \nIt's really hard for me to share the duties of parenting with a partner who doesn't do everything the way I would...who in fact, doesn't do\u00a0 anything \u00a0the way I would. \u00a0(insert sarcasm here)\u00a0 I am their mother...of course I know best right? \u00a0I read all the books, go to all of the therapy sessions, go to all of the school meetings, sit down with all of the counselors, do all the research, read all the books. \u00a0I like to use what I've learned to raise them with discipline, yet at the same time, I would like to create an hora of peace in our home. \u00a0I can not stand the constant arguing, yelling and screaming. \u00a0The boys are often out of control because of their fits of anger and meltdowns. \u00a0It is important for the parents ...the adults, who are supposedly not on the spectrum to try to remain calm and in control. \u00a0So of course my way is the right way? Right??? \u00a0( Hubby would emphatically beg to differ. ) \n \nRemaining calm isn't always possible. \u00a0We are human. \u00a0When someone is hammering you with negativity all day you are going to loose your shit every once in a while. \u00a0But when you discipline out of anger and frustration ...you are more likely to say things that you don't mean ...things that can be hurtful and damaging to the child whose self-esteem is already in the crapper. \u00a0If at all possible, we should take a step back, catch our breath and come back and deal with a situation with calmness. \u00a0This is the ideal. \u00a0Of course, this will not happen all the time.  \n \nHubby is straight from the old-school. \u00a0He has been to some therapy sessions, school meetings, etc. \u00a0Has he read very much about autism, discipline and meltdowns? \u00a0I don't think so. \u00a0He may say otherwise. \u00a0But there is always 3 sides to every story. \u00a0Maybe one day he will share his with you. \u00a0In  my  opinion ...he wants to parent the boys the way  he  was parented.  \u00a0(As if that worked so well.) \u00a0 Of course, he is a male and is naturally more aggressive and doesn't sugar coat anything. \u00a0It's just unnatural for him to use a calm tone of voice when the kid is bucking up with anger, and disrespect. \u00a0There is a lot of alpha-male crap going on as well. \u00a0 Let me show you loud and clear who is boss around here.  \u00a0At the same time, the boys are becoming young men, who have their own very strong thoughts and feelings although they don't always make sense to us. \u00a0And because of their Aspergers, they sound very blunt and don't filter things especially when they are upset, which can  feel  like blatant disrespect.  \n \nMy mother screamed at me all the time. \u00a0If I parented the way she did...I would be in the nut house. \u00a0My husband was parented in the old-school...I'm the parent...you're the kid...do what I say or you will be spanked method. \u00a0He parents with a certain level of in-your-face, I'm-the-boss kind of strategy, \u00a0 which usually leads to even bigger fireworks in our house. \u00a0I can't stand it! And he can't stand my Mrs. Softy coddling the boys ( as I'm sure he sees it ) way of doing things.  \n \nWhat we really need is an outside source ...a therapist to help guide us. \u00a0To help us to meet somewhere in the middle of parenting and discipline that is creative, thoughtful and effective. \u00a0He doesn't want to listen to me...and I sure as hell don't want to listen to him. \u00a0This causes thick as a brick wall tension between us where there would otherwise be love.  \n \n Who thinks of all of this crap before you actually have children? This crap is hard! \n \nAs a couple we are awesome together...we compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses. \u00a0He is loving and sweet, and he loves to spoil me whenever he can. \u00a0He is a good provider. \u00a0We have such a good time when we are alone together. \u00a0We both love to go to concerts, dine in fine restaurants ...we especially love to travel together. \u00a0We are also opposites in many ways. \u00a0All in all...I think I chose a wonderful mate. \u00a0I know that he loves his children. \u00a0He has stuck around although, I'm sure there are times when he wants to run screaming...as do I. \u00a0 If we could only take the stressful parenting aspect out of our relationship ...things would be so much more simple...not reality, but simple.  \n \nPeople think I'm crazy when I say ...sometimes I wish he could just be my boyfriend and baby daddy. You know ...I'll send the kids to you every other weekend and a month in the summer. That way you can parent them your way and I don't have to watch and vice versa. \u00a0 We could get together once a week for dates and take vacations together. \u00a0 That may be a little dysfunctional ...but hey! \u00a0You never know...it could work.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8JEGr1Sltx0/UP7D3DbgVlI/AAAAAAAAA-c/XYa9MBkgedM/s1600/images-6.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/01/venus-mars-parenting-on-earth.html", "title": "\nVenus & Mars Parenting on Earth \n"},
{"date": "Friday, January 30, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nIt\u2019s been the best of times. It\u2019s been the worst of times within my four walls lately. I\u2019ve written about much of it here on this blog. I stress that I have written much of it, definitely not all of it. My writing is my personal form of therapy. I write for others who are on a similar journey and for parents who will be facing similar issues in the future. The parents who come here and read our stories honestly appreciate my candor and honesty.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThere are plenty of warm and fuzzy blogs out there in blogosphere, if you want the fluff. My life is not all floating on a cloud of flowers, happiness and love. I am raising boys. Easy to love, hard to live with, boys. My original reason for writing this blog was so that my family and friends would realize exactly what our family is dealing with on a daily basis, in hopes that along the way, I might show others exactly what our flavor of autism is.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI do get the occasional hater who comments telling me what I need to do differently. How I need to just kick Red\u2019s ass to the curb like yesterday. Quite frankly, many of the people who leave the most judgmental comments are often on the spectrum themselves. Then there are those who don\u2019t even have any freakin\u2019 kids! Yet, they still consider themselves somehow an expert on my child and my situation.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \"Haters gonna hate. I just love, love, love.\" to quote Theresa Guidice, who is now in jail.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMost of the time I just laugh at the pure audacity of the judgement. I laugh pretty hard when people try to tell me how to live my life. If I didn\u2019t laugh, oh my God, I would be locked up in white padded room somewhere. (Although, I\u2019ve heard those rooms are blue now. Blue is supposed to be a soothing color.) \n \nOther times, I find myself being a little more apprehensive about what I write because I don\u2019t want to hear what the critics have to say. Well pardon my language but\u2026fuck that.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI have to remind myself that there are far more people who benefit from my writing than there are who detract from it. Besides, most of the time when people try to tell you how to run your life, they aren\u2019t all that successful at running their own. In fact, most of them are a hot mess. \u00a0I also remind myself that they are judging from their own perspective and their own life experiences which has nothing to do with my reality. \n \n \n \nThere is a big divide in the autism community between some adults with autism and neuro-typical parents who are raising children with autism.\u00a0 I can understand some of the animosity and disdain for us. I don't believe that it is mean, spiteful or even personal. Their feelings about us are based on the way they see the world. Their perspective is likely based on their perception of their own childhood experiences. I say perception, because if you ask their parents or their siblings the way things happened, they would most likely have a totally different point of view.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nBlue and I were doing some research last week on John Elder Robison, the author of one of my favorite books \"Look Me in The Eye\". Our research was for a project he was doing for school. We found that John, his mother Mary Robison, and his brother now known as Augusten Burroughs, (\"Running with Scissors\") have all written memoirs of their years growing up. For their mom she wrote the years she spent raising her children. All of their stories are different. This doesn\u2019t make any of them liars. It\u2019s just makes their stories their version of the truth.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIn the article that we found on\u00a0 NPR.org \u00a0 Lee Gutkind, a professor at Arizona State University and a specialist in creative nonfiction, said this about the memoir, \u201cIt's your story, that's what a memoir is. It's your own personal truth, and it is not necessarily factually accurate, and it's not necessarily the truth that other people have possessed.\" \n \n \n \nI know this from personal experience. In our family, if any of us were to tell the story of life in our house, each story would be totally different. Red would say, how much we all worked hard to piss him off! We never did anything to make his life better. He had the most god-awful childhood you could imagine.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nBlue would say, his brother sucked the air out of the room. That he never got any attention because we gave it all to his brother. But all in all, he had a pretty darn good childhood, with the exception of not getting nearly as many things as all of his friends had.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy mother would say, I had the patience of an angel with my children. Another day she would say that I needed to knock one of them upside the head and that they took complete advantage of me. There would be no tales of her part in agitating them and not being able to keep her mouth shut, ever.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy husband would say, I was the best mother to our children, but I didn\u2019t gave him enough time and attention as my husband. For all of them, their stories would be absolutely true. It may or may not be factual.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe truth is, I really do not share everything on this blog. On Saturday, I made what I would call a film documentary of a day in my life. If I shared in total the insanity that went on in my house that day, the mental hospital would be knocking on my door asking me why haven\u2019t I checked in yet. It would be \u2026just way too much information. It would be unbelievable.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThat\u2019s why I would never do a reality show about my family. It would end up being edited to tell the story that fits someone else\u2019s agenda. And trust me, our story could be quite entertaining to other people. It would be a hit! We\u2019d be rich!  Hmm! I could pay for all of the best therapy in the world, which we all desperately need.\u00a0 We could just move in to a family sanitarium.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI have our true reality documented on tape. The reason I taped it was because, I was seriously considering looking into a therapeutic facility where Red could have his meds assessed. I thought it would be good to show the actual behavior to doctors so that they would know, I\u2019m not making this shit up! He is acting way off! Kind of off the charts! I am wondering how much is anxiety and what could be related to the medication that is not working, or the mixture that is working against each other. I felt like perhaps he could benefit from being rebalanced out and in a safe environment sans all of the triggers that we have at home.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThen again, the truth could just be that he is conspiring to drive me completely nuts, or subconsciously trying kill me from stress.  kidding. Sort of. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe bottomline is that I have to follow my instincts as my children\u2019s mother. No one knows them and what they need better than I do. No one walks in my shoes. No one is privy to everything that goes on behind our closed doors.  (Well, except my neighbors, because ometimes it spills out into the streets.)\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am not the perfect mother. I have made my mistakes with them and I\u2019m sure I will continue to do so. However, they are my mistakes to make. This is our journey, our path to follow, hiccups, missteps and all. I know for sure, that God lights our path. He is showing me the way. My impulses and inclinations have served them well so far. They end up getting exactly what they need. And so far, they are two phenomenal human beings, even with their flaws and imperfections.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThey both have an unbelievable support system because I know their father and I can not do this alone. It takes a village and ours is extraordinary. \n \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \nSpeaking of John E.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 17, 2014", "body": "\n \n \"Be kind, for everyone you meet, is fighting a hard battle.\" -Plato\u00a0 \n \n \nOne thing that having these special children has taught me is to always stop and think about the other person's perspective. \u00a0Because my children see the world from a completely different point of view, I no longer take things at face value. \u00a0They don't look like they're having any problems, but they are. \u00a0The battles that they are facing inside of their own heads. \u00a0They don't \"look like they have autism, anxiety, ADHD, OCD, depression or a mood disorder. \u00a0Their challenges are not visible to the naked eye. \u00a0This does not mean that they don't exist.  \n \nThe way that I see things is not necessarily the way that they see things. \u00a0The way that either of us sees things may have little to do with the way that they actually are. \n \nThough my husband has no diagnosis, I think all of the men in this house actually have a perspective deficit. They just do not automatically think about what the other person may be thinking or feeling. I am often their barometer --the one who actually points out the different perspective. \u00a0When I do this, my husband accuses me of taking the other person's side. \u00a0I'm just pointing out that their actually IS another side. There is always another point of view. \n \nThe way that an individual sees and interacts in the world depends on a lot of variables. What is their life experience? Undoubtedly, it's different than yours. \nWhat's going on with that person mentally or even physically? \nAre they suffering from depression, some form of anxiety or some other heavy issue? \n \nLot's of people put on the bright smile and charm, even a great sense of humor. In truth, we have no idea how they're really feeling. Isn't the recent death of Robin Williams proof of that? O.K. I guess we should have known that he was often a bit manic and over the top, but I don't think most people had any idea how low his lows, actually were. \n \nWhat looks all put together, flashy, shiny and successful, maybe a hot mess on the inside. Just because a person has a great career, is doing well financially, appears to have the happiest, most perfect family ever, does not mean that they are indeed, actually happy. \u00a0The truth maybe that that person is so spent from working so hard, that they have very little left over in their mental bank when they come home from work. \n \nJust because that person has to be \"on\" all day in order to do their job, doesn't mean that they don't come home and want to hide because of social anxiety, depression or self-loathing.  \n \nA marriage that looks happy could be a source of internal anguish. We never really know what is going on behind closed doors much less, what is going on in someone's mind and heart. \u00a0The pretty pictures and happy smiles are not always what they're cracked up to be. \n \nSome of the most successful people I know still have some kind of mental issues or insecurities. \nYou don't know what their childhood experiences were. You may not know what their relationship is with their parents and how that effects them now. \nYou just never know what battles that person is fighting, or what it really takes to maintain their life. \n \nBefore you form your opinions about another person, maybe you should try to really understand them. \nBefore you feel slighted, or angry or internalize something they said or did as a personal affront to you, perhaps you should actually communicate your feelings instead of making assumptions. \n \nIt could be that the influences and experiences in your life, have barring on your perceptions. \u00a0Whether or not we want to admit it, \u00a0deep inside we all have preconceived notions of certain people, based on race, sexual orientation, religion, economic status or level of education. \u00a0And most of the time we are DEAD wrong. \n \nIf there is one thing that autism has taught me, and it has taught me SO MUCH, is that if you've met one person with autism, you've met just that ...one person with autism. Each person on the spectrum is unique, special in their own way and they all face different challenges right down to the two-children that I am raising. \n \nThe same is true about most people. We're all unique no matter race, sexual orientation, neurological status, mental issues, economic status or whatever ...and we're all fighting something. \n \nMy own depression has taught me that my perspective may be skewed. \u00a0When I am feeling down, I have a tendency to take things that someone says or does more personally than it's intended to be.  \n \n \n \nSometimes we sit in stew in our own juices, holding on to anger, or negative feelings.  \nWe don't communicate because we don't want to be confrontational or offensive. \u00a0The only person that really hurts ...is you. The supposed offender is off living their life, probably completely unaware of the offense. \n \nIn the end, the truth just may be that the person in question is just an asshole. \u00a0And even then, there may be a valid reason why they're an asshole. \n \nIt has been said, that I'm a bit of a Polly Anna. I really do try to find the bright side in any situation. \u00a0I usually try to find the good in a person, instead of just the negatives. \u00a0It's not always possible, but most of the time you can find something positive if you're really looking for it. \n \nHaving children on the autism spectrum has taught me that even through what looks like rudeness or what may appear to be abrupt or insensitive, there is usually a deeper story --another perspective. \u00a0The writer side of me makes me want to find out what the story is.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YvitfATemmg/VItq8ZDB3SI/AAAAAAAABwA/lf8xhoWNoe8/s1600/1622682_740258126050430_4044395742586727969_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/12/perspective.html", "title": "\nPerspective \n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, January 6, 2015", "body": "\n \nEvery single day I spend quiet moments thinking about my children --trying to understand them. \u00a0I want explanations for their behaviors. \u00a0What are they trying to tell me by this behavior? Is this behavior \u00a0hereditary? Is this a learned behavior? Is this innate? Is this manipulation? Do they get this from me? Does he get that from his dad or his grandma? Or \u00a0...oh my God! He's acting like my father! \n \nI know a lot of people don't like the puzzle symbol for autism. \u00a0But aren't we all puzzles? A puzzle doesn't have to indicate a missing piece. \u00a0Why can't it be about how we put all the pieces together and how sometimes, they're upside down and need to be turned around? \n \nI think I have Blue pretty well figured out. He's nowhere near as complicated as his brother. He is a little closer to textbook Aspergers -extremely intelligent, deep thinking, thinks outside the box, very curious, a little nerdy (he says he would like to be nerdier). He will probably be a world changer. \n \nYou may not realize he has Aspergers by talking to him. \u00a0He will actually listen to you during a conversation. \u00a0He will ask you questions and be interested in you. \u00a0Although he would prefer that you see the world as he does, he is intelligent enough to realize that that's probably not going to happen. That doesn't mean that he has to be happy about it. \n \nI'm in awe as I watch Blue constantly evolving, growing and maturing. In his last Person-Centered-Plan meeting the goal he set for himself to try to be more positive in his interactions with peers. He still has a few social issues at school. He has a tendency to comment on everything that everyone else is doing, and when it comes to peers and his brother, he must point out how completely idiotic their behavior is. Peers tend to not like that so much, so he ends up in a lot of arguments. \n \nWith his new goal of being more positive, one of his teachers who attended the meeting observed that Blue is not very positive about himself. \u00a0He can't really accept a compliment. He doesn't believe that he's smart, handsome, funny or a good friend. He tends to focus on the negative. \n\"Everyone hates me,\" he says, which is far from the truth. \u00a0The kid has his own social club for people who are different! How brave and forward thinking is that? \n \nSo for the next month or so, he is to focus on positive things about his own life. \u00a0What is the good that happened in your day? Write it down. Oprah says write down 5 things to be grateful for. We settled on 3 because of course, he hates superfluous writing (and he doesn't care for Oprah nearly as much as I do). \n \nSince he started writing down and observing the positives, he has discovered that he actually is a good friend. He has a female friend who describes herself as \"weird and most people think I'm strange.\" Blue is especially kind to her. When she's upset he comforts her. She is grateful for his friendship. \u00a0He seems to be the one boy, who she doesn't have a crush on. \u00a0She has told him that he is, \"one of the kindest people she's ever met.\" That's saying something! He can actually be less than kind, if he thinks you're an idiot, and most high school students in his opinion are idiots. Apparently, he sees this young lady as unique and intelligent, instead of \"weird.\" \n \nAs a mom, I am happy that he has developed this friendship because it gives him an opportunity to get to know and understand a young lady without the emotional entanglements of a romantic relationship. \u00a0This will serve him well whenever he decides to date. \n \nBlue has even been kinder and a little more patient with his big brother in the past few weeks. There have been moments when they hang out together. \u00a0He has been teaching Red how to play one of his favorite video games. They've watched movies in Red's room. It's been incredible! \n \nOf course, there are still those moments where he's ripping Red a new one, especially when Red is being his super annoying, button-pushing self (a behavior I believe he inherits from my father). \u00a0 Still, there is improvement. I appreciate any time that he gives to his older brother both because it makes Red happy, but mostly because it means for the moment, \u00a0Red isn't bugging the shit out of me! \n \nRed on the other hand, completely baffles me. \u00a0I've been told many times that behavior is communication. When a child behaves a certain way, they are telling you how they are feeling, rather it be good, bad, anxious, depressed. \u00a0They are reacting to social and environmental stimuli. \u00a0For the life of me, I can't understand Red's motivation behind certain behaviors. \n \n \n \nSome behavior is for attention. \u00a0He craves being the center of attention and if he isn't, he will find a way to make a situation be about him, good or bad. Hence, Christmas day for us this year was supposed to be more about relaxation, christmas music, and just our immediate family unit. \u00a0Honestly, I would have preferred that one of the boys went away to spend time with family. \u00a0Unfortunately, that didn't work out. \u00a0I specifically tried to take some of the pressure out of the holidays, both for myself and for the boys. I didn't make it about gigantic gifts or large lists of wants. \u00a0That usually creates way too much anxiety and drama. \n \nSo my dear son Red, found a way to create that drama anyway. \u00a0He couldn't allow us just to enjoy the relaxation. He had to stir things up and let us know his dissatisfaction with the world and his family in particular. \u00a0Where as Blue went out of his way to get me a small, thoughtful gift. Red made sure that he got several gifts for his girlfriend, but only wanted to know what his father and I \u00a0had for him and why he didn't have more? \n \nI wish I could understand him more. \u00a0I am in constant thought about his behaviors and motivations ...wondering how I can help him or help him help himself. \u00a0How much is his personality? How much is autism, depression, oppositional defiance? What is related to medication? What is this medication really doing for him? Is some of it helping while some of it is making matters worse? \n \nI'm beginning to see some of my father in him. The button pushing behavior is definitely a trait handed down from my dad. My father loves to say provocative things both to get attention and to get people stirred up or upset.  \n \nI don't know if I will ever understand him completely. Maybe he is not to be understood. One thing I know for sure, this transition to adulthood seems to be the hardest stage of his life yet ...at least for me. I will continue to support him in whatever ways I can, \u00a0even if that support is from a distance. Sometimes, it's just better to work in the background and let him figure his own life out with the supports that he has in place. He is so blessed with a team of people that are working with him to help on the road to success. \u00a0The world is his for the taking, he just has to stand up and grab it. \n \nHopefully, I will live to see the day when he finally does. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UqhYhz3_DU8/VKtGyPJVrCI/AAAAAAAABw4/_oaFElyBnFA/s1600/10888482_748675385208704_5981431380205206627_n-1.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/01/behavior-is-communication.html", "title": "\nBehavior is Communication \n"},

Your friends post all of these pretty pictures of their happy little lives, smiling with their pretty things in these beautiful places. \u00a0Ha ha ha! Fun fun fun! Yeah ...whatever! \n \nYou want to know how I know this? \u00a0It's from first hand experience, of course. \u00a0You see today ...I took some of those pretty pictures and couldn't wait to post them on Facebook.  \n \nIt's Valentines Day. \u00a0The 14 year-olds (Blue and his buddies) were definitely dreading the day because although they have crushes, they have no goods! \u00a0No girlfriends ...no Valentines -no special attention. \u00a0It's a day that makes them feel more left out than usual.  \n \nSo we --the moms of these boys go jump through hoops to make this a day about friendship, family and good times. \u00a0The twin's mom made them a special breakfast and sent them off like a cheerleader with pompoms and everything. \u00a0No literally...she had red, shiny, Valentines pompoms! \n \nI run out to get flowers for my mom and for all of my men (Red, Blue and Dad). \u00a0Single red roses for the guys. \u00a0Yellow roses and lilies for my mom. \u00a0I pick up dinner early so it would be here when the boys get home from school.  \n \nI pick up the middle-schoolers and take them out for ice-cream. \u00a0We all know -ice cream makes everything better and melts all of your troubles away. \u00a0I want to put a smile on their faces and make them think about their friendship instead of some unreciprocated crush on a silly middle-school girl. \u00a0It works! \u00a0Here is the pretty picture to prove it... \n \n \n \nWell before I could get the picture posted good this happens... \n \nHubby calls me while we are out having ice-cream... \n\"Um honey...I was wondering if you could meet me real-quick for dinner. \u00a0I'm starving. \u00a0I haven't eaten all day and I have to come back to the office to finish some quotes.\" \n \n Really? \u00a0Sure Honey! \u00a0Let me just drop everything and run right out to meet you for dinner. \u00a0It's Valentines day. \u00a0Everything will be crowded as hell, so I'm sure there will be no waiting. Oh and these boys? \u00a0I guess I'll just leave them here with homework un-touched, because after all our evenings have been running so smoothly lately. They don't need any supervision. \u00a0No! I'm not worried at all that one or both of them may have a meltdown and say...try to kill each other while I'm off \u00a0having this quick, spontaneous, middle-of-the week dinner out with you! No need to plan ahead for dinner out on a major holiday! \u00a0Forget about the dinner I have already picked up so that you wouldn't have to. \u00a0Yes -it is waiting for us at home. \u00a0But hey, I understand it looks like you won't be home to eat it with us because you have to work late. \u00a0No! I'm not \u00a0upset! \u00a0Really. \u00a0This is just the best day ever! \n \nBlue wants his friend to come over and do homework and hangout for dinner with us. \u00a0However, his friend's mom has other plans. \u00a0They are going out for. \u00a0Remember? \u00a0She is trying to make this day extra-speical for her boys too! \n \nWell -Blue is disappointed. \u00a0As we pull away from their house he starts with negative comments about his plans being ruined to hang out with his friend.  \n \n But -we just hung out with your friend for over an hour having ice-cream. \u00a0Not.Good.Enough!\u00a0 \n \nHere we go off on the deep-end. \u00a0He is not thinking in the least about what we have just done. \u00a0He can only see what he did not get the chance to do. \u00a0One thing leads to another and by the time we pull into our driveway he's yelling at me. \u00a0 Seriously? \u00a0This is not happening.  \u00a0I do not respond favorably. \u00a0In fact, I basically kick him out of the house and tell him to go for a walk to cool off. \u00a0Where does he go? Right back to his friend's house. \u00a0 Whatever! \u00a0I don't even care at this juncture.\u00a0 \n \nHe has no idea that I have bought him his own single-red rose, dinner and was planning on making homemade Toll-House cookies. \u00a0I am hurt and angry at this point, but while he is cooling off -so am I. \u00a0I told my self a long time ago, when it comes to these children on the spectrum, give without thought of reciprocation or gratitude. \u00a0Do for them because it makes me happy, not because I'm looking for a specific response. \u00a0Otherwise, I will often find myself disappointed. \n \nHis perspective is different than mine. \u00a0He can't see past what he did not get to do in order to see what he did get to do. \u00a0It is my job to teach him that. \u00a0If he gets a wife someday, she will not take kindly to being brushed off when she has gone out of her way for him. However, \u00a0I can't teach him anything during a fit of anger or in the heat of the moment when both of our egos are in danger of being bruised. \n \nSo I say all of this to say, when you see those pretty pictures on Facebook, don't be fooled into believing that everyone has this perfectly wonderful little life. \u00a0Our teenagers as well as many adults do this for hours on end. \u00a0They look at pictures of their school-mates -I won't even call them friends. \u00a0They think ... Look at them all having so much fun! \u00a0They have it all! \n \nWhat we are not seeing is the little ugly parts of their lives that are not so fun to look at. \u00a0No one wants you to see the family fights, meltdowns, arguments and tears. \u00a0They paint the pretty picture and we all buy it.  \n \nWell not me! \u00a0I am guilty of posting the pretty pictures, but I also write the truth -the good, the bad and the ugly both on Facebook and on this blog. \u00a0I may get a lot of flack from some of my family when I do so. \u00a0I don't really care. \u00a0I'm a writer. \u00a0This what I do. \u00a0I write about myself and my family and show you the truth -with all of our flaws.  \u00a0I know it's hard to believe I'm not perfect.  \u00a0I hope to make you laugh in the process, because my family is hilarious and my life is ludicrous! \u00a0What is life really, if you can't laugh at yourself? \n \nI'll paint you a picture alright, but it will not be all pretty. \u00a0You see that's one of the wonderful things that I love about art. \u00a0In art and in love ...there is no such thing as perfection. \n \n \nAnd by the way ...dear husband of mine. \u00a0For future reference -Please do not buy me cards with pictures of real people on them. \u00a0Who are these people? \u00a0I don't know them. \u00a0Is that supposed to be me? \u00a0I don't get it. \u00a0There is now a strange black woman sitting on my dresser. I don't want to look at this stranger. \u00a0It distracts from the message. \u00a0As a matter of fact ...maybe you should just write me a note.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nLove you madly! \nYour Smart-ass Wife \n \n \n \n The Single Rose for my love The picture above I made for him another V-day \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lq-RDx1Z1tA/UR3M0g6K1uI/AAAAAAAABAw/W0WnYeOtr4U/s1600/Valentine+friends.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Vs3IZiohfcE/UR3M-fwJkZI/AAAAAAAABA4/Ml4qEKd9w4k/s1600/hearts+and+flower.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/02/pretty-pictures.html", "title": "\nPretty Pictures\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, January 15, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n \nThe road to \u00a0adulthood is long and hard. \u00a0The transition to middle school was not easy, but we made it. High school was pretty god-awful. \u00a0We've had a transition to adulthood plan in the works for a few years now for Red. I wrote about this  Transition to Adulthood Plan  not long after graduation. All I can say is boy, was I naive. This shit is hard! \n \nRed has been holding the same job for 8 months now. That is huge! He still loves it and they seem to love him. \u00a0There have been zero incidents at work. Zero. He has been on time everyday, with the exception of the school bus being late once. He handled that responsibly by calling in to let his supervisor know what was going on. He has never missed a scheduled day. \u00a0Once, recently he decided he wanted the day off to go to Six Flags with his girlfriend. \u00a0He used the employee scheduling text message system to find someone to cover his shift ahead of time. \n \nOne of the issues that I am seeing recently, is that he seems to be getting up later and later to catch his ride to work. As in, literally 5 or 10 minutes before they get here is when his feet finally hit the floor. \u00a0He is also back to needing a couple of prompts in order to get up. \n \nIf you get up only a few minutes before your ride, you can't possibly do everything you're supposed to do to with your hygiene before leaving the house. You don't have time to eat. \u00a0There has been a time or two that he has gone out without taking his meds. \u00a0He usually catches his ride by the skin of his unbrushed teeth. \u00a0All of these are independent living skills that he will need if he ever wants to live on his own and actually to be able to maintain employment or go to college. \u00a0I won't be around to prompt him for the rest of his life. \u00a0I can't come to his rescue when he forgets his meds. Again ...his motivation needs to be internal, as it is when he gets up for church every Sunday morning (zero prompts). \n \nWe still encounter pretty awful behavior here at home. \u00a0Our biggest issues are boundaries, plain old rudeness and disrespect. \u00a0Of course, all of this is everyone else's fault. We all need to change and stop \"pissing him off.\" \u00a0He is the person who sings loudly when others are sleeping, watching television, working or studying, but WE all need to change and stop \"pissing him off!\" \u00a0For the most part, the outside world does not see this ugliness. \u00a0It is reserved especially for those of us who love him and provide a safe place to lay his head every night.  \n \nAnother thing that has improved, is the actual fighting with Blue. \u00a0(Instead he fights with my mom, who will NEVER back down by the way). \u00a0Blue has softened just a little bit and doesn't accept every invitation to fight (unlike my mom). \u00a0Blue has become \u00a0more willing to engage with Red in some positive ways. \u00a0They occasionally play games together. \u00a0Sometimes, they may watch videos on You-tube or maybe even a movie together. \n \n What's next?\u00a0 \n \nI have been looking into various Adult Transitional Living programs for adults with autism, \u00a0Americorps, \u00a0Minnesota College of Life, etc. The feedback that I have received is that since he is 18, and his own legal guardian, he must to be 100% willing to participate. \u00a0He must be self-motivated, free of aggressive or threatening behavior, able to get along with others in a living environment, be able to and willing accept direction.  \n \nHe is not demonstrating any of this at home currently. \u00a0One intake counselor said to me, \"If he can't get along with his 4 family members, how do we expect him to get along with a larger group of strangers?\" Well, the truth is that he is usually better with strangers than he is with us! \u00a0Of course there are no guarantees that this behavior won't transfer in another living environment. \n \nThe word I've been getting from admissions counselors is, \"Why don't you keep in the 18 plus program through the school district as long as possible, so that he can do some maturing? There is nothing as intensive as the services that the school district provides ...for free.\" He is receiving transportation to work through the school district. \u00a0He gets job coaching, social skills training, life management, Occupational therapy and person centered planning, which is great! The problem is ...none of this gets him out of my house or away from his dependence on me. \u00a0Not to mention his sort of obsession with getting my undivided attention all.of.the.time! \n \nI am still in the process of getting him connected with our local department of Mental Health agency for autism support services. \u00a0They can help with community support, counseling, supportive housing (group homes) and several other services. \u00a0This is all great however, dealing with any agency that is funded by the government is always a slow, arduous process. After our initial intake meeting with them over 2 months ago, we finally have a psych evaluation scheduled next week. \u00a0He will need that before he can move into any supportive living arrangement. \n \nI am also working on getting him connected with DARS (Department of Rehabilitative Services). We finally have our second meeting with them at the end of this month. (As I said, slow and arduous.) \u00a0They will hopefully help pay for some of his education, \u00a0training, therapy and quite possibly independent living services needed in order to obtain and maintain full-time work, which he says is his ultimate goal. \n \nMeanwhile, we deal with excessive behavior caused by his severe anxiety because of the uncertainty of everything that he is facing in this transition. He has to make a decision about college or trade school. Where will he end up living? He's still looking into driving, but afraid of the costs and the responsibility that comes along with that. Of course, he is also learning financial responsibility as an adult. Period.  OMG! He will he not be able to buy everything that he wants, the second he wants it! Will he have to struggle like every young adult does while they are getting their education and finding their way in life? This will be surely be tragic! Unimaginable!\u00a0 \n \nOh and of course, the dreaded trying to run a video editing business, with plenty of talent but absolutely no clue about expenses, profit and loss and record keeping. \u00a0In other words, he is trying to run a business with no idea how  business ACTUALLY  works! He is fixating more than ever on what the next gadget is that he needs to buy, in order to make this business a success! Because equipment is like magic! It will help you \"look more professional and be able to charge more money.\" \n \nEven though he is getting support from his job coaches, his Occupational Therapist and Ms. E. one of his old high school teachers, who comes here to work with him on his business ...none of them know what they are talking about! \u00a0 We are all just conspiring to not let him spend all of his money! \n \n On progress... \n \nAs I said, he has been holding this job for 8 months now. \u00a0When he got his first paycheck, he was furious with me when I  made him  take money out of he bank to pay for his  own expenses , such as eating out, transportation and entertainment. \u00a0Now that he is receiving SSI, his Occupational Therapist has helped him set up a budget. \u00a0He is buying his own groceries (specialty items) that the rest of us don't eat. \u00a0He pays for all of his entertainment, eating out and dating (yes...6 months later, he still has a girlfriend).\u00a0 He is also paying rent!!!  I've been working with him for 3 months on balancing his checkbook and keeping up with his spending. \n \nJust the other day, he took out his checkbook on his own, balanced it and wrote out a check for his rent with zero prompts!  Then he went to take a shower. And then I passed out from shock!\u00a0 \n \nThe struggle is real folks. \u00a0There are so many steps on the road to independence, \u00a0I must admit, I was extremely naive about how much work this is. \u00a0Not to mention, how much anxiety and behavior we would have to deal with as a result. \u00a0I really feel like this is the hardest stage of life yet. \n \nThere is however, incremental ...progress. \n \np.s. I appreciate your comments. I really do. Helpful suggestions are always welcome. However ...if you just want to tell me how I'm doing this all wrong, send me a direct message. \u00a0I will then send you my address so you can come and let Red live with you!\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_dOmUsqF7oY/VLf93Go1j1I/AAAAAAAABxM/w9KtYUiAr5U/s1600/10653577_737905739619002_1174270305683330364_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/01/nothing-going-on-but-rent.html", "title": "\nNothing Going On but the Rent \n"},
{"date": "Friday, November 28, 2014", "body": "\n \n \n The next time I spend a holiday with Red will be at his house, with his wife and children. I will sit there and whine and complain about how boring everything is, how disgusting the food looks, what I don't want on my plate. I will talk about how I will throw up if I eat one green bean. I will scream how unfair my life was while I was raising him. Then I will laugh manically all the way home. \n \n \n \n In the days and weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, I knew that I should have sent him away, or I should have gone away. I looked in to tickets to California for me and Blue. When I brought it up, I got the major guilt trip from my mother. \"What am I supposed to do while you're gone?\"\u00a0 \n \n \"Um ...you could go with me and stay through Christmas with your son.\" She wasn't trying to hear that.\u00a0 \n \n \nShe has not picked up on the fact that our family can not always be traditional. We can not enjoy all being at home, for extended amounts of time without there being some fall out. Simple holidays at home don't happen unless one or more people leave this house.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Life got hectic with my husband's travel schedule and everyday details. Before I knew it, Red was scheduled to work and I was tasked with figuring out how he would get to and from work. Getting away was looking bleak.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Wednesday morning after sleeping for 8 hours, I woke up still exhausted. I wondered what the heck was going on with my body? Why was I still so tired? Ha!\u00a0 Depression much?\u00a0 \u00a0Whether or not I wanted to be depressed, my body clearly was. That evening while I tried to do some food prep, Red came down and started being nasty and negative with his mouth. Clearly he wanted to pick a fight with me. I couldn't take it. I got up and went upstairs and went to bed.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n That night I wrote on Facebook... \n \n \n \"I think my body is revolting against my preparing Thanksgiving dinner. I tried. I got as far as seasoning the turkey. Pray that I get it together by tomorrow, or that we find reservations. I'm out ...\" \n \n \n \n I woke up Thursday morning feeling somewhat energized.\u00a0 He woke up Thanksgiving morning with the same nastiness. Yelling, angry, and being argumentative with everyone.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n My brother called in the middle of his yelling, telling people to shut up, etc. As, I told my brother what was going on, Red ran up the stairs to his room. He knew my brother would want to talk to him and he did not want to hear what he had to say.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n A few minutes later, my brother/his uncle called him on his cell phone. After their conversation, Red came down and apologized to everyone.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n We had peace for the next several hours while I cooked my ass off. Seriously...I have very little ass left.\u00a0 \n \n \n Blue helped me make the stuffing. \nDoesn't he look thrilled? \n \n \n I made everything. Turkey, tenderloin roast, stuffing, sweet potato pudding, macaroni and cheese. My mom made the green beans. Blue helped me with the stuffing, which has several steps and he did great. Everything else was on me. Red was in his room doing whatever. He was quiet and that's all I cared\u00a0 \n \n about. \n \n \n \n \n My perfect tenderloin roast marinated with fresh basil and rosemary \n \n \n At about 6 o'clock Red emerged, hungry, grumpy and once again yelling. \"This day is so boring! Why is it so boring? Why don't we have any company? Why didn't we have a party! This is the most boring Thanksgiving ever!\"\u00a0 \n \n \n\"We don't have company because I never know exactly how you're going to behave. Up until yesterday, I didn't know if I would have enough strength to prepare a meal, much less entertain guests. How can I plan ahead of time for a party when I'm constantly dealing with your antics? You want to know why their is no party? Your behavior is why we have no party!\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I ended up sending him upstairs with his dinner. I refused to have him frowning and screaming at my table. By the time I actually served dinner, I was just totally spent. Everyone was going on and on about how delicious everything was. I couldn't even really taste it. I made this beautiful tenderloin roast that I had been dying for. \u00a0I did not eat one bite. Half-way through the meal, salty tears filled my eyes and eventually my plate. I was thoroughly, disgusted. \n \n \n \n My husband was an angel. He held me, poured me a drink and encouraged me to go lay down. Blue was a real trooper. He thoroughly enjoyed everything that I prepared. When he saw that I was upset I heard him ask his dad, \"Is she o.k.? Did I do anything?\" Later, he came to my bedroom to see about me and asked if I was o.k.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n A few weeks ago I wrote about the fact that it is time for Red to go. \u00a0It's time for him to move out of my house and into some kind of supported living environment. Since then, I've been busy hooking him up with services through different agencies, trying to get that ball rolling towards getting him the support that he needs. I wanted to put him into the best possible situation, so that he can go on from there and thrive.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n A few minutes, after my husband told Red how much he had upset me, he was banging at my door, demanding that I open it. \u00a0He did not care about how bad I was feeling. My exhaustion meant nothing to him. As usual,it was all about Red.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Hours later, when he came to apologize there were still excuses. \"People in high school treated me like crap. That's why I behave this way.\" The excuses nullified the apology.  For once in your life, take responsibility for your actions. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I'm\u00a0done. I don't care where he goes or how perfect the situation is, I just want him away from me.\u00a0 I have to think of my own mental health. I will be working overtime to make his departure from this house, a reality.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-R-PYUF_l_ys/VHjib0QdNTI/AAAAAAAABvY/NU4GRGxZeR8/s1600/Colestuffing.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0-Sd7CNUqjs/VHjhoCtxfJI/AAAAAAAABvQ/nZgDEeLN3nM/s1600/tenderloin.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/11/no-thanks-giving.html", "title": "\nNo Thanks Giving \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 8, 2015", "body": "\n \nIn the months and weeks leading up to my 50th birthday I thought about how amazing it is what time and children do to your life. \u00a0Motherhood, marriage and daughterhood have completely changed my priorities. \u00a0I miss that selfish girl from my 20's, but I'm so glad I have her to reflect on from time to time. \u00a0That girl knew how to have a damn good time! Too bad she wanted so desperately to get married. Like she was missing something.  Ha! I laugh at her now.  \u00a0Especially, when I think of my niece who is in her 20's and spending it traveling the world, without a care about getting married or having children. I am so impressed by and proud of her. \n \nI always thought I would do something fabulous for this special birthday. Maybe I would go to Paris! Maybe a girls trip with my closest girlfriends. \u00a0Maybe I would have a big party. \u00a0But as it came closer, through mental exhaustion all I could do was think,  I just want to sleep for my birthday. \u00a0 How boring am I?\u00a0 \n \nHaving grown up not really celebrating my birthday because of my mother's religious beliefs, \u00a0which in turn became my beliefs that I never quite felt comfortable with. \u00a0We were a part of the Jehovah's freakin Witnesses until I turned 17 and had finally had enough of that bullshit. \u00a0I just could not see why I had to be continuously judged by a group of people about the way I lived my life. \u00a0I hated the all invasiveness of it all. \u00a0Hence, I am scarred for life. \n \nI finally started celebrating my birthday at the age of 17. \u00a0I had the first the birthday party since my 5th birthday. I vaguely remember my mom planning a surprise party for me. That was when she and my dad were still together, before she turned to the Witnesses as her support system. \n \nAfter reclaiming my life and independence from that religion, \u00a0it was like my birthday was a national holiday. I couldn't get enough attention from my family and my friends. I felt like I had missed out all of those years. I had to make up for lost time. \n \n \n \nDuring my 20's when I still lived in Los Angeles where I grew up, my birthday was a month long celebration that I couldn't stop talking about the entire month before. I made sure everyone remembered. I may have been a little obnoxious about it. ( Right Jenny and Mary? ) \u00a0But my friends indulged me and so did my family. \u00a0There was a special dinner and/or lunch with each and every set of friends in my honor. Occasionally, there was a party and it was all about me! \n \n \n \nAs I turn 50 \u00a0of course, it's hard to believe. I'm still a young party girl in my head. Except now, most of my partying takes place in my car, as I drive around in circles within a 10 mile radius of my house doing all of the mom things. \u00a0I dance unabashedly to my 80's and 90's tunes, from rock to R&B to rap. My boys hate my dancing and loathe my music choices. That doesn't stop me. I play it louder when they're not in the car.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThis year leading up to the big day, all I could think about every day was just how\u00a0tired I am. \u00a0It's been a busy few months with trying to pull together services for Red, dealing with his behaviors and crappy, ungrateful attitude. I felt a special kind of mental exhaustion every.single.day. \u00a0Some days I was so tired, I wondered if I was dying. Seriously. \n \nI \u00a0desperately wanted some peace and quiet. I had nothing left over for planning anything special. \u00a0All of my planning and coordinating was for my family. \nAll I really wanted was...not to have to do  anything  for  anyone .\u00a0 \n \nNot to listen to or solve anyone else's problems.\u00a0 \n \nNot to buy anyone's groceries. \n \nNot to drive anyone anywhere for any appointments.\u00a0 \n \nNot to cook, make sure anyone eats or takes medication.\u00a0 \n \nNo meetings or phone calls to coordinate anything for anybody. \nNot to talk or have to listen to anyone talk, and talk and talk.\u00a0 \n \n \nI mused of days of freedom to do whatever I want. Just a few days ...a month, or the rest of my life. \n A girl can dream right? \n \n \nI even found myself having frequent thoughts about quitting my job.  Sorry dudes! I quit. I'm outta here. Find another sucker to be your mother. \n \nBack in the days when I had an actual career, if I got tired of a job, tired of a boss not appreciating all of my hard work, that was it! Good bye! Sayonara baby! Moving on to bigger and better things. More money. More opportunities. \u00a0Something new. Some place new. \n \nSadly, this is not a job that one resigns from. \u00a0Lord only knows we can't afford a replacement. Someone might take the job, but I don't think they would stay long. \n \n \n \nA part of me is still that little girl who would have a big ballyhoo for her birthday.  \nI just did not have it in me to coordinate such an event that would include everyone that I love, or at least a good portion of them. \nI couldn't make a decision about what I wanted, or where I wanted it. \nI knew for sure that I didn't want a party for the sake of \u00a0saying,  I had a party, \u00a0with only my local friends in Texas and I love my friends in Texas. However, \u00a0this place still doesn't feel like home to me. I wanted to be surrounded by my people. \u00a0The ones whom I love and who have loved me most of my life.  \n \nLately, my husband hasn't had the bandwidth between work, travel and our family drama to put something like that together. \u00a0Especially for a high maintenance, control freak, wife like myself. \u00a0 He will love that I have admitted this, in writing no less. \n \nBut you see that one of the wonderful things about age and maturity... \nYou know who you are, flaws and all. \nI embrace the beautiful mess that I am. \nIt's glorious really. \nI know what I want \nI know what I don't want. \nI know that I don't have to settle, just so that I can say I did this or that. \nI don't have the time or energy to just go through the motions. \nIf I could not have it all, I'd rather not have it. \nI don't surround myself with people, just for the sake of \u00a0having people around. \nI spend what little free time I have surrounded by with people who I truly connect with. \nI spend time with those who I know truly love me, flaws, craziness and all. \n \nI have come to value true friends. \nPeople who never go out of their way for you, but will come to the party to have a good time are not your friends. They are people you know. \nPeople who will actually reach out when they can see that you're down ...those are friends. \nTrue friends are there for you through the good, the bad and the crazy. \nTrue friends are able to pick right back up wherever you left off, no matter how much time has passed since you were able to spend time together. \nTrue friends don't keep score. \nThey will call you out of the blue to say hey,  I was thinking about you. Let's get together,  even though it's been months, or years. \nMy family sometimes teases me saying, \"You know your friends are crazy.\" \nI absolutely know this. \nBeing crazy is kind of a requirement to be my friend. \nI don't judge my friends for their choices in life.  \nThey don't judge me for mine. \nWe love each other for exactly who we are. \n \nFor my 50th, I didn't get that totally relaxing week  or month,  to myself. I chose to spend a fun-filled weekend in New York City, just me and my husband. \u00a0For someone who wanted to simply sleep for her birthday, that may seem like an odd choice. \u00a0 The city that never sleeps.\u00a0 \n \n \n Hubby: There's always a lot of traffic on 34th Street Me: Is it because of the miracle?\u00a0 \n \nI knew that we needed to reconnect and we had put this trip (t hat had already been paid for)\u00a0 off due to family obligations last year. \u00a0It would not require a great deal of planning, decision making, coordinating or a huge expense. \n \n \n \nI got to sleep in, but our days were packed with activity from walking, to subway rides, taxi's, a Broadway show, \"It's Only a Play\", drinking and dining our way through Greenwich, all over Manhattan, to Mintons, Jazz Club in Harlem. \u00a0We even traveled as far north as Yonkers to have dinner with my sister-in-law and her family. \n \nOn my actual birthday, we took a long walk through Central Park, sat, people watched and listened to all of the accents being spoken, from German, to Italian and Russian. \u00a0The whole time, all I wanted to do is pull out my laptop and write.  Wow! So many stories were walking through that park. \n \n \n Me and Hubby -Central Park \n \nWe had a great Italian dinner, followed by an evening of jazz. When all was said and done, I was physically exhausted. But this exhaustion was a good exhaustion. \u00a0It did not come from mental anguish or frustration. \u00a0It came from living life and creating memories. \n \n \n \nThe Big Apple was there and I took a bite. \n \n \n Central Park April 6, 2015 \nFabulous at 50!\u00a0 \n \nI still plan on finding at least a quiet weekend to myself someday in the near future. \u00a0I need a vacation to recuperate from my vacation. \n \nWishing you all Love and light.... \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XVFa7m9RNYY/VSVQQnk-z_I/AAAAAAAAB2k/ZqVuSNOyz8k/s1600/11149563_10203804927513429_6970447216330536835_n.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GrEeH_TK9ho/VSRud52aRuI/AAAAAAAAB2I/po00ezkW-mY/s1600/11134147_10203799404895367_167751128820795660_n.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QJXg1acUw0U/VSRuiD11QUI/AAAAAAAAB2Q/bsXAqZO20h8/s1600/11138107_801649193244656_523243317823930266_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/04/embracing-50.html", "title": "\nEmbracing 50\n"},

{"date": "Wednesday, May 13, 2015", "body": "\n \n \nIn my constant state of self-observation, I have noticed a lot of changes in myself lately. \u00a0In other words, I'm always trying to figure out why I am so crazy.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThere are so many things that I used to enjoy that now...I just don't. Some things are simple like, talking on the phone. When I was younger, I lived for the phone\u00a0ring to chat or make social plans with my friends. Oh, and the single days of waiting for a particular fellow to call. \u00a0Makes my heart flutter just to think about it. ( Honey ...I'm totally talking about you.)\u00a0 \n \n \n \nNow, there is a slight sense of dread, maybe even panic when the phone rings. Most of the time, it's Red wanting absolutely nothing other than to repeat himself. \u00a0Otherwise, \u00a0it's Blue or my mom requesting services from me. \u00a0The other minority of the time, I just don't want to talk. \n \nThere are a few people who are an exception to that rule. I still have girlfriends across the miles that I like to catch up with occasionally. It's just so rare that I have moments quiet enough for lengthy conversations. \u00a0With one of my best girlfriends, I usually make an appointment for us to talk if we haven't seen each other in a while. \u00a0It sounds crazy and weird, but hey, that's my life. \n \n \n \nA big part of the reason I don't like to talk as much, is that after listening to my kids talk, all.the.time. I got nothin left! My mother gets her feelings hurt because I don't come down to small talk and chat when the boys are not home. Sorry, but I am busy trying to decompress from the constant noise!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nI used to love to go to parties and socialize. Now, unless it's a very close friend, I \u00a0look for excuses not to go. \u00a0This past weekend, I attended one with my husband and his friends. I tried to avoid it. \u00a0In my head, I made up all sorts of excuses. But since hubby has been traveling a lot, I ultimately decided to be a good wife and go with him. \u00a0I ended up having a pretty good time. Plus, there was cake! Deep, dark, decadent, chocolate, chocolate cake.  Totally worth the trauma. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe thing is now; I find myself taking these sensory breaks at parties. I hide in the bathroom for just a bit of quiet for a few minutes. \u00a0I look for places to sit quietly alone so that I can stop smiling and being pleasant for a few moments. \u00a0I need time to collect my thoughts and clear my cluttered head. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI have also noticed that I find myself dreading holidays and all of the pressure that comes along with them. I used to be the queen of Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years and oh my God, birthdays! \u00a0I have written about our last disastrous\u00a0 No Thanks Giving \u00a0and many others in years before. \u00a0I've written about our family's\u00a0 Christmas \u00a0insanity many times. (You should read those posts if you haven't). If you're an autism parent, you will\u00a0identify. If you're not, you'll probably cry for me.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI know that I'm not alone. A lot of autism parents feel the same level of hatred for holidays. \u00a0It's because of how our children may or not behave with the extra pressure and anxiety. \u00a0It's a part of this thing I call Autism PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). \u00a0PTSD is an anxiety-based disorder that happens when a person has experienced trauma or has repeatedly been exposed to\u00a0traumatic events. PTSD can occur to soldiers who have been in a war zone or to a victim of a crime. \u00a0Autism PTSD is when you are consistently experiencing traumatic events in your home or out in the community while raising your child with autism, who may fall apart emotionally, act out physically and have a meltdown at any given moment.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI've read several articles about it lately. \u00a0Jess at\u00a0 Diary of a Mom \u00a0wrote about it. A few weeks ago I read an article titled\u00a0\"Stress PTSD and Parents of Kids With Special Needs.\" It was a huge aha moment for me. I was like, YES! This is my life!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAccording to the\u00a0 National Institute of Mental Health , One of many the symptoms of PTSD is  Avoidance. \u00a0 \n \n \n Staying away from places, and events that are reminders of the experience  (I want to stay away from home all the time. I have to take a moment to gather myself in the car in the driveway before I come inside).\u00a0 \n Feeling strong guilt, depression, or worry. ( Check! Constantly! )\u00a0 \n Losing interest in activities that were enjoyable in the past. ( Talking on the phone, having parties, attending parties.)\u00a0 \n Feeling emotionally numb ( Check! Check!) \u00a0 \n \n \n \nHmm...sounds eerily familiar. \u00a0 Avoiding talking. Avoiding socializing. Avoiding holidays -no longer enjoying them because of the many traumatic experiences in the past. Feeling numb -no desire for the enjoyment that used to come along with these activities.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen our kids are diagnosed, we begin living a new normal, \u00a0which is anything  but  normal .  We are pretty much in a constant, heightened sense of stress ... always  waiting for the other shoe to drop, for the phone to ring with the school or the kid on the other end of the line with some major issue. \n \n \n \n \nLately, in our home things have  been a little bit better. Red is not melting down and ranting quite as often. \u00a0He's still a stick in the mud and negative, but things are ever so slightly better. \u00a0Of course, where Red slows down, Blue speeds up. So even the slightest progress can be difficult to celebrate\u00a0and enjoy. \u00a0It can be perfectly quiet. I am sitting here reading, but I'm waiting for screaming to start, for the argument to begin or for the actual physical fight to break out between teenage brothers.  Autism PTSD! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am constantly diffusing, trying to keep my mother from pulling a trigger --to just stay out of everything or not scream at the boys. I flinch when I think my husband is about to blow a gasket and set one of the boys off. I usually jump up and try to deescalate it. I feel like a puppeteer trying to control all of the strings so that the puppets don't end up saying the wrong things and end up all mangled together; the house destroyed, another hole in a wall or a door in the process.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am, by the way, working on that need to control all interactions at all times. \u00a0I just can not do it! \u00a0I can not control the kind of relationship my husband has with the boys. I can not control their every interaction. \u00a0It's impossible, and my husband resents it. \u00a0I'm sure my mother does too,  but hey, she lives there by her choice, and she is not their parent . I realize that especially when it comes to my husband and the boys, I have let the chips fall, and the dust settle. It is  super hard  for me to let go. But again, I am trying to keep control to avoid explosions, like a soldier, in a war zone! (PTSD) \n \n \n \nFor Mother's Day weekend this year, my husband did take the boys out of the house on Saturday to see a movie. It was heaven ...for me. \u00a0I did nothing. \u00a0I just absolutely relaxed with no guilt of, I should be doing this or that. It was torture for my husband. Red spent most of the day complaining, and asking his father, \"Why do you have to be so military?\" Nothing was enough. Nothing his father did was good from his perspective, not the shopping or the meal that he gulped down in 15 seconds flat.\u00a0 \n \n \n My Mother's Day Gift  Peace, Quiet & Sweatpants \n \n \nSunday the actual Mother's day, was mostly good. \u00a0I tried to relax. I did not cook. Hubby picked up Italian food. The boys were mostly home and mostly bored,  so you know how that goes . Red did go to church, but he came home complaining about the fact that he couldn't see his girlfriend that day. She was busy spending it with her  mother ,  seeing as it was  Mother's Day  and not  Red Day . \u00a0Her mother deserved her daughters' full attention without any extra drama or distractions. Red complained all.day.long. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nHowever, there was no screaming. \n \nThere were no major fights or major meltdowns. \u00a0 \n \nThat does not mean that I didn't spend the entire day waiting for one to happen.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n*** \n \n \n \nIf you enjoyed this post...please feel free to share it with your network.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://adiaryofamom.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/ptsd/", "http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gr1k0AKGtMw/VVNqdC4ycvI/AAAAAAAAB5s/QHP0GIoSkOU/s1600/11214139_816495951759980_6806853584958581325_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/05/autism-ptsd.html", "title": "\nAutism PTSD \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, June 17, 2015", "body": "\n \nThe other day you asked me why you can't live here at home for another 5 or 10 years. There are so many reasons, I don't know if I can count them all, but here is a good start. \n \n \n \nFirst and most importantly... \n \n \n \n \n You may not live to see another 5 or ten years if you continue to live here.  I know I'm much smaller than you, but I may end up killing you or at least hurting you seriously because of the way that you treat me. Okay I'm kidding. Sort of...exaggerating. Okay, the point is, I don't want to go to jail.\u00a0 \n I may not live another 5 years if you live here. \u00a0 You stress me out! My heart can not take another 5 or 10 years of you and your yelling, following me around and harassing me in my own home. \u00a0The only time I have peace is when you are not in this house. You and I seem to make each other miserable. I always love you, but honestly, I don't like you very much right now. \u00a0I will like you and love you so much more if there was more distance between us. Dad and I would be so much happier to help you if we see you taking steps towards taking care of yourself! \u00a0We still help your older brother to this day when he really needs it. That's what family does. Have you seen how much better he gets along with Dad now that he doesn't live here? \n You want to get married someday.  If you never learn to take of yourself, you will never be able to take care of a family. \u00a0No one wants to marry a mama's boy. Walking around talking about, \"Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!\" A good woman wants to marry a man who takes care of his business. \n \n Photo Credit imgbuddy.com\u00a0 \n \n \n I am to you, \u00a0like kryptonite is to Superman. \u00a0When I am around, you feel weaker than you actually are. When I'm not around, you feel stronger, empowered to do more for yourself. \u00a0You don't want to spend your life, waiting for others to help you. You have to help yourself!\u00a0 You want the most full life possible.  \u00a0This means being comfortable financially, being able to travel, take care of yourself and your family someday. \u00a0I can not continue to give you a crutch to hold onto, if I do, you will never walk freely on your own. \u00a0 \n You are not disabled. You are differently abled!  You can absolutely do anything you set your mind to. You can not let fear keep you from living a full life. You have the ability to do so much more than many of your peers that you're always comparing yourself to. \u00a0Have you ever noticed that you are one of the highest functioning people in most of the programs you're in? You have been blessed with more ability than many other people. Out of your close friends, how many have kept a job for over 1 year? How many have taught themselves a skill like video editing? How many have earned money from their own business? You are intelligent! You can do anything you WANT to do. You simply have to WANT to do it! \n Everything you try, you succeed. \u00a0D o you realize that your first answer to everything is  NO ?  \"No I don't want to do it! NO! I'm not doing that! No! I'm not eating that.\"  That is all about fear! You have to try it to know if you like it. You have always been more likely to try things when you are away from me! \u00a0You try new things when you travel to see family. You wanted this film internship. \u00a0You were scared to apply for it. It would mean changing your schedule. You were sure it wasn't going to work out. It did! You were accepted! There is always fear in the beginning. Change is scary, but you always come through it! You wanted to learn videography, you taught yourself. \u00a0If you want to live more independently, you can do it! You just have to walk through fear.\u00a0 \n Adults don't like being told what to do.  You are and adult, but as long as you are here in our home, you have to follow your parents rules. We will always have a say in what you are doing. Living on your own, gives you freedom from your parents (who according to you, know absolutely nothing.) \n There are too many people in this house that you don't get along with.  You fight with everyone! Me. Your brother. Nana, Harry (the dog) and Dad! If you haven't gotten along with us in almost 20 years, chances are, you won't start now.  You do however get along with friends and peers.  You will get along with a roommate or a group of peers better than you will EVER get along with your family!\u00a0 \n You are not happy here. You are happiest when you are away from your family.  \u00a0You are happy at work. You are happy at church and when you are with your church family. You are happy when you are around your friends, and people closer to your age. \u00a0You are happy when you spend time with Mr. Kevin. You are happy when you travel and spend time away from us. Why not have more of that? \u00a0Truthfully, freedom is happiness! Trust me. I'd give anything to be free and on my own! The time I lived on my own was the best time of my life!  Such a silly girl to give that up for this. \n Life struggles make you stronger and help you learn.  Life can't always be easy, or you will never learn anything. Challenges are opportunities to learn. An easy life teaches you absolutely nothing. Living on your own figuring out your bills and your life will be challenging, but it will definitely lead to you being a strong man and less of a little boy who is always walking around talking about, \"Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!\"\u00a0 \n \n \nI say this with all the love in my heart. Love that you will see a lot more of, once you move out of my house! \n \n \n* \nLike this.

{"date": "Monday, May 25, 2015", "body": "\n \nI have been plagued all day long with eight questions. Eight questions asked over and over again, in a loop. All.Day.Long. \n \nIt's Monday, Memorial Day. Here in central Texas it has been storming all night and all day. There have been flash flood warnings. There have been bogus tornado warnings in our direct area at least 3 times today. \n \nAround noon Red asks me if his therapy appointment is on for today. I told him to call his therapist. His therapist calls back and says, \"Yes. I'm working today.\" \nWell, we have flash flood warnings and I'm not about to get into my car with Red to drive forty minutes to an appointment. I told him to let his therapist know we would not be coming due to the flooding in our area. \u00a0I \u00a0suggested that he ask him if they could just talk on the phone. That wasn't possible. \n \nSo then it began, the questions. The same questions that he has been asking for months. The same questions that I have answered backwards, forwards and upside down. The same questions that he has asked countless other resources and has received again, basically the same answers. \n \nHe followed me around all day long asking these questions. \nI answered them once. \nI hummed, \"Kumbaya.\" \nI wrote my own version of it: \n \n Come on by Lord!\u00a0 \n Come on by.\u00a0 \n I'm about to\u00a0 \n start to cry. \n Come on by Lord.\u00a0 \n Come on by.\u00a0 \n Oh Lord!\u00a0 \n Come on by. \n Ain't got no secrets Lord. \n Ain't got no lies \n I'm about to\u00a0 \n start to cry.\u00a0 \n Give me peace Lord.\u00a0 \n Help me out. \n I need you Lord\u00a0 \n Without a doubt!\u00a0 \n Come on by Lord!\u00a0 \n Come on by! \n Oh Lord! \n Come on by. \n \nI sang. \nI colored in my coloring book. \nI ignored. \nHe continued for hours. \n \nFinally, I made him write the questions down. I answered each of them in writing. \n \n1) How can I buy equipment if I have to pay gas and car insurance if I had a car? \n You can only buy equipment when you make extra money. Your job and disability can help pay for your life, including a car or transportation.\u00a0 \n \n2) Can I still save up to buy equipment if I had an apartment and a car? \n If you have an apartment, you can only buy equipment if make extra money from video editing or working more hours. You can only buy things when you have extra money after all of your life expenses are paid.\u00a0 \n \n3) Do I have to pay insurance if I had a car when I\u2019m living with you guys? \n We will only help you with car insurance if you don\u2019t have enough money to pay it yourself from your job. We will only help you when you have no other resources for money. We will not pay your bills so that you can keep buying equipment.\u00a0 \n \n4) What number can I call when I\u2019m having problems at home? \n I don\u2019t have a number for you to call. You can ask your case manager if she has a number for you to call from home. \n \n5) Do you like to push my buttons? \n I use jokes and laughter when you are trying to push my buttons. I joke around when my nerves are shot to hell, instead of yelling at you.\u00a0 \n \n6) Do you hate me? \n I do not hate you. I HATE YOUR BEHAVIOR! \n \n7) Why do I have to have a hard life and not get along with my family? \n You cannot continue to stress me out all of the time and live here. I am no longer obligated to have you in my house if my health and sanity are in danger. \u00a0 \n \n8) Do you want my life to be horrible and to ruin my life? \n I want your life to be good. I want you to be independent. I want to live in peace. Your life being good does not depend on THINGS that you BUY such as equipment. THINGS do not make you happy. You are never happy even when you buy things for more than a few minutes. What makes you happy comes from your relationship with God and from helping others. You also seem happy when you are with friends and your girlfriend or anyone  other than this family ! You are NEVER happy when you are in this house unless your friends or girlfriend is here. I can not make you happy. \u00a0 \n \nThe END \n \nTen minutes later, he was back at my bedroom door. \nI need to talk to you. \nI need to see you. \nHe knocked, louder and louder.  \n \nI get it. \nAnxiety. \nO.K.  \nI can not help him anymore. \nIt feels like he is trying to drive me crazy and he's doing a bang up job. \nIt's 9 p.m. \nI have heartburn. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/05/the-questions.html", "title": "\nThe Questions \n"},
{"date": "Friday, June 5, 2015", "body": "\n \nIt must be a miserable thing when the world doesn't work according to the way you think it should as in,  it should really revolve around you.  \u00a0Work schedules should be convenient for your need for extra sleep or lazing about the house as you please. Yet, you should have all of the money necessary for whatever your pleasure. \n \nPeople should be at your beck and call -waiting by the phone to find out what you need. \u00a0Since they have cell phones, they should be able to answer your call 24/7. \u00a0When they answer, they should tell you exactly what you want to hear. You don't want to hear what is truth for the rest of the world. That does not apply to you. The reality that the rest of the world lives by is far to inconvenient for you to deal with. \n \n \n One of the thousands of text message conversations with Red \n \n \nWhile we're at it, let's face it, other people really should not have needs or feelings if they disrupt your needs being met at every second of the day. Other people should never be tired or sick. \u00a0Why should they need any rest? Why can't they be available 24/7 to answer your every question and listen to your every thought for the 9 millionth time. Too tired to chauffeur you around? That's ridiculous! All you have to do is sit there and push the pedal. How hard could that be? It's not going to kill you. Of course, this begs the question, How would you know since  YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT?! \n \nWhy on earth would parents need to go on a date or hang out with their friends? Why can't they just be there for you in case you need someone to yell at? \n \n Know anyone who thinks this way? \n \nWell in my last post, \" A Brilliant Mind ,\"\u00a0Red found out that his hours at work had been reduced from 20 to 10 hours per week. I was not happy because that would give him too much time on his hands to sit around the house, idle, bored, inevitably bugging the crap out of me. \n \nHis brilliant mind told him that the solution was for  us  to reduce the amount of rent he pays.  So NOT Happening Dude! \n \nThe rants and rages went on for days. \n \nHe spoke to his Adult Transition teacher about it. She suggested the same thing I did. That he open up his availability at work so they would give him more hours. \u00a0He had his availability pretty limited to what would be convenient for him because after all, he needs time to his self ...so that he can be bored and bug the shit out of everyone in this house. \n \nHe was livid when he came home from the meeting with his teacher! \n\"She made me put down that I want to work on Saturdays! She made me do it! If I didn't do it, she was going to yell at me! I'm afraid of her, so I just did it!\"  \nThis went on all day long! \n \nLater that evening, he spoke on the phone with another adult mentor who gave him the same story and advice that his teacher did. He listened but was not happy.  \n \nThe following day he met with his Occupational Therapist. \u00a0She is a very soft spoken, \u00a0lovely woman who has lots of experience with teenagers and young adults with various abilities. She also has had personal experience with her own children who had special needs. (They are now adults and all out of her house.) \u00a0She wrote me an e-mail after their appointment: \n \n\"My commits to him regarding his work decision. \n You are the one who must live with the decisions you make. \n Less hours is less money. \u00a0You\u2019ll need to adjust for that. \n Life is not predictable, you need to learn to practice flexibility. \u00a0 \n Have faith in yourself to handle it. \n \nHe got upset with me a few times, face flushing, biting his lip, and tears in his eyes. \u00a0He held it together, took some deep breaths and calmed himself. \u00a0I was proud of the control he managed. \u00a0He was able to reflect,  If\u00a0my Mom had just said that to me, I\u2019d probably be yelling about now. \nHe\u2019s starting to show some insights and maturity. \" \n \nHe held back with her, but continued to give  me  hell for several days. \u00a0He hates change! It brings about fear and anxiety. \u00a0It just really pisses him off that the world doesn't work perfectly, according to his plans. \n \nChanges happen and you have to roll with them, but that feels impossible for him. He needs to work through all of that, mostly by yelling at me! \n \nHe did however, keep his additional hours of availability for work open. When he received his new schedule for next week, he was scheduled for additional hours, consistently, in the mornings. \u00a0 No Saturdays ...yet!   \n \nHe was sick with a pretty bad sore throat the day he got the new schedule. He seemed to take it all in stride, keeping a very calm demeanor. Either that or his throat was hurting so bad, he didn't want to scream.

{"date": "Sunday, July 19, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n \n Photo Credit: Genius.com  \n \n \u201cLife is not a bed of roses, but at least there is a bed.\u201d -my personal Facebook status one of the nights Red was away.\u00a0 \n \n The peace in the house is a good thing. The fact that I\u2019m not running around town like a chicken with her head cut-off is nice. The breathing and thinking space is a welcome change. However, it\u2019s been replaced by worry about where he is.  How is he feeling? What happens next? Why does my child have to struggle so much? Why can't he just be happy?\u00a0 \n \n He actually asked me that question during a phone call the other day, \u201cWhy does my life have to be so hard?\u201d Of course, I have no answer.  Why does MY life have to be so hard? Why are many other people\u2019s lives much harder? Why can't I plan a vacation this summer because I'm here dealing with this heavy shit and I don't know when the nightmare will end?\u00a0 \n \n Yesterday was the darkest day I have experienced since, I can\u2019t remember when. As a matter of fact, I have to say that this time period in Red\u2019s life has been one of the most difficult periods \u2026ever, in raising hm. \u00a0He\u2019s like a bull in china shop. He\u2019s very big, strong, stubborn, hateful even. \u00a0He is an adult by definition, but a child in maturity and decision making ability. There is no taming him into what I want him to be. He is fighting me every step of the way. \u00a0And of course, I\u2019m not the most intimidating bullfighter that the world has ever seen. He knows my weak spots and he knows very well how to play the game of making me think that he can\u2019t help certain behaviors when he is actually in complete control. He's been playing this game for so long, he knows how to use his autism as a weapon in his arsenal.\u00a0 \n \n We had a family therapy session a few days ago. My child walked in (yes I know he\u2019s almost 20) \u00a0looking tired and wounded. He was visibly anxious, worried, his legs shaking back and forth, back and forth. During the session he went from beginning to take some responsibility for his behavior and actions, and then back tracking \u2014blaming everything on us. \u00a0 \n \n It was the hardest thing ever to walk out the door and leave one of my limbs behind. As my husband said, \u201cHe\u2019s not a baby. This is adult real life. We can\u2019t protect him from everything. He needs to see the reality of life.\u201d I did not want to hear his words of freakin\u2019 wisdom. \u00a0I just wanted to cry from the depths of my soul without listening to reason. \u201cDon\u2019t try to fix it. Just don\u2019t. You can\u2019t,\u201d I said.  Just let me feel this pain. \u00a0You can\u2019t take it away. You can\u2019t make it better with your practicality and rational thought.  I knew he was right, but for me, in that moment, none of it mattered. \u00a0All I could see is my child \u2026a part of me, in pain. I saw desperation, confusion, discomfort, anxiety and I physically felt all of it. \u00a0And the worst part, is there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. Nothing.\u00a0 \n \n We checked him in to what appeared to be a lovely facility. The building was clean and relatively new, located on a quiet oak tree-lined campus on a few acres of property. The nurse who did our intake assessment was tuned in, helpful and professional. \u00a0You know how some people can give you the feeling that they are just doing a job and don\u2019t give a shit about you. \u00a0They look through you instead of at you. \u00a0Well, I didn\u2019t get that energy from her. It was like she saw me. She saw him and understood what our family has been dealing with.\u00a0 \n \n Only after my first visit to see him did I realize that even though the facility was lovely, the pain experienced inside those walls, was anything but. It was life. It was cruel, adult reality. There were other people there who were dealing with their own monsters and skeletons and it just wasn't pretty.\u00a0 \n \n When I finally made the decision to move forward with getting some much needed help for Red, I was exhausted by the behaviors we had been dealing with over the past few years really. \u00a0I always wondered what was really him and what behavior was exacerbated by the medications. \u00a0Did he even really need everything that he's taking? It was my dream to actually take him off of everything and start over. \u00a0I\u2019m not a doctor, but sometimes I play one in real life. I read and research like a medical student and I feel like I know my boy better than any doctor ever will. \u00a0Sometimes, I think I know him better than he knows himself. \u00a0He\u2019s not always in tuned with his body. \u00a0I\u2019ve had to teach him to pay attention to how his body is feeling and reacting and that\u2019s still a process.\u00a0 \n \n (By the way, I urge you -if you don't go for guardianship of your young adult on the spectrum, at least attempt to get Power of Attorney, especially Medical, so that you can be involved in helping them make the best decisions for themselves. \u00a0It's much cheaper and easier to attain than full guardianship. \u00a0Personally, I feel that it gives them more dignity than taking away all of their rights. Of course, there are cases where guardianship is the only choice.)\u00a0 \n \n I had talked myself out of it, and back into moving forward a million times. A huge part of me felt relieved to finally be addressing his medication issues in a controlled, safe environment. I hoped that some more intensive therapy would help him to see his life more clearly. He\u2019s been incapacitated by fear and anxiety, which was showing up as anger, disruption and disdain for our family. \u00a0Knowing that I was probably (key word  probably ) \u00a0doing the right thing, didn\u2019t make watching the process any easier.\u00a0 \n \n I am a creature of habit and comfort. I have been described in the past as being like a cat. I love to cuddle up all by myself, in my bed, on a comfy chair, in a hammock or wherever. I take my down pillow to most places that I spend the night. I even have a favorite travel blanket that goes with me when I\u2019m away from home. My home is not luxurious by far, but it is quite comfortable. \u00a0As much as Red makes me crazy, he is by definition an extension of me. \u00a0It wasn\u2019t easy to see him outside of his comfort zone, looking so tired, defeated and confused. However, it was the beginning of a process that we both needed to go through. Although the experience of having him away was extremely difficult and humbling for both of us, so far I will say that it was worth it.\u00a0 \n \n While he was away, he came to the realization that his life here at home is not as horrible as he has been perceiving it to be. \u00a0In fact, although he has challenges, he is really blessed beyond measure. \u00a0He met people who had much more serious, intense issues and problems than the ones that he faces. There were kids there who have suffered real abuse and have no loving family to return to. He saw other people\u2019s scary looking, sometimes violent meltdowns. It opened his eyes to see how his anger can look to others. \u00a0He was approached by someone in distress who began yelling and cursing at him. He did not react. He walked away. He was able to demonstrate restraint under extreme circumstances. He was able to hold it together in the midst of chaos. Surely if he can do that with a stranger, he is capable of doing it here at home with his brother. \n \n He had no outbursts of his own while he as there. The biggest issue was his anxiety and asking questions over and over again. \u00a0He was trying desperately to process the therapy and worries about his life and his future. He was social with the more kind hearted among the group. He \u00a0attended group therapy sessions and learned that lots of other people's lives suck way more than his does. He now seems to have a greater appreciation for what he has here at home \u2026at least for now. I realize that we are probably in a honeymoon period., but I\u2019ll take it and hope that it lasts. \u00a0 \n \n He's on contract with us. \u00a0He knows that certain behaviors will not be acceptable. He has proven that he can hold it together when he wants to, so he will be expected to do it here. \u00a0We're not buying the bullshit any longer. \u00a0In turn, as a family we have to all get better at showing him love and support \u2014being forgiving of annoying behaviors that are attributed to autism. \u00a0 \n \n When we met with one of the doctors on staff before we brought him home, \u00a0we were cautioned about bringing up group homes or moving out for a while. \u00a0Red is is feeling very abandoned and unloved. Actually, traumatized by it. His behavior has been pretty damned unloveable, but the doc sees this as his attempt to get attention by any means necessary. \u00a0 \n \n We are looking into additional therapy and supports that will help him to grow into a more independent adult, but not discussing every detail with him until we have things in place. He needs to worry less about the big picture, so that he can focus on just taking one step forward at a time, not becoming overwhelmed in the process. As a family we are trying to make him feel supported and loved,, while being firm about our expectations. It's likely that we will need therapy as a family to maintain that balance.\u00a0 \n \n Then of course, I need my own personal therapy.  \u00a0So basically, what I'm saying is we should just have a therapist move in with us.\u00a0 \n \n Thank you so much for so many of you, friends, family and readers who have reached out to let me know that I am supported and loved during the difficult times. Your phone calls, posts and private messages carried me through.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n * \n \n \n In this post I tried to express what we went through, while avoiding some of the details. \u00a0I am writing with Red's permission. He hopes to make a movie about his life some day, so that people will know what it's like face the challenges that he has faced.\u00a0 \n \n I love your comments and feel free to share this if you think it may help someone.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RX0aprFxyEA/Vavcz27V5cI/AAAAAAAAB98/sZlkZjZI9Us/s1600/roses060309.jpg", "http://genius.com/1944973/Denace-die-young/Lay-me-down-on-a-bed-of-roses"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/07/bed-of-roses.html", "title": "\nBed of Roses \n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 3, 2015", "body": "\n \n \nYou must know how rare it is for a teenage boy to voluntarily say, \u201cI love you mom.\"\u00a0 It is probably even more rare for a teenage boy with Aspergers to say it, unsolicited and actually mean it.\u00a0 Imagine my shock when it happened yesterday.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI picked him up after a rough day at school. He had been working on a group assignment over the past couple of weeks for his Spanish 3 class. Group assignments have never been a picnic for Blue. I\u2019m sure the same holds true for many people with Aspergers. There\u2019s all of that social communication that has to take place, along with compromise and listening to other people\u2019s ideas. This can prove to be quite difficult for a person who usually thinks that his ideas are best. However, collaborating with others is a skill that we all eventually have to use in life. \n \n \n \nI must say, he\u2019s come a long way working on group assignments. He took this project on like a champ. He was being a leader at the same time, willing to accept and actually solicit ideas from peers. Unfortunately, they were not all as accessible to do their parts of the project. \n \n \n \nThe blooper in the mix of this assignment was not arguing with peers, but dealing with a less than flexible teacher.  A teacher who I may punch in the face, if we ever cross paths.  Most of his assignment group are in the high school band. \u00a0They had an intense week of performances, competitions, travel and rehearsals. Blue having empathy for his overworked team mates, tried to take on the brunt of the work for the project. A task that was nearly impossible to do.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThey ran out of time and the project was not complete. The teacher supposedly said, she would give them extra time. She then later decided that their band obligations were \u201cnot her problem.\" So, she recanted her offer. At least this is the way that Blue describes the situation. Who knows what kind of miscommunication actually took place.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe called me that morning fuming about this teacher! What I noticed was that even though he was very upset and probably wanted to call her every name in the book, he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t yell, scream or curse. I think he may have said something like, \u201cI hope she gets run over by a truck.\u201d Not really \u2026I\u2019m the one who thought that. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nA few years ago, he would have been screaming, \u201cCome get me out of this hell hole! This teacher is a total bitch!\u201d \u00a0 \n \n \n \nInstead we did some quick problem solving... \n \n \n \n\u201cWho can you speak with to help you communicate with this teacher?\u201d I asked. \n \n\u201cI looked for my tracking teacher, but she\u2019s not in her room.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n\u201cDo you think you could find Ms. B.?\u201d (the Special Ed. Lead) I asked. \n \n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n\u201cTry to do that, I\u2019m sure she can help you communicate,\u201d I said. \n \n \n \nThis is progress for both of us. I wanted to call that teacher and give her a piece of my mind and a reminder about his I.E.P. and accommodations. Instead, I gave him the opportunity to advocate for himself, which is an important skill for our kids on the spectrum if they want to go to college.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI read a great article about preparing our kids for college yesterday on\u00a0 VOX.com \u00a0titled,\u00a0 High School Sets Up Autistic Kids to Fail In College -How to Fix It . The article clearly states that our kids need to be a part of their I.E.P. process and they must learn self-advocacy. Colleges won't even allow parents to have a say.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen I picked Blue up from school, he looked exhausted.  Thanks a lot daylight savings time and the teacher who gave my kid a tough time.\u00a0 \n \n \" How did everything go? Any solutions?\" \u00a0I asked. \n \nHe explained that Ms. B. e-mailed the teacher to make sure that his I.E.P. would be followed. However, after school he had a \u201cdifficult conversation\u201d with the Spanish teacher. \u201cIt was really draining to talk to her,\u201d he said.\u00a0 \n \n \n Blue and Me in Malibu Summer, 2015 \n \n \n \n OMG! I was so proud! He handled things calmly!\u00a0 \n \nAs we drove to Starbucks so that he could work on homework he said, out of nowhere, \u201cI love you mom.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n What? *Tears  \u00a0 \n \n\u201cWhat made you say that?\" I asked, calmly, trying to act like this was not a huge deal.\u00a0 \n \n\u201cI just appreciate that you\u2019re always on my side.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n *More tears.\u00a0 \n \n\u201cI always will be son.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Pow! Take that stupid Spanish teacher! Thanks to your inflexibility and trying to bully my kid. I got an unsolicited, \u201cI love you!\u201d Bam!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n*No teachers were injured or cursed out as a result of this story. In fact, I may not punch her in the face after all. I may just do the kind, Christian thing and say, \" Thank you for being difficult. The result was fabulous dahling.\" \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8594375/high-school-sets-up-autistic-kids-to-fail-in-college-heres-how-to-fix", "http://www.vox.com/2015/5/14/8594375/high-school-sets-up-autistic-kids-to-fail-in-college-heres-how-to-fix", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iYrEXJNW75g/VjjqKmjPkxI/AAAAAAAACBo/t7S_t9LqkjQ/s1600/11811436_856867601056148_5290013418540938537_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/11/i-love-you-mom.html", "title": "\n\"I love you mom.\" \n"},
{"date": "Monday, January 4, 2016", "body": "\n \n 2015 was a whirlwind of drama and change   for my family .  The biggest change being the fact that Red has moved out of the house and into a supported living environment. (That's my fancy name for group home ...that I don't like the sound of.)  \n \n \nHe loves it one day and he hates it the next. Mostly, I think he's okay with it, but he loves to make me believe that he is miserable. \u00a0He has a special talent for playing on my emotions and I have a special talent for allowing him to do it. I'm working on it, but it's not a simple habit to break. \n \nThe truth is, there is no ideal situation for him and if there is, I haven't been able to find it yet. There was no plastic bubble to move him into that would protect him from all of the trouble that comes along with learning to grow up and become a responsible adult. He doesn't have the skill set to live on his own, yet. I knew that getting along with roommates would not be easy for him, but I had a feeling that it would be better than the way he gets along with us. And so it is. He doesn't have any huge problems there. He is mostly compliant with staff. He likes his housemates for the most part. He thinks the staff is lazy. But hey, that should make him feel more at home, right? It's not the perfect or ideal situation, but it's a start and it's what we have to do for now. \n \n Over the summer\u00a0both of us had come pretty close to the brink of insanity,  one of us a little closer than the other. \u00a0The level of intense feelings, emotions and behaviors had rendered me pretty close to incapacitated. I was unable to think clearly. I couldn't sleep and had little to no appetite. I found myself wandering through the days just trying to maintain my composure, while at the same time, trying to contain the explosions between the boys. I was like a zombie walking through a minefield. \u00a0Thank God that Blue is so independent, because I was basically parenting him on auto-pilot. \n \n \n \nThe good news is, that near breakdown this summer made my husband realize that he was about to lose me to the dark side of the force, so he sent me away with Blue for 2 weeks to California. I was nervous about taking Blue. I thought we may end up killing each other, but we actually had a good time, relaxing, bonding, spending time with family and friends. The adolescent Blue at age 16, is mellowing out quite a bit and can be quite enjoyable to be around, especially sans the stress of his demanding brother. \n \n Blue has really come into himself in 2015.  He has grown immensely. He is handling school extremely well, even when working with difficult teachers and peers. \u00a0He has been able to advocate for himself and pull through with excellent grades. He was inducted into the National Honor Society. He continues to run the club that he started for those who may not feel as included as their typical peers. He is developing more relationships with peers. \u00a0He even went on his first semi-date (with a girl that he likes, but won't date, because he's not ready to deal with all of the drama that comes with high school relationships). He has such a mature outlook on life. He makes me proud on a daily basis. \n \n I started seeing a wonderful therapist this year.  I am absolutely, over the moon, happy about the fact that I am finally seeing someone for ME! I have been driving the boys around to therapy for years, while knowing damn well I needed to see someone for myself. Therapy is helping me to come to terms with all of these changes and is helping me get through the post traumatic stress of living in total chaos for so long. \n \nI have some battle scars that I am working to heal. I have given so much, for so long. \u00a0At times now, I find myself wanting to totally retreat and not give anyone anything. \u00a0I am often resentful when my family asks me to do anything for them especially, things that I know they can do for themselves (adults, who I have spoiled, especially my mother). I am also cutting back on what I am willing to do for Blue, simply because I want him to be able to leave this house and go to college without being so dependent on me. \u00a0So far, my therapist has been excellent at helping me work through this. \n \n \n \n The transition into adulthood is not just a transition for Red.  \u00a0It's a big transition for me. \u00a0I am trying to let go of control when it comes to his life even though he doesn't want me to. \u00a0I am \u00a0pushing him to use his resources (and he has many).  \n \nI no longer attend every meeting, doctors and therapy appointments, nor do I transport him to these appointments. I do still have to do some advocacy and coordinate things from behind the scenes. \u00a0Some of the staff from the agency that runs the group home leave quite a bit to be desired. \u00a0I however, am not the one to try to get over on. I try to make sure that they do what they're supposed to do so that he gets what he needs. I work in the background, \u00a0so that I'm not as much of a presence in his life. I feel awful for some of the clients who have no one to really speak for them, because in this world of services for those with disabilities, you only get what you scream for. \n \n The most difficult thing is trying to maintain healthy boundaries between myself and Red.  \u00a0He makes this so hard with his incessant phone calls and text messages. \u00a0I keep my phone on silent most of the time. \u00a0I had to put him on a phone schedule/contract just to cut down the number of phone calls. \u00a0It's working ...mostly. He has cut way back on the calls and mostly follows the schedule, unless he gets angry and anxious about something. \u00a0I only answer his calls at our designated time. \u00a0I will just ignore the call, or text him saying \"I will talk to you at our appointed time.\" \n \nLately, I have noticed that slowly he is pushing the boundaries again. \u00a0When we do talk, he doesn't want to hang up. Ever! He wants to talk about the same negative complaints, which eventually send him spiraling and drive me to NOT want to answer the phone the next time he calls. \u00a0Again, I begin to feel myself being held prisoner by the calls, just like I did here at home when he would refuse to walk away or leave my room.  \n \nThere's that self-imposed, motherly guilt that makes me NOT want to leave him all alone, hanging in the wind, feeling like no one cares about him. On the other side of that, is the feeling of resentment. \u00a0There's that whisper, (or maybe it's a scream) that says, \"I don't want to do this! I don't want to talk to him! This is not how I want to be spending my time! And most of all, this is not healthy for either one of us!\" He needs to build a life that does not include talking to mommy multiple times a day. I have tried to get his psychologist to work with him on this, but so far ...little to no progress. \n \n On a more positive note, one of the biggest highlights of 2015 was our trip to the big island of Kona, Hawaii.  \u00a0(During which time I took absolutely zero phone calls from Red.) \u00a0My husband won the all expenses paid trip by being in the top 1% of the sales force for his company. \u00a0He works for an international corporation, so there were people in attendance from all over the world, India, South Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and of course, the U.S. There were 200 winners and among them, only 3 were African-American. \u00a0I may be a little biased, but I felt like my husband was the biggest winner on the island.  \n \nWe put together a P.R. package before he was selected, about our life raising the boys, the advocacy and work that I do on this blog and my online support groups for parents of children with autism. I'm going to say, that our work/life balance package, was what put him over the top for the win. The company also gave a lot of credit to the partners and spouses of all of the winners. Thus, making us feel like the sacrifice of our partners time was worth it. \n \n \n \u00a0 \nThe trip was the most relaxing vacation of my life, probably because it came at a time where we needed it more than ever. \u00a0This life of raising two boys with special needs and taking care of my mom \u00a0is extremely hard on a marriage. \u00a0Both of us were on the verge of breaking down after a tumultuous year with our family. \n \nThe sound of the ocean was healing to my soul. \u00a0If I could have taken it back home with me, I would have. And let me tell you, it was almost impossible for me to leave it behind. \n \n \nEverything was first class all the way, from the air travel, to our ocean front room at the Four Seasons Resort, where all of the staff knew my favorite drink and kept them coming. We were treated like royalty while we were there, right down to the private Keith Urban, concert on our final night. \n \n \n \n \nAs we sat on the quiet beach listening to the waves crash against the coast I said to my husband, \"Everything has been so crazy for so long, this almost seems too good to be true. Like when is the bottom going to fall out?  When is someone going to step up and say, April Fools! We were just kidding! Good things like this don't happen to folks like you .\" \n \nIt never happened. The trip was perfect and apparently, we did deserve it. \n \n \n \np.s. I love your comments!

{"date": "Sunday, January 24, 2016", "body": "\n \nEarlier this week, my father passed away. I've been trying to prepare myself for his death for the past couple of years. But are we ever really prepared? He was 86 years old, diabetic, stubborn and was also recently diagnosed with cancer. \n \nI use the term stubborn because even though his health has not been the best, he refused to listen to doctors, health-care providers and his children. \u00a0He has been in and out of the hospital dozens of times, recently. Sometimes, he would refuse to stay in the hospital and would check himself out against doctor's orders. Other times, he would refuse to leave the hospital, when they said he was stable enough to go home or they recommended a skilled nursing environment. \n \nHe lived life on his own terms, despite the challenges that he faced. \u00a0I can't be mad at him. It was his life to live however he saw fit. If you follow me on Facebook, you may have read some of the crazy stories that I've written about him over the past few years. \n \nHis friends called him\u00a0 Hollywood . Even though he was born a poor boy in Arkansas, and raised in St. Louis, Missouri, his personality was larger than life in any of those towns. \u00a0He went on to make himself a success in the Hotel industry. \n \n \nI am still in the midst of processing my feelings over his passing. I am trying my best to hold on to the good memories ...and there were many. I'm sure I will write more about him later. \n \nToday, I thought I would share some thoughts from my son Blue about his feelings over his grandfather's passing. \u00a0He wrote this as a Facebook status a few days ago. He is allowing me to share it again here. Let's go inside the mind of a pretty special teenager with Aspergers... \n \n \"My grandfather has passed away as of Tuesday morning. (January 19, 2016). \u00a0For the past two days I've tried figuring out what I wanted to say and now I know what to say. I never formed a huge bond with him. I only saw him once every year. I could never feel as much pain as my mother or all of her siblings are feeling. \n \n \n \n Blue & Grandfather, August, 2015 \n \nI  last saw him this past summer and to be honest, it was probably one of the best times I had with him. I wish I could have talked to him one more time before he passed.\u00a0 \n \n Although this tragic event has transpired, I was already experiencing stress for the past few weeks, with me getting back to school, starting Drivers Education, a scandal with one of my teachers, and me not getting along with my father. I changed my medication this past November and I have slowly been changing. I am more self-aware, more agitated and more stressed out. The good news is, I am also not gaining weight anymore.\u00a0 \n \n With so many things transpiring one after another, I have fallen behind in my school work and I am less focused on my daily tasks. Now, my grandfather has passed. What am I gonna do?\u00a0 \n   Right now, one thing is important to me. Life has been shouting it in my head,  I need to be a better and stronger person. I need to be smarter. I need to be a better friend to everyone, a more loving person, a more moral person. I need to work harder.\u00a0 \n \n \n Blue & Grandfather, on a visit to his school for lunch.\u00a0 \n \n \n With everything going on I am becoming closer to everyone in my life, friends, family and even people at school. That's all I care about now, not thinking of myself as much but being there for everyone. I know that would make my grandfather proud. \u00a0I will eventually get past all of this stress because every situation is temporary. I just want \u00a0my family and friends to know that I love and care about all of you. You all mean a lot to me.

{"date": "Friday, November 13, 2015", "body": "\n \nIn recent weeks since my son \u00a0 moved out of the house \u00a0, I\u2019ve gone through a range of emotions\u2026 \nfrom fear to relief, \nhappiness to emptiness, \nanger to empathy. \nMoments of feeling pissed off, \nresentful, \nused \nand invaded\u2026 \nto moments of feeling unusually normal. \nI s that even a thing? Unusually normal? \nIt must be, because I\u2019ve felt it. \n \nWhen the house is eerily quiet, I think to myself,  Wow! This must be how normal people feel in their own homes \u2026like all the time or at least, often.\u00a0 \nI can\u2019t believe I lived in total chaos for so many years. \n This quiet is weird, heavenly, but weird . \n \nI\u2019ve been able to watch some of my favorite television shows. I'm actually all caught up on \"Scandal.\" \nI even watched one of my favorite political talk shows and was actually able to follow along and keep up with what was being said, without thinking to myself,  Yada, yada, yada. Who the f*#% cares? I got my own problems. \n \nI spent a couple of Saturday afternoons watching  back to back  movies on HBO, without interruption. Well, Blue watched some of them with me so there was his occasional question, but not intentional disruption. (Don't tell him I told you, but he even watched \"The Devil Wears Prada\" with me. )At first he protested. \"This is ridiculous! She's so mean.\"  Probably reminded him of his Spanish teacher.  But then, he would not leave the room until it was over. I loved every moment of him watching with me. \n \nWhen Red was here, if the focus was not on him, he found a way to make it so. He would come into the room and say something like, \u201cWhy are you watching this crap?\u201d Or he would just start talking about his subject of interest, without any consideration for what was happening in the room before he walked in. \n \nA quiet, peaceful home, watching television, reading  real  books \u2014these are simple pleasures that most people take for granted. \nThese simple things I have not been able to do for years, at least within the comfort of my own home, with any sense of regularity. \n \nI shared some of these feelings in therapy today.  Have I told you how much I love my therapist?\u00a0 \nShe makes me think about myself for a change. We dive into my feelings and she redirects me from judging myself. Instead, she helps me to congratulate myself for both simple and extremely complex things that I have accomplished. She helps me to acknowledge the transition that I'm going through. How I'm trying to let go of control over his life after so many years of pulling all of the strings and being the fixer. \n \nShe encourages me to take care or myself \u2014to reconnect with who I am, other than servant to others. She has confirmed what I already knew, I\u2019m living with P.T.S.D (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). I am recuperating from years of what was to a degree, an abusive relationship. \n \nToday, she said something quite profound. \u201cInstead of feeling guilty because you\u2019re finally having some peace, doing things for yourself after all of these years, how about you look at it like,  you\u2019re finally showing yourself some compassion. \u201d \n \nAll of these years, I\u2019ve talked about needing therapy for myself, while I was too busy making sure that everyone else got every kind of therapy available to man. \nMy oxygen mask was withered, frayed, all cracked up. \nThere was no steady flow of air. \nI was gasping, while everyone else was breathing clearly. \n \nWell, not anymore. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/11/unusually-normal.html", "title": "\nUnusually Normal \n"},
{"date": "Monday, February 8, 2016", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nFor so many years I didn't make the time for therapy. It was yet another one of those things that I put on the back burner while I was too busy raising my children, taking them to all kinds of therapy.\u00a0 \n \nNow, I feel like a kid in a candy store every time I pull up to my therapist's office. Me time! Woo hoo! I'm gonna get sane. (In my sing-song\u00a0voice.)  \n \n \nTherapy is helping me to\u00a0put self-care on the top of my list. \u00a0It helps me remember to keep the boundaries that were erased by years of raising two children who demanded that their needs be met immediately.\u00a0 \n \nThe other day, I realized that I still find myself holding pee.\u00a0I have been conditioned to believe that I just don't have time. I always had to be in a hurry to do something for someone, to pick someone up or drop someone off somewhere, to make sure that all of their basic needs were met before I met my own. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI confess for years, while in the thick of raising my children, I didn't take showers as often as I should have. I always felt like I had to choose how to spend my free time. Should I write or take a shower? Should I take a nap or take a \u00a0long hot bath? Should I eat or take a shower? But mostly, should I get some more sleep? I was always behind on sleep.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI stepped into my therapist's office a few months ago, a blithering mess from the stress of dealing with Red\u2019s transition into adulthood and out of my house. It turns out that constantly being the diffuser of explosions in your home can fry your nerves and kill a few brain cells.\u00a0 \n \nEven when there wasn\u2019t an explosion, I was always preparing for one. I could hear screams in my dreams. When it was quiet, I was wondering why and when the quiet would be jarringly interrupted. If I was behind my closed bedroom door, who would burst through it, or start banging on it at any given moment. I hear footsteps. Are they coming towards me? Shit! \n \n \nBeing a mother for me meant years of trying my best to keep everyone in my house happy or at least from being sad,\u00a0depressed and angry which of course, was impossible, not to mention, not my job. Making others happy was often at the expense of the things I wanted to do that would make me happy. Are mothers entitled to be happy or is that something you give up in labor and delivery? \n \n \nThat people pleaser in me spilled over into other areas of my life. I'm like Joy from the movie \"Inside Out.\" \u00a0I want to be happy. I want my friends to be happy. I want my siblings and my parents to be happy. I certainly do not like upsetting or disappointing them. \u00a0Confrontation must be avoided at all cost. I don\u2019t enjoy arguing. I live with people who seem to live for it. I don\u2019t like being mad at people, and I certainly don\u2019t want people mad at me. When you live with constant bickering and fighting, you try to avoid conflict in other areas of life.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nThe trouble with all of that is that I found myself constantly giving myself away, one little piece at a time until there was nothing left besides stress, anger and resentment. I found myself always doing things I didn\u2019t want to do. I was slowly losing my mind and becoming an anxious wreck, always taking on everyone else's negative energy and problems. \n \nI am taking some of that power back. I am learning to say, \"No. I'm not doing that.\" \n \n \nWhen my father passed away two weeks ago, my husband volunteered us to do the obituary for the memorial service. He also tried to get us involved in setting up some kind of scholarship fund. I was like, 'Hell\u00a0 no! I don't have the energy for that.'\u00a0 You go right ahead\u00a0if you want to. I did the part of the obituary that I wanted to do. I did the research, and I wrote it. I wanted no parts of figuring out the layout. I didn\u2019t worry about how he waited\u00a0until the last minute to get it printed. It was his deal, not mine. I set a boundary for myself, and I stuck to it.\u00a0 \n \n \nWhen I got to L.A. for the memorial service, I didn\u2019t try to do my usual running around here and there and everywhere to see my friends. I let them come to see me at the memorial service. (It was really like a party, at a jazz club and bar, but that's a whole other story.) It was so wonderful seeing everyone, but when they all requested special get-togethers after the fact, I knew there was no way in hell I was going to do it. Sorry, friends. Red ruined that for you. I can\u2019t stretch myself too far anymore. I just don\u2019t have it in me. Instead, I spent the time with my family. And I didn\u2019t even let that stress me out. If I couldn\u2019t see my siblings at every single possible moment, it was perfectly o.k. (Okay, I felt a little guilty the day I didn\u2019t make it down to my dad\u2019s apartment to finish cleaning it out.) I was a little pissed that my husband and son were moving too damned slow to make it happen. (But, I digress.) The point is, the world did not end because I did not stretch myself too far.\u00a0 \n \nLast night when Blue started having a meltdown because he was unable to register for accommodations for the S.A.T. Dad comes into the room and as usual, starts adding fuel to the fire. Ah ah ah! Pump the breaks. Boundaries. I did not allow myself to get sucked into their crap. The difficulty they have communicating right now is THEIR deal, not mine. I can\u2019t fix it. I can\u2019t always diffuse it. I certainly can not take it all on and allow it to drain my energy. They are going to have to work their shit out\u2026or not. I can\u2019t do it for them.\u00a0 I will not do it for them.\u00a0 \n \n \n Stolen from my friend Elizabeth Gilbert's FB page. \n \n \nI am learning, better late than never to step back, to let go, to not engage, diffuse and try to fix every problem.\u00a0 \n \nI have worked double overtime for years. For now, I don't have to spend every moment doing something on my never ending to-do list. I have the right to: \n \n \n \n have compassion for myself. \n set and keep my boundaries.\u00a0 \n take time for me and not feel the least bit guilty about it.\u00a0 \n allow myself time to grieve for my father in whatever way I need to. (Which may include wearing black around the house, so that people will remember to leave me the f8#% alone.)\u00a0 \n allow myself time to adjust to the transition of letting Red go. Allow him to grow into adulthood, without me holding his hand along every step of the way.\u00a0 \n I can just be.\u00a0 \n I can take a long, hot, showers and not get out until the hot water runs out.\u00a0 \n I can pee every time my bladder says I need to.\u00a0 \n I can be an individual, not just a mom, a wife, a friend, a sibling, daughter, and caregiver.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMost of all, grown-ass folk who can do for themselves should. \u00a0My family is now full of grown-folk, including the soon to be 17-year-old, who never wants to be told what to do. \n \n \nIt's my hope that at least one person will read this, take just one step back and save yourself from extinction.\u00a0 \n \nBe well or at least, half-way sane.\u00a0 \n \n~Karen\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0jdWU1vTsr4/VrjO0XFFodI/AAAAAAAACj0/lWQMQcP1ArM/s1600/12565497_935893613153546_6586788981099894342_n.jpg", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-e9UOfd2IOAA/VrUZSQdqTFI/AAAAAAAACgo/iqNeFXB876I/s1600/1910491_956721147743334_3231958357147882133_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-right-to-pee.html", "title": "\nThe Right to Pee \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, March 9, 2016", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \nA couple of months ago, in a quiet moment between emergency phone calls ( which\u00a0are not really emergencies)  from Red, my 20-year-old son, I thought to myself, \"I definitely can not die.\" \n \nHow will these boys survive? \n \nThere are so many subtle nuances of life they will never be able to figure\u00a0out on their own. \nNo one else will have the time or the patience o deal with them. \n \nWhat happens when they have to deal with a government agency or a health provider who simply is not doing their job?  Believe it or not, it happens.\u00a0 \n \nWill they be able to advocate for themselves? \n \nI spend so much time thinking outside of the box about how to solve problems for these young men of mine. \n \nI am in the background of their lives, flipping tables over to make sure that they get what they need. \n \nOver the years, \u00a0I have spent a lot of energy just making sure that providers, \u00a0teachers, and administrators are doing their jobs. Even now that Red is an adult, I'm still working with the group home agency, the Department of Rehabilitative Services, Medicaid, Social Security, our local mental health authority, and even the school district Adult Transition program. \n \nThe thing is with these agencies and programs is, if you don't ask, you don't receive. \u00a0If you're not aware of what's available, you get the bare minimum. If you don't know your rights, you can get screwed. \n \nIn the care, feeding and raising of these children, there are times when things are going so horribly wrong, I wonder if they will ever go right. \n \nThere are still times when all I can do is laugh, cry or have a drink or three. \n \nThere are times when I doubt myself as a\u00a0parent ...when I feel like I'm doing it all wrong. \n \nI have put so much effort into raising them and advocating for them to get\u00a0them the supports that they need to be successful, or to at least survive. \nMaybe I've done too much. \nMaybe I haven't done enough. \nI'm too soft. \nThey are running over me. \nThey are draining the fricken life out of me! \nI hate this job. \nI quit. \n \nThe truth is, the success or failure of your children is not all about how hard you tried as a parent. \nWe are a  part  of their success. \nWe are not their success or failure in total. \nUltimately, motivation for what they will do with their lives must come from within. \nA parent can only plant the seeds, water the plant and in my case, kick a few asses. \n \nWe can't walk in their shoes for them. \nWe can not be inside their heads for every choice that they make. \nWe can't always be there to whisper, or scream words of caution when they are about to make a stupid decision. \nSometimes, we have to sit by and watch them run in front of the moving train. \nIt's the hardest thing ever for a parent to do. \nWe have to let them fall and cheer them on as they get back up. \n \nWhen mental illness and autism are a part of the picture of your child's life, there are even more facets that we have no control over. \n \nMedication is one big toss up. \u00a0It will either help tremendously or send them further over the edge. I've seen both.  Have I told you how much I hate psychotropic medications, especially during puberty when their bodies are growing and changing? \u00a0 It's madness! But we are desperate to help them, by whatever means necessary. \n \nTherapy\u00a0often feels like a gigantic waste of time, energy, and money. Again, we're desperate. We will give anything and everything for the off chance that something will work. Some days, therapy feels like a big scam that we\u00a0buy into to give ourselves hope that behavior and communication will get better. \u00a0(One day, I will finish my post about ABA therapy, and how many headaches it gave me. I wanted to strangle our therapist.) \n \nWith each new therapy, new teacher, counselor, and mentor, we pray that our children will put two and two together and make four. \nIt could happen. \nWhat else can we do other than put our feet on the ground every day and keep moving forward, trying something, anything, everything, to help them make even incremental progress? \n \nWell today my friends, I see progress. \n \nRed has worked for the YMCA for the past two years after high school. \nWhen he was in the vocational program  in  high school, he could not get hired to save his own life! There were days, where he was just too far off on the deep end of anger and depression. He spent a great deal of his time engaging in arguments and conflict with job coaches instead of allowing them to help him. \n \nBecause of medication and a horrible diet, he had become excessively overweight. \u00a0This summer, he was so out of sorts. I \u00a0determined that most of the medications could not possibly be helping him. Two of them were definitely a part of the weight gain issue. We made some changes which at first, made things worse. \u00a0We went back to the drawing board, this time with another doctor. It was a painful process, but it was well worth it in the end. We were able to get the number of medications down to just two that seem to be helping him. \n \nAfter a prompt from his doctor and a combination of being on the right medications, he made some changes in his diet. \u00a0At first, we kind of forced him to start exercising. \u00a0Basically, it was like, we're not picking you up from the YMCA until you swim at least 10 laps. \n \nWhen he saw himself starting to drop weight, he decided to completely change his diet and start working out five days a week. He found an online program to follow, which taught him about advance meal prep, and high-intensity work outs to help him get fit. He became obsessed with it. These changes \u00a0have led to over 100 pounds of weight loss! \n \nRecently, when the YMCA was about to lay him off because they couldn't give him enough hours, with my prompt and his job coaches assistance, he found another job before the layoff could happen. He is now working at another major gym. \n \n \nSeveral months ago, we had to have him move out of our home and into a group home. It was abundantly clear that neither of us could survive much longer living under the same roof. Aside from his behavior in our house, deep inside I knew that he needed a nudge, or rather a swift kick,\u00a0to help him get the motivation to move forward into adulthood. \u00a0I hate to admit it, but the closer he was to his mommy, he saw absolutely no reason to grow up. \n \nNow, the boy who in high school, \u00a0could almost NEVER get there on time, is now getting himself to work for a shift that begins at six a.m.! The night before, he arranges his taxi ride to pick him up at 5:15 a.m. \n \nHe prepares himself for work before bed. \u00a0He arranges his bag with his clothes for working out after work, showering and changing so that he can go on to his 2nd job! Yes. He is volunteering at a local middle school helping special needs kids with Science and Physical Education. This is the middle school where he was once in the self-contained behavior program. \n \nSpeaking of showers\u00a0...his transition teacher has been able to get him on a shower and laundry schedule so that he will always be fresh and smelling good when he walks into one of his jobs! I tried for years to do this! He would never listen to me. \n \nWhen Red finished high school, he was sure that he could NEVER be successful in any college classes. \"I hate academics!\" he would say. In high school, he required a lot of one on one support to stay on track. \u00a0However, one of the things I had him do\u00a0while in High school, was work with other special needs students who had more challenges than he does. \u00a0I figure the best way to stop thinking and worrying about yourself, is to engage yourself in helping others. The special needs students loved him, and it did wonders for his self-esteem. \n \nThis lead to him deciding that this is what he would like to do with his life. He wants to others with special needs. Recently, \u00a0he earned his Paraprofessional Certification from our local community college! He hopes to be hired full-time this coming year as an Instructional Assistant in our local school district! Hence, he is volunteering now, in hopes to gain exposure and more experience so that he can ultimately become a full-time employee. \u00a0( Yeah. Another one of mama's ideas. ) \n \nHe still has a way to go towards independence. I still worry ...I still wonder if he will be able to make it on his own. \u00a0Living in that group home where things are less than ideal\u00a0has certainly helped with his motivation to want his own apartment. \u00a0He will probably still need a certain level of support no matter what, at least for the next few years. \n \nI pray that he will find an awesome roommate be able to get his own place soon. At least, that is his goal. \n \nMaybe someday, he will find a wife who will compliment his strengths and weaknesses.  \u00a0 \n Dear God, I\u00a0hope so! \n \nMeanwhile, I hope to graduate someday further into the background of his life, playing a much smaller role. I want to retire from motherhood. I daydream about this every single day.  Yeah. I know we can't really retire. I would at least like to take a sabbatical! \n \nI hope that I can die some day ...in peace. \n \nI still worry. \n \nI still wonder... \nWill he be able to make it on his own? \nWill he ever drive? \nWill he ever be able to navigate his life without my help? \n \nThere are still many \"what ifs.\" \n \nAt the same time... \nThere is progress. \nThere is hope. \n \n Did you enjoy this post?

It has that loving autism-mom, quirky sarcasm, exhaustion and a side order of humor about this crazy autism life, that I \u00a0love.\u00a0 \n Enjo y! \n \n \n \n \nIn the wonderful state of Minnesnowta, there are some hardcore, Eskimo-like, winter surviving people. We don't get too many snow days. If they shut down schools, it's Defcon 2. Well, we hit that on Tuesday and Wednesday this week. \n \nI'm talking early release, stuck in the house, stir crazy, iPads are dead cuz you won't let them charge, destroy the house, acting a fool, kill yo brother, have 20 meltdowns, autizzle to the nizzle, freak out, shove handfuls of chocolate down your esophagus (ok that was me), go all The Shining up in here type of days. \n \nThen we have Autism. \nLovely, lovely Autism. \nAutism NEEDS school. Like every single day. \nAutism needs structure, routine, and an Occupational therapist on hand. \nAutism hates snow days. \nSnow days, bad. \nSnow days Bring out the crazy. \nWinter gate causes Autism to go all nuclear and have an Autism meltdown. Nobody wants this. Cuz there ain't no meltdown, like an autism meltdown. Cuz an autism meltdown won't stop. (Thanks Master P for the inspiration). \nMy house looks like it was ransacked by looters looking for free TVs. \nA good bit of Monday was spent cleaning it up from the weekend. \nIf it was summer, they'd be outside swinging and half naked trampolining. (Donovan). \nBut it's winter so they are inside naked, trampolining all over my couch. \nToday they are back in school, and I am exhausted. \nI need to clean my war zone, but I'm sooo wiped out and running dangerously low on chocolate. \nAutism doesn't just affect the person who has it; \nAutism also affects those who do not. \nI have second hand Autism. \nThe moral of the story\u00a0is that autism and snow days don't mix. \nAutism is hard all the time, but on snow days, Autism is a punk ass bitch. \nThat is all. \nOff I go to clean the trenches. \nCarry on. \n \n Jamie lives near the metro area of Minneapolis Minnesota. She has three children on the spectrum. Donovan will be 15 in April, Gracie will be 10 in May, and Alex will be eight in May. She also has a three-month-old baby boy named Davin. \u00a0Jamie is in the process of writing a book called Autism-isms: My life on Autism Avenue.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2016", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nThe process of raising my boys feels like I\u2019ve already done the work of a lifetime. Red is now twenty-years-old and Blue is seventeen. \u00a0I think  maybe I should just retire now. I deserve it! \u00a0(I \u00a0fantasize about this ...a lot.)  The reality is\u00a0 the job of raising my children is  changing , but it\u2019s not over. It will  NEVER  be completely over, no matter how much I wish... \n   (Excuse me for a moment while I cry\u00a0into my glass of wine.) \n   Okay, \u00a0I'm back.\u00a0 \n \nWe are all at a point in our lives where we are going through a transition.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nRed is out of the house and though he has made tremendous progress, (in case you missed it, read about it here in the popular,\u00a0 \"I Can Not Die\" \u00a0post) I am still his nervous habit. When he gets anxious (which is often) he calls me. This can mean way too many phone calls to count on any given day. Even deflecting, turning the cell on silent and not answering each and every call, is still an energy drain. He's like a robocaller, \u00a0dialing one number to the next between the house, my cell, his dad\u2019s phone, his brother's phone ...it just goes on and on and on. \n I think he wants to make sure he is ALWAYS on my mind. Can we say -attention seeking?\u00a0 \n \nAs he transitions into becoming a responsible adult,\u00a0I try to be less of a presence in his life. I\u00a0 try to work more behind the scenes. I don\u2019t attend every meeting and appointment. It seems to help him speak up more when I am not there to be an extension of his own brain. \u00a0He may not be a full-time job for me anymore, but he is still a piece of work! \n \n \n \nBlue will be a senior next year and totally opposite of Red, he is already working on becoming independent. He wants me as far into the background of his life as possible! I think I may actually talk to him less than his older brother, even though we live in the same house. He entertains himself. \u00a0More often lately, he calls his friends for his lengthy discussions about how the world should work, according to Blue.\u00a0 Score for me!\u00a0 \n \nHe\u2019s doing a lot of drawing lately as a calming/coping mechanism. \u00a0At the same time, he is slowing down on the video gaming, which usually makes him end up feeling more anxious. He keeps his own schedule, makes his own plans, and even sets up his own appointments. He is driving his life forward academically and socially, and even politically. (He just participated in his first political protest with some kids from his high school). He now belongs to two clubs that meet after school; one that he created, and now a Computer Science Club. \u00a0 I am just the chauffeur and giver of money.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo as the boys transition, I think it\u2019s also time for me grow up too. There is a pull towards something more than making motherhood the center of my universe. I have the crazy mind of an artist. I feel a certain degree of gravity pulling me towards more creativity in my life. I have scratched this itch with writing this blog during those busiest years of raising my teenagers. I reaped the reward of expounding my creative energy\u00a0while also having my own therapeutic\u00a0outlet. Now, there are a few other creative projects that I would like to explore.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe role of mother, wife, my mother\u2019s daughter and caregiver, continue to command a great deal of my energy. However, with Red out of the house, things are a  little  more quiet for longer periods of time (in-between the phone calls, that is.) \n \nThe peace is allowing my inner voice to speak\u00a0to me more than ever.\u00a0 I'm starting to think of myself more as an individual with dreams, hopes, ambitions, likes, and dislikes.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI am spending more time inside my head (which sometimes can be dangerous). I have to admit, I spend \u00a0a lot of this time beating myself up with negative self-talk about what I am  not  doing or achieving, instead of celebrating what I have accomplished. I realize there are still countless\u00a0things-to-do, but I spend a lot of time juggling them all around in my mind\u00a0until I feel overwhelmed. \u00a0Ultimately, I end up achieving a microscopic amount of my full potential. \n \nEventually, I find myself falling back into the habit of doing all of the things for all of the people; \u00a0running them around to their appointments instead of tackling the little projects I want to complete for myself. I\u2019ve been doing that for so many years. It\u2019s not easy to lose the habit. \n \nI have caught myself a couple of times being asked to rearrange my appointments or plans, in order to take care of my family's appointments.  Uh, uh. It's not happening!  I'm learning to take care of myself. If I fall apart, they're all screwed.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOne of the thoughts I beat myself up with is how much time I waste in a day.\u00a0 My therapist and my closest girlfriends remind me, that I deserve some downtime after being completely stressed for so long. However, the quiet self-reflection makes me I feel like I\u2019m spending a little too much time standing around like a deer in the headlights.  Um\u2026which way should I go?  Instead of just moving \u2026forward.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIn quiet moments, I think about all of the parts of myself that I have let go of in the last few years\u00a0while I was swimming in a pool of crazy with Red. His last two years in the house were hellacious -with one disruption and eruption after the next. If he wasn\u2019t fighting with his brother, he was fighting with my mother. If he wasn\u2019t fighting with my mother, I was diffusing things between him and his father. It was a constant expulsion of energy! \n \n \n \nRecently, a post came up in my Facebook history that I wrote a year ago,\u00a0 \"Excuse Me While I Go Left\"  . \u00a0The following day I wrote \u00a0 \"The Script.\" \u00a0 After reading both of these I thought,  how did I NOTcompletely lose my mind? \u00a0 How did he make it to the age of 20 without either one of us being arrested?\u00a0 \n \nAs the dust has started to settle, and the fire after the war comes to a smolder, I reflect... \n \nYou made it through one of the most difficult battles of your life.  Now, what do YOU want to do? \n \nBetter yet, you spent years erasing the essence of yourself.  What are the things you DO NOT WANT to do anymore? \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI put together this list -the new philosophy for my life with the underlying mantra, \u201cTake care of Me.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI will not say the automatic yes.\u00a0 \n \nI will give myself time to think about it, and say NO when that is the right answer.\u00a0 \n \nI do not want to consistently put anyone else\u2019s needs and wants ahead of my own. \n \nI will pay attention to my thoughts and follow my instincts. \n \nI will make myself my priority. \n \nI will listen to my body when it says, \u201cI need rest, exercise or to see a doctor.\u201d\u00a0 \n \nI will not waste time with people, just for the sake of being around people. \n \nThere must be an emotional, spiritual connection. If there is no connection, I need to move on.\u00a0 \n \nI don\u2019t want to waste time \u2026period.\u00a0 \n \nI want to live my life with intention and purpose.\u00a0 \n \nAs a part of that intention, I will relax without guilt.\u00a0 \n \nI will enjoy the sound of the birds singing outside of my window. \nI will sit and just enjoy the breeze and the feel of sun on my skin. \nI will stop and take a selfie of my silver hair and share it whenever I want to! I earned every last one of them.\u00a0 \n \nI will smell the roses.\u00a0 \n \nI will just be \u2026as often as I possibly can.\u00a0 \n \nI want to see the ocean -often.\u00a0 \n \nI want to create memorable experiences.\u00a0 \n \nI want to be in service to other parents who are walking with me and behind me on this journey of raising special children.\u00a0 \n \nI will take the opportunity to make life better for someone else, but not at the expense of my own life. \n \nI want to live each day creatively.\u00a0 \n \nI will savor every quiet moment.\u00a0 \n \nI will make my home a sanctuary.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis philosophy is a work in progress, as I am. I give myself credit for doing a better job of taking care of myself. \nI now go to *yoga and therapy regularly. \n *Lies. Haven't been to yoga in two weeks! I'm going back! I swear!\u00a0 \nI bought and am actively using a  Passion Planner \u00a0to keep myself focused on my personal/creative desires, as well as the work of taking care of my family. \nI continue to work on showing myself the same kind of love and compassion that I have shown my children for all of these years. \nI am making myself a promise to work hard at following my own advice. I hope that you will join me. \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qA4i36l2wVg/VxfIGXPE9LI/AAAAAAAADwU/h7EcwHiVbLgdvaC5tpo9hm9ltH-F20rJACLcB/s1600/Inside%2Bher%2BHead%2B.jpg", "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uPAWZ7EMros/VxfIgUsO8kI/AAAAAAAADwY/Uzf-qcub4WAO-dLSyc9m-IXKMvuOZUVqACLcB/s1600/Take%2Ba%2BBreak.jpg", "http://www.passionplanner.com/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2016/04/adult-transition-for-mom.html", "title": "\nAdult Transition for Mom\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, October 28, 2015", "body": "\n \n \nA few weeks ago I looked in the mirror and winced.  Yikes! Who in the hell is that?  I wanted to cry over how old and tired I looked. The gray hair is in the process of doing a massive takeover. I have been vacillating back and forth over the past year whether or not to let it happen. When it was just one little patchy area, I thought it looked kind of cool, like a natural highlight. \u00a0However, \u00a0as the gray started spreading like a disease, I've had mixed emotions over it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAccording to my history of personal Facebook posts, I have been having this  gray hair argument  in my head for quite some time. That Facebook  \"On This Day\"  feature can be cool, but sometimes a little depressing when you see some pathetic post you made 2 years ago about the same subject that you're currently still whining about.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I \u00a0digress... \n \nI like to consider myself to be somewhat of a natural woman. I no longer put chemicals to straighten my hair. I don\u2019t do the weave thing that a lot of black women do.\u00a0  Looks great on some of you, but it's too damn hot here in Texas for extra hair.  That's why I cut off my long dreads.\u00a0I wear just enough makeup to accent my facial features and fade a few blemishes, but I don\u2019t overdue it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI realize now, the reason I wanted to cry when I looked in the mirror makeup less, exhausted, with more gray hair than I realized, is because I wasn\u2019t happy with myself.\u00a0 Self confidence had flown out the window.\u00a0The reflection told the truth of the life that was literally being sucked out of me from years of giving more of myself than I actually could spare. I was allowing myself to be abused and in a way, I was abusing myself. My kindness and love was being taken for weakness. I was giving myself away piece by piece, gray by gray, puffy eyes, disrupted sleep cycles and lost appetite.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a good look -as in not pretty.At.All. It certainly was not\u00a0 the way I wanted to feel.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThere are people in this world who are  takers .\u00a0 It may not be any fault of their own. Sometimes as parents, we love our children so much that we spoil them and they get used to it especially, when we feel bad for the extreme challenges that they face. There is a saying, \"Be careful what you do for your child with autism. They will expect you to do it over and over again.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSome  takers  may have a psychological issue or problems with perspective. Some are just black holes that can never be filled up.\u00a0  I know a few people like that. I'm sure you do too.\u00a0 When a taker knows that\u00a0 a giver loves them unconditionally, they see no reason to stop asking for more.\u00a0 \n \n \n Beauty is a state of mind... \n \n \nSooner or later,  givers  have to learn to stand up for themselves and say, \u201cSorry dude, but we\u2019re all sold out here. I got nothing for you,\u201d\u00a0 or better yet, \u201cI love you, but I love myself more. If I don\u2019t take care of myself, I will have nothing to give you or anyone else.\" \n \n \n \nIt took me a very long time to stand up and say that to the son whom I love ALMOST as much as I love myself.  I have given you a good foundation. I have put a wealth of supports in place for you, but I have to take care of me.\u00a0I think it will be better for both of us if I love you from a distance for now.\u00a0 \nIn other words, it's not you ...it's me. \n \n \n \n \nToday I looked in the mirror and not only was the sparkle back in my eyes, but the gray no longer made me look old and tired, it had turned into sparkling silver highlights.

{"date": "Friday, October 23, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nIt was his senior year and we all were anxious to get him out of the high school environment. And by we, I mean his father, myself and his high school special education team. High school was crushing his spirit, making him so unhappy and angry.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe finished all of his credits by December and by that January, he would be starting Transition classes.\u00a0 We were invited to attend Open House for the Adult Transition program to get an idea of what his new adventure would look like. The Open House took place at the community college campus. This is where he would have class a couple of times per week. I remember being excited about that aspect.  My son \u2026on a college campus , before he even graduated from high school.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs I sat through the presentation, observing the various students and listening to the information being presented, I wondered to myself, \u201c Is this right for him? Is this what he really needs?\u201d\u00a0 \n \nHe\u2019s so intelligent.\u00a0 I wanted him to take an actual college class or two.\u00a0 \n \n Was he ready for college classes?  Not really.   He needed so much support in the high school setting.\u00a0 \n \n Was he living up to his potential?  Hardly, but I didn\u2019t think it was\u00a0 because he didn\u2019t have the ability to reach further. I thought his lack of achievement was because he had been bogged down in the social quagmire of high school.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Maybe the thing holding him back was the medication that he was taking . It did not allow his brain to work the way it did when he was in elementary school and even middle school before he started taking it. I had a list of rationalizations for why he wasn\u2019t doing as well as he could. I was making excuses in my mind of why he wasn't able to live up to my dreams for him. \u00a0It had to be some outside factor that was out of his control and mine.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nUp until the 8th grade, he had no need for extra help from special education.\u00a0 Sure, he needed a few accommodations \u2026but nothing like the level of help that was required to get him through high school.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIn hindsight and in reality,  did he end up needing the Adult Transition program?  Absolutely!\u00a0 \n \n Did the transition out of the the high school environment make everything better?  Absolutely not. It was just the beginning of a whole new set of issues.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI did not allow my apprehension, fear of change or my dreams of something better for him, stop me from getting what he really needed. We enrolled in the transition program and he made slow but sure progress, rising from the first level of the program to the 2nd level (which provided less support) within a year's time. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nEffective parenting is not always about the dreams we have for our children. We have to do what needs to be done in order to take them to the next level of growth.\u00a0 This was no different then when he was in the first grade and the school attempted to give him an ADHD diagnosis.\u00a0  They\u2019re just trying to label my child \u2026put him in a box ( I thought).\u00a0\u00a0So, I had my own private testing by a neuropsychologist. The results were pointedly clear. He did indeed have ADHD, and that was only the beginning of the diagnoses he would collect over the years.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nCut to two (2) years later after he started the Transition program, we go to look at our first group home. I\u2019m at my wits end with his behaviors at home. He is disruptive, extremely argumentative and just generally a real pain in the ass to live with. Just as any 20 year-old, still living with his parents would be ...except like on steroids!\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe was doing so well at work, having held down a job for well over a year. He was making good progress in his transition program. I thought maybe if he got some distance from me, he could start making more progress towards independence and we could all lead a more peaceful life. \n \n \n \nAs I looked around this group home, I thought to myself,  Is this the right situation for him? Is this what he really needs?\u00a0 \n \nMoving into a group home certainly was not my dream for my first born son. \u00a0I had a lot of fears.  \n \n \n How he would adjust to the change and the structure of the group home.\u00a0 \n How would he be able to get along with roommates?\u00a0 \n I was afraid that he was so unstable emotionally, \u00a0that he may end up having a complete breakdown.\u00a0 \n \n \nThere had to be a better choice.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI didn\u2019t let on to him how I felt about it. After the tour of the home, I put on the optimistic face. I wanted him to make his own decision. I didn't think I was strong enough to make it myself. \u00a0He said yes at first. He even said, \"Maybe this is God's plan for me.\"A few days later he became anxious about all of the change he would have to make. He then adamantly said, \" NO! I\u2019m not doing it!\"  (His favorite initial answer to everything we ask.)\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe went on for several more months of bad to worse behavior at home, while I looked into other much more expensive options.\u00a0His behavior was screaming \" something has got to change!\"\u00a0 It was almost as if he was subconsciously begging for us to get it over with already and make him move out.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI was unraveling, unable to think straight half of the time, \u00a0unable to eat the other half of the time. I wasn't sleeping well. \u00a0I was on edge, filled with anxiety, always waiting for the next bomb to drop. My heart rate stayed high. I was afraid to even check my blood pressure. I was falling apart.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy husband was starting to lose it too. He became more and more involved in the day to day care of Red's life. \u00a0He tried to give me a break and started taking on more. \u00a0He began to see exactly what I had been going through for the past few years. \u00a0His own blood pressure climbed. We were both just exhausted. Everyone in the house was miserable.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nFinally, something broke. Behaviors reached a peak. The emotional unrest was beginning to effect our family's health and safety. We were forced to make some tough decisions. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe started off with some major medication changes. \u00a0We started it over the summer and thanks to the imprecise nature of the so called science of psychiatry, it seemed like everything that could go wrong, went wrong. We're talking from behavior that was horrific to the stuff nightmares are made of.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Y ou know that feeling you get as a mother, something is way off? Follow that instinct!\u00a0 And don\u2019t stop pushing until you get some results. \u00a0I kept pushing until he was seen by the right set of eyes. By that I mean, I finally met a psychiatrist that I didn't hate. \u00a0I just wish there were more like him in the world.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nOur results ended in a big reduction in meds, along with a huge reduction in his weight. He has completely changed his diet and is now hyper focused on exercise. If you had told me a year ago that he would change to a healthy lifestyle, I would have told you were out of your ever loving mind!\u00a0The change in him that finally began to take place was nothing short of miraculous. His attitude did a complete 180 degree turn and he began to feel much more optimistic than I have ever seen him.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI'm talking like night and day changes in his ability and willingness to cooperate. So much so, that it seems to good to be true. It's sad to say that I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit this. When you've been living in a war zone that suddenly turns into a resort, you can't help but wonder where the land mines are hiding. \u00a0For now, I'm just trying to ride the wave.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThis past week, we started a trial run at a group home.  Am I in love with it or even the idea of him being there?  No, I am not.   I will admit, I am a bit of a snob. I want nothing but the best for my children.  Hence they are so freakin spoiled!  This is coming from a girl who was raised in government subsidized housing, but our house was spic and span, comfortable and cozy. \u00a0We never had a hungry day and we were often the best dressed kids in school. (That is at least until I started buying my own clothes. My mother would say that I dressed like a gypsy. But whatever... I digress.) \u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy dream for my son was for him to move out into an apartment or a dormitory. At the very least, a Transitional Living program for adults on the spectrum. I don't know who it is that can afford these astronomically, expensive programs like the ones that I found, but good Lord, they must be very well off to be able to afford costs anywhere from forty to one hundred thousand dollars per year!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nA\u00a0group home was not a part of the dream, but it is what he needs right now. \u00a0We had to do what was best for our family, \u00a0even if this isn't what we dreamed of being able to provide for him. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe are hopeful that this is a springboard for further independence.\u00a0 I am praying that he will stay motivated to finally get a place of his own or at least with less support someday in the near future.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe still have a few kinks to work out with the agency that runs the home. I am not all that impressed with the staff so far, but I know my standards are high. I'm sure they aren't used to parents who are involved and knowledgable about what they are supposed to provide. I am not the one to try skimping on. \n \nWe have seen him a number of times this week, while we are working out these kinks of transportation and making sure that he has the things that he needs. Another\u00a0positive, is that the place is very close to us, so we can see him and ensure that his needs are being met. \n \n \n \nFor now, \u00a0it's not the ideal situation but it is so much better than the life we were living just a few weeks ago. I am just trying to enjoy the peace in my home. I can close my door at night and not worry about anyone bursting through it with an immediate need. Blue is \u00a0more self-sufficient and he knows when it's time to leave mom alone.  I am off duty at 9 p.m. Don't ask me for anything unless you're dying.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nThe really good news is that Red is feeling better, physically and mentally. He is optimistic about his future for the first time in years.\u00a0 It has only been a week so far, but when he comes home to visit, we can actually enjoy his company.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n*** \n \n \n \n \n Now that Red is out of the house ...I'm actually trying to read a real book! I'm reading  Elizabeth Gilbert's, \"Big Magic.\"  So far I love it!

{"date": "Monday, July 6, 2015", "body": "\n \n \nBy Leo, of\u00a0 Autism Blues \u00a0 \n \n \n \n A Fortunate Slip of the Lip \n \n \n \nI could have sworn he was downstairs. Really. I wouldn\u2019t have said what I did if I knew he was in his bedroom\u2014well within earshot. As Katie and I were going up the stairs this afternoon, I was recounting how this kid (#4, nine years old) had taken such good care of his younger brother (#6, six years old) at the neighborhood pool. If I had known he was in his bedroom, at the top of the stairs, changing out of his bathing suit, I would not have said, out loud: \n \n \n \n\u201cAnd [this kid], our autistic son, did really well today. So much for the old myth about empathy!\u201d \n \n \n \n\u201cDad? What does \u2018autistic\u2019 mean?\u201d \n \n \n \nMy heart sank. It was probably the first time he ever heard himself described as  autistic .\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt\u2019s not that I was hiding it from him. I had been wanting to tell him for some time now. I just didn\u2019t know how to do it. And I didn\u2019t want to manufacture some Hallmark moment where there would be this big reveal and a whole new understanding. I wanted it to be natural and, well,  right . (Plus, I was also a little chicken.) \n \n \n \n No Good Opportunity. \n \n \n \nYou see, he\u2019s one of six, and they\u2019re all autistic. His two older brothers and older sister already know about their diagnoses\u2014and they found out more or less by accident as well. At least, it didn\u2019t happen on my terms and in a way that I wanted it to. (Insert chicken squawks here.) \n \n \n \nSo autism is pretty much the lay of the land in our family, and that means he doesn\u2019t really stick out at home enough to wonder why he\u2019s different. All the kids present a pretty consistent profile of being on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum, so he\u2019s got a built-in tribe of autistics to relate to.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe also manages to blend in pretty well with his peers at school\u2014at least so far. He\u2019s only in fourth grade, too which means that his classmates are too busy running around on the play ground to pay much attention to his quirks or language glitches. Plus, he works hard to try to fit in. It\u2019s not perfect, and it can lead him to come home tired, moody, and explosive. But it works.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo there didn\u2019t seem to be any need to explain autism to him. (Squawk!!) \n \n \n \n Stumbling into  The Talk . \n \n \n \nAnyway, there I was, completely unprepared for  the talk . But there was no getting around it; I had to answer his question.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI brought him into our room along with Katie, and asked him, \u201cWhat did you hear me say?\u201d \n \n \n \n\u201cYou said I was autistic and I have empathy.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Do you know what  empathy  means?\u201d (I was stalling for time.) \n \n \n \n\u201cNo.\u201d \n \n \n \n\u201cIt means that you care about how other people feel. It means that you can feel their feelings, and you want to help people who feel bad. That\u2019s a really good thing, and I\u2019m so glad you are like that.\u201d \n \n \n \n\u201cOkay. What about autistic?\u201d \n \n \n \nI hesitated, not sure exactly what to say. Then Katie stepped in and saved me. \u201cIt means you think outside of the box.\u201d \n \n \n \nO merciful intervention! I knew that this kid thinks too literally to grasp metaphors like that. But that was a good thing; it gave me something concrete to react to. I didn\u2019t have to come up with a complete explanation out of nowhere.  The talk  was happening all by itself. \n \n \n \n Autism Is. . . \n \n \n \nSo I told him that \u201coutside of the box\u201d means that God made his brain a little different than most other kids\u2019 brains. I talked about the cool gifts this brain gives him, like his laser focus on math and cooking and singing. He\u2019s got some real talents there. Then I talked about challenges like how he can have a hard time putting words together or how he sometimes struggles understanding when someone\u2019s talking to him. I hit on a couple of others, like emotional regulation and his need to jump around and get giddy sometimes. Then came the Big Finish. \n \n \n \n\u201cSo there\u2019s something a little different about you. That doesn\u2019t make you weird. Just different. Autism isn\u2019t a disease or a sickness. It just makes you special. Got it?\u201d \n \n \n \n\u201cYeah.\u201d \n \n \n \n\u201cAny questions?\u201d \n \n \n \n\u201cNo. Can I go type on the computer now?\u201d \n \n \n \n\u201cSure thing. Knock yourself out.\u201d \n \n \n \n No Drama. \n \n \n \nAnd that was that. No fuss. No drama. No nothing. None of the baggage that the world gives to the word autism. None of the baggage that  I  can give it, either. Just another word to help him describe himself. \n \n \n \nIn a way, I\u2019m glad that it happened like this. I didn\u2019t have time to worry about developing the perfect speech. I didn\u2019t have the luxury of turning it into a  thing , which might risk emphasizing the difference more than I wanted. I didn\u2019t have enough of a chance to screw it up, either. \n \n \n \nI also liked the way it became just another thing that happened today. Mind you, I\u2019m not sure how much of it he really grasped. But I didn\u2019t want to push. It doesn\u2019t really matter anyway. We began a conversation today that will unfold and deepen over time. \n \n \n \n No Big Deal. \n \n \n \nSo there you have it. My son found out that he is autistic, and he\u2019s doing just fine. An inopportune-but-opportune moment presented itself, and we did our best with it. \n \n \n \nIt may not sound like the best approach, but there\u2019s something really appealing and \u201cnormal\u201d about things like this happening within the natural flow of everyday life. It helps the kids see that it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s one facet of who they are, and it has no bearing on how much we love them or how much dignity or value they have\u2014in our eyes or in God\u2019s eyes. \n \n \n \n \nThat\u2019s four down, two to go. I think I\u2019m getting the hang of this thing. So bring it on! \n \n \n \n* \n \n \n \n Leo is one of my favorite autism dads.

He also runs a\u00a0 Autism Blues Facebook community \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Leo and his wife Katie live in Maryland with their \u00a0six children , ages 6 to 15, \u00a0 all of whom are on the autism spectrum. \u00a0 Yes you read that right!

{"date": "Thursday, September 3, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n Over the past few weeks we have been dealing with some medication changes.\u00a0 Emotions have been running high. Anger has been vast. We have experienced some ugly breakdowns\u00a0 ( parents ) and witnessed meltdowns ( 19 year-old  ). His body's chemistry has been going through some serious changes. I am so pissed off about that, I could choke a Psychiatrist or two right about now (but that's another post). \u00a0 \n \n So he may not be able to completely control his emotional and physical reactions to medications.\u00a0 The question that has been lingering in my mind is,  What can he control? What behaviors are a result of his medication being out of whack? What is the result of autism, things that may never change? What is the result of just plain old  assholism ?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n What is assholism  you may ask?  I\u2019m going to get that word patented, by the way.   Assholism is the choice to act like an asshole . It can be an addiction of sorts\u2026where you just gravitate towards those assholish behaviors without any forethought. The individual could be addicted to the pay off they receive by choosing such behaviors. As in - I know that will really piss that person off. I bet this will make this person scream or cry. That will be funny. \n \n \n \nIt could just be,  I\u2019m feeling bad \u2026and it will make me feel better if someone else is feeling as miserable as I am. \u00a0 Perhaps it\u2019s just,  I\u2019m a hormonal teenager and I think I know everything! Let me show you that you don\u2019t! \n \n \n \nSome may draw the conclusion that I\u2019m trying to compare autism to assholism. That is not my intention. Assholism can happen to anyone. For instance, my 86 year-old father can act like bit of an asshole especially, to people those who attempt to care for him.\u00a0 It\u2019s one thing to be a cranky old man. It\u2019s another thing, to curse people out and call them insulting names that degrade or defile them.\u00a0 That\u2019s just uneccessary. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Side story: This man, my father, (his friends call him Hollywood) recently escaped from his 3rd locked skilled nursing facility, where he was supposed to be getting therapy so that he can walk after taking a fall. Note: He can not walk unassisted!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n He didn\u2019t like it there. He felt he wasn\u2019t getting the care he deserved or wanted. He had cursed out several nurses and therapists, being a very uncooperative patient. Quite frankly, I believe that he just doesn\u2019t want to die in one of those facilities. \u00a0He wants his freedom and wants to go out on his own terms.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n So, he had someone get him half-way dressed and help him get into a wheelchair. He parked the wheelchair by the front doors and pretended to be asleep until an ambulance showed up and the doors opened. He rolled himself out, down the street and around the corner and caught the train and then a bus, to make it back home to his apartment, where he still -can not walk! \u00a0 I have to say this about him, he may act out.\u00a0 At the same time, he\u2019s kind of a bad-ass to make it out of a locked facility and all the way across town without being able to walk. \n \n \n \n I'm thinking of making a movie short about his life on the run as a senior citizen in a wheelchair. \u00a0(Some people make think it's wrong to say your senior citizen, father with dementia is acting like an asshole. To those people -I'm sorry.) Actually, not really.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe all know at least one person who acts like an asshole. \u00a0Some of our lives are full of them. Assholism can happen to anyone. It doesn\u2019t discriminate.\u00a0 It happens to most teenagers at some point during adolescence. It is heightened by puberty between the ages of 12-14. \u00a0Just because our kids are on the autism spectrum, does not mean they are immune to it. In fact, that may just mean that it is intensified times a thousand. \n \n \n \nLast week, we witnessed what outwardly appeared to be a pretty horrible, autistic meltdown.\u00a0 Our family room was pretty much turned upside down.\u00a0 Our son was livid, primarily because he wanted something, and could not have it in the exact moment he wanted it.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nGranted, the fuse that lit his anger was no doubt shorter than usual due to his body chemistry being off.\u00a0  But was it a meltdown or a horrible tantrum to get us to do what he wanted us to do?\u00a0 He seemed pretty out of control in the midst of it, screaming to the top of his lungs and throwing things. \n \n \n \nHowever, in the aftermath -we noted that not one single item in his bedroom had been touched. Everything remained exactly where it was pre-meltdown.\u00a0 It was only our things that had been displaced. We also noted how quickly he pulled it together so he could make it to work on time.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThat\u2019s one of those things that makes you go, ... Hmmm. How much control does he actually have?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI offer to cook you a meal and you give me attitude, \"I don't want that!\" When last week when I was out of town, \u00a0you ate the very same thing without complaint. -as sholism.  Make your own dinner. If you can control your attitude with your dad but not with me, that sounds like a choice.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen you walk around like everyone owes you something and yet you don't treat them respect -assholism. It's a choice that will not win you any favors from me.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe other day I posted this meme on Facebook.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nI made this one night as I sat in my room thinking, medication has nothing to do with assholism. \u00a0It's a bad habit. \u00a0You have to recognize it as such. Motivation to break a bad habit has to be internal. The individual has to be willing make a better choices. \u00a0Otherwise, you may find yourself up a creek without a paddle or a person to assist you down the creek. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nFeel free to share this post with the assholes in your life. Together, we can change\u00a0 \n \nthe world. \n \n~~~~~~~~ \n \n \n \nHello friends \u2026 \n \n \n \nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been able to complete a blog post. When traumatic things are happening in my life my feelings are to raw to express without saying more than I probably should say publicly. I\u2019ve always been a pretty open book on this blog, but as one of my boys is seriously staring some heavy issues in the face, I have mixed emotion about sharing his journey. Unfortunately, my journey is undeniably linked to his right now. As much as I would love for us to go our own separate ways. Well, that\u2019s a whole other story.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAnyways, I hope you enjoyed this bit of humor today. \u00a0Remember, if it's not offensive to someone, it probably not funny.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThanks for following!\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QeAZ4f-Nn_I/VehxjHQEj7I/AAAAAAAAB_M/BkZZgwxAi28/s1600/11987098_869751579767750_1886093738278391930_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/09/assholism.html", "title": "\nAssholism \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 16, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n Editorial Note:\u00a0 \n   Here we are one year later, (April 2016), and Blue is no longer taking any psychotropic medications. He is now balancing his anxiety and sleep by taking vitamins, Omega-3's and natural supplements. \u00a0Since coming off of the last medication, he has also lost 40 pounds! He no longer has a ravenous appetite. He is also working with a therapist and a group of mentors on strategies to deal with anger.\u00a0 \n   We have also been able to reduce the number of medications for Red. \u00a0Proper balanced diet, including, protein, vegetables, fruit, minimal carbohydrates, and exercise have become and essential part of his life. He has lost 100 pounds.\u00a0 \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \nWhen it comes to psychotropic medications, most autism parents have ambivalent feelings... \nWe hate that our children need it. \nWe're glad that they have it. \nWe despise the trial and error. \nWe love when it works. \nWe lament over the side effects. \nSometimes, we want to hurt the doctors. \nOther times, we want to kiss them. ( This is rare .) \n \nI should clarify that medication does not treat autism or make it go away. \u00a0It can help with some of the co-morbid conditions such as ADHD (lack of focus, always moving) ), anxiety, depression/mood disorders, OCD -obsessive compulsive disorder, extreme difficulty sleeping. Many children with autism just can not turn those brains off at bedtime. The same goes for many worried autism parents. \n \nIn the past few days, I have been reminded how important medication is for both or my boys. \n \nI wrote a post, \u00a0 \"Turning Blue\" \u00a0a couple of days ago about how well Blue is doing. There are a number of factors that are in play, one of which is a medication that works along with several vitamin supplements. \n \n \nHowever, this past weekend on Saturday, Blue slept until noon.  I never wake a sleeping bear.  He did not eat breakfast and therefore did not take his medication and supplements on time. He decided he was going to walk to the local diner for breakfast. Only, he farted around watching videos on You-tube for a couple of hours. Then he went to take a shower and get dressed. By 2:30 p.m. he ended up in full rage. \u00a0He came down the stairs after his shower, entered a conversation that he was not a part of, and then proceeded to curse us all to high heavens! \n \nI immediately made him take his medication and literally pushed him out the door to go eat and get away from us. He wasn't finished with me yet. He got down the street and called me from his cell phone, \n\"Look! You better f-ing listen to me!\" \nUm...click!  I don't think so kid.  Of course, after I hung up, I prayed that he had already made it across the busy street and wasn't out there going berserk. \n \nBy the time he got home, he gave me a hug and a sincere apology. I told him that from now on he will eat something first thing so that he can take his meds. Crackers, a piece of toast ...whatever! \n \n Think he doesn't need his meds?  It's all a part of helping him keep it together. \n \nYes, he has made a lot of progress over the past year, but that doesn't mean that we are beyond all challenges. \n \nYesterday, I picked Red up from work. He works with young children who usually leave him feeling relatively happy. As he walked towards the car, the look on his face made me think he had just been fired or something. He looked angry, sad and mad all at the same time. \u00a0I felt sorry if the kids had to see that face. \n \nWhen I asked him what was wrong, he said, \"Nothing.\" That within itself was strange. He never passes up on an opportunity to complain. \nI pushed. \nAs he began speaking, tears started to fall. \n \n\"I don't know what's wrong with me. I've always felt like I was a messed up person. I'm broken inside. I'm scared. I'm afraid that I can't make it in life. \u00a0You're just trying to kick me out and make my life as hard as possible. Dad doesn't love me. No one cares about me. Sometimes, I even think God has forgotten all about me.\" \n \nIt's been ages since I've seen tears from him. \u00a0Even as they were falling softly, he said, \"Men don't cry, I'm usually more angry.\" He didn't understand why he was feeling the way that he was. \n \nMy heart ached. \n \nThis morning I read an article,\u00a0 \"Why High Functioning Autism Is So Challenging\" \u00a0. \u00a0It described Red to a tee. \n \n\"...people with high functioning autism are, in general, very aware of their own difficulties and extremely sensitive to others' negative reactions.\" \n \n\"Anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders are more common among people with high functioning autism... We don't know whether the autism causes the mood disorders, or whether the disorders are the result of social rejection and frustration...\" \n \n \n \nRed being less angry and more vulnerable allowed me to see how he's been feeling for months. His feelings have been showing up as anger and negative behaviors, lack of forward movement (fear), buying things to make himself feel better (self-medication), \u00a0attempts to show me that he is not ready to grow up and be responsible (more fear). He is deathly afraid of the changes that he is facing (anxiety). The possibility of moving out will be a major change. Starting some post secondary education (fear of failure) most likely feels incapacitating. \n \nYet, he goes to therapy week after week and talks about how he needs more equipment for his video business, instead of the things that need to be addressed. \n \n \nThe tears also made me aware that something was way off. After further investigation, it turns out that he has been out of one of his meds (Intuniv) for a few days. He had mentioned it to me casually after he ran out. \u00a0I called it in, but there was a delay because he was out of refills and they had to call the doctor. \u00a0Then, the pharmacy didn't have it in stock.  You know the drill. \n \nIn the back of my mind, for the longest time, I thought this particular medication wasn't doing much for him. He's still so all over the map with behavior. Apparently, it  has  been helping him sleep, and it does augment his ADHD medication (Focalin). \n \nI found out he had been waking up in the middle of the night two nights in a row with a headache. \n \n Yeah. So there goes my mother of the year award. Letting him run out of medication. Parenting fail! \n \nThe bottom line is that we both were reminded the importance of his medications ...taking all of them and taking them promptly, every day. \n \nI think I will always have a love/hate relationship with psychotropic medications. Unfortunately, \u00a0for us, they are a necessary evil. \n \nIf you found this post helpful in any way, please share it.

What in the hell is he going to do with all of that time on his hands?!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\"Why do you think they did that?\" I say, trying to sound calm. \u00a0 \n \n\"It's the summer.

( Because he doesn't want to work Saturdays.)\u00a0 \n \n \n \n WTF? You need to work whenever there are hours available! \u00a0I think, but bite my tongue and do not say.\u00a0 \n \nWhat I do say is this, \"Well, I will not be around on Saturday's and Sunday's to transport you anywhere.

On Saturday mornings you're knocking on our door when we are still sleeping. Or you're out here on the futon flipping the wooden arms up and down to make noise.

{"date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2015", "body": "\n \nAfter weeks of resistance and avoidance, instinct prompted me to not only drive Red to therapy but to be a part of the session. As a result, I ended up with the most valuable insight into the motivation of his behaviors that I've received in a very long time. \u00a0If you read this blog regularly, you know that many times throughout an average day I ask myself, what the actual f% is he thinking? \u00a0He can be impossible to understand. \u00a0Well, therapy gave me a few answers. \n \nFor the longest time, I have wondered the point of \"talk therapy\" for Red. \u00a0He loves to go! I've even used it as a consequence.  If you don't behave, I will not drive you. \u00a0 I think because he enjoys hearing himself talk. Other people, including the therapist? \u00a0Not so much. \u00a0I believe that for the most part, \u00a0he only wants to hear his point of view reflected back to him. In the sessions I've attended with him, that's what I've seen. When I ask him about therapy\u00a0sessions that I don't attend, he isn't able to give me any earth-shattering insight that he gathered. \n \nThe ride to and from therapy within itself stresses me the hell out. I'm a captive audience, keyword, captive. \u00a0I'm a hostage, trapped in a small space listening to his ranting, arguing and debating. \u00a0There have been times when I just pull over until he shuts up! \n \nA month ago, I canceled two of his four monthly sessions because of the long, stressful drive home. That appointment had us driving home through five o'clock traffic. It could take almost 2 hours.  Oh.My.God! I wanted to drive off a cliff! \n \nFor his last session two weeks ago, \u00a0I asked his Community Supports provider Kevin, to take him for me. I felt like the goose that laid the golden egg, and no one else knew how valuable it was. \u00a0 Score one for me!  I saved myself some aggravation. \n \nOne of the boundary issues we have with Red is when he hugs me, he totally engulfs me in his arms. I am much shorter and so much slimmer ( not ) than he is. He puts a lot of his 200 plus pounds of weight on me and won't let go usually until I pinch him or something. He also continually picks up Harry our little 7 pound Maltese. \u00a0He hugs him to death or at least until he yelps. \u00a0Let's just suffice it to say he is overly affectionate with the dog. \u00a0Harry runs when he hears him coming. \n \nRed also seems to panic when I'm leaving the house. Where are you going? When will you be back? Then I get a zillion phone calls while I'm gone. \u00a0I come back home; he meets me in the driveway before I can even get out of the car. \n \n \n Banging on my car window \nAnger \n \nYesterday, I learned that fear, anxiety and a deep need for love and affection are the primary drivers behind many Red's behaviors. \u00a0He has a girlfriend, but he doesn't get to see her that much because of her issues and actions with her parents. He only has one close friend, and that friend spends most of his life grounded. It's sad. He does have his church family, and I'm sure that attention, love and caring are primary motivators behind his being so close involvement in his church. \n \n \n \nRed's therapist believes that he is panicking because of his fear of losing everything. \u00a0That's why he is holding on so tight. He is genuinely afraid of change. \u00a0His transition into adulthood involves so many variables; there are many unknowns. \u00a0It frightens him. \u00a0Red believes that once he walks out these doors, he loses everything. That's why he always references moving out, as being \"kicked out.\"  I imagine he sees my foot on his ass as he heads out the door, never to be able to come back again. \u00a0 \n \nI realize now that we perpetuate that fear. In recent months, his behavior has been so all over the map. Boundaries have been next to non-existent, and we have been close to moving him into a group home. In fact, when he misbehaves, our first line of defense is to say, \"That's why you need to move!\"  Turns out that's not so healthy. It's making matters worse. \u00a0I never claimed to be perfect, especially when being driven to the edges of sanity.\u00a0 \n \nOf course, if we did have to follow that course of action, \u00a0it's not as if he would not have any support. But, he can't see through all of that. \u00a0He's afraid of losing all of his comforts.  Gasp! He may have to struggle a bit, like every young person in America.\u00a0 \n \nOh yes, and buying all of the things. \u00a0That's another way that he is holding on, tightly. \u00a0Buying video equipment is something that he can control when he can't control anything else. \u00a0He is buying things in a panic because when and if, he gets \"kicked out,\" he won't be able to buy anything again, ever!  \u00a0It all makes perfect sense! Why didn't I see all of this before? Duh!\u00a0 \n \nHis therapist also pointed out, that Red sees that his older brother who has been out of the house for almost nine years, hardly ever comes back home. I don't think he knows that we continue to support his older brother when he needs it. \n \nRed may act like he doesn't like us, but he loves us. We are all he has ever known, especially me. I have been his rock, and his crutch. What will he do without that? Of course, he thinks he's going to fall if he no longer has what has been holding him up for his entire life. Standing on his own, \u00a0becoming an independent person scares the crap out of him. \u00a0He is the bird in the nest; that thinks that there is no way he can fly. \u00a0This is a very normal feeling that many young adults go through. It's is only exacerbated by autism and anxiety. \n \n \n Moments later running from a bug. Fear \n \n \nWhat we need to do (all of us including his dad and his brother) is reassure him that he is loved, right now -today\u00a0and that he will always be loved. \nHe will always be a part of this family. \nHe needs that love and affection to be shown by ALL of us. \nWe can't continually be angry because he's angry and scared. \nWe can't let the only attention that he gets be negative. He acts so unlikeable\u00a0because that's the only way he knows how to get attention. \nWhat he needs is encouragement to know that we are positive that he can do well on his own. \nHe can fly. \nWe need to reassure him that we realize that even if he is out of our house, he will continue to need support. \nWe will be there to give that to him or make sure that he receives it from outside sources until he doesn't need it anymore, just as I have ALWAYS done. \nWe need to continue to encourage and remind him how well he does in other environments, which is a sign that he really can be happy and independent. \nWhen he travels to see family for weeks at a time, he thrives. \nWhen he has gone away to camp, he loved it and did well. \nWhen he is at work and volunteering at the high school with special needs students, \u00a0he is happy and self-assured. \nWe must continually encourage his strengths and consistently reassure him, that we know he can do this! \nHe can be an independent person. \nSomeday he can be a husband, and perhaps even a father. \nTo get there, he has to be willing to walk through the fear and walk out of our front door. \nHe also needs to see a  visual plan for his life.  He needs  a roadmap  to follow so that he can feel himself heading in the right direction. \nHe needs to see that it's just one step at a time, instead of becoming overwhelmed by the big, fuzzy picture. I have arranged that his Occupational Therapist will be helping him map things out, creating a blueprint in the coming weeks. \n \nSo it turns out that therapy can be a good thing after all.

{"date": "Friday, March 20, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n \nHaving a public forum where you share some of your deepest feelings and emotions can be dangerous. I totally went left the other night on this blog. I was feeling completely overwhelmed and pissed off, so I purged all of my feelings in writing. \u00a0I don't have a therapist ( dumb I know ). \u00a0I have some really good friends and family members who care, but no one knows everything that's going on in my life. Besides, I can't say everything in one conversation. I don't often get to have a telephone conversation without it being interrupted. It was therapeutic for me to get it all out. \n \nWhen I went back and read it again the next day, I thought to myself,  what the hell did you do?  My husband is going to be pissed when he reads this. \u00a0Everyone will know how completely nuts I am.  I know that's not really a newsflash.  \u00a0I kind of sound like I'm whining and complaining a lot. I don't want people to feel sorry for me. \u00a0I just wanted to get the feelings out. \n \nHundreds of views later, I couldn't take it back. \u00a0Apparently, my feelings connected with a number of you who said it read like it was your life. That's always a really good thing. \n \nGoing back and reading it, \u00a0allowed me to see exactly what is happening and what part I am playing in the process. Life doesn't just happen to you. You usually have a part in what you are allowing to happen. \u00a0This is especially so, when it is a pattern of things that \u00a0seem happen more than once. \nThere are no mistakes really. \nFailures are an opportunity to learn. \nThere is a lesson to in every trial we go through.  \nI am learning every.single.day. \n \n \n \nBy re-reading what I wrote, I learned so much... \n First, I need to slow down.\u00a0 \n \nIt made me look at myself and say, ' What in the hell are you doing?'\u00a0 Obviously, way too much. \nI am allowing too many people to put too much pressure on me, not to mention the amount of pressure I am putting on myself.  \nI can only do one thing at a time. \nI have got to get better at saying  no.   \nNot just no but,  \u00a0'Hell no! I'm not doing that! \u00a0Do it your damn self!'\u00a0 \n \n \n \nFor example the other night, Blue comes into my room at 9:30 asking about me warming up tacos for him and his friend. \u00a0My first impulse was to say yes, \u00a0because that's what I do. \u00a0This time, I stopped myself. I thought, I don't want to do that. What's more I don't have to do that. I'm tired! I've been experiencing extreme fatigue for days. I'm relaxing right now. I'm not changing my program just because they came in here hungry this time of night.\u00a0 \n \n\"Make yourselves some corndogs! Have some yogurt, or some popcorn. Whatever it is, \u00a0get it yourself.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n Second, I am feeling pressured to make Red gone like yesterday, as if that will solve all of our problems.   \nThe thing is, he's a person. A complicated person and this is a complicated situation. \nI can't make everything happen overnight. \nI have been working on this process diligently, for months and I am on the right track. \nWhen you are dealing with government agencies, things take time. \nWhen you are dealing with a less than stable young adult who has rights, but not all of the abilities that go along with those rights, nothing is simple. \n \n \n Third, I need to give myself some credit. \n \n \n \n \n I applied and got him qualified for  SSI.  \u00a0Now that he is 18, he qualifies based on his diagnosis, and his own income and not ours.\u00a0 \n That helped him qualify for  Medicaid  to help with the cost of his healthcare and medication.  That is major! \u00a0 \n We applied and he has been approved for services through  DARS  (Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services) which is going to help us get work on behaviors and obstacles that need to be removed in order to get himself ready for full-time work and therefore, independence. \u00a0We met with his DARS   counselor a few days ago. He offered to get \u00a0Red a  Functional Behavior Assessment .\u00a0 \n Then he will start working with a  BCBA Behavior Therapist  here at home, in the community and at school. \u00a0If he happens to move during that process, the therapist will provide service where ever he lives.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI have a feeling when the behavior therapist comes, she will note that we are all giving Red a payoff with our reactions. \u00a0The rules and structure need to be clear and enforced with everyone who lives here. \n \n \n I have applied and qualified him for  Autism services  through our local  MHMR  (county mental health agency). \u00a0 \n This gives him a  Case Manager  to help coordinate services for him. \u00a0 \n He also qualifies for  Home and Community Supports,\u00a0 \u00a0a provider who will spend a few hours a week with him out in the community, taking him to the bank, getting a haircut, going grocery shopping, maybe even taking him on a date! That will give me some relief.\u00a0 \n We can now receive  Respite  services (someone to come into the home or take him out of the home to give us a break for extended time.)\u00a0 \n We also put an emergency game plan in place if I am seriously about to break. They can provide  emergency respite  if I need to get him out of here with a quickness on a temporary basis, before he actually moves.\u00a0 \n \n \nWhen it comes to my mom, I have arranged for her to use a car service for her physical therapy appointments. Next, I will look into her actually having a part-time caregiver. \u00a0I can't always be 3 places at once. \u00a0It won't be easy to get a 75 year-old woman to change her ways. Especially, when her behavior seems to be going more and more in the direction of childish, antagonizer every day. \u00a0She is going to have to live by certain rules as well. \u00a0I'm not going to continue to put up with chaos. \n \nIt turns out that hubby wasn't mad at me after reading the blog. He actually came home and asked me out for dinner. \u00a0Since then, he has been trying to use a firm, yet milder tone when speaking with Red. \u00a0I sincerely appreciate the effort. \n \nIn the meantime until Red moves,  I am going to have to take things one day at at time. \nI will work on accomplishing one goal at time, instead of worrying myself to death about every little thing.  \n \nAs many of my dear friends from my  Facebook Support group \u00a0reminded me, some more subtly than others (Tonya),  I can not control everything . \u00a0I need to stop sweating the small stuff and let a lot of these grown folks in this house manage their own lives. \n \n \n \nI have been getting a lot more rest in the past few days. I can see the peak of blue sky among the clouds, which is God's way of telling me,  'Everything is going to be alright. Trust me.' \u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-srr2pjw_MC8/VQx-ExIvoXI/AAAAAAAAB1g/WeyGu-LfnUQ/s1600/10411736_791372567605652_3334263488827142362_n.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/03/blue-sky-among-clouds.html", "title": "\nBlue Sky Among Clouds \n"},

What if I need to go back to work on a video project?\u00a0 \n \n Me: \n You haven't worked on a video project in months. Even when you have one, you don't work on it during the day. You come home from school or work and follow me around the house talking most of the day or you're watching Sponge Bob.\u00a0 \n \n Him: \n You don't support my passion!\u00a0 \n \n Me: \n Your passion is for buying equipment and watching You-Tube videos about movie making. You don't actually make movies. You don't actually practice or get involved in the local movie making community like your counselor suggested that you do. You do event shooting if a job is dropped in your lap. If you would do more things to develop your passion, get more education, interact with the local Austin Film Society, practice more. I would fully support it. \n \n Him: Harry! Harry! Come here Harry! (In a very high pitched squeal. Harry runs away.)\u00a0 \n Me: Leave the dog alone.\u00a0 \n Him: But I really love his cuteness. I just want to feel his cuteness.\u00a0 \n (This is an everyday, multiple times a day, script along with the action of chasing the 6 1/2 pound dog, like the 250 pound Jolly Green Giant.)\u00a0 \n \n I leave the kitchen to go to my room to get dressed to go to the grocery store. Harry follows me to get away from being chased. Harry regularly runs to hide if he hears Red coming into a room.\u00a0 \n \n Hubby and I are listening to music in our bedroom. When I open the door... \n \n Him: \n Why do you listen to that rap music when you know I hate it?\u00a0 \n They are cursing and talking about shaking butts! \n You're really making me angry.\u00a0 \n You're just trying to piss me off! \n Turn that music off!\u00a0 \n \n We keep listening and dancing ...releasing a little stress.

I have been avoiding the place like the plague for a week, so I need to shop too. \u00a0At this point, I have already had it with him. I can't take listening to another pissing, moaning, complaint.

{"date": "Wednesday, November 5, 2014", "body": "\n \nI feel like I'm swimming upstream, against the current, all alone. \u00a0Everyone, in this house, including the person I am trying to help seems like they're working against me. \n \nI've been busting my ass getting Red connected with services. \u00a0Week before last, I met with his Adult Transition team through the school district. \u00a0The best thing to come out of that meeting is that the Occupational Therapist is now coming out to our home to work with him on budgeting and some behavior issues. She told me straight out to give up a lot of the power struggles and let him make his own mistakes with his money. \u00a0She encouraged me to put him more in charge of his own life so that he can actually feel the pain of being an adult. As you may have read in my last post\u00a0 \"Mama's Boy\"  , I've been trying to do that. \n \nThe following week we met with our local MHMR (our county Mental Health agency) \u00a0for an intake. This was like a 2 hour meeting just to get the ball rolling with what supports they may be able to \u00a0offer him. \u00a0The best thing so far that I heard from them, is they can give us Respite Care, where some will come into our home to give us a break. \u00a0They can also do Community Supports training where some one will come out and take him into the community to work on different skills, such as money management, shopping, etc. \u00a0They could also do Case Management, and help him with community living options (such as a group home) if we were to go in that direction. \n \nThis week I did an intake with DARS (Department of Rehabilitative Services). \u00a0I could do a whole blog post about the services that they offer, and I will, but I want to get to another point. \n \nHubby is working and traveling and  has not been able to come to one of these meetings . \u00a0I basically have to try to regurgitate a shitload of information to him once I finally see him, which is usually a few days after the meeting. I don't half-way understand all of the information that's coming my way, but I'm doing my best to figure it all out. \n \nWhat I know for sure, is that there is help. \u00a0There is supports available to turn our young man into an independent adult. \u00a0The ultimate goal is independence! \u00a0I can see it far, far away in the horizon. \u00a0I need glasses to see it, but I know it's there! \n \n \n \n What do I get from hubby as I'm trying to share all of this information?  I get,  \" Bottom line, when can we get him out of here? He's acting like an ass! And I'm sick of it!   Well,  hello! I'm sick of it too!  I'm the primary person dealing with it, face to face while you earn a living to take care of our family. I'm ready for all of this crap, including his behaviors to go away like...yesterday! Unfortunately, it's just not that simple. \n \nRed tries to make improvements and then he turns around and takes 10 steps backward. \u00a0Last night he bought a new printer. \u00a0He came to his dad and demanded that he help him set it up!  Now! Loudly! Obnoxiously! \n \nIn what world does that work? I'm trying to help set you up for the best possible life dude and then you just act like pure ass. \u00a0He was even crappy with me once we got home from the bank and other errands yesterday, which is why today ...he will not be riding in my car. \u00a0He will be paying someone else for a ride. \n \nHe needs some behavior therapies, which DARS says they will pay for!  \u00a0Hallelujah!  He needs all kinds of things that I am working on putting in place for him but, \u00a0it feels like I'm working alone and everyone in this house, is working against me. Hence, \u00a0I am swimming upstream. I'm up a creek without a paddle! Dad is taking all rude (Aspergers) behavior personally. \u00a0Red is continually being \u00a0ungrateful and rude. \u00a0He's always talking out of his ass saying things that make no sense, both for attention and sometimes, just to piss us off. \n \nThe counselor at DARS told me, \"The easy route to a group home is not necessarily the best route for his ultimate success.\" \u00a0It's putting a bandaid on the situation not really treating it. It's like taking a few steps sideways instead of forward. Ultimately, creating more work to get him on the road to independence. \n \nI can't seem to get Dad or Red to see the big picture. I'm frustrated! I'm tired! And again, I'm frustrated! \n \nMotherhood ...the job you can't quit. No matter how much you would like to! \n \nDad and I need therapy to get us through this in one piece. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Sbdpo2xXNMQ/VFqB4ZtNWOI/AAAAAAAABtg/mjmLjGWBeeI/s1600/10632809_690939420982301_2207653745346804873_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/11/frustrated.html", "title": "\nFrustrated \n"},

It doesn't do any good.\" \u00a0 \n Boy did that piss me off!\u00a0 \n What if she's right?! \u00a0 \n It's her answering questions when my children are asking me, literally echoing from another room.\u00a0 \n It's the door that she doesn't have to close or the apartment she doesn't have to go home to.\u00a0 \n It's her screaming, engaging, sometimes even taunting, or teasing the catalyst like another child.\u00a0 \n Did I tell you I caught her sticking her tongue out at him the other day?\u00a0 \n It's her adding to my \"to do\" list, while she is either not capable or doesn't want to do for herself any longer. \n It's my guilt trip for feeling like I'm blessed to have her. I should take care of her while I can ...even if it's killing me.\u00a0 \n \n It's that a year ago we had our 20th wedding anniversary celebration. \u00a0 \n We had to put our trip to New York on hold because my mother was sick. \u00a0 \n We have yet to reschedule it.\u00a0 \n \n It's the fact that in less than three weeks, I will celebrate my 50th birthday.\u00a0 \n I wanted to finally go on that trip with my husband to New York to celebrate.\u00a0 \n As of today there has been no time to plan any kind of celebration. \n \n It's not one thing.\u00a0 \n It's all of the things.\u00a0 \n I just want someone to come and take over.\u00a0 \n I want to disappear until all of these problems are solved.\u00a0 \n I know that's not realistic, but that's what I want for my birthday.\u00a0 \n I need strength.\u00a0 \n I need guidance. \n \n God are you listening? \n btw God ...sorry about that F word at the top.

{"date": "Monday, November 17, 2014", "body": "\n \n Last night I heard myself say the words out loud. \"I do it because I'm trapped, not because I enjoy it.\"\u00a0 \n \n Wow! What an awful truth to hear coming out of your own mouth. It's that time of the month where thoughts fly out of my mouth without any edit. Obviously, the thoughts are floating around in my mind. \u00a0Only, most people don't let the world in to their most private thoughts. Apparently, I do. Hazard of being a writer, I guess.\u00a0 \n \n Last night I made a pot-roast for dinner in the crock-pot. It turned out rather well, I think. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, except for Red. He wouldn't even entertain trying it, with the gravy, vegetables and all. I've never made a pot-roast before in my life. It's not really the kind of dish that I would think of making, but on Friday at the grocery store they made the recipe and were handing out samples. It was good as pot-roasts go. It had the tangy taste of red-wine in the sauce. I knew it was going to be a cold weekend. I wouldn't want to go out, so something in the crock-pot would be an easy idea for Sunday dinner.\u00a0 \n \n If I'm honest with myself, I don't even like Sunday dinner unless someone else cooks it. The best idea for a Sunday dinner is going out to a nice restaurant, but not with the entire family. That's not fun. At all.\u00a0 \n \n I go through the motions most Sundays because I know that my mother enjoys it. Hubby appreciates a good, hot meal. Blue loves food.period. Red doesn't appreciate a god damned thing. Never really has and probably never will. I certainly don't cook with him in mind.\u00a0 \n \n My mom complimented the meal and followed up by saying something like, \"You should enjoy cooking. You're a homemaker, a wife, a mother and a caregiver.\"  Where does she get this 1950's bullshit? \u00a0 \n She couldn't believe her ears when I said, \"I do it because I'm trapped.\"\u00a0 \n \"What did you say?\"\u00a0 \n I repeated, \"I am trapped by the decisions I made a long time ago. I don't cook for this family, because I enjoy it. I cook because I feel an obligation to do it.\" \u00a0And that's the ugly truth.\u00a0 \n \n My husband heard me say it and brought it to my attention this morning. Yeah. I said it. I'm sure there are moments that you feel the exact same thing. In fact, I know there are moments that you do. The difference between you and me, is that you get to walk away twice a month on an all expenses paid business trip, to a nice quiet hotel room. \u00a0 \n \n This marriage and raising children thing is no picnic. It is not for the weak who easily walk away when it's not fun anymore. It was actually kind of fun when the kids were young, cute and didn't talk back. And my babies were really, really cute. Adorable. Most beautiful babies ever, even. \n \n \n See! Really Cute! \u00a0 \n \n I do enjoy caregiving ...sometimes. In fact, I have been known to often over do it. I was the mom who made warm cookies when the boys came home from school. I enjoy putting a smile on my husband's face when I bring him a hot cup of coffee ...sometimes. Sometimes, I enjoy being his team mate.\u00a0 \n \n However, standing for hours to prepare a meal, only to have it gulped down in less than five minutes, while listening to arguing, smart-assery, or 'What is this? It looks disgusting!\" ...is not my idea of enjoyment.\u00a0 \n \n Am I really trapped? No. If I was not a responsible person, I could walk away from my obligations. While I'm here, I can take breaks and find moments of happiness and fulfillment. I can make more of a concerted effort to make that happen more often. Sometimes, I can pay someone to do the stuff I no longer enjoy doing. \u00a0 \n \n Do I love my family? Of course, I do. I want to see them happy. I want to them to leave the nest knowing how to fly. \u00a0 \n Do I enjoy everything that it takes to get them to that point?\u00a0 \n No. I certainly do not.\u00a0 \n Do I want them to leave the nest like ...yesterday? \n Abso-freakin-lutely! \n \n In fact, I'm counting down the days until that happens. \u00a0 \n Help support the blog ...click below to shop Amazon for the holidays\u00a0 \n \n Shop Amazon with Confessions  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yRb0YZnimiI/VGouEoP10zI/AAAAAAAABuY/C00CaWQ6dVU/s1600/1424505_548440691898842_1631337021_n.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag=confesmom-20&linkId=5NH2LYLGIYXASNST"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/11/trapped.html", "title": "\nTrapped \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, February 19, 2015", "body": "\n \nDear Blue, \n \n \n \nSixteen years ago your unique, little soul came into my life. You were an easy, breezy baby. Curious by nature and naturally independent. You started trying to walk when you were 8 months old. You were successfully running by the time you were 10 months. \u00a0As soon as you started to get around, you were wrestling with your big brother. \u00a0I remember thinking,  who taught this baby to do a headlock?\u00a0 \n \nYou were a messy toddler, always climbing and getting into everything. You had an affinity for getting into things like lotion and baby powder. You once massaged my bedroom carpet with Vaseline. You were always climbing onto the counters and into my cabinets. \u00a0One time you climbed the pantry shelves and spilled the cooking oil all over the floor.  \n \nI always felt like an angel with wings followed you around because for all of your climbing, you never got hurt. One of the reasons you climbed is because, you did not want to ask for what you wanted. You wanted to get it yourself! \n \nAt 18 months, we moved up here to Austin and bought our first home. We put a gate on the stairwell to keep you safe upstairs, especially since you started climbing out of your baby bed. \u00a0I will never forget the day, you came to my room with a box of cereal. You had climbed over the gate, walked down the stairs, \u00a0climbed up to the top shelf of the pantry to get the cereal and then climbed back down. Then you climbed up the stairs cereal in tow, back over the gate and strolled into my room to wake me up. \n \n \n \nNotice, you didn't wake me up to get the cereal for you! And that still hasn't changed. You continue to find your way through life. \u00a0No matter how much I want to and try to help you, you pretty much want to do most things on your own. \u00a0That quality will serve you well throughout your life. \n \nYou have always been a deep thinker, asking me questions about things that I've never even thought about. You have always had a strong interest in science and weather. You could be found, talking about politics while on the playground or in the swimming pool instead of playing. I remember once saying the words, \"Stop talking about politics and go swim!\" That was the year that President Obama was running for President. You and your best friend J, had some pretty interesting debates about that election.  \n \nThat brings me to another point, despite your social challenges caused by autism, you have managed to connect to friends so deeply, that those friends remain in your life to this day. \u00a0You met the twins in pre-school. You all were 3 years-old. \u00a0Your friendship flourished over the years and in middle school it seemed to really take off. \u00a0Here we are 13 years later and you guys are still hanging. You're like brothers. And even through some challenging times in your lives, you guys have been there for each other, forgiven each other and continued to grow your relationship. \n \n \n \nYou met J. in the 3rd grade when you guys shared a class. \u00a0You advocated to help transport J. in his wheelchair to lunch and other activities. \u00a0Thankfully, he is stronger now and no longer needs to be pushed in a wheelchair. Even though the two of you are not in the same school anymore, you have remained close while going to different middle and high schools. \u00a0You made the effort to continue to call and make social plans with him on the weekends and throughout the summer. That speaks highly of your character. \n \nYou were always so different than your brother so for the longest, you went without a proper diagnosis. I knew that you had strong opinions and you really challenged some of your teachers. You were also insightful. In first grade you told me that your teacher didn't like you. That she never smiled at any of the boys in class. \u00a0She and I had to have a few chats and then I had to chat with her boss, the principal. By the end of the school year, you guys were pals. I saw her a few years later and she said, she still has your picture on her desk. \n \nYou frustrated the hell out of your 5th grade teacher. It was his first year teaching and you challenged him often. Because of course, you knew more than he did. \n \nIt was the years of fear and anxiety over thunderstorms that got me really worried about you. Do you remember hiding sometimes for days at a time, when there was even a threat of storms? By that time, your brother had been diagnosed with autism and though you were very different, I started to see some erie similarities. \u00a0I followed my instincts and had an evaluation. \u00a0We found that you too were on the spectrum. \u00a0It answered so many questions and it seemed to give you a sense of relief. \u00a0You wanted to read as much as you could about it so that you could understand why you felt so different. \n \n \n \nYou have made so much progress since then. The years of middle school that you found so daunting in the beginning, had you soaring through by the end. The fears and anxiety subsided tremendously! You began taking some advanced classes. \u00a0You started learning how to advocate for yourself with your teachers. By the time high school rolled around, you were ahead of the game having high school Spanish and Algebra under your belt. \n \nThe first year of high school was tough! But look at you now! You have started your very own club at school. \u00a0It has flourished to include those who just don't feel comfortable anywhere else ...whether they're on the spectrum, have ADHD or they just feel different. You include them and make them all feel that they are important. \n \nYou've built relationships with a number of mentors. \u00a0You seek out your natural supports and problem solve on your own! You are self-aware and set goals for yourself to work on your social skills. \u00a0You are your own advocate. No one has to tell you how to improve your life. You see something you want to change and you figure out a way to get it done. Many adults can't or won't even do that! \n \nI know that you hate to hear the words, \"You're so smart!\" So I won't say that. I will say, that you demonstrate the skills of a young man who will definitely become a successful adult. \n \nWe have our moments of wanting to probably punch each other, or at least give each other a good smack upside the head. \u00a0You think you know so much more than I do, so that gets on my nerves. I know that my constant humor gets on your nerves, but it has helped you develop your own sense of humor.  \n \nReally son, I could not be more proud of the young man that you have become \u00a0and I can wait to see the adult that I know you will be. \n \nHappy 16th Birthday! \n \n \n \nI love you! \n \nMom \n \nIf Blue's story has inspired you over the years, please tell him how below. It can be your birthday gift to him.

{"date": "Wednesday, December 3, 2014", "body": "\n \n*Warning there is some pretty descriptive, colorful language in this post. If you're easily offended, move on. \n \nLately, in the afternoons when Red is about to come home from work or school start getting this anxious, dread that comes over me. I know that sounds horrible to say, but it is my truth right now. Whoever would have thought that it's possible to feel that way about your own precious child? The precious little baby that you gave birth too. Well, he's my own not-so-precious, adult these days and I am just plain old sick and tired of his behaviors.  \n \nWhen he comes home in the afternoon, I usually haven't gotten enough stuff done. When he comes through the door with his long list of complaints and arguments, my ability to think -to focus is cut down by half. \u00a0My focus level hasn't been on full for months, so it's really cut down to about a quarter of a tank, about to hit empty with a quickness. \n \nHe comes through the door just as I am about to eat the bacon that my mom has made for me along with a couple of waffles. \n \n\"I want that! Let me have it!\" He is standing over me, totally invading my space. I refuse to give it to him. He continues begging, insisting really. I finally give in, just to shut him up. I give him a half of a slice. \"No I want the whole thing!\" He yells, and then grabs the other half and puts it in his mouth. \n \nI took it as,  fuck you and your feelings. I want this bacon and I'm taking it. What are you gonna do about it? Nothing.  \u00a0It was just blatant disrespect. I...was...livid! \n \nTo make matters worse, my mom chimes in with her outrage over what he did. The two of them start arguing. \"Nana! This is none of your business! It's just a piece of bacon!\" \"I made that bacon for your mother! You have a lot of nerve!\" Minutes later, she wants him to be quiet because she's watching her soap opera.  Really? You get him started by chiming in on a matter that doesn't \u00a0really involve you. Now you want him to be quiet? \n \nI didn't engage with either of them. I ate my late breakfast while it was hot and then went upstairs, knowing that he would follow and that would break the two of them up. \n \nInternally, I was smoking hot! He kept saying, \"I'm sorry! Why are you so mad? \u00a0Really mom! \u00a0It's just a piece of bacon. What's the big deal? You still had some left.\" \nThis is not an apology. It enraged me further. \n \nI explained to him it wasn't about the bacon. It was about the blatant disrespect. \"If you did this out in the world, at work where someone has food stored in the refrigerator, or in a roommate situation someone may just decide to stab you with a fork for reaching over and taking their food.\" ( Especially if it was bacon. )  \u00a0In what world is this acceptable behavior? \nHis reply? \"I would never do that at work or to anyone else!\" \u00a0 Wow! Just wow! \n \nI explained that the bacon was just the last drop in the bucket, that made the water overflow. \u00a0It's about the way he has been treating me for years and the increased behaviors in the past few months. While being a very generous person to his friends, almost to a fault, he won't share a french-fry with me! This is \u00a0about how he made me cry over  Thanksgiving dinner \u00a0because of his rudeness. \u00a0Then he says to his dad,  \"What's the big deal? I've made mom cry before.\"\u00a0 \n \nIt's about me being very literally at the end of my rope. I am stressed, depressed, pissed off and generally overwhelmed about the crisis that we've been living in for months. We have in this house the total ingredients for a divorce. There is enough stress and discord to totally tear this family apart. Luckily, hubby and I love each other and are determined to work through this situation to get Red out of here, thereby reducing the stress level. \n \nEverything has been neglected. \u00a0Our marriage, our sex life. \u00a0The house is clean, thanks to my mom paying a housekeeper, but it's like a freakin ghost town as far as upkeep and decor. We need to paint, inside and out. Furniture is falling apart. Blue is walking around in pajamas are now skin-tight, capri pants. I haven't bought him any new winter clothes. \u00a0I haven't even shopped for myself!  And I'm a shopping queen.  \u00a0The pajamas I'm wearing are at least 5 years-old. No holes in them yet, but I'm sick of looking at them! I don't have time, energy or focus on anything other than how I'm gonna get this clueless kid out of my house! \u00a0The bacon is just really the straw that is breaking my back. \n \nAs I was steaming, I thought what can I do to get my point across to this boy. Should I take his food and eat half of it so that he can see how it feels? \u00a0What should I do? He has got to learn. I have to be firm. \u00a0I decided that the consequence for his actions was that I refused to take him to the camera store after therapy that afternoon. \n \nHe tried his best to muster up a meltdown. I told him, \"Go ahead and have it. I don't care. \u00a0But if you don't get your shit together in the next half-hour, I will not be taking you to therapy either. I will just cancel or call your father and ask him to take you.\" \n NO!!! Not dad! \n \nSlowly he pulled it together. He apologized again and again, which I really didn't buy. \u00a0It felt like a manipulation to get me to change my mind about the camera store. \n \nWhen we finally got in the car to go to therapy, he had reconciled that we would not be stopping. \u00a0He ended up offering to take me to lunch --to a sit-down restaurant. \u00a0I mean, as in actually paying for my lunch, which he has NEVER done. \n \nQuite frankly, I told him I would think about it. I really didn't know if I wanted to sit down and have \u00a0meal with him. I was just so disgusted, I thought I might gag over lunch. \u00a0At the same time, I could really use a glass of wine to calm my fried nerves. \n \nWhile he was in therapy, I decided to accept his invitation. We went to the Cheesecake Factory. I ordered my wine. He asked to use my laptop to look something up, which meant I didn't have to listen to him perseverate. It was perfect! Until my phone started ringing over, and over and over again. \n \n \nMy mom called. Blue called. My husband called. My neighbor called. With everyone calling I figured there was some crisis and I better answer. \u00a0Mom wanted to tell me that the smoke detectors were going off. \u00a0My husband was gone and she couldn't reach him. Blue wanted to ask me to bring him something to eat.  So NOT happening.  My neighbor was having what she thought was either a panic attack or a heart attack and wanted me to check on her boys if she ended up in the hospital.  \n \nI told mom to send Blue next door to a neighbor to help with the smoke detectors. I talked my neighbor down to a calm state where she decided, she just might be o.k. But of course, I would check on her boys if need be. \n \nAfter that, I sent Red next door to Barnes and Noble and ordered a second glass of wine! I sat there alone, and tried to decompress a bit. \n \nOn the way home, we stopped by to check on my neighbor. \u00a0Luckily for her, she was resting and not up cooking for her boys. \u00a0Otherwise, I may have throttled her and given her that heart attack. \n \nI came home and crawled directly into bed. \u00a0Less than 5 minutes later, Blue came into my room screaming because his brother was singing in the shower. \u00a0I screamed louder than him.  Sometimes, you just have to out-meltdown your kid.  \u00a0I also added in a few expletives. *Warning, this could turn out badly, but in the moment, it felt like a chance worth taking. \n \n\"Do you want me to jump out of that fucking window? Well, you better get out of here and leave me alone!\" \n \nAfter an episode of the Beverly Hills Housewives, my nerves calmed a bit and I felt horrible about what I said to Blue. \u00a0I apologized this morning. \n \nThese are the confessions of a depressed, lunatic mom. \n \nJust one more thing, although I am pretty severely depressed these days, I want you all to know that I never consider hurting myself or others. \u00a0I do sometimes think about slapping Red silly. \u00a0Though I know it wouldn't do any good, other than making me feel a little better. \u00a0(That's humor for you literal people.) \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PScsPMihpMg/VH83xJZawSI/AAAAAAAABvo/V9AwdGSjhqc/s1600/10389123_10203002486492905_5058468233027770479_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-case-of-stolen-bacon.html", "title": "\nThe Case of the Stolen Bacon \n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, February 3, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nOnce upon a time, I could never imagine what happened yesterday. Blue started out like many with autism being a very, anxious, picky eater. So picky in fact, it was difficult for him to be around other people who were eating what he deemed to be \"disgusting food,\" with all of the colors and smells that came along with it. Throughout most of elementary school, he had a little office set up for the cafeteria, which was a three panel cardboard file that he would sit in front of him, blocking his front and peripheral view, so that he could sit at the end of the table, alone, to eat his hand packed lunch, while blocking out the sensory input from what everyone else was eating. He did not care about socializing during lunch. He just wanted to eat and get out of that cafeteria as soon as possible.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nCut to today, age soon to be 16, he has become a real foodie. His palate suddenly opened up when he hit middle school. This may or may not have had anything to do with the fact that he started taking medication for his anxiety. Now, he is willing to try anything! He loves to go to restaurants. In fact, he would eat almost every meal out, if we would let him. Although, he also cooks quite a bit here at home and not just for himself. He will make breakfast for the entire family. He has a good, balanced diet which includes many fruits and vegetables, even salads. Unlike his 19 year-old brother who is still pretty stuck on just a few basic, very plain, very boring foods.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo, there\u2019s a little cafe around the corner from our house. It has Cafe in the name, but I think that\u2019s just a nicer word for diner in this case. Blue went there with his dad for breakfast one day last week. He obviously enjoyed it, because yesterday he woke up and decided that he wanted to go back. This time, he didn\u2019t feel like he needed me, his dad or anyone to go with him.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nYep! So he took a shower, got dressed, headed out around the corner, down two blocks and across a major intersection (with no stoplight) to have breakfast in a restaurant \u2026alone! I don\u2019t think I dined in a restaurant alone, where there were actual waitresses who took your order and you had to leave a tip until I was in my twenties!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe ordered. Ate. Paid his bill, left a 15 percent tip and then walked back home (back across that major intersection). Alone! Like a boss! Major accomplishment! Big. Huge! And yes, I am proud! \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nThere is hope people! Never give up! I\u2019m even still hopeful that someday, Red will actually eat a more balanced diet. Hopefully, that will come when he has a wife to boss him around and tell him what to do.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XTLEkqTmoO4/VNEOKhVxuLI/AAAAAAAABx4/xHFDmimzSb4/s1600/1477398_558112804264964_743106194_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/02/check-please.html", "title": "\nCheck Please! \n"},
{"date": "Friday, February 13, 2015", "body": "\n \nHe didn't come home on the bus. He didn't call to say he was staying after school. He was just a no show. When I called to find out where he was he said, \n \n\"I'm sorry. I forgot to call you. I was upset. I got verbally attacked today by this girl.\" \n \nTurns out he stayed after to process through what happened with his Computer Science, teacher Mr. M., who also just happens to have Aspergers. \n \nAs many with Aspergers, Blue has a tendency to debate with people ...a lot. His views are almost always oppositional from the mainstream. He hates modern pop music! Rap music is disgusting in his view. Today's artists are not really talented. They all use autotune and sing about nothing important. \n \nWe live in Texas where football is everything. To him, football is a pointless game and all jocks are assholes. \u00a0Don't even bring up Country & Western music. \u00a0This is just a small sampling of how he thinks. \n \nHe's also a bit of a police officer of right and wrong and must inform everyone when they are wrong. It doesn't matter who it is -a teacher, another student, a good friend, a parent. We're all equal opportunity ignoramuses. \n \nA certain girl who happens to be in a number of his classes, has the need to call him out ...often, on his oppositional views. \u00a0She just can't stand his argumentative ways and she feels the need to constantly attempt to put him in his place. \u00a0As I've told him in the past, who knows what her issues are. I'm sure she has some.  \n \nOn this particular day, this young lady (and I used the term lady loosely) went off on an entire rant \u00a0about Blue in front of their whole Computer Science class, after Blue disagreed with the teacher. \u00a0The girl was not involved in the conversation. \u00a0The teacher was not offended, but she was. \n \nWhen he came home, he was still pretty livid. As we approached bedtime he started to spin himself up about what had happened. \"She's just a real b*tch! I hate her! And what's worse is she's smarter than me. Her class ranking in higher! She doesn't even work hard. Everything just happens naturally for her.\" \n \nIn the middle of his spin-up, in walks Red, the perfect target to dump his anger on. Before I know it, he's shouting at his brother, \u00a0Red posts up like Mr. Toughguy and the two of them are wrestling on the floor. \u00a0The same thing happens the following morning before school. These two big-ass boys are talking crap to each other, wrestling and they toss each other onto my couch! They're lucky it didn't just snap. \n\"I don't want to go to school!\" Blue shouts. \nI haven't heard that one yet this year. \n\"I don't want to have to deal with these kids! They think I'm stupid!\" \n \nOn our way to school in the car, I suggest that he talk to a counselor or a Vice Principal about this ongoing issue with the peer. \u00a0If the girl is making him feel uncomfortable and not want to come to school because of behaviors that have to do with his autism, he needs to let someone in authority talk to her and tell her to mind her own business. \n \nHe yells, at me! \"I can't do that! That won't help! You don't understand! I get on her nerves too! She will say that I can't mind  my  own business!\"  \n \nI give several suggestions as to how he could remedy the situation. All are met with, \"You don't get it mom! I know what I need to do.\" \n \nI get back home and e-mail his Case Manager letting him in on what's going on. Blue told me he wouldn't be able to talk to him, because he had a class that morning. I was concerned because the girl would be in his second period class. \n \nNo sooner than I sent the e-mail, my phone rings. It's Blue. \"I'm just checking in to let you know I have the matter resolved. I had a sit down conversation with the other student and my Computer Science teacher. We explained Aspergers to her and now she gets it. And it turns out she doesn't hate me.\" \n \nScratch the record! There was no reason for me to get involved. He's got this. He is going to be 16 years-old next week. \u00a0He is his own advocate. He doesn't need his mommy getting involved to solve his problems. Lesson learned.  \n \nDear Mom, \n \nPlease mind your own business. \n \n \nWithin moments of him making me feel like an idiot, for trying to come to his rescue when he doesn't need me to --I get a text from his brother. \"Mom I forgot my medicine can you bring it to me at the Community College?\" \n \n\"Um no. Your medicine is your responsibility. Instead of playing with the dog this morning, you should have been taking care of your business. You will have to survive without it.\" \n \nI'm learning! \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ihYvEhlB2yw/VN40EcdUKEI/AAAAAAAAByY/qHsy-mD-CzI/s1600/10612941_712473712162205_6040632799981437787_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/02/i-got-this.html", "title": "\nI Got This\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, November 12, 2014", "body": "\n \n This weekend we took Aspergers to a party and we really had fun! \n \n \n \n \n Pretty flowers from the party \n \n I realized last night, that the majority of my blog posts lately have been about Red. He has been the biggest pain in my ass -the source of most of my frustration \u00a0--and for that, he has received a lot of the limelight and attention lately. \u00a0It's sad but true. I hardly have anything left over after dealing with him. So poor Blue has been out there surviving the best he can, without much help from me. It's actually a really good thing. \n \n I have to say, while Red may be a quite a  Mama's Boy ,\u00a0Blue is so much more independent. It brings a huge smile to my face every morning as I hear him get up on his own, before I get out of bed. He goes downstairs, makes his breakfast, packs his lunch and is ready for school on time every single day! He is using his supports at school -his Case Manager, his favorite science teacher (who helped him start a club for kids on the spectrum), Mrs. E. who worked with him at home quite a bit over the summer. (She also teaches in the behavioral program at the high school.) \n \n I don't get phone calls from the high school during the day. \u00a0He handles his business, including his grades and homework with zero prompts from me! He even takes his showers without me reminding him. He and Red are like night and day.\u00a0 \n \n So over this past weekend, my best friend was having this fancy smancy party. Her teenage girls who Blue has known since he was a toddler were going be there, along with a number of their friends from school. Since I can never leave Blue and Red at home together I thought, lets bring Blue along .\u00a0 \n \n But what if it's socially awkward for him with the girls when they are surrounded by their high school friends? Then he'll just feel bad (and want to talk to me the whole time).\u00a0 Let's also bring his best friend Jake. At least they will have each other to talk to and hang out with. \n \n I love, love, love Jake! He is also on the spectrum. He is has such an inquisitive mind, a great sense of humor, a love of music and of course, he's not shy at.all.  \n The party is a blast! Jake jumps right in with every adult he meets saying, \"Hi. So did you go to high school in the 80's or the 70's? What year did you finish? So that makes you (such and such) age. (Which of course, he nailed on the head every time.\u00a0 Sorry ladies if you didn't want to talk about your age.)  \u00a0Did the kids where a lot of long hair back then? Did the guys have facial hair?\" And so on. \n \n Blue introduces Jake to the girls. \u00a0The boys were actually pretty social mostly with T's friends, who are in their last year of middle school. \u00a0According to Blue, they were a little more approachable than the high schoolers who were B's friends. \n \n There was a moment during the party when Blue came to me and says, I haven't had a chance to talk to B~ all day. She's been around all of her friends. \u00a0\" Guess what kid? I haven't talked to her mom (my best friend) very much either. She's entertaining a number of guests. I can't expect for her to stand around talking to me the whole time. That kind of comes along with the territory of a big party.\" \u00a0He got it and let it go for the moment. When things slowed down at the end of the night he finally got a few words in with B~.  \n \n The boys roamed around, enjoying the free flowing food, drinks and the live band. There was even a video game truck. Every once in a while, Jake would disappear. We would find him at the piano inside the living room of the house playing Beatles, Eagles and other 70's rock songs by ear. \u00a0 \n \n When the party ended and most of the guest left, we were invited to stay for more wine and hot pizzas. Jake pulled out his guitar and played. \u00a0The few people who lingered behind made requests and sang along. It was awesome! \n \n The funniest thing about the party that I noticed was that  I  actually had to take quite a few sensory breaks. There was a live band, and even a belly dancer who coaxed me out onto the dance floor for a little belly dancing lesson. \u00a0 Some of us have much more belly to work with than others. I'm just sayin.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n I met and had conversations with a lot of interesting people, including a Neuro Scientist ( totally held my own through that conversation ). After a while, I had to find a quiet place just to sit, hide and decompress. This NEVER happened to me when I was younger. I was always the life of the party. The more talking with friends, meeting people, dancing and drinking the better! \n \n I don't have Aspergers.I have self-diagnosed myself with A.D.H.D, which I've probably always had. I also have a smidgen of anxiety, that came along with motherhood. And yes ...I was the one who needed sensory breaks. \n \n My world has changed so much. As I approach 50,I am constantly barraged by noise, chatter, arguing, preaching, talking, fighting. \u00a0I no longer thoroughly enjoy the constant loud noise of a party or a nightclub. I have to find a quiet place to pull myself together (a bathroom, an empty chair in a corner.) I find a pet or a baby to play with. I'd much rather sit one on one having a glass of wine or a cocktail or three, with a few of my girlfriends than be at a big party. \n \n I have also given myself a diagnosis of P.T.T.D. (Post Traumatic Talking Disorder).  Really. It's a thing. Just ask any mom of an Aspie . \u00a0It comes from living in the war zone that I call home, where it is almost never quiet.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XhdyOp5wvVA/VGOdaNKo7QI/AAAAAAAABuE/WJQcIpGRydY/s1600/10346394_724396450969931_7218213085281752435_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/11/aspergers-at-party.html", "title": "\nAspergers at a Party \n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 4, 2014", "body": "\n \nThe fact that I have help create a real mama's boy has been slapping me in the face lately. \u00a0I own my part in the equation. \u00a0He's my firstborn. \u00a0He didn't come with a manual and all of the manuals I found, didn't seem to apply to him.  Yada yada yada.\u00a0 \n \nIn his lifetime he has faced so many more challenges than most people. \u00a0Most of his school experience was an exercise in pain, competition, isolation and rejection. \u00a0When your boy is obviously depressed in the fourth grade, so much so, that he says he wants to die. \u00a0When he says that he just wishes that he could just laugh like all of the other kids -naturally, you just want to do something about it. You want to do whatever you can to give him some semblance of happiness. \u00a0You want to give him a reason to smile. \u00a0You feel every inch of his pain and as a mother, you just want to alleviate it. \n \nI fought for him when he didn't \u00a0have the capacity to fight for himself. \u00a0When the school system was rigged  against  him and  for  the typical kids who fit into the mold, \u00a0I was compelled to level the playing field as much as possible. \u00a0Who else was going to do it? No one understands him the way that I do. \u00a0What's more, is most people don't even care. \u00a0Schools typically want to do what's easiest for them, not necessarily what is best for the special needs child. \n \nWhat I did not realize until recently, is that Red is a careful observer and much more cognizant of what's going on around him than I ever gave him credit for. He has seen over and over again how I run to his rescue. At some point in time, he decided to take full advantage of this. Probably a lot sooner than I could have ever believed. \n \nNow that we are suddenly staring down the barrel of manhood, I'm thinking,  'Crap! He's a total mama's boy!' He still wants me to do everything for him.  He has very little if any, motivation to grow up and take on responsibility for his life. \u00a0Why should he when he thinks he can just easily handover most of his responsibility to me? Why should he want to drive when he can be driven? He doesn't want the expense of a car because then his money may be too tight. \n \nPersonally, I wouldn't want to have to depend on someone to get where I'm going. I HATE waiting for people! But that's just me. Oh wait ...he does hate waiting for people, and will even have the nerve to rush them. \u00a0While he very seldom rushes to do anything himself. One of those Asperger's paradoxes I suppose. \n \nWhy should he want to live on his own when he has such a cushy life here? \n \nI swear, I couldn't wait to get away from my mother at his age. I wanted to come and go as I pleased without having to answer to anyone. He would prefer to stay here so that he won't have to struggle. Struggle is hard. \u00a0There are too many unknowns and that's scary.  OMG! What if he were not able to just buy everything that he wanted as soon as he wants it. \u00a0That would be tragic! \n \nHe still wants my attention all.of.the.time. He follows me around the house like a lost puppy. He will literally dial my phone number over and over again when I'm out of the house just to say, 'Mom where are you? When are you coming home?' One time I counted 37 calls back to back. \u00a0No. I don't answer. Sometimes, he drains my battery on my phone. Otherwise, \u00a0I just have to turn it off which then means, I can't even use it. \u00a0 That really pisses me off ! I finally got smart enough to block his number so that now, he has to leave a text or a voice message and I decide if it's important enough to call him back.  Who does that? Who has to block your kid's phone calls?\u00a0 \n \nHe still wants me to basically tuck him in at night. \u00a0We used to have \"me time\" when he was still in high school. \u00a0Now, \u00a0no matter how much I've talked to him all day, he wants me to come in and give him my undivided attention before he goes to bed. I'm over it.\u00a0 Hello! You're 19 years-old dude!  He wants me to continue doing for him, just as I have done for him all of these years. \u00a0Only now, he's  supposed  to be transitioning into manhood. \n \nIt's time to him to man up. \nIt's time for me to step back. \nIt's time for him to think and do for more for himself. \nIf the mama bird flies her nestlings around on her back all the time, why should they ever learn to fly? \nHe is no baby chick! It's time for him to take flight. \n \nOne step at a time, I am trying to cut the strings. \u00a0I make him responsible for more of his own transportation. \n \nHe wants to explore becoming a videographer. \u00a0So on his last video shoot, \u00a0he assumed that I had nothing else to do but be there with him for 5 hours!  Not. \n \nI said no right away. For one, I didn't appreciate his assumption that I was available especially, since he had been so disrespectful to me recently. \u00a0Secondly, I've been encouraging him to get more formal training --to intern or shadow a professional videographer. \u00a0He needs to learn more about the business aspect of running a business. \u00a0He needs to price his services to allow him to pay someone a small amount to assist him since he needs a little help with organization. He hasn't wanted to hear any of that, especially from me. Obviously, he has to learn by doing, even if that means making mistakes or failing. \n \n \nWhen the time came for the shoot, it was hard for me, but I had to let him fly solo. \n \nHe shot the Quincinera completely on his own. Beforehand, of his own accord, he did an online webinar so that he could be prepared. He made a Pre-Production Checklist and a Shot List. When he came home, \u00a0he actually felt pretty good about it. He met with a professional, more experienced \u00a0videographer who gave him some constructive criticism. \u00a0He realized where he made some mistakes and where he could use some improvement. \u00a0He even eluded to the fact that he needs more formal training, education and experience. \n \nWith my efforts to cut the strings ...he is actually  starting  to get it. He is behaving better because he knows, we do not have to allow him to continue to live here. He is beginning to see that he is indeed in charge of his life. With the support of his transition team, he now realizes that he needs to pay rent to live here and be more responsible for the decisions that he makes financially and as a roommate in our home.  \n \nI'm not saying it's easy to let go, but if I continue doing so much for him, I will find myself doing it for the rest of his life. \u00a0He needs to be prepared for the day that I am not around. Sometimes ...I have to let him fall and figure out how to pick himself back up.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4WYwExh-Zp4/VFFYWfI9Y2I/AAAAAAAABtQ/TeriDlu3w_w/s1600/10612941_712473712162205_6040632799981437787_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/11/mamas-boy.html", "title": "\nMama's Boy\n"},
{"date": "Monday, April 13, 2015", "body": "\n \n \n \nThe amount of growth Blue has gone through within the last year is extraordinary.  \nFrom the boy who called me a couple of times a week to come get him out of that f-ing high school... \n-to the boy who now calls me to process his feelings before he heads back to class. \nFrom the boy who had a meltdown every Wednesday morning because it was uniform inspection day in R.O.T.C. \n-to the boy who started his very own club for those who feel like they just don't fit in anywhere else. \nFrom the boy who thought all high school students were complete idiots because they think differently than he does... \n-to the boy who decided on his own, to start working on himself, trying to be more positive so that he can get along better with his peers. \n \n \n \nParents in my support community on  Facebook  have asked, \"What do you think is making such a big difference in him?\" I think there are a few factors in play: \n \n His hormones have balanced out some.  -In the past couple of years we were in the throes of puberty and raging hormones. I saw my sweet little boy turn into an evil teenager who hated everything. He was more aggressive than ever, especially with his brother who at the time, was bigger than him. It didn't stop him from regularly trying to knock the crap out of him. He is 16 now and I think we've made it past the crazy hormonal changes.\u00a0 \n \n \n We have\u00a0 medication that works  in place. We had DNA testing, which showed us that he has adverse reactions to SSRI's. Because of his anxiety over the years, we have tried a few of them. They seem to work for a while, and then end up not working, or making things worse. He can't take them. He now takes a psychotropic med that helps balance the anger and aggression. (I won't say specifically which one for his privacy). He also takes a mixture of vitamin supplements:\u00a0 \n \n \n Vayarin \u00a0(a medically prescribed vitamin food that helps with thought processing and focus) *Warning most insurance do not cover it.\u00a0 \n methylfolate B9 (helps with depression)\u00a0 \n vitamin D (mood)\u00a0 \n B6 (anxiety and mood),\u00a0 \n magnesium glycinate ( helps with his restless leg syndrome and sleep) along \n melatonin (sleep).\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Person Centered Planning  \u00a0 is a process where we come together with a facilitator, a group of mentors, teachers, parents and friends. ( Our facilitator is from the Special Education Department of our school district. As with most special programs, you have to ask for it. \u00a0They won't volunteer to give it to you. ) \u00a0As a group, we help Blue set individual short-term, life goals that help the him develop personal relationships, participate more in the community and develop the skills to take control of his own life. \u00a0 \n \nBlue struggles somewhat with self-esteem. Initially, depression and negative thinking would not allow him to see himself as successful. \u00a0He could not accept a compliment. Even with his excellent grades, he was constantly comparing himself to someone who he believes to be  better  than him. We put Person Centered Planning on board last year. \u00a0However, with his state of anxiety it didn't seem to help very much. He couldn't seem to focus and he really could not see the point of it all. \n \nAs we got him balanced out more hormonally and chemically, he started to get more into the process, scheduling his own meetings, without prompts and inviting more trusted mentors to participate in the process. \u00a0I am actually very proud of the mentor network that he has developed at school. \u00a0He is definitely his mama's son!  Except for the whole math and science thing. He's excellent. Me ...not so much.\u00a0 \n \nDuring the first step in each meeting, we go over  Celebrations . What has the individual accomplished over the past number of weeks since the last time we met? Nothing is too big or too small. \n \n \n Blue's Celebrations on Paper \u00a0 \n \n \nThis year in his more balanced state of mind, he is able to concretely see the things that he is accomplishing. \u00a0He sees that his accomplishments are to be celebrated. He has expanded his planning team beyond just me and dad, to 3 additional teachers/mentors whom he respects. \u00a0When he hears their praises and then sees them in writing, it makes him feel so much better about himself. \n \nHe floored me when he decided to make one of his goals to become a more positive person. \u00a0He didn't like the way that he was being perceived when he repeatedly started arguments with peers and always had to let everyone know of his opposing views. He wanted to change that. \n \nAnother goal that I love that he set was to try to understand the way his brother Red thinks, in hopes to get along with him better. That's a work in progress for both of us. Red definitely has a different perception of the world and his place in it. \n \nI could go on all day about the positive things that I've seen happen with him this year, like his development of friendship with female peers, but that's a whole other blog post. \u00a0I have to leave something for you to look forward to the next time. \n \n*If you haven't joined my Facebook Support page you really should.

{"date": "Tuesday, March 3, 2015", "body": "\n \n \nDo you ever have those moments when you think ...I just can't do this anymore? I can't take another step forward. I don't know what else to do. I got nothing left! Yeah. Me too.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nLast night I went to bed feeling defeated \u2026like giving up. I just can\u2019t not do this job anymore. I quit. There is nothing left in my bag of tricks. I\u2019m usually pretty resourceful and intuitive when it comes to figuring out what my kids need, but I\u2019m fresh out of ideas. In fact, I have too many ideas and can\u2019t seem to make any concrete decisions. I'm dazed and confused. I just don\u2019t feel like I have it within me to make another decision about another person\u2019s life.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nRed is afraid of failure.\u00a0 \n \nI\u2019m afraid of him failing.\u00a0 \n \nI know that he needs support.\u00a0 \n \nI\u2019m afraid to let go of control.\u00a0 \n \nI\u2019m afraid that he will blame me when the shit all hits the fan.\u00a0 \n \n\u201cYou forced me into this, now look whats happened,\u201d he\u2019ll say.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWell, what\u2019s new? He blames me for everything that\u2019s ever gone wrong in his life and gives me no credit for anything good that has ever happened. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe truth is the child is no longer a child. He can only be guided. We can push \u2026but he can push back. He has legal rights now whatever the f*#& that means.\u00a0Yes. I know we could go for guardianship. Of course, we would have to prove incapacity. There are definite pros and many cons. For now, we have Power of Attorney so that we can help guide him.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI can get together all the resources in the world, but he actually has to want them and accept them, and he is as stubborn as hell! He may not be smart enough to know exactly what to do, or how to get everything done, but he is damn sure smart enough to figure out how to get  out   of doing whatever he doesn\u2019t want to do. He\u2019s an expert at finding a backdoor -another way out.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe straw that led to my feeling of hopelessness last night was the fact that hubby left to go to Dallas for business. That gave Red the idea that he had free rein to wreak havoc in the house. He was the prickly needle who poked and prodded at Blue until he blew. It doesn\u2019t take much, because Blue has zero tolerance or patience when it comes to his brother\u2019s annoyances. The fighting between them is indeed a two-way street. The difference is, Blue doesn\u2019t fight with his brother for pure entertainment of it. He\u2019s usually trying to make a point or teach his big brother something. They are always trying to prove the other one wrong. The argument usually turns into someone knocking someone upside the head.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI had to pull out the crazy black woman on their asses after hubby left. I was simply in no mood. Every once in a while, I have to make them think I have completely lost my mind, so they will stop the non-sense in their tracks. Yes...this little five foot, nothing woman threatened to pull out a can of whoop-ass and start swinging their father\u2019s belt in any which direction where there was a teenager in close proximity. If you don\u2019t move\u2026you lose. You best believe they took their butts directly to their prospective rooms.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAfterwards, I was the one who felt just whipped. I'm just so tired of the fights. All of them. I'm a lover not a fighter. \n \nUnfortunately, I live in a houseful of mens, and mens love to fight.  *In my Sophia from \"The Color Purple\" voice. \n \n \n \nBefore I could crack my eyes open this morning, Red is knocking at my door. I couldn't believe it. He usually does not get up that early. I tried to ignore it, but it got louder. When I didn\u2019t get up to let him in, he starts rattling the door and pushing it. He was getting so loud, in comes little brother who hates to see him hassling me. So again, World War Three is about to break out at 7 o'clock in the freakin morning!\u00a0 Did I say my eyes were barely open? \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nOn the way to school Blue says to me, \u201cHow much longer do we have to live like this? I want you to know, I\u2019m not fighting with him on purpose just to upset you. I just can\u2019t take the way he treats all of us anymore. He changes me. I\u2019m different when I\u2019m around him. I don\u2019t feel like this around any other person.\u201d I have to say, I feel the same way. I love Red and I have more patience for him than anyone else on this earth, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter anymore.\u00a0I can't give him enough. He appreciates nothing. Nothing I do, makes his behavior any better. \n \n \n \nWhen I get home, I'm sitting in my car as I do most mornings, in a stupor. I text my husband, \u201cI\u2019m done. I can\u2019t do this anymore. You\u2019re going to have to handle him.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMoments later, Red pulls away with Transportation services. I realize he will be home again in just a couple of hours. He only has class today and nothing else. I literally cannot take it. I cannot have him here all day. And why should I have to leave my own house to avoid him?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt hits me. Call the high school and talk to Mr. M. to see if Red can come volunteer in his class this afternoon. Mr. M. runs the class for kids with special abilities at Red's old high school. Red used to volunteer in there before he graduated. Thank God Mr. M. agrees to have him come. I arrange to have Red dropped off there by transportation, so he can\u2019t come home and refuse to go.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHours pass. I don't hear from him and I am so thankful. I had enough time to get my head together to think about my next moves for him and do some research. Then, I actually took a break from thinking about his crap, showered, washed my hair and had a Stevie Wonder, Pandora station dance party. I can sing just like him you know ...in my shower anyway.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe phone rings. It\u2019s Red. \n \n \n \n\u201cYou know you were right Mom. This was a really good idea to structure my time doing something positive. I feel much better now that I\u2019m here helping the kids and thinking about someone other than myself.\u201d \n \nUm ...w ho the hell is this and what have you done with my kid?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWell, holy crap! This boy is definitely a great smooth talker. He certainly knows the right thing to say. He gets that from his dad. Now, if he could only actually  DO  some of the right things on a regular basis, he may just get to live to see the age of 20.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nDuring this conversation he was so lucid, it was a little strange. He also agreed that it\u2019s a good idea to look at group homes until we find the right fit. He said, \u201cI have to keep structuring my time so that I stay busy until we find the right place because I don\u2019t want you to kick me out and I end up in a shelter. The food would probably be horrible there.\u201d\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI\u2019ll believe it when I see it actually happen. In the meantime, I think I\u2019ll have him put that all in writing. And I definitely know my next move.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe moral of this story ...just when you're about to give up. Don't. Or maybe you should give up as in, stop doing everything for them. The answers are coming. They may just be  his  to figure out. Sooner or later they have to own their own shit.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt's our job to lay the ground work.

{"date": "Friday, October 11, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n One of my favorite bloggers asked me to write a guest post for her and I was happy to oblige. I asked her if she wanted something specific and groaned under my breath as she answered. \u201cCan you write something about making your marriage work? You and Julie do such an amazing job with each other\u201d\u2026 \n \n \n \n Thanks. Can\u2019t you get a chick to write that? \n \n Who on Earth would want my opinion on that? \n \n \n \n But, she was right. I read these alarming statistics about divorce and autism. I\u2019m friends with several single moms (and dads, yes they do exist) raising at least one child with special needs. I\u2019m friends with several married moms and dads that, sadly, have very little to do with each other, or with their child\u2019s diagnosis. \n \n \n \n In our house, we\u2019ve flipped the script. We decided to cross cast the roles that were available for the show. After our daughter was born (2010) and our son (2006) was starting his therapy journey, it became evident that one of us would need to be at home. Julie had the much better job (and future within), so it was going to be me.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Thing is, I kind of suck at this. In addition to attending almost 3 years of daily therapies and schools and play dates and birthday parties and the such, I now had the responsibilities of the classic \u201chousewife\u201d\u2026 namely cooking and cleaning. Cooking? Meh? But cleaning? Next please. \n \n \n \n Suddenly, life became unfair (from my point of view). She got to go out and work this fun, rewarding, and stimulating job, making a name for herself. And my success was now deeply coinciding with how well my children were doing\u2026 and one of them is autistic!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n If I were the one out working ridiculously long hours, society would see me as a hero! Look at how well that dad provides for his family! He must really love his wife to work so hard!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Worse yet, the comments she gets\u2026 \u201cIt must kill you to be away from your kids so much\u201d, \u201cHow can you leave your kids with a man who still thinks farts are funny\u201d. \n \n \n \n *** \n \n We spend a lot of time teaching \u201cperspective-taking\u201d with our son. We constantly drill him with questions like \u201chow does he feel\u201d and \u201cwhat does she think\u201d and \u201cwhat do you think he should do\u201d and \u201chow does that make you feel\u201d.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Perhaps we should all drill ourselves. \n \n \n \n ***\u00a0 \n \n None of those things bother me. I painted a picture of an absent, workaholic mother, and a bitter, stay-at-home loser father. \n \n \n \n The truth is that both of us are pretty happy in our roles. We\u2019re both pretty good at telling each other when we are either envious or, more importantly, NOT envious of these duties.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \u201cI have to file an MSJ, so I\u2019ll be working late tonight\u201d \n \n \u201cSucks to be you. I\u2019m cleaning up the bathroom, again, because someone can\u2019t learn to shit in the potty\u201d \n \n \u201cSucks to be you\u201d \n \n \n \n Where I really score a double-win is with our special needs child. I think we\u2019ve done a wonderful job splitting duties\u2026 almost diabolically so. \n \n \n \n Yes, I do almost all the therapies and the schoolwork and the such, but my wife does all the organizing. She sets the appointments. She writes the emails. She fights with the\u00a0 regional center. The really important stuff, we do together. What we\u2019ve established is a great \u201cgood cop/bad cop\u201d scenario. I go to the meetings and raise my voice to the point that they want to talk to the mother, the reasonable one. Little do they know, that reasonable one is so much smarter than the other, so much more of an advocate, and very involved and versed in what we need for our son.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n And I go to her first when we need it. Very few decisions are made without lengthy (God are they lengthy) discussions about what we both think. We make an unspoken pact to make a decision, and don\u2019t allow ourselves to second guess it once that decision has been reached mutually, because that can lead to a lot of doubt and/or blame\u2026 which ain\u2019t healthy for anyone. \n \n \n \n ***\u00a0 \n \n This was supposed to be about making a healthy marriage last in the time of autism, so I guess I should give some advice? I feel like the oldest couple at a wedding being asked what makes marriage work. So, my advice\u2026 \n \n \n \n I have no effin\u2019 clue. I can tell you why I have a good marriage. I can tell you why either Julie or I don\u2019t leave in the face of adversity, but I don\u2019t know if it applies. When people ask me \u201chow do you do it?\u201d I always have the same answer. You just do. Julie and I know no differently. Our family is just that\u2026 OURS. Does having a son with autism make our lives harder than yours? Does having a stay-at-home-dad make our life more challenging than yours? Does having mom at work for hours and hours make our life more lonely than yours? \n \n \n \n Of course not. It\u2019s just what it is. \n \n \n \n Perspective. \n \n \n \n *** \n \n Here are the things we do well in our marriage: \n \n \n \n Advice for men: \n \n \n \n Remember, your wife loves and hates her \u201crole\u201d as much as you do yours. Respect that! \n \n Women think differently than you do. They react emotionally. They come home to a dirty house disappointed in you. They grow further disappointed that you couldn\u2019t figure out that\u2019s why they were disappointed on your own. So instead of getting pissy back (cause we ain\u2019t ever gonna\u2019 understand them), simply ask \u201cwhat would you like?\u201d and do it. Cuts the second half of that argument out completely. \n \n Women like to be complimented\u2026 especially when they don\u2019t have to fish for them. You should wake up every morning and say \u201cYou look beautiful\u201d or \u201cYour MSJ was brilliant\u201d or \u201cI really like the living room furniture you picked out last Christmas\u201d. It will make their day. \n \n \n \n Advice for women: \n \n \n \n We are immature. We all think farts are funny, like beer, and a good off-color joke. Accept that. It ain\u2019t gonna\u2019 change. \n \n Before you get disappointed because we couldn\u2019t figure out how you were feeling on our own, tell us. Really saves a lot of time. Before you leave for work say \u201cI would like you to take all that crap to the Goodwill today\u201d instead of being disappointed that we didn\u2019t figure that out on our own when you get home and there\u2019s still a pile of crap in the front closet. \n \n We really like you telling us what you like in bed. I can guarantee it will not disappoint us (unless it involves George Clooney\u2026 feel free to keep that to yourself) \n \n \n \n *** \n \n Lives change. Roles change. Circumstances change. \n \n \n \n I want you to remember, every day, what made the younger version of yourself want to be with\u00a0 your spouse for the rest of your life.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Chances are, despite whatever dynamics have occurred, it\u2019s still there. \n \n \n \n *** \n \n I started dating my wife in 1997.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n In 2005 I married her.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I married the nicest and most empathetic human being I had ever known. I truly felt lucky to be with her. \n \n \n \n When Jack was a baby (2006) he came home from the hospital with a pretty bad case of jaundice. My wife and I took him to the pediatrician as brand-new first time parents and were told to put him on home phototherapy.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Those were the two longest days of my life. We stayed up worrying for him. It was the first time I ever truly had to put the needs of another in front of mine. \n \n \n \n But my wife had been doing that since she married me\u2026 \n \n \n \n And I finally understood the beauty of true empathy. \n \n \n \n \n Jordan and Family Aren't they gorgeous?! \n \n \n \n Editorial Note:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I have been married to the father of my children for nearly 20 years. \u00a0Although in many ways we have an excellent partnership, lately I've been feeling very alone in the details of raising our 2 teen boys on the spectrum. \u00a0It seems that these teen years have them butting heads with their father more often than not. \u00a0It has been very strenuous on our entire family. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I was looking for answers and quite frankly, and Jordan came to mind. \u00a0He and his wife Julie have younger children, and haven't been married as long as we have. \u00a0However, they seem to have an  excellent partnership.  \u00a0I wanted to see what he could share with those of us who are struggling through this journey of marriage and raising kids with special needs. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n He did a brilliant job! \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I hope that you will read this and share it with your partner in life.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n You can find more of Jordan's writing about his family at\u00a0 Find My Eyes . \u00a0He also gives awesome updates on\u00a0 facebook/FindMyEyes \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pmArwjYWfnw/Ulg77tXS4NI/AAAAAAAABT0/0X1KRjME2wM/s1600/1371539_623910484328126_364953600_n.jpg", "http://phatjaye.blogspot.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/FindMyEyes"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/10/love-in-time-of-autism-guest-post-by.html", "title": "\nLove In The Time Of Autism -Guest Post by Jordan of Find My Eyes\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, January 1, 2014", "body": "\n \nIt didn't always feel like it, but in 2013 Our family did manage to make a lot of progress. \u00a0Blue started high school and came through his first semester with a killer GPA, despite the fact that \"teachers are mean and give him bad grades.\" \n \nRed actually, completed high school his high school credits and turned into a legal adult. \u00a0He is now 18. He grew spiritually as he attended a two-week Christian camp for kids on the autism spectrum. \u00a0He returned home, a person who no longer choses to express himself by using curse words. \u00a0He's also fixated on Christianity and how come the rest of of us are not as hardcore into our faith as he is. \u00a0You gotta take the good with the ...not so good I guess. \n \n \nI wrote some killer blogs in 2013. \u00a0The most popular blog by far was written in July after the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman verdict. \u00a0 \"On This Night\" \u00a0was\u00a0about how I felt tucking my own African American boys into bed, the night to the verdict. \n \nI\u00a0was featured and published on several additional autism/parenting blogs and various media outlets, including an interview that I did for Facebook media relations after I wrote the blog,\u00a0 My Facebook Life  . \u00a0The article I wrote about my online support groups was featured\u00a0on  She Knows.com \u00a0  \n \nI also had an essay accepted for publication in an upcoming book written about parenting kids with hidden disabilities.  \n \nI was featured on a  Blog Talk Radio show, \"Back to Us\" ,\u00a0where I discussed Special\u00a0Education Advocacy for parents.  \n \nThe online support private support group I created actually thrived and became a lifeline for so many parents raising kids on the spectrum. \u00a0As well, for those on the spectrum themselves or with someone in their lives with Aspergers.  \n \n \n \n \n \nHubby did his usual working his ass off to make sure that financially all of these things were possible. \u00a0He turned the big 50 this year and we had a great party to celebrate it. \u00a0We then took a trip to L.A. for the Playboy Jazz Festival and visited with my family and some of our best friends. \u00a0This was one of the best 2 weeks of the year! I will always and forever be a California girl. \n \nIt has been an extremely rough year for Blue. \u00a0His hormones, anxiety and anger have been completely off the charts, especially since high school started. \u00a0To be honest, trying to get him figured out and emotionally balanced turned our lives completely upside down for a good part of the year. \u00a0We've been living in an explosive world. \u00a0There were countless phone calls from school, plenty of days, missed, and countless meetings held at school, in therapy and with his doctor to try to help him navigate through this tumultuous time.  \n \nHonestly, dealing with the changes Blue has been going through this year left me exhausted and exasperated. \u00a0We have all been living, walking on eggshells, waiting for the next anger-filled, volatile, \u00a0meltdown. \n \nWhere I wanted to rev up my writing this year and actually get started on writing a book, I was forced to take my writing down a notch. \u00a0Where I wanted to have a daily exercise routine, including yoga and Zumba, I was often too spent to leave the house to go work out after getting them off to school. \u00a0It's unbelievable how much energy it takes to juggle these two boys out the door in the mornings. \u00a0It's like playing a game of chess with pieces that explode if you make the wrong move. \n \nI became pretty depressed. \u00a0There was hardly any time or energy for anything fun, or social. \u00a0There was little mental energy left for planning, and getting away to get much needed breaks, even though I needed them  more than ever! \n \nWhen things seemed to go from bad to worse with Blue, internally I blamed myself for not being able to figure out how to help him. \u00a0All kinds of fears and self-doubt seeped into my being. \u00a0The daily deluge of negativity, self-loathing, anxiety and fear became contagious in our house. \u00a0Many days I felt lower than low. \n \nThe luxury of hiding underneath the covers for months on end, was not on the table. \u00a0I had to press forward, try to put on the happy face, try to be loving and encouraging to both boys, while feeling like absolute crap myself. \u00a0Hours upon hours were spent driving them back an forth to therapy, doctors appointments, academic and social activities. \u00a0All while my personal and professional life was at a sad, pathetic, standstill.  \n \nDuring this dark period, I spent a lot of time wondering about friendships that seemed to have dissipated. \u00a0My closest girlfriends that live here in Texas seemed to almost completely disappear from my life. \u00a0Daily, in my depths of despair, fear and self-loathing, I wondered what I had done to bring these friendships to this place. \u00a0In the quiet moments I wondered,  why doesn't she reach out to me anymore?  I asked myself this over and over and over again. \n \nOccasionally, I would muster up the courage to reach out to my girlfriends with a phone call or a text. \u00a0I would usually get a text back. \u00a0But never ...a phone call. \u00a0I experienced various emotions about what feels like a loss. \u00a0I had lots of internal dialog about it. \u00a0I attributed the gravity of my negative thoughts to my own depression. \u00a0 It could be nothing. \u00a0It could just be my imagination. What could I do about it? \u00a0I didn't have the time or the energy to fix these broken-down relationships. \n \nI am blessed with many true friends that I have had over most of my life. \u00a0It wasn't until having these children that I actually experienced the friends who simply moved on. \u00a0I guess that's an aspect of adulthood, especially adulthood when the day to day of your life requires so much time and attention because of the responsibility of raising my high-needs children.  \n \nSometimes I wonder, if I were still in L.A. with friends that I've had for most of my life, would our friendships break down because of the demands of our adult lives? Hopefully, I will never know. \u00a0I am still in close contact with all of my L.A. friends. \u00a0Some now are in other parts of the country, but we always manage to connect and pick right back up where ever we leave off. \u00a0There is always reaching out, and it is NEVER one-sided. \n \nIn fact, when I'm in L.A. all of my girls make time for me. \u00a0They have me to their homes. \u00a0We lunch, we dinner, we spa together. \u00a0Several of them have come to Texas, or we've met for girls trips in various locations. \u00a0Most recently, my girlfriend Mary came to Houston for business. \u00a0Months ahead of time, she contacted me to make sure that we could get together while she was in town. \u00a0In November we met for a fabulous weekend get-away. \u00a0I also got to see one of my Asperger mommies while I was there for brunch. \n \nAt the same time all of this was going on, \u00a0I began to strengthen my online friendships with other moms like me. \u00a0Women who feel my pain, who I could be totally honest with because in many ways we live the same lives. \n \n \n \nMy friend Kathleen in Denver became a lifeline for me, not just online, but I could call her if I needed to talk. \u00a0Kathleen has 3 sons, just like I do, with a range of diagnosis from ADHD, to bi-polar, to Aspergers. \u00a0Not only can she feel my pain, she lives my pain. \u00a0Yet, she was always there to comfort and encourage me. \u00a0She is such a positive light and loving spirit. \u00a0I couldn't have made it through the year without her. She even wrote a very successful guest post for me titled\u00a0 \"If You Really Knew Me\" . \n \n \n \n \n \n Elena sharing a bottle of wine with me \n \n \n \n \nMy kindred sister and friend Elena, lives in Miami. \u00a0We have yet to meet in person. She too has 3 sons, with issues. \u00a0She writes these beautiful words of encouragement in a blog called  \"The Laid Back Cloud of Peace\" , which always speak directly to my heart.\u00a0She also reaches out to me on the phone, and online almost daily. \u00a0She puts a smile in my heart and on my face. \u00a0I love and follow the stories of her 3 boys, as if they are my own. \u00a0Especially her youngest, we call G3. \u00a0All of her boys names start with the letter G. \u00a0She is crazy as all get out! Yet, she is brilliant, and has such a loving heart and spirit. \u00a0We drink together from across the miles. \u00a0I so look forward to the day when our paths will physically cross. \u00a0That's going to be a beautiful day. \n \nElena also wrote a guest post for me, titled\u00a0 \"Hope\" . \u00a0You can get to know her story by reading it and/or checking out her blog. \n \nEach friend crazier than the next, brings me to my friend Sam who lives in New York. \u00a0She had an extremely rough year, going through a divorce and temporarily losing custody of 2 of her children in the process. \u00a0Now part of me thought,  I don't have the time or energy for that! \u00a0But my heart said otherwise. \u00a0Helping her, being a support for her helped me. \u00a0The first time, I heard her sweet little New York, jewish voice on the phone, my heart melted and I fell in love with her. \u00a0Even though there were days she was at her lowest of lows, she still encouraged me, listened to me and I tried to do the same for her.  \n \n \n Sammy\u00a0@ the Beach \n \nSam kept me going through the summer with her days at the beach. \u00a0She would always post pictures. \u00a0I would encourage her to get off the couch, and go out and enjoy life, even during this most difficult time. \u00a0It's funny how I can live vicariously through my friends and encourage them to do things that I couldn't even do myself. \u00a0 Sammy is another lifeline that kept me going in 2013.  \n \nI am so blessed to have so many friends, both online, and across the miles, \u00a0so many that I can not mention them all in this post. \u00a0I value my friends like no other treasure on this earth. Some I have had for a lifetime, some for a short time. \u00a0I appreciate that our paths have crossed that you have loved me and I you. \n \n \n \n Me and Jen \n \nThis summer also met my white sister Jen through one of my online blogging networks. \u00a0Jen lives in Ohio. \u00a0She actually came to Texas to visit her mom and we got the chance to meet. \u00a0I got to hang out with her girls, and her mom down near San Antonio. \u00a0We had a blast.  \n \nI have to give an honorable mention to my brother Jim of\u00a0 Just a Little Blog . \u00a0Jim also helps me run my private support group. \u00a0According to him, he does all the work, along with the 4 other Admins. \u00a0Many a day, he is my only reason for laughing. \u00a0His daily antics with something as simple as an apple or an orange, can have me in stitches. \u00a0He may never know how much his fruit means to me. \u00a0(Inside joke...sorry). \n \nI can't go without mentioning my online support groups of parents, bloggers, and adults and teenagers with Aspergers that I have come to know and love this year. \u00a0How awesome is it, to be able to log in at anytime and get feedback and support from other people who really get it? \n \nSo even though I am sad about friendships that seem to have lost their way. I have to see it as perhaps it's just not the season for those relationships. \u00a0It's hard, and I feel so alone some days. \u00a0I pray that the season for them will come back around. \u00a0Until then, I can not worry about what I may have done, or not done to make things fall apart. \u00a0I know that I have a loving heart and that I am a person who does good in the world. \u00a0I am a friend you should want in your corner. \u00a0In fact, I'm the best.  \n \nUntil things come around, or the seasons change, I will try to remain positive, continue to help my children through these difficult years, and count the blessings, the support systems, the friends and the family who walk through my life, and help keep me afloat.  \n \nI will fill my life with simple pleasures that make me feel something good about each and every day. \u00a0In 2014, I hope to be able to keep myself on the priority list. \u00a0To make strides in my writing. \u00a0To grow spiritually, and to take care of me. \u00a0I want to go back to my art lessons and make yoga and meditation a part of my daily life. \n \nEven though everyday when I look in the mirror, I don't always see an awesome human being staring back at me. \u00a0Sometimes, I see ... Ugh! You again. How did you get so old? What happened to your skin? \u00a0How can you be so lame as to let these children completely take over you life? \u00a0 \n \nDeep inside I know that my heart is pure. \u00a0I am enough. \u00a0I am worthy. \u00a0I do do good things in this world and I am loved by many. \n \nMy apologies now, if I did not mention you personally. \u00a0However, please know that if you are reading this ...I love you. \u00a0I appreciate you. \u00a0I look forward to continuing this journey together in this new year.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1009023/social-media-help-for-parents-of-kids-with-special-needs", "http://www.blogtalkradio.com/back2us/2013/08/11/back2usshoweducational-advocacy-101-for-parents", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7cbZcUpGTUs/UsTh2Q51c8I/AAAAAAAABZM/UeFXHFvTUrs/s1600/8491_4853705670300_735970003_n.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zxGtBRaBg6A/UsTe2c5k63I/AAAAAAAABY4/lMuySAP0yVc/s1600/1517513_10201658271671229_1612917691_n.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qd4xDgaCQug/UsTd7o_GrmI/AAAAAAAABYo/clxSSMu-VYs/s1600/541361_10151489207339194_165994715_n.jpg", "http://thelaidbackcloudofpeace.blogspot.com/", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_bNPWAc1xh4/UsTp3IaUy2I/AAAAAAAABZY/ehq2I3ildNA/s1600/1175474_10201713382181284_645978384_n.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-j54mLDNDvbY/UsTd7okIO-I/AAAAAAAABYw/3-KN_hX-l7U/s1600/969077_10152882368685284_130637581_n.jpg", "http://blogginglily.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/01/2013-its-wrap.html", "title": "\n2013 It's a Wrap\n"},

I need a personal assistant to help me be everyone's personal assistant.\" \n \nAll week long, I have been putting out small fires in one of the online communities that I run. \u00a0I have been spending more time than I have available, being a resource to others. \u00a0Which by the way, is one of my favorite things to do, but it puts me behind schedule for other priorities in my life. \n \nI have done some work on the outline of my book, but not nearly enough. I don't like the direction of the outline. \u00a0It is boring me. \u00a0I want to tell our story, but in a fun, unique, funny way. \u00a0I don't want it to be just your ordinary Aspergers parenting book. \u00a0I feel like I need a good block of time, to sit, play music and really think about the direction I want this book to go in, and hash-out the outline. It just feels like a massive task. \u00a0I do better with small snippets - like this blog .  \n \nMy advice to myself, is to just take it in small pieces. \u00a0One step at-a-time, and you will get there. \u00a0Only I feel like my steps have been minimal because of all kinds of distractions, including my Facebook addiction. \u00a0If I could drop that bad habit, I'd be further down the line to where I need to be.  Loser! \n \nI am behind in my own self-care. \u00a0My hair needs to be colored, twisted and perhaps even cut and it's been that way for over a week. \u00a0I've been hiding behind pretty, silk scarves, and head wraps. \u00a0What lies underneath is scary! My nails need to be done. \u00a0If you follow me on Facebook, you know that my toes are my \"pretty girly thing\" that I try to do for myself on a regular basis. \n \nAlso, I probably really need to see my doctor. \u00a0I feel bad. \u00a0Then I feel good, and so I put if off. \u00a0I know what her advice will be... \n-Add more cardio into your daily routine. \n-Eat healthier.  \n-Take more time for yourself. \nThat's what she said the last time. \u00a0I followed her directions for about a week.  \n \nSo today ...I am over scheduled with shit for other people. \u00a0Red made a doctors appointment to talk about a weight loss program that will work for him. \u00a0I take him at 1:15 today. \u00a0Then I take him to work.  \n \nI then go pick up my mom and take her to get  her  nails done. \u00a0Why? Because I've already been putting her off for 2 weeks. \u00a0Yes. I've put myself off too. \u00a0But who cares about that? \u00a0(No. I will not be getting my own nails done today. \u00a0While she's getting hers done, I have to go back and pick Red up from work.) \n \nMy mom told me 2 weeks ago that I \"treat her like shit,\" because she's really just sad, isolated and depressed, which is really not my problem. \u00a0This is the life that she has created. \u00a0I know that it's her and not me, but still. I guilt myself into doing things for her that I really DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR. \u00a0But she's my mother. \u00a0She's 74. \u00a0She doesn't drive. \u00a0She lives with me. \u00a0So I play the part of the dutiful daughter. \n \nA big part of my problem is just plain old disorganization \u00a0-Attention Deficit Disorder at it's best. \u00a0I really think my life would be so much simpler if I were just an organized person.  \n \nI am full of self-loathing today. \u00a0I feel like an overwhelmed, scatterbrained, idiot. \n \nSo in order, not to bite anyone's head off this afternoon, I will take a brief nap now. That will be the extent of my self-care for today. \n \nAnyone out there have some advice on how to become organized? I would love to hear it. \u00a0I can not however, promise you that I will follow it for more than a week.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fHZ_HXayG_E/Uwd9lNycO7I/AAAAAAAABbM/tZaBhqUVYos/s1600/1781896_588540901222154_684905581_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/02/slap-me-now.html", "title": "\nSlap Me Now\n"},

{"date": "Tuesday, March 26, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nIt was one of those mornings where I did not want to get out of bed. \u00a0The night before, by the skin of our teeth, we were able to have an evening out. \u00a0We had tickets to see Alicia Keys in concert. \u00a0Yeah...o.k. --so what if we were the old people in the crowd. \u00a0You know the people who needed earplugs, because although her voice was beautiful, the music was so damned loud, I thought my eardrum might burst. \n \nThe week had been more stressful than usual, if one is to believe that is possible. \u00a0I had a pre-IEP meeting for Red...where we tried to put together an elaborate plan to get him through graduation next year. \u00a0Guess what? \u00a0They want to get him out of there early. \u00a0That high-school campus and Red are like fire and dynamite. \u00a0I am praying that he will thrive once he gets out of that hot bed of social landmines --the cliques and the couples, the popular people that he wants so desperately to be one of. \u00a0He has been spending the majority of his time this year focusing on this social-nonsense. \u00a0In fact, when asked in the pre-I.E.P. meeting, what he would like to accomplish within the next year, he said, \"I want to be popular!\" \u00a0That's it! That's all! \u00a0No -I want to graduate, or I want to get more video editing experience. \u00a0Just -I want to be popular. \u00a0 You know ...the impossible. \u00a0That's what I want. \u00a0He says that's what he wants yet, his actions will bring about the polar opposite popularity.  \n \nAfter our after our long, drawn out, planning meeting, I drag my tired self to get something to eat, and drink at the place 'where everybody knows my name.' \u00a0I had just ordered an afternoon margarita and lunch when I get the phone call ... da da dum!!!! Drum roll please! \n \n\"...I think you need to come and get him. \u00a0We've never seen him quite like this. \u00a0He is cursing and yelling and he is not backing down. \u00a0He cursed at another AP and we don't want all of these folks to get involved in the situation,\" says his teacher. \n \n Great! Cancel that drink that I desperately need! Bring me the food though. \u00a0I'm going to need my energy.   \n \nI'm shaking both from exhaustion and anxiety as I drive back to the school. \u00a0I find Red in a completely manic state. \u00a0He is making some pretty explicit threats of self-harm. \u00a0It seemed that there was no backing down, even after I arrive. \u00a0The campus officer ends up coming to have a chat with him. \u00a0There is something about that uniform, gun, and taser that calms him down pretty damn quick. \u00a0The officer is pretty awesome with him ...he is not antagonistic or threatening. \u00a0He is actually, unbelievably nice and supportive. \u00a0He brings Red back down to earth to the point where I can take him home. \n \nBy the time we get home, he is physically and emotionally drained. \u00a0I am able to get him to lay down and within minutes...he is fast asleep. \u00a0Meanwhile, I'm on the phone to his doctor and therapist about what to do. \u00a0We put a plan in place and I schedule an appointment for him to see his therapist the following day.  \n \nThe following day, I also have a meeting scheduled with Blue's team of teachers. \u00a0His anger, anxiety and depression has been significant lately. \u00a0Hormones and puberty are wreaking havoc on his poor mind and body. \u00a0Medication tweaking has done very little if anything, to help him. \n \nDuring Spring Break I did see more smiles than I had since school started, but once he started working on assignments for school ...it wall went downhill fast. \u00a0He just became so overwhelmed. \u00a0He told me how unsupported he feels by his math teacher. \u00a0She has tried to avoid giving him the accommodations of his IEP. \u00a0He has been a great self-advocate this year, but this bitch is trying to intimidate him and make him feel bad for needing to use his extra-time accommodation.  Wrong answer Sweetie! I may smile and be nice but don't mess with my boy or you will meet a bitch who will turn your world around. \u00a0 \n \nBlue and I both do an excellent job presenting the issues in this meeting. \u00a0I defer to him to tell the entire group how he has been feeling. \u00a0The Assistant Principal is also in attendance. \u00a0I am glad he's there because I want it on record how this math teacher has been behaving. \u00a0She sat there like a sour puss, hardly speaking at all until she didn't have much of a choice. \u00a0She appears to lack any compassion. \u00a0She definitely wins the award for the Most Unhelpful Teacher of the Year award. \n \nTalking in front of his entire team of teachers, standing up and advocating for himself is very stressful for Blue. \u00a0However, he did rise to the occasion and made his mama proud. \u00a0Once we tackle these adolescent years, success is written all over this boy's future. \u00a0I just feel it in my bones. \u00a0Give him a few years to mature and watch out world! \n \nThe following evening we make arrangements for Blue to be at a friends house while we have Date Night with Alicia Keys. \u00a0His friend's mom brings him home just before bedtime. \u00a0My mistake. \u00a0I should have just let him stay there until we could pick him up. \u00a0He had a major meltdown just before we came home. \u00a0As tuck him in to bed, I try to get him to do some deep breathing. \u00a0He can hardly pull it together enough to really exhale. \u00a0Before I leave the room he says to me, \"Mom...I don't trust God anymore. \u00a0Why is he letting this happen to me?\" \n That's it...finished! Heart. Broken. \n \nIt's well after midnight before he gets to sleep. \u00a0When I go to wake him for school the following day, he says, \"I can't do it mom. \u00a0I can't go to school today. \u00a0I need a break.\" \n \nHubby had already tried to get Red out of bed, this same morning, to no avail. \u00a0I refused to poke and prod him out of bed. \u00a0So I have both of them sleeping when they are supposed to be at school. \u00a0I lay in my own bed seething with anger because Red is refusing to get up. \u00a0This is actually the second day that he would be at home from school. \u00a0But I'm done! \u00a0Something has to give. \u00a0I refuse to keep begging him to go to bed, and begging him to get up in the morning. \u00a0I am weary, depleted and exhausted, unable to move so I lay there trying to figure out what to do. \u00a0I decide to do nothing. \u00a0 I let them sleep.  \n \nBlue hits the floor around 11:30 a.m. \u00a0Red doesn't hit it until 1 p.m. \u00a0Obviously, he was pretty tired. \u00a0I could have forced the issue and made him go to school, but then we may end up with a day like he had earlier this week ...completely falling apart. \u00a0The same for Blue really. \u00a0He needed some rest. \u00a0The difference being, that the night before...Red refused to go to bed. \u00a0So for him, there is a consequence of not getting up and going to school on this day.  \n \n\"I'm sorry that you chose not to go to bed, and not to get up this morning. \u00a0There will be no electronics today. \u00a0No computer, no phone, nada. \u00a0We are going out to get some exercise, we are going to do some chores and we will make sure you get in bed early tonight. \u00a0If you do not get in bed on-time...that computer will not be in your room when you wake up in the morning, \u00a0and it will not return until you have gotten up on-time for school every day next week. That's the entire week. \u00a0Just so you're clear.\" \n \nOf course, that's not fair! I'm the worst mom ever. \u00a0But at the beginning of this day, I was ready to pull the covers over my head and stay that way. \u00a0By the end of this day, after we exercise, get the boys haircuts, run errands and do our chores, both of the boys were more relaxed than I have seen them all week. \u00a0All in all I would say the Mental Health day was a success. \n \nYou can put money on the fact that they were both in bed on time. \u00a0And yes...Red did get up on his own the following morning and got himself out the door...independently. \n \nAround the world in and back again....just another day in the crazy life.  \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FXHZJQv6rwo/UVIkkP3CQVI/AAAAAAAABC8/i62zhGKTX9s/s1600/Unknown-2.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/03/mental-health-day.html", "title": "\nMental Health Day \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 23, 2014", "body": "\n \nI can't find my happy. \u00a0I think it's at the beach. \u00a0 Unfortunately, there is no ocean anywhere near here. \u00a0The Gulf of Mexico is several hours south, and there are no plans on the books to head that way. \n \nI grew up in L.A. where the Pacific Ocean was a 20 minute drive. \u00a0I don't think if I truly appreciated that luxury as I was growing up. \u00a0Now, I miss it so much my longing is palpable. \u00a0The sound of the waves crashing against the shore, sauntering aimlessly at the waters edge, collecting sea shells, the cool breeze and the sunset. What made me think I could survive these hot summers in Texas without it? What the hell was I thinking moving here?  \n \n \n Taken in Manhatten Beach California, 2013 *cries at the memory of cooler days \n \nThis happens to me every summer since the boys have been teenagers. My anti-anxiety meds feel like they stop working. \u00a0I end up spending so much more time with them. \u00a0Me time is short. Everyday I decide what part of myself to give away.  \u00a0Do I give them my exercise time? Maybe I'll give them my shower. \u00a0Here you go kids ...take my writing time. \u00a0Enjoy! \n \nWhen they were little, we spent most of our days by our neighborhood pool. \u00a0I would catch up on my novel reading. I had other girlfriends with little ones. \u00a0We would meet up poolside and hang out. \u00a0The boys would be so worn out by the pool, they would come home eat, watch movies and play games. \u00a0They were much more easily entertained. \u00a0Hours on end talking about their worries and problems was not a part of the equation. \u00a0These days that takes up a lot of my time and energy. \u00a0Listening to relentless, repetitive, negative dialog is exhausting. \n \nWhen they were younger, we also took regular family vacations with the  whole  family. \u00a0The boys actually got along long enough for us to travel together and have it not to end up being an absolute nightmare. \u00a0As they came into the teen years, we seldom take whole family trips anymore, unless we go to visit family and there are plans for the boys  not  to spend the majority of the time together. \u00a0Otherwise, we do separate get aways. \u00a0My husband and I traveled to Napa in March, followed by a trip for me to L.A. to see my dad. \u00a0We had plans to go to New York in June, for our 20th anniversary. \u00a0That didn't happen due to my mom being in the hospital and as of yet, it has not been rescheduled.  \n \nThis summer there were no other trips planned due to Red working, and Blue going to summer school and volunteering at at Special Needs camp. \u00a0So, it's mostly just me toting them around from camps, to summer school, work, friend's houses, or local city pools. \u00a0(Dropping them off at the pool is actually kind of cool.) \u00a0Then I add my mother to the mix, taking her to her medical appointments, to the hair salon and nail salon. \u00a0Also, running back and forth to the grocery store for her. \n \nI could say ending up in this situation is bad planning on my part. \u00a0I should never plan on being in Texas all.summer.long. \u00a0Never! The only trip on the schedule right now is St. Louis at the end of August for a family reunion on my mom's side of the family. \u00a0That should be fun. \u00a0But it's not the beach, and it's not exactly cool weather. \u00a0In my opinion, anytime I have the teenagers with me, it is not considered a vacation.  \n \n \nI need some kind of boost to change my sucky attitude and perspective. \u00a0It's really sad when you know you're perspective is off and you're thinking in the extreme negative. \u00a0Yet, you just can't shake it. \u00a0When you reach the point where people are grinding on your nerves for nothing other than being who they are, who they've always been, but somehow, their very being just makes you angry, bitchy and you want to scream!  Just leave me alone! Please! I \u00a0know it's not really them, it's me. \n \nI've been in this funk for going on 3 weeks now. \u00a0I honestly thought it was PMS, but the P has come and gone and the depression is still lingering --hanging around like an unwanted house guest. So I dunno? \u00a0What is this? Pre-menepause, hormonal imbalance, a different flavor of crazy or just plain old summertime blues? \n \nI am fully aware of my negative mood and my negative thought patterns. My usual patience are very thin. I've apologized to my husband a few times for frankly, just being a bitch. \u00a0He was really sweet about the moodiness for the first few days, but now I think he's just about had it with me and I can't really blame him. \u00a0I hugged him this morning for the first time in almost two weeks. \u00a0I felt pretty good when I first woke up. Suddenly, I realized that I miss his affection and I miss showing it towards him. \n \n \n \nIt takes an extreme amount of patience and energy to deal with my children when I'm feeling like this. \u00a0I fight with every ounce of my being to muster that energy. \u00a0Getting angry, impatient and showing them my ugly side only sparks their anger and behaviors. \u00a0Having to remain calm when someone is melting down, attacking your already heightened senses, goes completely against human nature. \u00a0We naturally feel that fight or flight instinct, but fighting or flying away is not always an option when you have two teenagers with autism and anger issues. \n \nSo for the adults in my life, who don't have Aspergers (or maybe they do ...lately it REALLY feels like my husband definitely does, but that's a whole other blog post). They certainly have quirks and idiosyncrasies that I have very little patience leftover to deal with. \u00a0When my kids are talking at me constantly, and I am consistently playing fire-woman to their inner angst which turns into outer meltdowns and fights, I just don't have a lot left to be a loving, social, adult, wife, daughter and caregiver. \n \nIn my head, I know that I am blessed to have my mom here, living with me, \u00a0but when she is pushing the boys buttons, making my job harder or asking me to do things for her that she could easily do herself, I get irritated. \u00a0Sometimes, she just wants my attention because she doesn't get out very much. \u00a0I'm sorry, but when I have both boys talking at me for hours, the last thing I feel like doing some days is sitting and chatting. \u00a0I just want silence. \n \nThere are moments when I don't feel like putting on the happy face and personality to hang out with other adults, being nice and polite, holding in how I really feel, because who wants to hear it really? \u00a0I don't even want to share these feelings with my husband. \u00a0He is really busy with work and has a lot financial pressure. \u00a0I don't want to add my whining and sadness to his plate. \u00a0Besides, when he's this busy, he will probably end up saying something I really don't want to hear. \u00a0So I hold a lot of it in. \u00a0Except here...I let go. \n \nAgain, I know this is bad perspective. \u00a0This is what depression does it steals your positive attitude and ability to truly count your blessings. \u00a0Depression reverses the truth. \u00a0Part of me knows that I'm just being a whiny baby ...kind of ungrateful in way. \u00a0But who am I kidding ...these feelings are real. \u00a0My tears are real. \u00a0They are effecting me, my relationships and interactions with my family. \u00a0When I give too much of myself away, \u00a0resentment builds. And really, who do I have to blame except for myself? \n \nI am longing to go on an adventure. \u00a0I want to go out and see the world, ...the cooler part of the world, where nature is beauty and can simply and easily be enjoyed. \u00a0I miss my friends in California. \u00a0I also have this longing to get on the road to meet a lot of the autism mom's that I have connected with through my  Facebook autism support groups  . \u00a0These women, get me. \u00a0There are even a few wonderful guys who do as well. \u00a0They don't judge me. \u00a0Some of them feel like sisters that I have never met. \u00a0I have been blessed to meet a few of them. \u00a0I've also met one of my brother's from another mother, J from  Find My Eyes . \u00a0We get to hang out every time I go to L.A. now. \u00a0I wrote about our meeting  meeting J and his family here .\u00a0 What an awesome feeling to be able to connect with someone else who has kids who you love more than anything, yet they are the biggest pain in the ass that you've ever had in your whole life! \n \nI wish I could tie this post up in a nice shiny bow and say that I know what to adjust my attitude, to find some semblance of my happy again. I hesitate to even share this because it feels so negative. \u00a0However, these feelings are lingering they don't seem to magically disappear just because I want them to. \u00a0I always think, maybe someone else out there is going through the same thing, and by reading my thoughts, they will feel less alone. \u00a0So here you are! \n \nI have some ideas to work on getting my happy back and helping me make it through this long hot summer. \u00a0I can only hope that they work. \n \n I need to plan more simple pleasures into my days. \u00a0(I would love to get back to painting on canvas).\u00a0 \n Plan me time ...I mean really put it on the calendar and stick to the plan. \u00a0 \n Take my showers back every day! \u00a0I mean don't leave the house without one because one of these boys is rushing me to get them here...or there. \u00a0Besides, it's too hot to be smelly.\u00a0 \n Steal my writing time. \u00a0Even if I need to run and hide in order to do so.\u00a0 \n Schedule time for thought, meditation, yoga and other exercise.\u00a0 \n \nLast week one of my autism mama friends shared this post with me about finding respite. \u00a0Bec Oakley the author has some awesome ideas on little ways for us to find a reprieve from the madness\u00a0 here on Snagglebox.com . Check it out. \n \nI do know this for sure. \u00a0I have to look for my happy ...proactively. \u00a0It's not going to just show up without me doing some work.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-04JZuW9RV-s/U8bqSBpUQiI/AAAAAAAABoM/Xu7BFF06BWs/s1600/1014357_638775586198685_8356132851838462971_n.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V5lbxz4sJ18/U8_qTKqt8BI/AAAAAAAABok/n8zJyPRhtc8/s1600/1959217_651709584905285_5832156908756685424_n.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=hl", "http://phatjaye.blogspot.com/", "http://www.snagglebox.com/article/realistic-respite"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/07/lost-my-happy.html", "title": "\nLost My Happy \n"},
{"date": "Monday, May 2, 2016", "body": "\n \n Sitting alone in my room on that Thursday morning, April 21st, I read the news... \n What?\u00a0 \n How can people be so cruel to perpetuate such a rumor?\u00a0 \n That's ridiculous!\u00a0 \n Nope. I don't believe it. Just No. \n I am a hopeless optimist.\u00a0 \n I never want to believe the worst case scenario.\u00a0 \n I don't jump onto every bandwagon on social media, especially when it's something negative. \u00a0 \n I don't believe it until you prove it.\u00a0 \n   Moments later on CNN there is confirmation: \n The fatality at Paisley Park was indeed the artist who played the soundtrack of my youth.\u00a0 \n At the age of fifty-seven- \n Just six years older than me- \n Prince is gone. \n I sit there on the couch in shock,\u00a0 \n trying to process what feels like bad dream. \u00a0 \n I can not move. \n I can not carry on with my day.\u00a0 \n I am numb.\u00a0 \n   It's not the first time that I've been alone in my room with Prince, but this time eerily different. \n~~~~~~~~~ \n \n \n Photo lifted from ABC News.com \n \n \n That time when you were a teenage girl - sneaking around to do everything that your mother didn't want you to do. She didn't approve of much. As a single mother, she was trying to the best of her ability to keep you on the right path, close to God and all of that. \n \n \n \n Your loving mother decided that your religion was Jehovah's Witness when you were in the second grade, not long after your father left,\u00a0and before you were old enough to have any choice in the matter. \u00a0You think that part of her reason was that she needed the support system of the \"Witnesses\" being a newly single mother in L.A. without any family. You did meet friends who became like family. \u00a0They were the nicest people ever. \n \n \n \n It was cool\u00a0until you realized that you had to go to those freaking\u00a0meetings three times a week and field service on Saturdays. You would miss all of your favorite t.v. shows on Tuesday and Thursday nights. There were no VCRs at the time. \n \n \n \n On Saturday mornings, when you wanted to sleep in and watch cartoons, you had to get up to knock on people's doors to pass out \"Watchtower\" and \"Awake\" magazines for a ten cent donation. \u00a0 Excuse me I'm knocking on your door, disturbing your peace to bring you the word of God for the bargain price of ten cents.  It was torture! You hated it, but you were a good girl and did as you were told. \n \n \n \n When you were hitting adolescence and started having those feelings about boys, like an average teenage girl; only you weren't allowed to date. It was against the rules. You were drilled with, dating leads to making out, heavy petting and pre-marital sex. You weren't allowed to do a lot of things; no birthday celebrations; no Halloween; no freakin Christmas. \u00a0However, your strong will would find a way to do whatever it was that you wanted to do. \n \n \n \n Somehow you listened to all of that Prince music and learned the words by heart, even if you didn't completely understand what they meant. Who cares really? The music was a funky, hot combination of soul, punk, and rock, with a side order of naughtiness. \n \n \n \n That time when the album, \"Dirty Mind\" came out. It was unlike anything you had ever heard before. It was R & B with a splash of New Wave. You were seriously into New Wave at the time; the Go-Go's, The Cars, Soft Cell, Devo, the B-52's. \u00a0It was your first year of high school. You finally had the first boyfriend that you were NOT allowed to have. The \"Witnesses\" were right. It did lead to a little bit of making out, but that's about as far as you allowed it to go. \n \n \n \n All of the boys in high school were talking about that song, \"Head.\" You thought the idea of \"Head\" was  OMG gross!  After all, you were only 15 and still a virgin. The fact that you were grossed out by the sexual act did not stop you from singing every single lyric and shaking your ass to every single beat. I mean ...how could you not? From \"When you were Mine\" to \"Party Up\" there was no reprieve. You simply had to dance. \n \n \n \n I don't know how you managed to listen to the entire album over and over again, especially in  your  mother's house, but there you were alone in your room, with Prince.\u00a0 \n   You learned every song, in order of play and there was no other way to listen to it. You listened to the entire album over and over again, loving every song more than the last. You particularly loved the transition between \"Head\" and \"Sister;\" how it almost seemed like a continuation of the same song, but it was indeed, another song altogether. It would be years before you realized the meaning behind \"Sister.\" \n \n \n \n OMG and then there was that time when Purple Rain the movie came out! It was 1984. By that time, you were seventeen, almost eighteen. You pretty much told your mother you were done with the whole, judgmental, controlling, Jehovah's Witness religion. You were done with sneaking around to do all of the things you wanted to do. You were just being honest with her. \u00a0She was a bit shocked at first. She gave you that look like,  I don't know who you think you are,  but she ultimately accepted your truth. \n \n \n \n You had friends who were boys\u00a0and one that one boy who was more than a friend. \u00a0You were knee deep in rebellion and - I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want to do.  So of course, you went to see \"Purple Rain\" the movie more than once. In time, you knew all of the lines and of course all of the songs. You wanted to be Vanity, the girl who got the sexy boy. Of course, you weren't even close to being the sexiness that oozed from every pore of Vanity's body, while Prince was drinking it up. \n \n \n \n Then there was that time when you got to see your boy live at the \"Purple Rain\" concert! \u00a0You had a special friend; he was like a brother to you, only nicer. \u00a0He took you to that concert at the Long Beach Arena. It was like living a dream, getting to see Prince dance and sing live on stage. You were taken aback by how loud everything was. There was no adjusting the volume to Prince's screams. It was an experience you would never forget. That dude who was like your brother would remain a part of your life thirty-something years later even though you would come to live miles apart. \n \n \n \n Let's not forget all of those times when you were hitting house parties and the clubs in L.A., dancing to songs like \"Erotic City,\" \"Housequake,\" \"D.M.S.R.\" \u00a0\"Sexy MF.\" \u00a0There were so many songs, so many parties, and so many clubs where you danced into the night. \u00a0Your favorite spots? The Red Onion on Wilshire Boulevared and the Bitten Apple, further west on Wilshire. There was always somebody there who knew your name, and if they didn't\u00a0know your name when you got there, they would by the time you left. \n \n \n \n There were many times and many people that each of those Prince songs would always remind you of, even all these years later. \u00a0Until this day, when you hear \"Adore\" and \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,\" it brings back the kind of memories that a married woman is not supposed to talk about. \n \n~~~~~~~~ \n It's afternoon now. I've been dancing all day to all of the songs. When I'm dancing somehow, I'm not sad. I am celebrating his life. I am celebrating  my  life in all of its different stages. Each Prince song carries with it a memory of someone --of happy, carefree times before I grew up and had to start taking life seriously. On this day, when my sweet Prince said his final goodbye, I took\u00a0a much-needed\u00a0break from my reality. \n   Hours go by. I can't shake it off. I can not let it go. \u00a0I can't quite figure out why this is hitting me so hard. I'm like a love sick teenager, except I'm a 51 year-old-woman, a mother, a wife.\u00a0 \n   My son comes home from school and into my room. He begins talking about his day; politics and everything that's wrong in the world. He jars me back to reality.  Hey, wake up girl! You have a son with autism who loves to hear himself talk. It's his way of processing his thoughts. He has no idea that you are currently living in another space and time. \u00a0 \n   After a few minutes, I stop him because he wants a response to the question, \"Who will you vote for in the upcoming election? I mean, how can you trust Hillary?\" \n   I start my automated response, \"How can we trust anyone in politics? Obama is probably the last President I will ever trust, and he wasn't perfect. Close, but not perfect.\" \n   That was not good enough. He starts going on about the candidates on the other side. I could not give less of a flying f*#% at the moment. \u00a0Suddenly, I\u00a0interrupt, \"I'm sorry. I can't process anything that you're saying right now. You know who Prince is, right? Well, he died today, and I'm having kind of a hard time with it.\" \n   He apologizes, but then he keeps talking. I turn the music up and start cleaning out my closet. After all, I am not entitled to completely lose a day of productivity. I am an adult!\u00a0 \n   My son says \"Are you trying to tell me that you want me to leave your room?\" I think to myself,  Hallelujah! Great reading my social cues! Yes. Would you please leave me in my Prince world? \n   Days go by. I am still sad. It feels like I've lost a close, friend unexpectedly. I can't quite grasp why I'm so sad and lack of ability to just move on with life. \n   I listen to his music every chance I get. I'm furiously looking up lyrics and reading articles about him, trying to find the deeper meaning behind his body of work. \n   I'm stunned when I start reading an article and find out that \"Sister\" is actually about incest.  How did I  not  know that when I was 15? Oh yeah. \u00a0I was pretty clueless. I thought it was just about his sister who was \"loose\" and liked to sleep around. Duh!\u00a0 \n   I start mapping through his life -looking at every video I can find; reading everything I can about him. I read about him becoming a Jehovah's Witness, which I always thought was strange. As I examine his life, I find so much irony and paradox in this choice.  How is it possible, that the man who was a key part of my rebellious youth, actually came to believe and follow the very controlling, extremely conservative religion that I rebelled from? \n   I wonder,\u00a0 How could they have accepted his travel around the world, hanging out with other celebrities and even becoming heavily involved in social causes?\u00a0Maybe because he was Prince and probably giving them a crapload of money in donations, they let him do whatever he wanted to do. \n \n \n \"Prince often vanished from the congregation for long periods, apparently while he was traveling, and his fellow congregants didn't seem to begrudge him, acknowledging the effect his musical gifts had on the broader world. They also said he apparently visited other Kingdom Halls when he was on the road.\"\u00a0 Los Angeles Times, \u00a0April 24, 2016 \n   My memory of Jehovah's witnesses was that they attempted to restrict who their members were allowed to associate with. It's one of the reasons I left. I had friends from all walks of life, and I no longer wanted to have to answer to  The Elders\u00a0 about who my friends were and what I was or was not doing with them. There was a judgmental overtone about \"people in the world -with their worldly ways\" that I hated.\u00a0 Prince would have been one of them at the time. \n   In \" The Truth \" (which is what witnesses call their belief system) they only wanted you to associate with others who shared the same belief system. \u00a0I found it to be cultish. They wanted you all in. So much so, that I wanted nothing more than all out. \n   Perhaps the paradox of Prince's decision to become a Jehovah's witness is not for those of us outisde of his world to understand. His sprirituality, his relationship with God is really none of our business.\u00a0 \n   Whatever the case may be, the world was better off because of Prince and his rebellious days making his special genre of music. He made us stop whatever we were doing and dance. He opened our eyes to acceptance and difference, of being whoever you choose to be, without asking the world for permission.\u00a0 \n   I felt compelled to write this story. At first, it wasn't coming out right. I wasn't really making any sense. It wasn't cohesive. I went through all of the typical artist/writer feelings.  Who cares what you think or feel. No one will read this. Your blog is not about music or celebrity.\u00a0 As I kept reading about Prince, how hard he worked and he NEVER gave up on his art. He created every single day, not thinking about the outcome or who would approve of his work. That was his final gift to me.\u00a0 \n   Thank you, sweet Prince. \u00a0 \n You \u00a0live in my heart always.\u00a0 \n Thank you for the inspiration.\u00a0 \n Thank you for the music.\u00a0 \n I love you.\u00a0 \n Always \n \n \n Another Artist... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zPiiq7QlYfM/VyeGV0rLFZI/AAAAAAAAD5I/LGJJLoJWlU4JghzL_flE-owCy2lY9CzcgCLcB/s1600/images-4.jpeg", "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-prince-jehovah-20160424-story.html"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2016/05/dear-prince.html", "title": "\nDear Prince\n"},
{"date": "Friday, May 20, 2016", "body": "\n \nSimple conversations can be agonizing in my house. In fact, I am becoming less and less of a fan of talking. I would rather write or just be -alone, in silence or listening to the birds sing, or the sound of the waves crashing on a beach, where I am alone. Did I say, alone? \n \nLately, trying to have a conversation with my 17-year-old feels like a trip to the gynecologist. You just don't want to go there. \n \n \n \n \nWhoever said \"third time is a charm\" is a mother sucking liar. I am going through the age of seventeen for the third time raising my boys, and it is anything but -charming. \u00a0There are layers and layers of suckiness, emotions, and anxiety that comes from all of the stressors for Blue right now. The worst is how much he thinks he doesn't need his parents anymore. In fact, having us around is a major inconvenience. The only problem with this is\u00a0 IT's OUR HOUSE! \n \nI realize that seventeen is not the only sucky age, especially for those on the autism spectrum. This is not my first time at the rodeo. I've been through all of the ages with my boys, including my atypical son who is now 27 or is he 28? I can't keep up. \u00a0He was not much easier as know-it-all teen. \u00a0He is just starting to get the fact that we are and always have been, one hundred percent in his corner. \u00a0He is becoming a much more responsible adult. In fact, I must congratulate him for finally earning his degree in Computer Science a few weeks ago. \u00a0I didn't believe it until I saw the degree in writing! \n \n \n \nSo I get it. It's only natural to go through this right of passage. Seventeen was when I told my mom that I would longer go along with her religion of choice for us. I would not answer to a congregation of people and the elders about how I was going to live my life. \u00a0It's almost like a teen's job to want to be nothing like their parents during this time in their lives. Of course they resent\u00a0the control parents have over them. \n \nBy seventeen, you want to break away and be your own person -an individual, with thoughts and feelings, that are separate from your family. You don't want guidance or opinions from your parents. After all, we're completely clueless, right? \n \nAs much as they can't stand us (parents) being around, they can't completely breakaway because they still need a roof over their heads, and rides, and money. Subsequently, they resent our authority. \nThey want to be adults. They think they know more than we parents could ever know. After all, they didn't even teach us the kind of things that they're learning now in school, way back in the day -you know in ancient times. \n \nThere is an easy solution to not being around us. \u00a0 GET OUT! And I left out the expletive.\u00a0 \n \nI get it; you're practically an adult, and yet there is fear all of the responsibility that comes along adulthood. There is a ton\u00a0of social pressure from peers. It may be the first time you're experiencing love, and no one in the history of the world has felt the kind of love that you're feeling right now ...in the 11th grade. \n \nDo I dare even mention those sexual desires and all of the complications that are helluva confusing? Everyone is talking about sex at school, all.the.time. You think everyone has done it except you. ( Except you know most of them are lying, right?) \n \nToday's kids have easy access to media and anything they ever wanted to know about anything via the internet. Only, they don't realize there are nuances to relationships and sex that media can NEVER teach. \n \nNow, let's add Aspergers to the mix, which produces a whole other series of social deficits that are too intricate and complicated to wrap your head around. They have this unique way of seeing the world and sometimes it's hard to figure out why everyone else doesn't see things the exact way they do. People just don't get it and parents, the people who should get it, are the worst offenders. \n \nThere is a ton of pressure with school. Grades are beginning to get serious as they can affect what college you're accepted. They have to start thinking about college; possibly going away. There are AP exams, SAT's and college applications. The list of pressures is infinite. \n \nAs a parent of a seventeen-year-old,\u00a0I have to face once again, that I am no longer the mom; the teacher of lessons; the preventer of falling over a cliff. I have now become\u00a0 The Consulting Parent . I wrote about this two years ago, so you think by now I would get it by now. \n \nSo now more than ever, when we try to help our son or teach him something, he takes it as a personal affront; like what we are telling him is that he is all wrong, and we are right. \u00a0Or as he puts it, \"you're treating me like I'm stupid.\" We are just trying to help him. We would like to give him the benefit of our life experience. We are parenting. We would like to spare him some grief, maybe prevent him from making some of the mistakes that we made. Unfortunately, it feels like the teaching window of time for this kid has expired. Any guiding that we do for now is met with disdain and anger. \n \n \n \nIn recent weeks, I've been told in every which way but loose, that I have no idea what I'm doing anymore. \u00a0He is different than his brothers, and we're treating him like he doesn't know anything. He doesn't need our help. \u00a0And then in the next breath I am told,\"You should know what I need by now! You should know what I'm thinking! Everyone understands me better than you!\" He doesn't need our advice and our teaching moments! \"I just need for you to listen to me! I need your understanding!\" \n \nI am eternally grateful for the adult mentors and friends in his life, who he believes do understand him. He can talk to them so much easier than me or his father. I am especially thankful for the  special  friend who he believes has given him a sense of humor and sarcasm.  I mean, there's no way he got that from me.\u00a0 \n \nI ran into some old friends a few weeks ago. This family has a daughter Blue's age. She and Blue were friends in Elementary school. In fact, she would sometimes be the only girl at his birthday parties. I was kind of staring at them from across the room in the restaurant, mesmerized by how beautiful and poised this young lady is now. When they finished eating, her mom popped over to our table to say hello. She told me that her gorgeous daughter just told her that apparently, she \"knows nothing about anything anymore.\" She said this with a forced smile on her face, which I read as she was about ready to strangle her lovely child. \n \nIn recent weeks, simple conversations turn\u00a0into anger-filled rages so fast it gives me whiplash. Anxiety is a big part of it. However, I leave these conversations with hurt feelings and sometimes even tears. That brutal honesty that those with Aspergers have can sometimes\u00a0leave\u00a0you with bruises. \n \nWhen a person with anxiety, stress, and anger is feeling out of control, they can sometimes project their\u00a0emotions to whoever happens to be in the line of fire. Especially, a mother who they know loves them unconditionally. They can make us feel like we are the problem. I've been there done that with Red and I still feel the sting of PTSD from years of it. I feel myself tensing up, stomach turning in knots when I think that Blue is getting ready to get started. \n \nWhen you're being attacked by words and barraged with yelling, sometimes you start to believe that you actually are indeed the one with the problem\u00a0or at least a contributor. The truth is that I am usually just trying to survive with a little bit of sanity intact. As mothers, we are usually trying to help however we can, even when we can't. \n \nI know that I'm not perfect and I often find myself engaging in an argument that I had no intention of being a part of, but I can easily get sucked in. \u00a0 So, I did some research and even talked to some adults that I know with Aspergers to help me process what I have been experiencing with Blue and our conversations. I wanted to see what if anything, I could do differently. \n \nAs a result of my research and examining some of our recent conversations, I came up with \u00a0some guidelines and strategies to help me communicate with my Aspie: \n \n Ask in the beginning of the conversation, \"What would you like from me? \u00a0Do you want me to just listen or do you want my advice?  More than likely they don't want your advice.  Ask, do you even want a response from me?\u00a0 \n If what he wants to just have a monolog (to information dump, on a topic of interest, or he just wants me to listen) where he is the only one talking \u00a0-I will give a time limit in the beginning.  The amount of time depends on how close I think I am to snapping. \u00a0 \n When monolog turns into a personal attack where he is blaming me, shaming or making me feel bad -I have the right to *walk away or ask him to go take a *walk until he can calm down and speak to me with basic human decency. \n \n*Walking brings down\u00a0cortisol levels almost instantly. You will feel better. \n \n Criteria for ending the conversation\u00a0 \n \n \n-Do I feel bullied? \n \n-How would I feel if this were a friend talking to me like this? \n \n-Do I feel uncomfortable? \n \n-Would I accept this coming from anyone else? \n \n-Would one of his friends or colleagues accept his talking to them in this manner? -If the answer is no. I am not doing him any favors by allowing him to speak that way to me. Lord knows, I'm not doing myself any favors. \n \n I realize that sometimes, I feel compelled to teach him something. Even though he's made it pointed clear that he does not want to be \"taught\" by us anymore. I often find myself caught up in this trap especially... \n \n-when he starts making assertions that I know are not factual as if they are indeed fact. I \n-when he starts using words or language that I consider offensive or unacceptable. I want to stop him right then and there and correct him. \n-This never works when he is already on a roll but as his mother, I get caught up in the fact that he will go out into the world and people will think he was raised by a pack of wolves. \n \n What may work better is if I could just wait and listen when he is talking. Perhaps, I can take notes while I continue listening and give him feedback later when he's in a more calm, accepting \u00a0mood.  As if that ever happens. This will give me something to do with that nervous energy with which may otherwise lead me to whack him in the mouth or wring his neck. \n \n \n I have to remind myself that I am probably more in control than he is; keyword  -probably  and I should try to be patient.

{"date": "Sunday, May 12, 2013", "body": "\n \nI was driving down the street the other day checking my phone at a stoplight, as I am a bit obsessed, when my grandmother, La Unia popped into my mind.  \n \nThe memory ~ \n \nWe were at brunch one Sunday with my mom, my sister, sister-in-law and some of my girlfriends. \u00a0This was back in the day of pagers, not cell-phones. \u00a0I was a Real Estate Agent at the time and so was my girlfriend Glenda. \u00a0Glenda's pager kept going off while we were dining at the table. \u00a0Of course, she would pick it up and look every time it went off. \u00a0It was then that my grandmother said,  \"What do you do with that thing when you're having sex? I'm just wondering because you check it every five-minutes!\" \n \nEveryone's mouth dropped open and we laughed and laughed. \u00a0That was La Unia --no non-sense...no edit...just real. I guess that's where I get it from. \u00a0A good sense of humor and a taste of smart-ass runs on both sides of my family, maternal and fraternal. \u00a0So I have it honest. \u00a0Things just fly out of my mouth that are funny, honest and real on a daily basis. \u00a0My kids can't stand it, \u00a0but that's just too bad. It's who I am. I am thankful to Grandma for that. \n \nAs a matter of fact, I remember my fraternal grandmother for much of the same thing. \u00a0She would tell you off in a heartbeat. \u00a0There was nothing warm and fuzzy about her. \u00a0As the sign on her vanity table said, \"Don't go away mad. \u00a0Just go away!\"  \n \nIda V, as we called her my father's mother one day, kept calling me Carol instead of Karen. \u00a0When I corrected her saying, \"My name is Karen! Not Carol.\" \u00a0She retorted, \"If you don't want me to call you Carol...I won't call ya nothin!\" \n \n \n Me and Grandma La Unia \n \nOn this Mother's Day I am thinking of my grandmother, La Unia. \u00a0I know she is smiling down in awe of the mother that I have become. \u00a0She probably would have never imagined it. \u00a0She would have loved my husband because he takes such good care of me and he loves to talk as much as she did. \u00a0They would have a talking good time together. \n \nYou see when she died...I was still in my mid twenties and I was a finger popping, partying, diva. \u00a0Sure...I had the steady boyfriend, whom she also loved. \u00a0I was a great Auntie to my little nieces and nephews, but a mother? No! Not even on the radar.  \n \nGrandma would come and spend months at at time with us. \u00a0She lived in St.Louis. \u00a0We lived in Los Angeles. \u00a0She was there for all of the important moments in my childhood. \u00a0She was there for Prom and graduation from high school. \u00a0She was there to see my first apartment. \u00a0Yes, she came and spent \u00a0the night at my apartment even though now I know she was devastatingly ill at the time. \n \nLa Unia got on my nerves, just like my mother does now...but I loved her madly. \u00a0My grandmother was a professional cook for a living. \u00a0So whenever I would attempt to cook, even something as simple as a hamburger, she would tell me how I could do it better. \u00a0 A hamburger? \u00a0Really Grandma? You think I don't know how to make a hamburger? \u00a0At the same time, if I asked her to make me an apple pie...she wouldn't hesitate. \n \nShe never held her tongue. \u00a0I don't think she knew how. \u00a0If she had an opinion, you can bet she was going to share it with you, whether you wanted to hear it or not.  \n \nMy mother who now lives with us is the exact the same way. \u00a0My kids ask  ME  a question...my mother answers it. \u00a0I'm like -Hello he is talking to  me! \u00a0She gets involved in every conversation and argument that goes on in this house -and there are a lot! \n \nMy mother and  her  mother would fuss, fuss, fuss at each other. \u00a0Yet, they couldn't stand to be away from each other for long. \u00a0I remember my grandmother looking out the window, waiting for my mother to come home from work each day. \u00a0She couldn't wait for them to start fussing at one another!  \n \n \n La Unia Hinton & Beverly La Unia \nGrandma and my mom \n \nMy mother and I can be the same way. \u00a0For many years, I lived here in Texas, while my mother was still in California living with her husband. \u00a0I missed her so much. \u00a0Yet, we would get into it every time I visited. \u00a0She would say or do something to piss me off. \u00a0Yet, I would cry every time I drove away to drive to the airport when it was time to come home. \n \nWhen I would see daughters, and mothers out shopping or having lunch together ....my heart would ache. \u00a0I was so sad that I didn't have my mother close enough to do those things with on a regular basis.  \n \nA memory~ \n \nMy mother would call me and my grandmother Jezabels because we loved big, colorful jewelry and loud, vivacious lipstick and makeup. \u00a0My mother was ultra conservative. \u00a0We didn't care. \u00a0Grandma and I would get dressed up and go to lunch and to the movies, with our bright red lipstick and our dangling earrings thinking that we were too cute for words! \n \nNow my mother, Beverly LaUnia lives with me.  \nWe go to lunch and have margaritas at noon on a regular basis.  \nShe sends back her food, if it's not piping hot, \u00a0and served as ordered. \nI have taken up her love for wine to help soothe the nerves most evenings, although she can still out drink me! And her mother could out drink  her ! I can't keep up with either one of them in the drinking department. \nWe go to the occasional movie together, where she complains about how cold the theatre is. \u00a0Sometimes, she complains about the amount of sex or cursing in the movie, although she can curse like a sailor herself! \nShe stays all up in my business, never holding her tongue. \nAt the same time, she helps me keep my head on straight --reminding me of every detail that I forget. \nApparently, I did not receive her organization gene.  \nI'm sure my unorganized house drives her nuts.  \nYou see...she has nothing else to do besides mind my business. \nShe cooks for our family on somedays that we would otherwise have cold sandwiches, or wine for dinner. For this I am eternally grateful.  \nShe also has those days, where she sits and waits for me to feed her like my 4th or 5th child.  \nShe helps me with my laundry. \u00a0In fact ...I can't keep up with her in getting it put away. \nShe tells me like it is when I am being mean to my husband. \nSome days, I am still like her little girl. \n\"Are you going to clean your room before your husband gets home?\" \n\"Your husband hasn't eaten today. \u00a0Aren't you going to feed him?\" \n\"Your closet is a wreck! You need to spend the day in there cleaning it up!\" \n\u00a0 Stay out of my damned closet Mom!\u00a0 \nShe reams me everyday about how much time I spend on my computer. \nWhile I get on her about how much time she spends sitting on her butt -watching that annoying Judge Judy! \n \n \n Me and Mom -Girls Night Out \n \nHaving her live here with me, I can see the dynamics of our relationship is just like the relationship she had with  her  mother. \u00a0They fussed and fussed and loved each other madly. \n \nWhen we lost Grandma, I thought that my mother would completely fall apart. \u00a0She did not. She was much stronger than I ever imagined she would be, although she still misses her to this very day. \u00a0But now, we think of Grandma with nothing but happy thoughts and laughter. \u00a0Thankful to her for the gifts that she gave us while she was here. \n \nWhen the day comes, that I loose my mother and I hope that day comes, much later than sooner. \u00a0I will think of her, smile and laugh about all the things she said and all of the gifts that she has given me. \n \nLoving you La Unia Hinton, and Beverly LaUnia on this Mother's Day and always... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bi-C-TKoSJA/UY_gyHe8YiI/AAAAAAAABMQ/SKupMTRtYWM/s1600/meandgrandma.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9CmMr_wno0A/UY_g2iGTe1I/AAAAAAAABMY/2_5qXg5XQmw/s1600/grandma+mom.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J3zhQ79vHBI/UY_i0Nj_RGI/AAAAAAAABMk/BwaKm1OA6Y0/s1600/momme.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/05/launia-hinton.html", "title": "\nLaUnia Hinton\n"},

{"date": "Thursday, June 2, 2016", "body": "\n \n \nSubconsciously, I was trying not to think about the fact that summer is staring me in the face until the subject came up in therapy. \n \n\"Your summer will be very different from years past. Have you thought about how that will look for you and what you want to do?\" \n \nMe? Do? Summer? I'm not used to thinking about what  I  am going to do for the summer. It's usually all about what am I going to do with and for the boys. What activities and camps will I find for them? How much more driving will I have to do in this Texas heat? How will I keep them entertained and from killing each other or being kicked out of all of the city pools like in this blog ~ \"Down Dog.\" \n \nToo much togetherness has never been good for our family's mental health. Summers have been the bain of my existence since the kids have been in adolescence. I have come to loathe what used to be one of my favorite seasons. It has become a time when I get more anxious, sad and depressed. \n \nUsually this time of year, I'm visiting my doctor's office in a panic that my anti-anxiety/depressant isn't working anymore.\u00a0 Increase the dose! Please! I don't think I can make it through the summer without someone being seriously injured.\u00a0 \n \nIf you have followed my blog for a while, you may have read some of our summer stories.  \"Lost My Happy\" \u00a0and  \"Very Aspergery Day\" \u00a0(which was hilarious, in a painful kind of way) are just a couple of them. \n \nLast summer was definitely no  \"Bed of Roses.\" \u00a0Red's behavior was at an all time high of suckiness. I don't even want to think about all of the details. \n \nThis summer will be divergent from the norm for us. For one, Red has moved out of the house, and I am no longer responsible for entertaining him.  Can I get a hallelujah? \u00a0He has arranged for his schedule to be very busy for the summer (key word here - HE  arranged). He will be working an average of 25 hours a week or more. Work will be followed by working out at the gym where he is employed. \u00a0The group home will be providing his transportation to work so ... YAY ME! \n \nWhen Red is busy and has a structured schedule, his behavior and anxiety are so much better. It gives his mind less time to wander and worry about all of the \"what if's\" of life. \n \nExactly what Blue will be doing is still up in the air. Why? Because he is 17 and no longer allows me to plan his life. I know for sure he will be taking driving lessons, and he will work on his required parent taught\"driving hours\" to get his license. Only, I won't be the parent teaching him. We will have to hire a \"parent\" because we would end up killing each other. He and his father are like fire and gasoline these days. He will also be taking a class through our local community college. \n \nHe says he wants to get a job, although he has yet to look for one. And who am I to try to prod him along? I would like very much for him to do some traveling ...without me. However, I have to get him to agree and figure out if and when he will be working before I can plan anything with or for him. So yeah . Good times.\u00a0 \n \nAs for me, my plan is to take a bit of a break from the blog. I will check in every once in a while with a quick update. However, I want to use the majority of my creative energy on some other projects \n \n \n \nMany of my readers have been asking me to write a book based on this blog. I would like to focus on that. \u00a0I've been writing this blog for seven years, so figuring out how to dissect it and give a hindsight perspective will be a\u00a0major project. \u00a0 If you know of any editors or publishers who may be interested in helping me get my stories into a book, please feel free to contact me.  (wesleyweave@gmail.com)\u00a0  Seriously! Please! Help!!!  I am called to do this, but overwhelmed by the idea at the same time. \n \nIn the meantime, I hope to open up the blog to some of my readers, fellow autism parents and adults or even teens on the spectrum to share their stories. \u00a0If you have a story you would like to share or know someone who does; please contact me. I will be glad to help you polish it. \n \n \n The Pacific Ocean in Kona, Hawaii \n \n \nFor the first time in 20 years, I plan to focus on self-care this summer. I will be exercising, traveling, writing and trying to be creative. I hope to put my feet in as many bodies of water as I possibly can. I will also be working on a few home improvement projects. My home has been severely neglected for the past few years. \n \nMy husband and I already have an exciting trip planned. Of course, I only have a general idea of what I will do with my mother and Blue while we're gone. \u00a0I find that I still get an extra dose of anxiety planning any get-away\u00a0because there are usually so many details to work out. I'm trying to get over it, which is, of course, easier said than done. \n \nThis freedom is a strange, untethered feeling. It's kind of like I'm blowing in the wind, but I will try to make the best of it. \n \nI will be in touch. I'm a  Facebook \u00a0addict, so there will always be updates there. \n \nLove and blessings, \n \n~Karen\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rq8sKm5zgQ0/V1CGhi8q6OI/AAAAAAAAEdg/HpnAFCBPJy4dN9HvdTNDfGx0K_VvzkeFwCLcB/s1600/12308302_10205086290066692_1494174330783367503_n.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/ConfessionsofAnAspergersMom"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2016/06/omg-its-summer.html", "title": "\nOMG!

{"date": "Friday, November 1, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \nFor Halloween this year ...Red dressed as an  Annoying Aspergers Christian  preaching the gospel to all those who don't want to hear -over and over and over again. \n \n \n \nI am continually annoyed by his preaching especially, since most of the time he has no idea what he's talking about, his facts are not straight. \u00a0He has a tendency to listen to the interpretation of others, which is often based on opinion. Since he is so black and white -he believes almost anything that comes out of the mouth of another Christian. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAt the same time,\u00a0 I am so happy that he has his faith .  \n \n \n \nIf you've followed this blog for a while, you may know that I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. \u00a0Yes -one of those annoying people who knocks on your door on Saturday mornings when you're trying to relax and watch cartoons. \u00a0Believe me, I wanted to be home watching cartoons too, \u00a0but my mother chose otherwise. \u00a0We attended some kind of service or bible study 3 times a week, and then Field Service on Saturdays. \u00a0 HATED IT!  I didn't protest too loudly. \u00a0It wouldn't have made much of a difference anyway. \u00a0But as I grew into my teenage years, I became more and more crafty at ways to get out of it. \u00a0I also became pretty damned good at finding ways to do things that I wanted to do ...like dating and hanging out with my \" wordly \" friends. \n \n \n \nBy the time I hit 17 ...I was officially done. \u00a0I was tired of the judgment of the congregation and the all-life-invasiveness of the religion. \u00a0I told my mom, I am totally done with caring about what these \"people\" think about me and what I'm doing in my personal life. DONE!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI remained a faithful Christian who for many years carried tons of guilt for everything that I did. \u00a0Of course, the guilt didn't stop me from doing what I really wanted to do. \u00a0My Christian upbringing was however, a good guide between right and wrong. \u00a0It lead me to stay away from drugs, and smoking (unless you count marijuana). \u00a0Drinking? \u00a0That's another story.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nI was always a natural servant to others following the example of Christ. \u00a0In fact, Christ is still my favorite Christian. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI\u00a0didn't allow my faith to stop me from having any fun as it did all of those years that I was controlled by my mother and the religion with no Christmases, Halloween or birthdays. \u00a0 Yes people! This is the reason I still treat my birthday like a national holiday and I celebrate for a month! I'm scarred! \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs an adult and a parent, I provided Christian guidance and values for my children, but never strongly pushed church. \u00a0It was always so hard to get the boys together enough to go when they were younger, but we did go periodically. \u00a0After leaving California and moving to Texas, I never quite found a church home in which I was totally comfortable.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs a middle-aged adult, my ministry is helping other families through this blog and the support groups that I run. \u00a0Writing is my gift from God that I share with the world and I do so in service to him.\u00a0I don't need the approval of anyone besides God in my ministry. \u00a0My relationship with him is private.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \nA few years ago, Red found his way to church with a friend. \u00a0It's a very small, relatively quiet church where he found love and acceptance. \u00a0He became close friends with the Pastor of the church. \u00a0In fact, he and his wife pick him up every Sunday morning. \u00a0He is a part of Red's team of mentors; a friend he can call when he is having a rough time. \u00a0He's a friend who I can call if Red is having a particularly rough day and needs someone ...when he is not listening to me. \u00a0After all -I am his mother, which means I'm clueless. \u00a0I am eternally grateful to his pastor and friend, for what he has done and continues to do for my son. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAs a matter of fact, he is taking Red to his first Christian all-day concert this Saturday -Spirit Fest. \u00a0Red is so excited! \u00a0Christian rock has become his favorite genre. \u00a0He actually put down Linkin Park, and some of the Heavy Metal music and has replaced it with praise music, which he LOVES to sing all.the.time! \u00a0Much to Blue's annoyance.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI call him the  Annoying Aspergers Christian  because his faith, the gospel, and church have become his latest obsession/fixation. \u00a0He preaches to all of us in this house without ceasing. \u00a0He also tries preaching at school. And quite frankly, he doesn't always have his facts straight. \u00a0I know the bible! \u00a0I have studied the bible backwards and forwards most of my life. \u00a0He's been a Christian for 15 minutes and he thinks he can school me ...and my 74 year-old mother.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe is constantly talking about who is and is not going to hell; who is not Christian enough; who must be an Atheist because they don't go to church every Sunday, or 3 times a week like he does. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nIsn't it ironic that he  chooses  to go to church 3 times a week and I never pushed him? \u00a0If I had pushed ...would he be as sick of church and judgmental Christians as I am?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe goes to not one church but two different churches. \u00a0He attends his home church on Sundays. \u00a0On Monday and Wednesday nights he attends another church because he loves their youth program.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nYes. My heavily religious childhood has left certain scars. \u00a0However, my faith in God remains in tact. \u00a0I am so thankful to him that he has touched Red's heart. \u00a0This has been the only thing that has truly turned his life around -for the positive. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe boy who used to post curse filled rants on Facebook is now quoting scripture and leaving positive messages about God's love. \u00a0The boy who hates to read is now reading the bible -on his own. \u00a0He uses a computer application that helps interpret the bible to help him understand it. \u00a0 \n \nYes ...he talks about his faith all day long and to everyone who is willing to listen.\u00a0 \n \nYes it is annoying! \u00a0 \n \nAnd yes...I am grateful.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wSrmF3apj8A/UnPN_mcWg6I/AAAAAAAABVI/tDRI7oO9UwE/s1600/images-1.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/11/annoying-aspergers-christian.html", "title": "\nAnnoying Aspergers Christian\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2016", "body": "\n \n \n \n \nIn the wake of the Orlando shooting a few days ago, social media has been full of sorrow, ranting, anger, arguing and so much more. I usually reserve my fighting energy for the battles right here in my home, trying to raise these children. I fight for services for them and their education. With what I have left, I write. I hope that my writing helps other parents to be inspired to keep fighting for their children. I go out into the world and try to touch a life in some way, whether that be helping a neighbor by picking up her children, or taking them a gallon of milk when she is sick. Babysitting for a single-mother friend, who doesn't have family support. I will give a smile, a compliment or encouragement to a complete stranger. \n \nAfter so many were killed once again, \u00a0by a madman with a gun/or guns, I've been feeling helpless, depressed, sad and sometimes even angry, especially, when politicians start their rhetoric and pontificating. \u00a0Nothing changes. \n \nThen I read this, and I knew I had to share it with my audience.

The only two people I took care of yesterday other than myself, were my children. \u00a0For that --yes...I am grateful. \n \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n Hit me up with a comment below. \u00a0I love hearing from my readers... \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-supervisor.html", "title": "\nThe Supervisor (w/the worst Pay Ever!) \n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, November 11, 2014", "body": "\n \nThis morning I am publishing part of the little love note that Elizabeth Gilbert wrote on her Facebook page today ( 9/11/2014 ). \n \nThough Liz is not a mother, I think that this message is so vitally important to us parents in the trenches trying to raise our kids. \u00a0In fact, just on Sunday I made this meme for my followers on my own  Confessions Facebook Page\u00a0 . I thought it was so ironic that Liz posted a letter with this very same theme today. Of course, she spells it out much more eloquently than I ever could. \n \n \n \nMany of us continue to try to no avail, to control our children. However, there comes a point in their lives somewhere close to the teenage years, where we as parents are really no longer in control. \u00a0We are guides, we are examples, we are counselors, we are consultants. \u00a0We can not make them believe what we believe. We can not force them to have the same values. They just are who they are, imperfections, unlearned lessons and all. \n \nSometimes, trying to force them to be who we want them to be, has the exact opposite effect and can even be damaging to their spirits. \u00a0A \u00a0parent can  try  to control a child's behavior, but you can not control who your child really is at their core especially, as they grow closer and closer towards adulthood. \u00a0You may be controlling their behavior when they are in front of you. \u00a0However you may be causing them to lie to you and sneak around in order to be who they really are as soon as they're out of your sight. I've seen this in some of my children's friends. I went through that myself with a controlling mother. \u00a0No thanks. I'd rather know the truth about what my kids are doing and who they really are. Even if I don't like it.  \n \nSome lessons we are not meant to teach, no matter how much we want to. For example, no matter how much I want Red to want to take a shower daily, he doesn't want that for himself, so it doesn't happen. No matter how much I want him to learn to spend money more wisely, he has to make his own mistakes with his finances. Some things, he will just learn on his own, in his own way, or from someone other than me. I can not control everything! \n \nI am currently working hard on a couple of new mantras... \n\"Karen ...just stay out of it!\" \u00a0 ( Even when you see the train wreck coming from miles away. ) \nThe second one is ...  \n\"I am the the only person that I can control.\" \n \nHere in part is Liz's letter... \n( Yes. I call her Liz. She's like a personal friend and I'm like her stalker. ) \n \n \"Dear Ones - \n \n During Oprah's speech at the Life You Want Tour, she quotes Glinda the Good Witch from The Wizard of Oz, in that fabulous moment when Glinda banishes The Wicked Witch of the West with this line: \"You have no power here.\"\u00a0 \n \n Oprah was talking about how important it is in your lives to be cognizant of where you have power, and where you do not. She said that so much of the stress and pain we bring into our lives comes from trying to interfere in other people's energy fields \u2014 trying to meddle in domains where we simply have no power.\u00a0 \n \n The truth, of course, is that the only energetic domain in which you have any power is your own. You don't have power over your spouse, over your parents, over your neighbors, over your co-workers. Even regarding your own children, there will come a moment when you realize that you no longer have any power over their energetic domain (and for most parents I know, that moment comes a lot sooner than they are expecting it, and is often a shocker) And trying to hold power (even with the best of intentions) over other people's lives will bring you \u2014 and them \u2014 nothing but suffering. \n \n Ask yourself how much of the pain you suffer in life is because of something you wish somebody else would be, or do, or fix, or transform. Your friend who needs to stop drinking. Your brother who needs to get a job. Your mother who can't let go of her bitterness and rage. Your father who can't open his heart to love. Your daughter who can't stay in a relationship for more than six months. Your son who needs to change his diet and move to a new city and find a good church and get away from those bad-influence friends of his.\u00a0 \n \n The fact is: You're probably right. All those people may indeed need to make exactly those changes. Obviously, their lives would be better for it. Any fool can see that.\u00a0 \n \n But it's not your domain. \n \n And meanwhile, you're leaking energy, when what you really need to be focusing on is your own power, your own life (which is hard enough to manage, and has its own set of problems that really require your full attention...as any fool can see.)\u00a0 \n \n I have been guilty of this forever. I have a history of getting deeply, profoundly, aggressively over-involved in other people's energy fields \u2014 losing sleep and peace over my worry and judgment about other people's lives. (Or, rather, I should say, losing sleep and peace over MY PERCEPTION of other people's lives.) Getting involved where I have no power. Neglecting my own growth and development because I'm too busy minding somebody else's business. Making myself sick with anger or disappointment or sorrow or frustration over how somebody else has behaved. Often destroying relationships because I go around messing where I have no right to be messing. (I don't care if it's out of love and concern \u2014 I still have no right to be making myself crazy by getting involved in somebody else's energy field.)\u00a0 \n \n You have no power in their domain. \n \n You have no power in their energy field. \n \n You have no power over their choices.\u00a0 \n \n You have enough trouble (I remind myself) managing your OWN energy field. So focus on the one person in the world you can somewhat control (YOURSELF) and stay the hell out of their business. \n \n We must love each other. We must be kind to each other. We must be generous in act and spirit with each other. But for the sake of grace and sanity, WE MUST LET EACH OTHER BE. (Or else somebody might drop a house on you, too \u2014 as our friend Glinda would warn with a smile...)\u00a0 \n \n ONWARD, \n LG\"\u00a0 \n \nIsn't this just the perfect message? It's definitely not just for parents. \u00a0Even Blue could use this valuable lesson, as the young man who tries to completely control the world and his environment. \n \nAgain, I left some of her words out. You can read the  entire letter  on \u00a0 Elizabeth Gilbert's Official Facebook Page (post from 9/11/14) . \u00a0If you are not following her on FB or Twitter ...you should be. She's full of all kinds of wit, wisdom and inspiration. \u00a0She feels like a kindred spirit to me --a much smarter, inspiring, sister from another mother. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eIcqDBDsBLg/VGI79hbH8bI/AAAAAAAABt0/QhWyPGBcGf4/s1600/10407142_724882790921297_4892166896516843041_n.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/GilbertLiz"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/11/you-have-no-power-here.html", "title": "\n\"You Have No Power Here\" \n"},

{"date": "Monday, June 27, 2016", "body": "\n \n \n \n Sister-friend, Autism Mama ~Elena \n \n \nAutism \u201clife is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you\u2019re gonna get.\u201d \u00a0Will it be a pleasant day? Will I be able to get my chores done, exercise, write, go to the market? \u00a0Will the whole world be shot to hell in a hand basket by just saying one thing, that sets off an explosion that will last\u00a0for hours, or maybe even days? Will I get one of those phone calls, that makes my heart start racing? Autism parents all know that feeling when the school's number is on the caller i.d. \n \n \n \nI can feel my summer depression setting in. I thought with Red living away and being busy working; I would be able to avoid it this year. Silly girl. I should know by now, never to get too comfortable with life in the easier lane. \n \n \n \nWith Red gone, issues with Blue are bubbling to the surface. \u00a0He started off summer with a bang of a meltdown which essentially lasted three days.  And by start off, I mean, the day that school was out. Bam!  \n \nOne minute we are shopping, laughing and having a great conversation. He met me in TJMaxx after SAT tutoring, which was in the same shopping center. We were picking out girly gifts for my god-daughter. \u00a0He talked about how much he enjoyed spending time with her just the week before. \"She loves\u00a0me, mom. I think she looks at me like, kind of a big brother.\" \n \nMoments later, we are in my car when I apparently said the wrong thing. He went from zero to one hundred in nothing flat. He was angry and decided he could no longer be in the same car with me. He got out of my car and walked, at night, in the rain, 2 miles to get home. \u00a0He could not be in the same car as the woman who chose, \"tonight of all nights, the night before the SAT,\" to correct him for yanking his earbuds out of his ears. I had no right to open my big mouth about earbuds that I have replaced dozens of times, because  somehow , they keep getting broken.  It has nothing to do with yanking them by the cord out his\u00a0of ears. They just keep shorting out for some strange reason. \n \nOf course, it was his choice to get out of the car, but everything that happened that night was all my fault, and of course, he was furious with me about it all ..for days! \n \n \n \nThe past month of school has been full of stress with the end of his 11th-grade year. He had AP Exams, State Testing, and the SAT on top of his regular class projects and final exams. \u00a0In fact, the next day after the epic meltdown, he was scheduled to take the SAT for the 2nd time. \u00a0I'm sure this was a major contributor to the anxiety which sparked the outburst.  (And No...he did not end up taking it the SAT the next morning. Again...all my fault.) \n \nI was steaming mad about all of the expensive tutoring we paid for to help him with the test, not to mention, paying for the test itself, that he now refused to take. I couldn't push him into doing it. That would just be another disaster. \u00a0Anything I said or did for the rest of that entire weekend, added fuel to the fire.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe has had an incredible year of social success at school. He developed some wonderful relationships with friends, both male, and female. \u00a0The\u00a0females especially have been a great source of strength and comfort. \u00a0They give out the best hugs when he is upset. \n \nHe also has developed a mentor network at school. His Computer Science teacher who is also on the spectrum, is a wonderful resource that he could access daily. He has also basically become friends with his old Science teacher, who is now his Club Sponsor. She is quite familiar with autism because she is married to a man with Aspergers. She also has a brother with autism. \u00a0In other words, he has created a substantial support system that suddenly, he will not have daily access to now that summer is starting \n. \nSo, let's add all of the pressure from the end of school, to the sudden absence of his support network, then add a splash of SAT testing, and wham! There you have it! The makings of an epic meltdown.\u00a0 \n \n \nI remember that feeling in high school when school was out for the summer, I wouldn't \u00a0have easy access to my friends. For one thing, I usually worked, and most summers I worked full-time. I loved the money, but I hated the time it took away from hanging out with my friends. It felt like I was going through withdrawals from them. So, I get it. For him, these feelings are intensified as everything is with autism, especially social relationships. \n \n \nAt this point, I can not say, or do anything right. I can not parent. I can not guide. I can not suggest. \u00a0I can not even listen, without succumbing to the urge to say something, which will ultimately be the absolute worst thing anyone in the history of the world, could say. \u00a0I\u2019m screwed! I feel purposeless, other than occasionally handing out money and providing transportation. And apparently, I can\u2019t even provide transportation without the world nearly coming to an end. \n \n \nSimple conversations between just the two of us are a strain, to say the least. \u00a0A conversation where the two of us could get to the root of our communication problems, would be impossible. We decided it would be best for me to sit down with him and his therapist so that we could hear one another. I needed to find out what he wants from me at this point because it feels like he doesn\u2019t want anything. Yet, he makes a point of telling me that I\u2019m not being supportive and understanding.  I\u2019m like, how supportive can I be when you\u2019re always so angry with me? \n \n \nThrough our session with his therapist, I discovered that when he is at school working with peers, teachers and adult mentors, he feels successful and more adult-like and independent. Somehow that all goes away when he comes home and has to be reminded what to do. It makes him feel less powerful and in control. And he  loves  control! In fact in the middle of one of his meltdowns recently he told me, \"I hate limits!\" Of course, he probably feels more limits when he is here with us than when he's away from us. That's only natural, right? \nI decided that I need to find ways to recreate some of the autonomy that he has at school. I need to give him more of a sense of control so that he can feel more independent. \u00a0He needs transportation from me, but at the same time, he probably hates the fact that he needs it. Yet, the prospects of driving are a little nerve racking to say the least. He says he wants to work, but going through the process of actually making that happen, feels overwhelming to him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI decided it is time to add to my village. When you can't do everything yourself, find someone who is better at it. I've decided to hire a replacement mom. Haha! I wish! Actually, through my contacts in our school district,\u00a0 I was able to find and hire a Job Coach who will work with him privately. It's cheaper than sending him to a camp or a social skills group that would help him to gain these skills. \n \nEvery attempt I have taken to help him look for a job or plan his time this summer has been met with disdain and the attitude of  I have no idea what the hell I\u2019m talking about.  The value of him working with someone whom he will cooperate fully, is priceless. \n \n \n \nThe Job Coach will help him write a resume,\u00a0 go through job application process, and work on interview skills. She will also help him look into some volunteer opportunities to help fill his time and maybe even work with him to get the ball rolling with his driving instruction through the driving school. \n \nI believe there is nothing like the feeling you get from being a leader and doing something to help others. I hope that adding some opportunities for success and structure to his days, will be good for his mood. \u00a0The less time he spends in this house with me, the better for all us. He's happier when he's accomplishing something. \n \nAt this point in his life, I have to step back and let his support network help transition him into adulthood. It has been proven in the past with his brother, Red. \u00a0It truly does take a village. And sometimes, the best way to solve the problem is to take yourself out of the equation.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-05BfK-GIPzw/V3FaI-RAGxI/AAAAAAAAE1I/ysZ7C6D9b0E6PoSjMNsPxuxOjUBea-AwwCLcB/s1600/13495016_10154227086239194_6154682056830556118_n.jpg", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2DdWUOUcsWo/V3GprUTvewI/AAAAAAAAE1g/gy0UlRgKtJs1yR0rqChYi-3rfH9Vg0tqACLcB/s1600/13432419_1024518800957693_1446993304230524326_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2016/06/autism-box-of-chocolates.html", "title": "\nAutism -Box of Chocolates \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, December 15, 2010", "body": "\nThe boys spent their weekend here at home with their dad and my mom. \u00a0I am so happy and proud of the bond that my husband shares with our youngest son Blue. \u00a0They like to go to breakfast together on the weekends. They love to go to the movies and play these geeky computer games together. \u00a0Red -on the other hand, is a teen who wants little or nothing to do with his father right now. \u00a0He appears to view his father as the enemy most of the time, that is unless he wants or needs something from him. \u00a0I refuse to help him with anything to do with his computer so that he will NEED his father for something and have no choice but to go to him and attempt to be respectful. \n \nI had the best weekend ever, or at least recently. \u00a0My girlfriend  came in from L.A. to hang with me and go to Lake Austin Spa for the day.  \u00a0Rebecca and I met over 20 years ago working for the same employer. \u00a0We  have been there for each other through all of life's changes. \u00a0We once  both dated twin brothers. \u00a0We could have been sister-in-laws. \u00a0We've  been there through our single years, devastating break-ups, career  changes, marriage and motherhood. \n \nWhile she was  here...we partied, relaxed at the spa, shared some exquisite meals and  cocktails, closed down a night club like we used to in the good old  days. \u00a0I feel so blessed to have friendships that I have maintained for a  lifetime. \u00a0I love that I have people who know me -the real me, and they  love me anyway. \n \nSo all was good on the home front over the weekend...or so I thought until Monday morning. \u00a0First of all, on Sunday evening, I came home and passed out around 7 p.m. \u00a0This sister can not party the way she used to. I slept until 7 a.m. the next morning when my alarm went off. \u00a0Well, it actually went off at 6:40 a.m., but I hit snooze twice. \u00a0When I did lift my head from the pillow, I felt a little groggy. \u00a0It took me a couple of minutes to get my bearings.  \n \nI wandered into Blue's room at 7:08 a.m. to make sure he was awake. \u00a0He had been waking up on his own for the past week or so, early, because he wants to be on time for the bus and not be rushed. \u00a0He was livid! \"You woke me up late! \u00a0My morning is ruined! It's all your fault! \u00a0Just forget it...I'm not going to school!\" \u00a0Now this is my cooperative child \u00a0-the one who is the total opposite of his brother. \u00a0He went on and on and on. \u00a0He read me up and down until I put it to a halt. \u00a0He even went into, \"You're the worst mom EVER!\" \n \n Ha! That will teach you to leave me all weekend! \u00a0\u00a0Of course, he didn't say that. \u00a0He may not have even been aware that this is what the rant was all about. \u00a0Somehow, I know that was the underlying reason. \u00a0Even though, he was well taken care of, and had a totally awesome weekend, he did not appreciate me not being here. And to top it off -I had the audacity to stay at the Westin -Domain, where the Apple Store is located (his favorite place on earth). \n \n \nBy the time I picked him up from school, he was in a much better mood. \u00a0He sincerely apologized about what happened that morning. \u00a0After the doctors appointment, we stopped over at the Domain where I had left my favorite pillow in the hotel room. (Yes -I'm like Linus with his blanket.) We also stopped by the Apple Store where he answered all of my questions about the differences between the laptops and th IPAD. \u00a0All was good between us. \n \nThe next morning over breakfast out of the blue he asks, \"Mom, do you ever worry about being a good mom?\" \n\"Yes. \u00a0I worry all the time.\" \n\"Like when?\" \n\"Like when you guys are sad or upset and I want to fix it. Like when you feel bad about having Aspergers. I wonder if I'm doing the right thing. \u00a0If I have the right supports in place for you at school.\" \n\"Well, you shouldn't worry, because you are. \u00a0You are a good mom.\" \n \nThis more than made up for the rant the morning before. \u00a0The moment was priceless and so is he.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/12/worst-mom-ever.html", "title": "\nWorst Mom Ever!\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2011", "body": "\n If you've been reading while I was away...you know that I had a fabulous trip! \u00a0For 5 days I was able to forget who I am and what I do and just be. \u00a0I am a woman -an adult who can laugh with her friends and family. \u00a0Free like a bird -I came and went taking full advantage of my independence. \u00a0I spa'd, danced, laughed, dined, cocktailed and chatted with old friends and siblings. It was great -until I got to the airport to come back home. I get one of those infamous phone calls. \n \n \n Yes -that's right. \u00a0The shit hit the fan on my very last day. \u00a0My mom called to ask me a question about medication. \u00a0She also filled me in on the days events. \"We had the opportunity to walk in your shoes today. We (my mom and husband) now know what you go through.\" \u00a0This time, my husband was there to catch the phone call from school, \"You need to come and pick up your son. \u00a0We can't put him on the bus because he is seeking attention by making suicidal threats.\" Aspergers dad -was in the middle of carpooling Blue and his friends when he gets the call. \u00a0He had to drop them off and go over to the high school to retrieve an angry unhappy Aspergers teen.  \n \n \n After a conversation with the school Psych -Red apologized for making those statements. \u00a0He says he is just angry and didn't know what else to say to express his anger. \u00a0There is a wall full of positive statements written and posted all over the walls to remind him of all of the good things in his life. \u00a0They are trying their best to be supportive.  \n \n \n By the time they get home...he goes back to the negative script, \"Ms. so and so is just mean! \u00a0No one cares about me! \u00a0The work is just too hard! \u00a0The classes are too loud. \u00a0I hate the cafeteria. \u00a0Maybe I should go to the hospital. \u00a0I have no other choice.\"  \n \n \n The following morning I call his Psychiatrist's office to fill her in on the days events. \u00a0She wants to see him. \u00a0Instead of me falling back into bed because I am jet-lagged. \u00a0I get myself together to take him to see her. \u00a0She almost hospitalized him based on his statements. \u00a0He talked his way out of it. \u00a0Assured her that he just needed to rest at home and wait for the tweak in his medication to kick in. \u00a0He promised that if he had any more serious bouts with anger he would be willing to go to the hospital. \u00a0She gave him a mental health day off from school and sent us on our way with a medication adjustment. \n \n \n It just doesn't seem right that a kid should have so many different meds on board just to make it through the day at school. \u00a0At the same time, we can't have him exploding all over the place, making threats and creating havoc at school and at home making himself and everyone around him miserable. The whole situation is just screwed!  \n \n \n It's a really difficult decision to give your kid medication, but when he's full of anxiety, depression, anger and heavy moods you feel helpless. \u00a0I feel inclined to take the advice of the professionals who are close to the situation and have all of the facts to help them make an informed decision on how to proceed. \u00a0I just wish their was a better way -you know, like a miracle. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n If you have any thoughts or feelings about your child, Aspergers and medication...I would love to hear your feedback. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qETxR2Kb-j0/TbgxQRwFV0I/AAAAAAAAAMg/utmnvQvKhWw/s1600/images-17.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/04/that-aint-right.html", "title": "\nThat Ain't Right!\n"},
{"date": "Friday, October 3, 2014", "body": "\n \nHere in my reality, I am not always able to find the bright side of the story. \u00a0Lately, there hasn't been much light to be found in the shadows and darkness. \u00a0Yesterday, was different. \u00a0The sun was shining and I definitely saw a bit of light. \n \nI had a rational conversation with Red, in which he finally took some responsibility for his recent behaviors.  \n \n\"I just can't do it. \u00a0I don't know what it is ...but I can't get along with this family.\" \n\"Do you think there is anything that can change that?\" \n\"No. Honestly, I don't.\" \n \nWow! I wish I had recorded it. He seemed to be reaching a point of acceptance that he is going to have to move out. He still thinks he's not ready and that he can't afford it. \u00a0He doesn't think he can handle everything on his own and neither do I. \u00a0I assured him that I would make sure that he has the support that he needs. \u00a0We talked about a post-production film program in California for young adults on the spectrum. \u00a0We talked about supported living environments both here and in California. \n \nI illustrated how well he is doing in all environments except for home. \u00a0He saw the picture. I told him that I think he will grow into the young man that he needs to be if he gets away from me. \u00a0He's a mama's boy and he knows it.  \n \nI have been his anchor, his voice and his advocate for so long. \u00a0Maybe I have over-mothered in attempts to protect him from himself and from the horror that was middle and high school. He was so sad, depressed and felt so isolated. \u00a0I knew that he was in deep pain in those situations and I tried to compensate for that however I could. \u00a0I fought for the best possible scenario available in a sea of \u00a0bad options for a kid like him.  \n \nHowever, I feel like at this point, I'm stunting his growth. I can't be his lifeline anymore. I just can't do it. The more I give, the more he takes, leaving nothing left over for me. He needs to stand on his own. \u00a0He will continue to need support, but he will get it from other adults who have high expectations of him and he will rise to the occasion, just as we've already seen since he left high school. \u00a0Being away from me will force him to grow up. \u00a0I think he'll be happier. \u00a0I told him that during our rational conversation. It may not be all roses. There will be some thorns. \u00a0There will be some setbacks but ultimately, he will thrive. \n \nIt's not like he's someone with absolutely no drive and no initiative. \u00a0He was that way in high school. But since then, he is on point with his job. \u00a0He hasn't missed a single day and hasn't had one, single issue there. \u00a0He has the drive and initiative to work on his own business, even though he still has a lot to learn. \u00a0He is motivated to make money! I think that getting some distance from me will be the spark that puts him into overdrive. \n \nI was feeling discouraged and messaged my good friend Paul yesterday. \u00a0I met Paul through this blog and my  Confessions Facebook community \u00a0 (See... Social media is good for something! ) \n \nPaul wrote a little about  his Aspergers story \u00a0on my blog last year. (It's a really great piece of writing. \u00a0You really should check it out.) Paul had had a difficult childhood not knowing that he had Aspergers. \u00a0He is now a successful business owner, excellent father and a husband. \u00a0He has friended Red on FB and always has encouraging things to say to him.  \n \nI love him for who he is as a man and the way he treats my son with such dignity.  \n \nPaul wrote the following... \n \n \"I have this gut feeling that I've never been able to shake...but I have always thought there was something very special about your boys. I mean that with all my heart, and I've probably even told you that before, but I absolutely cannot shake the feeling that, despite the frustrations and challenges, God is cooking up something extraordinary in Red's life. I swear to you, it's just feel it as real as the air I breathe.\u00a0 \n \n You've always inspired me so much just in the way you live your life and carry yourself through these struggles. It doesn't seem like much of a consolation, but it takes an extraordinary person to raise kids like that, and it's pretty clear why God picked you. Gee...thanks, God! Right?\u00a0 \n \n Maybe I just relate to him because I was like that too, and I was blessed enough to have a dad with the same heart you have ...and he never gave up. It wasn't like he said \"I'm done with you\" but instead he was saying \"I love you too much to let you keep living like this\". And because he was a parent with the same heart as you, he saved my life over and over and we have a great relationship now. He's my hero and always has been. I would bet my life Red sees that in you too when he looks back 5 or 10 years from now.\u00a0 \n You are all amazing people and I count myself blessed to call you friend. Please hang in there...you are doing an amazing job!!\" \n \nThis brought a tear to my eyes and joy to my heart. Everything he said made absolute sense. It's almost like Red is pushing me to push him out and that may be a God thing too. \n \nAgain, thank you Paul for being there for him and for me. I appreciate your support more than you'll ever know.  \n \nIt is a daunting to think of my child moving away from me, out there into the big, bad \u00a0ugly world. I know it's scary for him. \u00a0It's scary for me. Ultimately, it will be for the best for both of us. \u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099?ref=hl"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/10/a-little-light.html", "title": "\nA Little Light \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, September 4, 2014", "body": "\n \nOur family may have very well just had our last trip with everyone together. \u00a0It was my mother's 75th birthday and a family reunion on her father's side of the family. \u00a0The boys had not been to St. Louis to see the family since before they could walk and talk. \u00a0I felt it was important that we all be there so that the boys would have an opportunity to meet their relatives. The fact that the planning committee requested that Red be the videographer for the event, sealed the deal on his going. \n \nOver the past few weeks his behavior and attitude towards this family has royally sucked. \u00a0More than once I thought about eating the cost of his ticket and just canceling. \u00a0He is 18 years-old, but could not be left alone here at home. \u00a0There are no guarantees that the house would be locked, that he would eat properly or take his medicine regularly. \u00a0We would have to either send him somewhere, or have someone come here. \u00a0Both alternatives would cost even more money. \u00a0And so ...off we went. \n \nThe boys first got to meet my cousin Court who was absolutely, awesome with them. \u00a0They both were filled with anxiety over meeting all of these new people. \u00a0Court put them at ease instantly. \u00a0He reads my blog regularly and follows my Facebook page, so he had an idea of what to expect from the boys. \u00a0Although, there's nothing like meeting them in person. \u00a0He spoke their language. \u00a0He's young enough to know about the same music and popular culture that they are interested in. \u00a0He's just old enough to \u00a0have a little experience in life that he could relate to their experiences as young black men, being raised in a predominantly white culture and world. Court is a well spoken, college educated man who they related to rather well. \u00a0The boys were impressed with him. Both boys feel it is important to speak well and present the best of yourself so as not to be stereotyped and thought of in a negative manner by society. \n \nBefore the first Family Reunion dinner ...Blue started a anxiety-filled rant. \u00a0He was nervous about how the evening would go. \u00a0Red had been pouncing on him all day. \u00a0He pushed every button and was relentless in his taunting. \u00a0Red became stuck on how Blue doesn't get enough discipline. \u00a0How we let him get away with everything. \u00a0He's the only one who gets in trouble. \u00a0He actually brought this up at the table during the reunion dinner as we sat with extended family and he would not let it go. \u00a0I was kind of shocked by the fact that he was going there, in front of other people. \u00a0Usually, he reserves that behavior for just immediate family. \u00a0His behavior was so ugly, I had to get up and leave the room before I would end up losing it. \n \nOn our last night there, Red continued to pounce on Blue, with negative comments again during a family dinner situation. \u00a0My aunt and uncle were awesome at trying to distract him, allowing him to talk about himself and his interests to in order to get him to leave his brother alone and have a nice dinner. \u00a0He kept coming back to controversial subjects like racism and religion. \u00a0In the car on the way back to our hotel, again he pounced. \u00a0In fact, I may venture to say he was bullying Blue, calling him an atheist over and over again. \u00a0The irony in that of course, is how un-christ-like his own behavior was in the process. \n \nThe day that we traveled home didn't get much better. In fact, at DFW our second flight was delayed, and delayed and delayed, then finally another plane had to be brought in. He became anxious and visibly upset. \u00a0Imagine, a two-hundred plus pound angry looking, young, black, autistic teenager, pacing back and forth, going up to the staff continuously asking, \"What's the problem? \u00a0How much longer do we have to wait?\" Then he would come back to me and say, \"I'm getting really angry!\" Then, he would start to try to vent that anger on his brother, who actually did remarkably well in not responding. \n \nRed is 18 years old now. \u00a0I can not protect him from everything. \u00a0With all that's been happening in the world lately, with police situations gone wrong, I couldn't help but worry, thinking at any moment, he would explode and would be taken down and detained by airport police. \n \nHe has traveled numerous times alone. \u00a0He has even been delayed and missed a flight in Chicago. \u00a0He NEVER behaved this way! \u00a0This is what made me say, I will NEVER do this again. \u00a0I will never travel with him and the entire family. \u00a0He was agitated by his father, and his brother. \u00a0The better Dad and Blue got along, the more upset Red became. \u00a0He was relentless with me. \u00a0\"Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom. I want to sit next to you! Mom listen to me!\" \n \nBlue is not perfect by any means. \u00a0He can push buttons also. \u00a0He can not mind his own business to save his life! The difference between Red and Blue, is that Blue can be redirected. \u00a0If you ask him to stop doing something, he will stop. \u00a0You can ask Red to stop and have to say it 10 times. \u00a0He won't listen until you become completely exasperated and are ready to lose it. \u00a0Then, he blames YOU for getting upset. \u00a0Then he blames his brother for not getting as much discipline as he does. \n \nThe next day after getting home, there was a moment of contrition where Red felt bad about his behavior. \u00a0He thought deeply about it when he was able to take a reprieve away from us, while at work.  \n \nHe said, \"Seems like no matter what I do, I can't stop being angry. \u00a0Even though I know that the way I treat you guys is making Dad want me to move out, I can't seem to stop treating you that way. \u00a0I need some other kind of help, maybe some other kind of therapy. \u00a0I can't stop this behavior. I know I need to do better to be able to keep living at home, but even that doesn't seem to stop me. Do you even think it's even possible for me to change?\" (Honestly, I don't. At least not while he is living with us.) \n \n\"I think that people who respect their parents, have always respected their parents. \u00a0I never really have. \u00a0I really don't know what else to do,\" he said sadly. \n \nI don't know what else to do either. \n \nLast night, he went to church with his pastor and his girlfriend. \u00a0As soon as he got home, he started back up again. \u00a0\"Blue needs more discipline!\" Yelling, screaming, banging on doors, invading Blue's personal space, invading mine.  \n \nHe goes to his room and starts playing annoying videos loudly. \u00a0I asked him to stop as his brother was doing homework. \u00a0He refused until I took the device away. \u00a0Then he starts screaming and pounding on Blue's door as he is trying to get to sleep so that he can get up for school the next day. \n \nThis was not a meltdown. \u00a0This was I'm pissed off and I'm going to piss you all off. \u00a0I don't care what you say. \u00a0I don't care how you feel. \u00a0I don't care about you being tired and ready for bed. \u00a0I don't care that Blue has to get up for school. \u00a0This was pure, unadulterated asshatery! \n \n \n \nTrue enough, all negative behavior has a reason behind it. \u00a0At this point, I'm not sure exactly what it is. I don't even know if I care. \u00a0I just know that I am completely sick of it \u00a0and something has got to change. \u00a0It's not fair for the rest of us to have to live in fear of his antics. \u00a0It's not fair for Blue to have to deal with this when he's trying to get to sleep or do his homework on a school night. \u00a0This boy has got to go! \n \nWhere? I do not know. How? I really don't know. But he is pushing me to find out. \n \nHe keeps going on about how he wants to pursue his passion of video editing. \u00a0Hell! I want to pursue my passion of writing! But he sucks the life right out of me, till I have no creativity left in my body! \n \nWhat he really wants is to have all of his money available to buy video equipment. \u00a0He says that moving out will prevent him from doing that. \u00a0He won't have the cushy life that he has here. \u00a0However, obviously he does not appreciate the cushion of living here. \u00a0He seems to be doing everything in his power to make it impossible for his cushy life to continue.  \n \nI told him today, \"You know what's getting in your way of pursuing your passion? You are!\" \n \nMy Facebook status after the night we got home... \n \n \"I feel like someone kicked my ass last night. Probably because someone did ...mentally.\" \n \nMy Facebook status this morning... \n \n \"Overwhelmed, exhausted and sad. I want to say, 'Jesus take the wheel,' but I know he needs me to do some work too. I guess I will just ask for guidance and strength.\"\u00a0 \n \nSomething has got to give...I've only been saying that since he was 12. \u00a0When he was in high school, I would say,  \"I can't wait until this is over! Then everything will be so much better. \u00a0His stress level will be down. \u00a0He won't have as much to be angry about. \u00a0He'll be happier.\" \n \nI could not have been more wrong. \u00a0It's just a new set of challenges that I don't know if I have the energy to face. \n \np.s.  \nOur weekend was not completely ruined.

{"date": "Sunday, September 14, 2014", "body": "\n \nEvery once in a while we have one of those crazy nights where I feel like I seriously live in the movie, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (the black family version). \u00a0On this night Red came this close (holds fingers together) to becoming homeless. \u00a0I went off the deep end! I was ready to explode completely. The whole house seemed to be going mad. But in the midst of all of the pandemonium, one good thing managed to happen. \n \nHave I ever described my 2 teenage boys to you? Let's see, Red is about 5' foot 10\" close to 11\" and weighs ...a lot. Blue is catching up to him quickly at about 5' 9\" close to 10\" and he weighs ...a lot. I am about 5 ft. 1\" and I weigh hardly anything. \u00a0I am so skinny. (Not!) But let's just say I weigh a hell of a lot less than either of them. \n \nWhen the two of them go at it with their non-stop mouths, insulting each other, trying to intimidate each other, with typical sibling rivalry issues, it often turns physical with a quickness. \u00a0Blue is not afraid to smack the crap out of his big brother, but then he acts surprised when Red goes nuts in return. The next thing you know, what started as a silly sibling fight can turn into one of them ending up in complete meltdown and tearing up something in my house. \u00a0Sometimes I just let them go at it. Other times, when I know someone is already close to the edge, I try to prevent them going over. \n \nWe've all been a little done with Red over the past few weeks. \u00a0His antics in the house have been very disruptive and has everyone on edge and unhappy. He's been ranting about one thing or another and Blue has very little patience for that. The rants don't usually make a lot of sense and since everything needs to make sense to Blue, he feels the need to let his brother know how idiotic and irrational his thoughts are. \u00a0Blue often tells Red that his i.q. is much higher than his. He's in advanced classes, while Red was mostly in special education classes.  \n \nI will jump in when Red really has no defense, other than, \"Shut up! You are not smarter than me!\" I disallow Blue to use certain words against his brother like stupid and dumb. \u00a0I feel like these words are more hurtful than some of the curse words he uses. \u00a0I point out Red's special gifts. \u00a0The fact that he has a job, that he loves and is good at and is even working on developing his own business. \u00a0I point out the fact that Red is loving and kind to other kids with special needs. \u00a0He has a gift for working with and talking to seniors and has volunteered in a Senior Rehab center. \n \nHe's not dumb by any means. \u00a0He just focuses on what he's really good at and pretty much only wants to do that. \u00a0There's nothing wrong with that.  \n \nSo on this night Red is ranting. Thee two of them are fighting. \u00a0I'm trying my best to juggle and keep them apart. \u00a0 You go upstairs, while he is downstairs. You eat dinner, while he's doing homework. I need to go to the pharmacy but I'm afraid to leave the house for 10 minutes because all hell may break loose.\u00a0  My husband is trying to stay out of everything, because his approach to discipline is the subject of one of Red's rants. \n\"Dad is a wannabe tough guy because he was in the military! The military is full of wannabe tough guys.\" \n(This rant is based on some stupid video about a Marine who has become a police officer. \u00a0He clocks this guy for mouthing off to him and then says, \"You're messing with a United States Marine! Don't disrespect me!\") \n \nHe has somehow connected this Mr. Tough guy mentality with his father, who in his opinion often \"soldiers up on him.\" \u00a0Of course, he makes no connection that we have spoken to him civilly over and over again, you know, \u00a0repeating  don't, stop, quit , 2 or 10 times, \u00a0but we get no change in behavior. \u00a0We only get action from him when dad has to become Mr. Tough guy. \n \nRed has told me straight out, if you have nothing to hold over his head, if he has nothing to lose, he will not listen to you. \u00a0Hence, he does well at work because he doesn't want to lose his job. \u00a0He doesn't make the connection that he has a soft place to land, to lose in this situation. \u00a0He is very close to losing the comfort of this home to live in. \n \nOn this night, as I am juggling to keep the boys apart, I am also trying to cook and serve dinner. I made two chicken breast especially for my husband. He doesn't eat wings which is mostly what I have prepared for the rest of us. \u00a0Red knows these two big pieces of chicken are specifically for dad. \u00a0But of course, he's like, \"I want that piece!\" \nBegrudgingly, I agree to let him have one of the breasts along with his other pieces. \n \nShortly after, I have to leave the kitchen for a few minutes to talk to Blue. \u00a0When I return, you bet your butt Red ate ALL of the large pieces. \u00a0It was like he swallowed them whole because I wasn't gone that long. \n \nI swear ...steam was coming out of my ears! \u00a0I was livid! \u00a0My husband who works hard to provide for this family, who had just returned from a business trip, would basically have nothing to eat because of Red, who pays for nothing in this house. \u00a0After all of the other havoc he was causing, this was just the last draw. \n \nOf course this situation reminded me of Chris Rock, \"Oh Lawd! You mean to tell me, you ate the big piece of chicken?!\" Don't click this link this if you don't like profanity... \n \n(*Also Warning if you are viewing this post from a smart phone you may not be able to see the link. Try it from a laptop or pc) \n \n \n \n \nI make Blue get in the car with me, again because I'm trying to keep them apart. \u00a0I need to go around the corner to Walgreen's to pick up his allergy medicine. He can see how visibly shaken I am. \u00a0 He's asking me why I'm so upset? \u00a0I basically blast him.  \n \n\"Really? You're kidding me right? You two huge boys continually going at each other! Me trying to keep you from killing each other! And it's not all your brother! It's you too! You're like a moth to the flame! You have to get involved in every conversation. You insult him constantly! I'm sick and tired of all of it! To top it off...your brother just ate all of the dinner I prepared for your father! He has got to get out of my house! I'm done! I can't live like this anymore!\" \n \nThis is a mild version of what I said. \u00a0My rant was laced with expletives and I didn't care. \u00a0Blue curses worse than I do, so he wasn't hearing anything he doesn't already know. \u00a0He was a little shocked to hear me using it. \u00a0I was between anger and tears ...completely falling apart.  \n \nWhen we got home I was ready to go upstairs and completely lay into Red. I was ready to tell him he has got to get the f*@# out of my house! Blue stopped me.  \n \n\"Mom. Please don't go up there and lose it with Red. Can you please just take a second take some deep breaths and listen to this song?\" \n\"A song! I don't want to listen to any song!\" \n\"Please mom! Please! I promise you. Just listen to this.\" \nI stopped. I listened. \n \n \n \n \n \nHis social skills teacher had showed him this video earlier in the day and now he was showing it to me. He made me stop before I acted. \u00a0Knowing that my actions would just lead to more explosion in the house. \u00a0It's like the saying, war begets war. \u00a0There was really no good to come of me exploding on Red who was already in an agitated state. \u00a0When he's like this, he's just looking for another fight and I was about to give it to him.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe good thing was that I was able to reach Blue and he was able to reach me. \u00a0He did not engage with Red for the rest of the night and neither did I. \u00a0In fact, the following day when Blue came home from school, instead of going straight for the jugular with his brother, he was more patient and understanding.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt will be interesting to see if he can stop and pull out the Mr. Rodgers song the next time he's ready to blow a gasket.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/09/one-good-thing-on-night-from-hell.html", "title": "\nOne Good Thing on a Night from Hell\n"},

He had sharp nails and he scratched me.\" \n Hmm...maybe I should get Harry's nails sharpened.\u00a0 \n\"You know, Harry only makes that sound when  you  pick him up. He is saying, leave me alone. He looks at me with those eyes saying, Mommy help me.

Most dogs make a yelping sound, they bark or they bite when they're unhappy. Unfortunately, Harry doesn't bite.\" \nI stop for a moment to think. \n\"I think I will start to bite you for him. Since he is too nice to do it. \u00a0I am not nice.\" \n \n \n My sweet Harry\u00a0 \n \n \nThis was a conversation I had with Red last week. \u00a0It's just full of all kinds of reality, symbolism, truth and more truth. \n \nRed can't seem to see himself as a part of the equation. Everything is someone else's fault. \u00a0He can't get along with us because  we make him mad.  \u00a0If I hold a mirror up to him so that he can see his own behavior, his own reflection, he deflects the view.  \n \nThe boy will blame the dog, a door, a piece of trash ...whatever. \u00a0It doesn't matter. \u00a0As long as he is not a part of the problem. \u00a0It's everyone,  anyone  or anything else in the world. \u00a0It's definitely NOT him! \n \n\"You people make me mad!  You  should change!\" \n \nI've been pushed beyond my limits and my limits are vast. I sat in my car on Friday night after a conversation over dinner with my husband. \u00a0Heaviness laying across my heart like a wet blanket. \u00a0I couldn't move. \u00a0I couldn't drive. I wanted to cry, but I just had nothing left. \n \nMy husband feels like the boy is pulling our family apart. \u00a0He is driving a wedge between us, because after dealing with him, \u00a0most days, \u00a0I simply have nothing left over for myself or our marriage. \u00a0I have nothing. \u00a0No patience, no loving heart. Nothing. I'm just existing. Living from day to day, getting the bare minimum details done, but not really living. \u00a0I'm not conscious daily of how small I've allowed my world to become. \u00a0I'm not as social as I used to be, because I'm empty. \u00a0I don't even want to hear myself complaining about my life anymore. \u00a0I know my friends are tired of hearing it, not that I see many of my local friends often. \n \nSo I mask the pain with jokes and hilarity. I smile because I am happy for the moment when and if I get away, but I dread going back home, wondering what kind of explosion I will face. Which fight will I have to referee? Who's need to I have to fill? \n \n Confession... \n \nMy only way of recharging, is sleeping, enjoying occasional silence when the boys are out of the house, \u00a0writing whenever I can focus long enough, engaging with my peeps on Facebook and drinking. \u00a0I don't even enjoy food or desserts as much as I used to. \u00a0Honestly, drinking is that one small thing that I look forward to at the end of the day. It's like the one thing that I can control.  \n \nI can't always go out with friends or even with my husband. I can't always disappear from the house to go out and do yoga or exercise. \u00a0I can't pull out my paint and canvas to just create in peace. \u00a0I can't always even focus on writing. \u00a0As a matter of fact, when Red is at home, I can hardly focus on anything. \u00a0I lose all train of thought. \u00a0Once he's home at 3 o'clock, I can only manage to do things like laundry, cooking or cleaning. \u00a0That I can do kind of on auto pilot. \u00a0Then shortly after that here comes Blue and then the fireworks. \n \nFortunately, or unfortunately I'm not sure which, God has created this small little bladder which doesn't hold much liquid. \u00a0Otherwise, I'd probably be a drunk. \u00a0I can only have 1 drink, 2 max or I'm up and down all night peeing. \u00a0I've even considered how cool it would be to smoke a joint and just be oblivious. Like ... hey cool man. Whatever. You 2 dudes want to fight? Go right ahead. I'll just be over hear chillin and then I'll get the munchies and just pass out.  \u00a0I've seen it in the movies. It looks really pretty cool. No of course, I've never experienced it in real life. Wink, wink. \n \nIn the real world, I am a responsible adult. \u00a0I don't drink myself to death, or smoke a doobie. I take care of the details every.single. freaking. day. And I'm seriously exhausted. \n \nMy support group moms got on my case the other night because I disclosed that I'm not in therapy. I'm too busy trying to make sure everyone else gets therapy, gets to their medical appointments, gets their hair done, their haircuts, manicures and pedicures. \u00a0Ensuring that everyone has their groceries and medication. I could go on all day with this list. \n \nAfter Friday night's feeling like I was ready to drive off a cliff, I decided that something has got to change for sure and with a swiftness. Number one, hubby and I spent the night away from home last night. We reconnected like we hadn't in a very long time. I felt like a grown up. \u00a0I sent Red to spend some time with his Pastor and friend and when he came home I told him not to call me. \u00a0I would not be answering my phone. \u00a0Blue went to spend the night with a friend. I told him not to call me unless he was dying. I left my mom at home with her wine and the dog. \n \nThis night away was just a bandaid on a gaping wound. The next step is finding myself a therapist ...stat! Beyond that it is inevitable that I have to find a place for Red to live. \u00a0I may not be able to focus on working on the book everyday. \u00a0I just don't have the capacity right now. \u00a0I've got to work on fixing my life. \u00a0It looks like Iyanla ain't gonna do it. \n \nIf I had just Blue, I could do this. \u00a0He has Aspergers. He has anxiety, but he would be more manageable without his brother in the mix every single day. \u00a0Red is just that ...Red. \u00a0He's like handling a piece of dynamite. \u00a0He is a spark that lights all of the fires. \u00a0I am the firewoman and my extinguisher is out of that white stuff ...you know that puts the fires out. \n \n Disclaimer... \nIf you come here to read my blogs in the near future, don't expect perfection, fluff or polished work (not that you ever got that). Just know that right now, I really don't care. I'm writing for my sanity, not for blog popularity. If you find something helpful along the way, that makes me happy beyond belief.You in my blog community have been my life line, my therapy, my reason for smiling many a day.  \n \nAt this point, I realize I need a little more. \u00a0I need some professional help. \u00a0As my friend Meredith said the other day, \"I'm only strong ...until I'm not anymore.\" \nI'm not anymore. So hold me up in prayer, positive energy and whatever else you got.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hew9oXWCvJw/VChy3Qo83mI/AAAAAAAABq0/4wiM4IsAz2M/s1600/1964916_701435009932742_2091957984236166137_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/09/dogs-dont-lie.html", "title": "\nDogs don't lie \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 17, 2014", "body": "\n \nDear Family, \n \nI think we need to try something new. I know that one of our family members seems to be the biggest agitator -the biggest annoyance and therefore, appears to be the source of a lot of disruptiveness. Well o.k. he  is  a big source of disruption. \u00a0He's 18 years old. \u00a0It would seem like there are certain things he should get by now. \u00a0Maybe he does get some of it, but old habits die hard, especially if you are still getting a payoff from all of your antics. \n \nHere's the thing, that person let's call him  the Disrupter,  has a brain that works differently than most of ours. \u00a0This doesn't make him dumb, stupid or even crazy. However, his thinking is definitely different.  \nFor example, he came out of his therapy appointment yesterday and said, \"I guess if I want my life easier and to keep living with you and the sergeant (dad), I'll have to learn how to tolerate you.\" \nNow I know damn well, that is not what his therapist said, but that's the way that he took it. Sounds like a little upside down thinking, right? \n \nLet's not forget his diagnosis... \n \n \n PDD/NOS (pervasive developmental disorder -not otherwise specified). In other words Autism which is a neurological difference. \u00a0His thinking is different! \n ODD \u00a0(oppositional defiant disorder) \u00a0He has been known as oppositional and defiant since he was a toddler! Since before he could talk! This is the one diagnosis they got right early on.\u00a0 \n ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). He is acts impulsively, without thinking of the consequences of his actions. He is constantly moving in some way. He is constantly singing! This was on his 3 year-old neurology evaluation.\u00a0 \n Mood Disorder or Bi-Polar/NOS (signs include -depression, OCD obsessive compulsive disorder, easily angered, etc.) \u00a0 \n \n \nSometimes, I think we forget all that HE is dealing with. \u00a0It's kind of amazing that he is doing as well as he is in all other areas of life, based on all of the things he has going on. \n \nYes. He drives us all crazy, especially me. \u00a0We are human. We can only be pushed so far before we are triggered into pushing back. \u00a0Fight or flight is a normal human response when we feel that we are being attacked. \u00a0It seems like in this house  we often choose fight , instead of flight. \u00a0Flight would mean walking, perhaps even running away from the attack. \u00a0Some of us even seem to take flight directly towards the flame, instead of away from it. We seem to take some pleasure in the fight. It's like ... \n Ooh! I got him! He's making me angry. He's interrupting me. \u00a0He's annoying me so ... Bam! Take that! \nEven though that fight is such a waste of energy. \u00a0It certainly doesn't change the behavior of the person with a different neurology.  \n \nSo what if we were to act like the Christians we profess to be and try to simply turn the other cheek? \u00a0What if we approach the person who seems to think differently than we do, with love and compassion instead of anger and further agitation. \u00a0Do you think that may reduce a small portion of his anger and disruptiveness? \u00a0I certainly don't think it will erase it. \u00a0It may mitigate it by a margin, therefore, making all of our lives just a little bit more peaceful. \n \n Mitigate  ...I love that word. \u00a0(Yes. I am in love with words.) \u00a0It means  to lessen, make less severe or painful . (Yes. He can be painful.) \n \nThere are certain words in my vocabulary that I remember the exact \u00a0first time that I heard them, or at least actually became aware of their definition. I remember the word mitigation distinctly. \n \nI used to work for a mortgage bank as a Loan Analyst. \u00a0( Yes. Once upon a time, I had a job that paid real money. We even got time off, and vacations. It was great! ) Our department was called Loss  Mitigation . \u00a0It was my job to look at loans that we were about to foreclose on to determine how we could  lessen  our loss. \u00a0When a bank takes a property back through foreclosure, there are a lot of expenses incurred. \u00a0If there was a way to lessen those expenses, then we may do something called a Short Sale, thereby taking a payoff for  less  than what the current owner of the property actually owed us. \u00a0This would have to be\u00a0 more  than we would get if we actually foreclosed. \n \nWhat if we could mitigate the amount of arguments, fights screaming and disruption in out house. Wouldn't that be helpful?  \nWhat if we could lessen our pain, and  my headaches ? \nWhat if we could mitigate the number of times that I (the mom) have to step in to referee between everyone in this house? \u00a0And I do mean everyone, including the adults who supposedly are not on the autism spectrum. \nWhy do we buy into the negative behavior and try to teach a lesson by displaying more negative behavior.  \nWhat are we teaching? \nWhat are we modeling? \n \nWe are modeling?  You act ugly. I can act uglier . \nIs that going to motivate him to change? \nIs that promoting an atmosphere of peace? \n \nOne of us or more of us may be more resistant to change than others of us. One of us may not have the ability to readily change his thinking, just because we want him to. We can't control that can we? \u00a0But what  can  we control? We can control our reaction to him.  \n \nIf one person is out of control for whatever reason, and you have the ability to remain in control, why not exercise that ability whenever possible? \u00a0I'm not saying it's always possible, but there are some places we just don't  have  to go. For instance ... \nDo we have to go into name calling or cursing, just so that we can make the person who is not in control, or does not have the correct thought process, even more angry? \nDo we meet irrational thought by adding insult to injury?  \nHow does that make things any better?  \n \nI know we're all tired and we're all frustrated. \u00a0But it seems to me, that the more we give in to being upset by his antics, the more he loves it. What if we all take our power back, especially the 3 adults in \u00a0our house. \u00a0Imagine the example we would be setting for the child in our house who still needs to learn how to do this. \n \nLet's give it a try and see how we all feel 2 weeks from now. \n \nLet's meet anger with love. It will take energy. \u00a0Trust me. I've been trying this for a few days. It won't be easy. We won't be perfect, but let's try. \u00a0Let's see if we can mitigate our pain. \n \nSincerely, \n \nYour Tired, \u00a0Loving, Wife, Daughter, Mother & Referee \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/09/loss-mitigation.html", "title": "\nLoss Mitigation  \n"},

Every person enters your life to teach you something. \n \nThis morning I had breakfast with the Transition Coordinator for special education in our school district. \u00a0She is also the Principal of the Adult Transition program that Red is in now. Feeling desperate for answers for moving into the next phase for Red, I messaged her last week and asked her if she could meet with me privately, before our next meeting with him. \n \nWe first met years ago when Blue did a presentation at our school district's teachers conference, on why students should participate in their I.E.P. \u00a0(individual education plan) meetings. You can read about that experience\u00a0 here on my blog. \u00a0 Yep. That was my kid! \u00a0 \n \nShe was the teary eyed administrator attending his presentation.

She genuinely wants to see them become successful and independent. \n \nSince then, this wonderful woman helped me put Red on the right path by mapping out his future through a process they call a V.I.S.I.T. meeting. Together, we got him out of the high school where he was not thriving at all. We placed him in another high school program, that although not perfect, worked much better for him. We got him through high school a semester early even, and into adult transition, because we could clearly see, that the high school environment was just not the place for him. \n \nShe runs his PCP (Person Centered Planning) meetings here at our home. Where a group of mentors, including teachers, job coaches, and his Pastor come together periodically to help him work on personal goals for his life. \n \n \nI took her to breakfast today, so that we could talk one on one, about the next steps with Red and the possibilities for him finding a supported living environment.  \n \nWhat an excellent resource, friend, and the example of an Administrator who truly wants to make the lives of those with disabilities better. \n \nThey are out there people! Get involved and get to know the powers that be in your area. We need all that the resources and help that we can get. I am a firm believer that it takes a village to raise a child. \u00a0Even more so, when they are children like mine. We are so blessed to have her as one of our village people. \u00a0\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-d1XS89feYcE/VDQIh2-vzTI/AAAAAAAABsM/0Q3B-8NB2GE/s1600/PCP.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/10/village-people.html", "title": "\nVillage People \n"},

I am really sick of driving Red's ungrateful ass everywhere. \u00a0We have some of the toughest moments in the car (especially on the way to therapy). \u00a0It can be pure torture. \u00a0I need a way to resolve some transportation issues for him. \n \nThen again, wouldn't it be a little ironic to hire some one to help me  watch  my newly adult son, who now works as a Child  Watch  Counselor? \u00a0Child Watch counselor or not, he still has a lot of growing and maturing to do. \u00a0Also, the sibling fighting issue seems to be getting worse by the day, if that is even possible. \n \nI may be good at a lot of things. \u00a0I think outside the box to solve problems. \u00a0I can be pushy as hell when it comes to getting the things that my children need, and lately what my mother needs as well. I'm the kind of person who doesn't accept no, and what you can not do. \u00a0Anything is possible, if you push the envelope. \u00a0I don't live by the rules. \u00a0Rules are made to be broken ...by me. \n \nFor example, in the hospital with my mom a week ago with the nurses. \u00a0 Please don't try to get away with sitting on your ass and not take care of my mother. \u00a0Just because I'm here doesn't mean I'm going to do the job you're getting paid for. \u00a0 \n And ...Mom, that's what the nurse is for. \u00a0I can help you with somethings, but you're not inconveniencing the nurse to have her do what she is paid for.\u00a0 \n Doctors? \u00a0Um ...what are you doing? I need details. \u00a0And I'm keeping track of these details and conferring with her private doctor, (who by the way, ended up giving me her personal cell number) to make sure you're not screwing us just trying to collect the money for this hospital stay. \u00a0 \n (By the way, they did totally screw us. \u00a0I'm trying to figure out how to get that resolved, but that's a whole other story.) \u00a0 \n \nWhen it comes to asking for help for myself ...it is definitely not a strength. \u00a0Part of it is relinquishing control. \u00a0The other part is, I don't like to feel like I'm infringing on people. \u00a0We have an awesome village that usually helps us, but friends are not always available and I really just hate asking. \u00a0Even though I am the kind of person that will help anyone and everyone in whatever way I can. \u00a0Sometimes, I don't even let them ask. \u00a0I see a need. \u00a0I fill it. \u00a0Everyone doesn't operate that way. \u00a0I guess other people are smart. They don't have time to be helping everybody and their mother. \n \nMy husband and I had a trip planned to New York for over a year for our 20th wedding anniversary. I knew I needed help in order to make it happen. \u00a0I waited until the last minute to ask my sister and my sister in-law, because honestly, I didn't want to. \u00a0I didn't want to be pissed if they couldn't do it. \u00a0My kids are such a handful. \u00a0Did I want to welcome them into my crazy world so they could see up close and personal what I deal with day to day? Or the other scenario, the boys would act like little angels, which brings about the question ... what the hell are you doing? They were fine with me! \n \nWhen I finally did ask, there were issues in their own lives that would not allow either of them to come and help. \u00a0Then my mom started to have issues with her health. That had me going back and forth to the doctor. \u00a0She ended up in the hospital as I mentioned above, which complicated matters even more. \u00a0How could I leave not knowing what her health status would be? \u00a0Life got crazier than usual with her hospitalization and me spending so much time at the hospital. \u00a0The boys were pissed because I was unavailable, so when I did come home, they were acting out. \u00a0I was exhausted! I could hardly think and problem solve how I would get the help that I needed.  \n \n How could I hire a total stranger to come into my crazy life and replace me for a few days?  \u00a0Again, there we go with the control issues.  \u00a0Can I trust hired help in my home? How do I vet someone, get references and all of that crap when I already have my hands full?\u00a0 \n \nWe ended up postponing our trip, because of my mom's health issues. \u00a0We didn't know when she would leave the hospital and what her condition would be. \u00a0However, we still wanted to salvage some way to spend some time alone together, away from these demanding children and my mother.  \n \nI sent out an e-mail to a group of teachers and administrators in the school district asking if anybody, knew anybody who could help. \u00a0I got a few replies, but the very best possible scenario just came together today! \n \nA special education teacher who has worked with both of the boys and is EXCELLENT with them, agreed to come in to help me out. \u00a0She could use a few extra dollars. \u00a0Summer is coming up so she won't be working at the school. \u00a0It is a bonus and a gift from God, that she is also an expert in my children. \u00a0How awesome is that!?  \n \nHoney and I will be able to salvage our anniversary after all. \u00a0And I conquered my fear of asking for help! \n \nThat my friends is how you purchase a little sanity. \u00a0Not everyone can afford to pay for help, but if you can get a friend or a family member to help you out on regular basis, even if you're trading favors do it! Don't wuss out like me until you end up been driven insane. \u00a0Of course, your local mental health agency often offers these services for free if you qualify. \u00a0However you can, try to find a way buy yourself a little sanity. \u00a0Because you're worth it!\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gQT3V4TzAAA/U4yaI-qjN3I/AAAAAAAABiU/vtQrs6erIWs/s1600/1926750_615329321876645_905430681472159266_n-1.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/06/purchasing-sanity.html", "title": "\nPurchasing Sanity \n"},

As of now, he will walk the stage with his peers in the graduation in June of 2014. \u00a0We will decide between now and then whether or not to give him his diploma at that time, and then transition him to the Department of Rehabilitative Services. \u00a0DARS will assist him and hopefully help pay for, career training/college or a certification program. \u00a0Otherwise, he can continue to receive adult transition services through the school district up until the age of 22. \n \nHe is extremely talented in video production, and editing. \u00a0He has in fact, developed his own business and has been hired to make videos and photo montages for friends, family, and even a few professional clients. \u00a0He earned a pretty penny just this last weekend, putting together a photo montage for a \"word-of-mouth\" client of an anniversary vacation, complete with appropriate music.  \n \nWe hope that he will pursue movie/video editing as a career. \u00a0However, he still has quite a bit of growing and maturing to do before we feel that he will be ready for college level classes, and fully developing his business.  \n \nThe two goals that we set last night were as follows... \n \n1) Red will pursue getting his drivers license. \n \n \n He will gather information (along with his vocational teacher) about a course that he can take over the Christmas Break \n He will complete the course over the break. \n He will work with Dad to obtain a driving permit in January\u00a0 \n He will work with Mom to get an evaluation by St. David's Driving program for special needs to determine any special needs or concerns to do with his disability and driving, i.e. reaction time, ability to focus, fear of being pulled over, etc.\u00a0 \n Depending on results ...move forward with obtaining license.\u00a0 \n \n \n2) Red will complete high school credits and prepare for transition into Self-20 Adult Transition program through the school district. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n Work with Vocational Coach to obtain either employment or an adult volunteer position in the first 2 weeks of January. \n Work with staff to figure out new schedule\u00a0 \n High school staff will work to complete a visual transition schedule for him to follow. \u00a0 \n \n \nThe Self-20 program is a transition to adulthood service that the school district offers to those with disabilities. \u00a0They meet on the local community college campus as well as a few other places in the community to work on independent living (transportation, cooking, budgeting, how to be a good roommate, etc. \u00a0They also work on vocation training, (job coaching, paid employment or adult volunteer) and social skills.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \nThe program is from 9 a.m. till 1 p.m. Monday-Friday. \u00a0After 1 p.m., they must work or volunteer. \u00a0He is hoping to be hired by the YMCA as an After School Counselor. \u00a0He interviewed with them and is supposed to hear back after Christmas. \u00a0As a back up plan, if he doesn't get hired, he will volunteer at a Senior Living facility, assisting the Activities Coordinator with games, crafts and parties.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy hope is that this program will give him some time to mature before beginning college classes. \u00a0He needs a little time and space between college and high school. \u00a0Especially, since he was not much of a self-starter in high school. \u00a0He has been great in self-starting his video knowledge and training, getting a mentor in the field and building a portfolio of work. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe are leaning towards him getting a certification in Video Technology through the Community College and if by chance he matures and is ready to get a degree in this field, we will support him in that. \u00a0Only time will tell...how far he will go. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI hope he will reach for the stars!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n*Please contact me via e-mail if you are interested in hiring Red to do video editing or photo montages for your family or business. \u00a0He does have a web-site with his portfolio. \u00a0Only serious inquires please. \n \nFor more information on\u00a0 Learning Disabilities and The Law: After High School \n \n Click here\u00a0 The Learning Disabilities Association of America.  \n \nOr you should contact Special Education Services in your local school district or your State Department of Education.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CpIB_IFqBm4/UrCACPqVjfI/AAAAAAAABYQ/Pj6AcQzW4lQ/s1600/adult_hood.jpg", "http://www.ldaamerica.org/aboutld/adults/civil_rights/law.asp"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/12/transition-to-adulthood.html", "title": "\nTransition to Adulthood\n"},

My purchases are mostly lined up on the conveyor belt --cereal, a few things for Blue's lunch and most importantly, my mom's 6 bottles of Chardonnay. My cell phone rings. It's not a familiar number but it's local so innately, I answer. \u00a0It's Red's voice that I hear.  Heart sinks! Shit! What is it now?\u00a0 \n \n \n \n\"Mom! Dad called the cops on me. They're probably on their way to get me right now! You have to do something!\"\u00a0 \n \n (He has been doing a lot of \u00a0turning our words around into something we've never said. What is that about?) \n \n \n \n \nHe said more than that. \u00a0There is a disgusting line from a Boondocks video that he likes to include whenever he talks about what happens when people go to jail. Because in his mind, the Boondocks is a documentary. \u00a0 Yep. Thanks, You-Tube. \u00a0Autism parents around the world thank you for our children's ability to find the most disgusting videos, play them over and over again, and then script the most inappropriate lines, at the most inopportune times.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n Wait a minute? Cops? Where is he?\u00a0 \n \nMy head starts swimming, spinning like I'm in a dream sequence in a movie.  What the hell did he just say? \u00a0 \n \n\"Where are you?\" I manage to get out of my mouth. \n \n \n \nIt turns out that he's calling from our neighbor's phone.  Just great! Wonderful! Neighbors if you weren't aware of autism ...this is it! We are the poster family for autism awareness! If you don't know...now you know!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI hang up with him and call the house to find out what happened. No one called the police. There is no imminent threat. Great. Again. I hang up. I can barely process what the hell is going on while trying to run two different debit cards through the thingy. Somehow, I manage to pay for my groceries. At least, I think I paid for them. \n \n \n \nBlue and I end up wandering around the parking lot for what seems like 30 minutes looking for my car. I have absolutely no recollection of how I arrived here. \u00a0 What does my car look like again? I think it's white. \u00a0Oh! There's a white car! Not mine. Damn!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI finally sit down in the middle of the lot on the curb. I park the basket and tell Blue to find our car. \u00a0He looks at me like ... really? Why are you sitting down in the parking lot?\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI somehow managed to make it home. \n \n \nThe conversation between Red and my neighbor goes like this... \n\"Why do you think your Dad called the police?\"\u00a0 \n \n\"Because I was yelling and screaming at my grandmother.\"\u00a0 \n \n\"Well, is that what you're supposed to be doing?\" \n \n\"Well...no.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen I arrive home, the 3 of them (Dad, Red, and Neighbor) are talking in the driveway. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAfter unloading the car, I'm searching for my earring that somehow fell out of my ear in the car. The neighbor comes over. \u00a0\"So ...the boys have Aspergers? How exactly does that affect him?\" \n \n \n \n\"Well, he has autism. \u00a0Maybe not specifically Aspergers. \u00a0Aspergers describes Blue more than Red. \u00a0But this isn't just autism; this is also ...\" I go on explaining all of his challenges as well as his strengths.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nIt turns out that our neighbor knows someone at work who has Aspergers. \u00a0He also knows someone at his church who own's a video business. \u00a0He's going to talk to him about Red. \u00a0He says, \"Maybe he can throw some work his way, they can collaborate, or he could mentor Red in someway.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWow!

{"date": "Monday, September 9, 2013", "body": "\n \n My son has marched to the beat of his own drum since birth!  There goes the immunization theory for Aspergers.\u00a0 He was treated for ADHD from 1st grade until 4th grade at which time I just didn't feel like Ritalin was answering any of our problems. He was diagnosed rather quickly with Aspergers at an appointment with child development specialists at age 9. He fits the mold of Apergers rather well, except for the fact that he has no problem making eye contact and loves to socialize. \u00a0He just doesn't do it appropriately at times!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe grew up with many of the issues that I read about you all having every day. I think that is why this page,\u00a0 fb/Confessions Of An Aspergers Mom \u00a0is so helpful. \u00a0It just confirms that we are not alone in what we are going through with our kids.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI don't mean to scare any of you with pubescent kids, but the teenage years were HELL! From 13 to about 15 years old I really would just like to rip from my memory! Rants and rages nightly for 1-2 hours, just like a colicky baby, only he was almost 6 foot tall and weighed 200 pounds. Luckily, it was only verbal rages and we never had to deal with him physically hurting anyone. I must admit there were a few nights during that time that I contemplated sleeping with my door locked, just because the situation was so volatile. We got through it with the help of an amazing psychologist. \u00a0We went through several before found one that actually had a clue! \n \n \n \n \n \nAbilify is our miracle pill. Though it did not completely stop all of the issues he did become much more bearable! My son is very intelligent - scored at college master's level on vocabulary, plays some instruments by ear, has a beautiful singing voice, a memory like an elephant.... but does math at about 1st grade level, writes like a 2nd grader, has the hygienic level of about a 12 year old boy, and has the judgment level of about an 8 year old. Sigh...\u00a0 \n \n \n \nHe graduated high school and went to a career training center about 2 hours from home for a year where he was supposed to learn a trade so that he could become employable instead he learned to smoke, curse, and sell his plasma! He did complete the program and I would be lying if I didn't tell you that it was during the first month he was out of the house that I realized how much stress he had me under! Many of you will go through the same thing! He moved back into our home and we figured out pretty quickly that he would not be able to get a job much less hold one down and he entered a sheltered workshop program.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWe finally got him approved for SSI which alleviated many concerns about affordable healthcare and medications (Abilify costs over $400 if not covered by insurance!). It also opened many doors for him such as group homes, etc. He has always wanted to live independently and we have encouraged that because we know that we won't live forever and he will need someone to help him the rest of his life (with money, meds, decisions).\u00a0 Though his younger brother has always said he will help him when we are gone it just wasn't enough security for me! So, group home lists are long and you can have to wait for years! We put him on all of them and even agreed as a family that if there was an opening within 2 hours of home it would be doable. Then I gave it go God to handle. \n \n \n \nAbout 18 months after going on the waiting list, we got a call out of the blue from a private home just 25 minutes from our home. They had an opening. We toured it. \u00a0He loved it! They have a day program that he works at and earns a paycheck! He moved there the next week. We pick him up to come home about every other weekend and visit him by phone daily. He could not be in a better place. These people just fabulous are are truly of a higher calling! He has supervision but yet has freedom. He has security and I have peace of mind that he is cared for and always will be.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nDon't get me wrong, we still have issues! Currently, we are working on the \"tales\" that he contrives. Such as, he has told everyone in the day program that I am opening an Italian restaurant, that his brother has a baby, etc!\u00a0 He can tell them with such detail that if you don't know us or haven't talked to us in a while,\u00a0 you will believe them! It is something we will work through. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nI am just so thankful for the text that I received from one of his caregivers that said that my son is so helpful around the group home and helps with other residents and that they love talking to him and that this story telling is just something they can work on as a goal! That did this Momma's heart good!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI hope our story will encourage some of you that may be having a bad day.\u00a0 Know that there sometimes is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow! \n \n \n \n Editorial Note:\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I met Sue online through her brother-in-law Dr. William Nash, who was our family doctor before he retired. \u00a0He now writes a blog,\u00a0 Organic Green Doctor.com . \u00a0I have come to love Dr. Nash, his wife Jo Ann, Sue and much of their family. \u00a0I love Sue as a resource because her son is just a little older than Red. \u00a0Their diagnoses stories are very similar. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Since our boys are older, we didn't have all of the benefit of some of early intervention, therapies that many of you may have. \u00a0My son was born in 1999 and 3 years later, when he saw his first neurologist, Aspergers wasn't even on the radar. \u00a0Even without some of those interventions, as you can see there is hope that our kids will live independently from us one day. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I just hope mine is sooner than later!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n ~Karen\u00a0 \n \n \n \n p.s.

He is spot on, honest, and dead serious. \u00a0He can not see why we all think he is being so hilarious, when all he is doing is telling the truth and the whole truth, so help me God.\u00a0 \n \n I am publishing it here because I believe this is the way many of our young men with Aspergers feel about physical education and exercise. \u00a0I have heard some of the same words from my son Blue. This young man does an excellent job of educating us all. \u00a0 \n \n Thank you Christopher for allowing me to share it!\u00a0 \n \n Christopher Owens Physical Education 9 September 2013 Weight Training Portfolio Essay This is my essay for the weight training portfolio assignment. In this essay I will discuss my physical condition, future fitness goals, and sports and exercises that I enjoy participating in. By the end of this essay, you should know all of the information regarding my physical condition and goals. First, my physical condition. As it stands, I cannot run half a mile without getting extremely fatigued. This tells you that my physical condition is poor, at best. At worst, you could say that I am so physically unfit, that a walrus would beat me in a race. In fact, the only location with any real muscle mass on me is my legs, as my arms have little to no muscle mass. I do however, manage to maintain a slim figure. This is surprising, considering that I do little to no physical activity, and have less than healthy eating habits. It is currently believed that my slim figure is due to an incredibly high metabolism. This metabolism also contributes to the fact that I am quite limber, and am capable of extraordinary feats of flexibility. So far my metabolism has shown no signs of slowing down, and I am particularly happy about this. Moving on, I will now discuss my fitness goals. Long story short, I have none. I don't plan on needing any muscles in my job in the future, and quite frankly, I like it that way. I personally don't really see the need for muscles and such, and can't think of a single instance in my adult life in which I will require them. This doesn't mean that there are no instances in which I will need them, simply that I can't think of one of such instances. Maybe if I have a really fat baby, and it's my turn to push the stroller, but somehow I don't think that will happen. If you think I need fitness goals, well that's your opinion. I however, see no need for them. Finally, we come to sports and exercises that I enjoy. Quite frankly, there aren't any intense exercises that I enjoy. We have an indoor trapeze at my house, which I enjoy. I also enjoy simply sitting and bouncing on an exercise ball. Swimming and the trampoline in my backyard are the last activities that I enjoy, but both are recreational only. When on the trampoline I take breaks quite often, and I don't swim laps or anything like that. Personally I find it quite pathetic that I can't swim in place for ten minutes without getting tired, but I suppose there's nothing to be done for it. I think that this is quite a solid lineup of activities that I enjoy to do, but I agree that it could be better. This concludes my essay, and I hope that you have learned about my health and exercise habits by now. To recap, we have learned that I am flexible, and enjoy a wonderful metabolism. We have learned that I have no fitness goals, and have no desire to create any. Finally, we have learned of the exercises and activities that I enjoy to do. If you have no idea what I am talking about, due to reading this backwards or Alzheimer, I suggest that you either read in the correct way, or seek medical attention, depending on which one it is. Now if you can excuse me, I have a calender of fake exercises to construct. \n \n \n \n If you know a Physical Education teacher or coach ...please share this with post with them!\u00a0 \n \n ~Karen\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/09/aspergers-physical-education-guest-post.html", "title": "\nAspergers & Physical Education -Guest Post by Christopher Owens\n"},
{"date": "Tuesday, July 10, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n Rolling down the street \n \n Chasing my son \n \n Wantin Some Gin and Juice \n \n Going Nuts \n \n With my mind on his future \n \n And his future on my mind \n \n And my name ain't Snoop D-O double G \n \n Editorial Note:\u00a0 \n For my friends who are parents of young Aspies, I don't mean to scare you. \u00a0I pray that this is not what is in your future. \u00a0Maybe you can learn something from whatever the hell it is that I'm doing wrong. \u00a0And maybe from somethings that I do right. \u00a0Remember...every child with Aspergers is different. \u00a0Let us pray that your child is different \u00a0from mine...\u00a0 \n p.s. The names have been changed to protect the innocent...and the guilty.\u00a0 \n \nThere is no laughter as I am driving down the street in full-chase of my 16 year-old, 200 something pound teenager, as he runs away riding on his little brother's bike. \u00a0It would be comical if it wasn't so tragic. \u00a0 I can say that about much of my life actually.  \u00a0Imagine, me, my mom and Blue riding down the street in my SUV chasing an angry, sweating, huge, teenage boy, almost 6 foot tall, on a motor-cross bike, in the 100 plus degree Texas summer heat. \n \nThe day started with my usual driving around the world and back, doing circles around the city, taking the boys here, there and everywhere. \u00a0Around 5:30 p.m., \u00a0I pull into the garage with Blue, so glad to cross the threshold into my air-conditioned house. \u00a0As soon as I turn the key I remember,  Damn! Mom has an appointment at 6:30. \u00a0 The last thing I feel like doing is getting back in that car for ANY reason. \u00a0However, I had scheduled this appointment for her over a month ago, with a masseuse who is not easy to get an appointment with. \u00a0She is also a friend of mine. I can't just blow it off at the last minute, when she could have booked someone else in that spot. \n \nAs I walk through the door I am immediately accosted by Red. \"Mom...I need you to take me to the church right now!\" \n\"Um...excuse me! I have an appointment to take Nana to right now. \u00a0I can't take you anywhere. \u00a0Your dad has been here all day. \u00a0Why didn't you ask him?\" \n\"He's asleep.\" \n\"Why aren't you riding with Luke?\" (The friend whose church he is going to).  \nMind you...I have already taken him and another friend to his OWN church activity earlier in the day. \n\"Um...Luke can't give me a ride cause he's taking two other friends and there's no room for me.\" \nSounds fishy. \u00a0As far as I'm concerned, if Luke isn't taking him...he doesn't need to go. \u00a0 This is not  his  church, it's Luke's church. \u00a0 He only goes there because of an invitation from Luke. Why would Luke invite him and then say he can't give him a ride? \u00a0Doesn't make sense to me. \n\"Sorry dude. \u00a0I have some place to be. \u00a0Nana can't be late.\" \n\"You don't understand mom. \u00a0YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME NOW!\" he screams.\u00a0 Oh Hell no! This is not working for me. \n \nHis cell phone rings. \u00a0I assess from one side of the conversation that something is up. \u00a0There is a REASON why he needs a ride because something is going on between him and Luke. \u00a0Whatever it is...is making him desperate to get to that church. \u00a0He's not very good at lying or hiding things, \u00a0so it doesn't take long to get  most  of the story.  \n \nLuke is an emerging friend who also has Aspergers. \u00a0However, he is extremely high-functioning. \u00a0He is very social, like Blue. \u00a0He is also very bright. \u00a0I swear if I didn't know he had a diagnosis...I would never guess it. \u00a0He comes off as cool...with it...popular even. \u00a0He is the most polite young man of all of Blue and Red's friends on the spectrum. \u00a0He never forgets to greet anyone or to say, please and thank you. \u00a0I so desperately want to meet his mother and ask her,  What is the deal with your kid? \u00a0He's awesome! \u00a0What did you do to make him this way?! \u00a0 His father is the Pastor at the church the boys have been going to together. \u00a0 Is it the extreme Christian upbringing or what?  \n \nIt turns out that the reason that Luke is not taking Red to church is because Red has insulted him. \u00a0After Luke agreed to take him to church, Red says, something like...\"Well are you sure you're going to come? Because you've played me off before. \u00a0You know you're not like my best friend Keith. \u00a0You always blow me off.\" \u00a0 Now why would you do this when he just told you he was taking you to church? \n \nWell, there has been several times when Luke has canceled on Red at the last minute. \u00a0Red got to talking about this with his best friend, who quickly told him, \"Dude Luke is\u00a0not really your friend. \u00a0That's why he's always blowing you off.\" \n \nRed being the literal guy that he is, took what his best friend said at face value, without questioning Keith's motives. \u00a0Red is Keith's  only  friend. \u00a0I'm sure, he would like it to remain that way. \n \nAfter Red opened his mouth and inserted his foot, he tried to apologize, but Luke needed some time to process it. \u00a0He didn't just say, \" Oh it's cool dude. \u00a0You just totally insulted me. \u00a0But that's o.k. \u00a0Sure I'll come right over and get you.\"  \u00a0No, he was hurt by Red's words and therefore, would not be taking Red with him to church that day. \n \nMy mom and I are getting into the car to head to her appointment. \u00a0Blue jumps in the car with us. \u00a0He doesn't want to be left at home with Red acting crazy and his father upstairs asleep. \u00a0Red follows us out the door yelling, \"You have to take me to his house now!\" \u00a0When I ignore him...he jumps on his brother's bike and takes off. \n \nRed is riding down the street...pumping and sweating on the little dirt bike. \u00a0He is angry...out of control and desperate. \u00a0He is going to go to this kid's house to demand that he forgive him and take him with him to church! \n \nHis adulthood is flashing through my mind. \u00a0 What if this were a girlfriend who dumped him? \u00a0He's going to show up at her house...uninvited...in a rage. \u00a0Can you say... arrested?  \u00a0 \n \nHe's going to make a complete fool of himself, scare the heck out of this kid and his family in his anger and rage. \u00a0Forget about him becoming his new best friend. \u00a0He's going to make him run screaming in the opposite direction.  \n \nAs I am hauling ass down the street, I have Blue look up the number and call the massage therapist on my cell phone. \u00a0I have to let her know I have an emergency and I'm not going to make it. \u00a0It is literally like 10 minutes before her appointment and I'm busy chasing Red down the street. \u00a0My mother insists that I stop him.  \n \nBlue locates the number and then asks, \"What do I say again?\" \u00a0I tell him to give me the phone.  \n\"I am driving down the street chasing my kid right now. I can't really explain, but we are not going to make it. \u00a0I am SO sorry!\" I say to her. \u00a0She also has a kid on the spectrum, luckily she is gracious. \n\"Don't worry about it. \u00a0She tells me. \u00a0I will be in touch to reschedule.\"  \n \nWe get ahead of Red. \u00a0I pull the car over in front of him, you know, like you see the cops do on t.v., cutting him off at the pass. \u00a0He rides around us. \u00a0Blue gets out of the car and starts chasing him on foot. \u00a0He is yelling, \"Stop! \u00a0You can't do this! Come back!\" \n \nI catch up to them, pull the car over again, \u00a0and try to get him to get into the car. \u00a0He is yelling and being irrational. \u00a0At this point we have made it to the corner of the kid's house. \u00a0While I am trying to talk some sense into to Red, Blue runs ahead to the kids house. \u00a0He is going to try to warn him.  \u00a0NOT HELPFUL!  Red sees him heading towards the house and follows suit. \u00a0I get back into the car with my mom, as she shakes her head in disbelief.  This is nuts!\u00a0 \n \nThankfully, Luke and his parents are not at home. \u00a0At least they didn't answer the door. \u00a0Thank God! \n \nI finally talk Red into getting into the car. \u00a0He is still belligerent, but he's hot and he's tired, so he \u00a0finally gets in. \n \nBlue tells me he will ride the bike home. \u00a0Red is still yelling, \"Don't take me home! \u00a0Take me to the church! \u00a0I need to talk to someone now! \u00a0Don't turn that way! Turn this way! DO NOT TAKE Me HOME! \u00a0If I go to the church someone can help us with this!\"  \n \nHe thinks I'm going to take him to the church so that he can make a huge scene, insisting that this kid be the kind of friend he wants him to be...NOW! \u00a0He thinks he is going to step into this church, embarrass the hell out of this kid, and this is going to what? \u00a0 Endear him to him?\u00a0 \n \nThe deal is that he wants Luke to be always available. \u00a0He wants to be included in every plan that he makes as if the boy never had any other friends before they met. \u00a0He wants to be his instantaneous new best friend. \u00a0He is not taking into consideration that this young man does not think exactly the way that he does. \u00a0That not only does he have MANY other friends...he also has Aspergers and it just may be that he doesn't ALWAYS want to be around anyone. \u00a0Perhaps it's overwhelming for him to be surrounded by people all of the time. \u00a0Whatever his feelings may be...they should be honored. \u00a0They don't have to be exactly like Red's feelings, wants and needs. \u00a0Luke nor anyone for that matter...is responsible for filling Red's empty well.  \n \nI would love it if he spent more time with Luke. \u00a0He is a positive role model. \u00a0He is mature, smart and insightful. \u00a0He doesn't fill Red's head with non-sense like some of his less mature friends do. \u00a0Luke has great Christian values. \u00a0He doesn't curse. \u00a0He likes girls but isn't talking about dying to have sex with them. \u00a0He works out and encourages Red to do the same. He is a good student, taking advanced classes and a heavy work load. \u00a0He is patient, kind, understanding and forgiving. \u00a0However, I can not make him Red's new best friend any more than Red can. \u00a0Friendships develop naturally and with time.\u00a0Teaching Red this is like talking to a brick wall. \u00a0I realize that this, along with many other lessons that come with peer relationships, will have to be learned the hard way. \n \nThe antics do not stop once I get him in the car and we pull into our driveway. \u00a0He continues screaming at me to take him to the church. \u00a0My mom gets out of the car to go get my husband, who is of course, still fast asleep in the house.  \n \nRed yells at me, \"Give me the keys! \u00a0I'm going to drive myself!\" Mind you ...he has no driver's license, and has never driven a car. \u00a0He has been trying to convince us lately that he is ready to drive. \u00a0 Yeah...sure! \u00a0We are ready to hand over the keys to a lethal weapon when you are volatile and impulsive.  \u00a0This is proof positive that he is so...not ready.  \n \nFlashing through my mind is the day that will come when we have no control over his impulsiveness. \u00a0When he will have to make sound decisions for himself. \u00a0He is just a few months away from 17, where in the state of Texas, you are treated as an adult in the legal world. \u00a0He is worlds away from being able to consistently make good decisions. \u00a0What 17 year-old is for that matter? \u00a0I can only hope that maturity will kick in at some point in the near future. \u00a0As his mother, naturally I want to have him walk around the landmines that I see in his path. \u00a0But, I can't do it for him. \u00a0I can not walk in his shoes. \u00a0I can not completely protect him. \u00a0I know this, and it scares the hell out of me. \n \nHubby comes down and eventually gets him inside the house. \u00a0He eventually calms down. \nMom has missed her appointment. \nI am mentally and physically drained. \nI wonder which neighbors saw what, but then again...who cares?  \nIt has been a long time since we've been through anything like this with Red. \nI pray that it will be a long time before we have to go through it again. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WKLg2BH7hHU/T_xikSlxPZI/AAAAAAAAAuw/XT6NeKcVnDc/s1600/114038086.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/07/rolling-down-street.html", "title": "\nRolling Down the Street\n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, September 18, 2013", "body": "\n \nToday my first born son \u00a0hit's adulthood! Today he is 18 years old and though he celebrates, he is also afraid of the phase of life he is entering into. \u00a0Most people who have Aspergers do not like change and the changes that he is facing are major! He's\u00a0afraid of all of the responsibility that comes along with adulthood. Everyday he frets over one thing or another. \u00a0Of course, he lovingly shares all of those fears and feelings with me -over and over and over again, every.single.day! \n \nOrdinary people celebrate 18 with much ado. \u00a0Finally, you reach the age where you don't absolutely have to listen to your parents anymore. \u00a0You can start making some decisions for yourself. \u00a0You can go away to college -move out, drive, vote, join the military! \u00a0In some parts of the world you can drink...legally. \u00a0In other parts of the world you can drink illegally. \n \nHe wants to develop his video business. \u00a0He wants to get a job. He wants to further is education. \u00a0He wants to drive. \u00a0He wants to get a car. \u00a0But dear sweet Jesus -that's a lot of work...a lot of crap to figure out. The one thing he absolutely does not want to do -is move out!  \n \nWell -why should he want to move out and lose all the comforts of someone else paying for everything? \u00a0Why not stay at home so that if and when, he makes money...he can keep it all and spend it only on the things that he wants? \u00a0Why not let childhood with the benefit of parents paying for your lifestyle, last a little longer? Who wants all of that responsibility? \u00a0Who wants all of that change? \u00a0 No thanks. \u00a0I appreciate the offer of freedom and all, but I'll take the cushy route. \u00a0Thank you very much! \n \nOnly, he doesn't really want to listen to his parents anymore. \u00a0He wants to make his own rules and he would like for  all of us to follow them . \u00a0Unfortunately -that's not how the world works. \u00a0Not my world anyway.  \n \nEven with all of his fears, \u00a0things that he still needs to learn, and maturing that he has yet to do, there is much to celebrate today. \u00a0The boy has come a long way. He still has much to conquer. \u00a0However, he has grown up and matured beyond the point of recognition in some aspects. \u00a0He is well on his way. \n \n18 Plus things to celebrate about Red today! \n \n He can articulate his feelings and process them extremely well -when he is lucid and not deep into perseveration on a negative topic. \u00a0 \n He plans his social and church activities without assistance and even arranges for transportation\u00a0*Unfortunately ...I am still one of his major transportation resources. \u00a0 \n He gets up for school and church on his own -the majority of the time. \n He takes his medication without reminder 70% of the time. \n He fills his medication into the weekly distribution boxes and has even called in refills.\u00a0 \n He takes care of his hygiene without reminders. \u00a0He has always been a snazzy, neat dresser. \u00a0 \n He does a number of household chores with great attention to detail. He can clean a bathroom better than any maid service!\u00a0 \n He does his own laundry in a timely fashion without reminder.\u00a0 \n He has no love for school, but he completes his work with some assistance, in a small special education setting.\u00a0 \n His school attendance is excellent. \n He helps other's with more severe disabilities in the school setting. \u00a0The kids love him! He makes wonderful connections with these students. \u00a0He is very compassionate with them. \u00a0This is probably the thing that makes me the most proud.\u00a0 \n He cooks basic meals for himself and does some grocery shopping.\u00a0 \n He has developed some lasting friendships with appropriate peers and gets together with them regularly.\u00a0 \n He sets his own calendar of appointments and meetings and sends out reminders to all parties involved. *Yeah -he even reminds me ...the forgetful one\u00a0 \n He seeks out available resources for help, such as his Pastor, his Video Tech mentor, extended family members and even a local policemen, who will actually come out to our house, just to chat with him.\u00a0 \n He is scheduled to complete all of his high-school credits by January, 2014. \u00a0He will continue in the 18 plus program through the school district at the very least, until the end of the school year when he will walk across the stage with his peers.\u00a0 \n He has developed his own web site for his video production business and made his own business cards.\u00a0 \n Up until recently, he has done productions for school, friends, family, churches and non-profit organizations, all with self-taught skills and no formal training.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n PLUS\u00a0+\u00a0 \n \nThis past weekend he booked his first official job as a Video Production contractor for a non-profit organization where he was paid professionally! \u00a0Filled out his first W-9 and all! This was a gala benefit where he made lots of connections and contacts for future business. \n \nAlthough he really does have a long way to go and all of the change and responsibility is a really scary thing. \u00a0I believe he will rise to the occasion. \u00a0He will slowly take on life and meet it's challenges. \n \nBest of all with hope and prayer...he will eventually  MOVE OUT OF MY HOUSE!\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vb_DVAtFLeI/UjmjhImkKLI/AAAAAAAABR4/LQUguuPMLm0/s1600/manatwork2.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/09/18-plus.html", "title": "\n18 plus\n"},

It wasn't my fault! \u00a0Well...I told you to give me $20.\" \nWhat have I done by exposing him to dining out so often? \u00a0Have I created an entitled little monster?! \u00a0One of the staff members told me he even talked about ordering appetizers! \u00a0She thought maybe he was showing off a bit for the girls. \u00a0He may have been, but actually this is pretty typical of his restaurant behavior.  \n \nI have to put this on my list of things he needs to learn before he goes off to college.  \u00a0 Dude ...you are not rich! You have to live within a budget. \n \nThe other fun thing I've been listening to this week from Red, who is nearly 17 years old (which scares the crap out of me) is... \n\"Why do you keep bugging me about going to work training? \u00a0I don't need this! \u00a0I don't need an IEP any more? \u00a0I don't need any help! It's my life!\" \nHe even said once, \"Why can't you just let me   RUIN   my life?\" \nThis is not a type o. \u00a0He said RUIN, not run...RUIN.  \n \nLater on when I repeat his statement to a friend of ours ...he denies ever saying it. \u00a0Who knows he may not even remember saying it? \u00a0When he goes on these rants, he often says the most ridiculous things that make NO SENSE whatsoever. \u00a0I think he does it \u00a0to push my buttons. \u00a0Afterwards, he will say something even more ludicrous like, \"You can't believe everything that I say Mom. \u00a0Sometimes I say things I don't mean.\" \u00a0 YA ThINK?\u00a0 \n \nI could go on all day with the lunacy that is my life. \u00a0Chances are, if you're an Aspergers parent, you already know what I'm talking about.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O0VpKQT-0YU/UAgvpDV2OpI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/JuB4Zp8Do2U/s1600/Unknown.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/07/simple-things.html", "title": "\nSimple Things...\n"},

Both boys want to tell me how to parent the other one. \u00a0No one wants to back.down.ever! This is our normal and honestly, it's kicking my ass.\u00a0 \n \n I was never all that \"together\" of a person in the first place. \u00a0I've always been a little ADD -unorganized, forgetful, scatterbrained ...whatever you want to call it. \u00a0Lately, that's been taken to a whole new level! \u00a0I'm not just my regular crazy. \u00a0I have crossed over in to pure, unadulterated,  cray cray!  Wearing clothes inside out -in public, forgetting or not wanting to eat, \u00a0which leads to headaches, difficulty making decisions. \u00a0Yep ...cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!\u00a0 \n \n I've been writing about horrible\u00a0 Morning Scenes \u00a0for years now. \u00a0In some ways they have gotten better. Red is 18 now, and does most things, as he should for himself. \u00a0He does make the bus when he's supposed to, even if he hasn't brushed his teeth. \u00a0(We keep a toothbrush and toothpaste in his backpack for these occasions.)\u00a0 \n \n It's still extremely difficult to get both of them out of bed most days. \u00a0Red can get up at the crack of dawn for church, but not for school. \u00a0 I  dread \u00a0getting them up every.single.day! \u00a0I've tried every strategy/bribe there is. \u00a0Nothing works for long. \u00a0 \n \n By 9:15 in the morning ...I literally feel like I've been beat up, like someone has just slapped the shit out of me. \u00a0Either that, or I feel like I've run a marathon. \u00a0I'm exhausted, physically and mentally. \u00a0 \n \n This morning ...Blue is yelling at Red first because he is actually using the bathroom, \"stinking it up!\" \u00a0Then he jumps down his throat to wash his hands  after  he uses the bathroom. \u00a0He goes on and on and on for a good 15 minutes. \u00a0 \n \n - That's disgusting! \u00a0 \n -What's wrong with you? \n -You should know this by now! Why do we have to keep reminding you?\u00a0 \n -And Mom -why haven't you taught your son to wash his hands after he uses the bathroom. \n -This should be a habit! It should be automatic!!!\u00a0 \n \n Then he starts in with calling his brother every name in the book, from idiot, to fat, to dumb and so on! When I give him a consequence for the name calling, he goes ballistic!\u00a0 \n \n -I can't help being angry!\u00a0 \n -Why are you getting angry because I'm angry?\u00a0 \n -I can't help screaming!\u00a0 \n -I can't help cursing!\u00a0 \n -I can't stop myself! \n -This is who I am!\u00a0 \n -Why are you punishing me for being angry?! \u00a0 \n -Why are you being on his side?! \n -Why are you letting him get away with everything!? \n \n It's all a vast right-wing conspiracy! I am the right-wing in this scenario. \u00a0In reality I am totally left! \n \n \n Last night's fight between these two gigantic boys was a doozy. \u00a0It left me shaking and exhausted. \u00a0I had no appetite when it was over. \u00a0 Except for an appetite for 3 glasses of wine.  \u00a0I must be a complete idiot for trying to come between them. \u00a0Part of me feels like letting them just clobber the shit out of each other. \u00a0The other part of me knows, that the more things escalate ...the more things escalate. \u00a0Rage and anger can turn into true violence if it's not squashed. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n This time, I threatened to call the police department. \u00a0This crap is getting out of hand. \u00a0I can't do it anymore. \u00a0Let an officer explain what happens when you handle anger in this manner. \u00a0They don't get a damn thing when it comes from me. \u00a0It's like my voice is on mute. \u00a0All they hear is like Charlie Brown ...\"Wah wah woh wah wah.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n When Hubby gets involved, it's just adding more testosterone to the mix, \u00a0like adding fuel to the fire.\u00a0 \n \n I've said it before, about Red, now it's Blue.\u00a0 \n I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship. \u00a0I am supposed to remain, cool, calm and collected while he rages. \u00a0It just ain't right! It goes against all human instinct. I try ...I really do. \u00a0I just can't do it.\u00a0 \n \n I really think I should just move out! Get my own apartment ...run away. \u00a0I think they would get along better without me. \n \n And yes ...I have told them this. \u00a0 \n \n photo credit: annotatedmst.com \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2EKjCf8ADtY/Up9df3X_ztI/AAAAAAAABWw/-bJJ5O2_XnM/s1600/Unknown.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/12/confessions-of-frustrated-mom.html", "title": "\nConfessions of a Frustrated Mom \n"},
{"date": "Sunday, July 15, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As I am meditating\u2026I keep feeling my mind doing the usual drifting.\u00a0 It drifts towards problems I need to solve in my life,\u00a0 unresolved issues with people that I love and worries in general.\u00a0 The whole thing with mediation is supposed to be \u00a0quieting your mind and body.\u00a0 Letting go of your thoughts to just --be. You are supposed to focus on just one thought, subject, mantra or prayer. You can just quiet your mind and focus on your breath. \u00a0This is not an easy task for me. It's probably not an easy task for most people, but I'm desperate for inner peace and deep rest so I figure --it's worth a shot.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \n A few weeks ago I downloaded a meditation relaxation MP3.\u00a0 I had been thinking about meditation after watching a show about it on Super Soul Sunday on Oprah's Network, OWN. \u00a0A few nights later, \u00a0one of the pages I like on facebook offered this free meditation music download.\u00a0 For the first 2 weeks of listening and meditating, it was like freakin' magic.\u00a0 I wondered if it had some kind of subliminal poppycock, witchcraft or something in it. I listened and relaxed, only drifting a little here a little there.\u00a0 I could easily bring myself by counting, breathing deeper, focusing on the breath.\u00a0 Remembering the soft voice of my friend and Yoga teacher, Laura telling me to relax every part of my body --to soften my jaw and relax my mouth. I would realize that although I'm supposed to be relaxing\u2026I'm actually clinching my teeth.\u00a0 I would remind myself, breathe Karen\u2026just breathe.\u00a0 \n \n It worked almost like a miracle.\u00a0\u00a0I slept like a baby for 2 weeks straight. \u00a0I awakened without a headache. \u00a0I had energy for the entire day. \u00a0It was great!\u00a0\u00a0 \n \n \n \n For the past few nights, it seems like it isn't working as well. \u00a0 However, I refuse to give up. \u00a0This time as I'm meditating, I come up with a mantra to repeat -to focus on instead of my worries.\u00a0 I'm sick of my worries.\u00a0 I don't want to think too hard or deep to come up with a prayer or mantra.\u00a0 My mind goes straight to... \n \n Love (in breath) Peace (out breath) Love (in breath) Peace (out breath) \n \n \n \n I begin to notice how much deeper I am able to breathe than I was just a few short weeks ago when I started this process.\u00a0 I am thankful for this. I keep breathing.\u00a0 \n \n Love (in-breath), Peace (out breath)  \u00a0 \n \n \n \n When all is said and done, and I'm finished meditating, I am a little perturbed that I am not sleepy.\u00a0 I start to think of my hunger. I don't want to eat this time of night.  Why am I not sleepy? I have to get up early tomorrow.\u00a0 I need to go to sleep now!\u00a0 I don't want to take any sleep aid.\u00a0 Then I'll be even more tired in the morning.\u00a0 This meditation crap isn't working anymore.\u00a0 The download music was all a fluke.\u00a0 It psyched myself out\u2026believing this meditation music was some miracle that had changed my life.\u00a0 Big Dummy! \n \n \n \n Finally, I give into the hunger.\u00a0 I get up\u2026go downstairs and get that week-old half a red-velvet cupcake from the refrigerator, heat it for 7 seconds, pour myself a half cup of milk and fill the empty spot. I get back in bed and watch some lame television until I get sleepy enough to turn it off.\u00a0 So much for meditation right? \n \n \n \n The following morning I have an epiphany.\u00a0 When I come down the stairs to clean Blue's t-shirt for camp, the sun is shining.\u00a0 It was cloudy and gray all day yesterday.\u00a0 I find myself in markedly, deep thanks that we had the rain that we needed and now the sun is shining.\u00a0 The pink roses I bought myself for $5.99 at the grocery store are all blooming and smiling at me. \u00a0 \n \n Love (in-breath), Peace (out-breath).  \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Blue is being a total morning grump.\u00a0 It is all my fault that his camp-shirt is dirty because HE wore it last week when there was no camp and then shoved it in the dirty clothes. I clean it for him with a smile and throw it in the dryer.\u00a0 I refuse to join him in his grumpiness.\u00a0When he looks at me all grumpy I smile back at him.\u00a0 \n \n Love (in breath) Peace (out breath) . \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I go upstairs and smile at my husband.\u00a0 \n \n He says, \"Are you smiling because you're grateful?\"\u00a0 \n \n \"Grateful for what?\" I ask. \n \n \"Because I'm taking Blue to camp this morning.\" \n \n \"I had no idea you were taking him to camp\u2026but thank you!\" \n \n I get to spend a quiet morning ALONE\u2026in my own house. \n \n Love (in breath) Peace (out breath) \n \n \n \n As I'm sipping my coffee, I get on my  \"Confessions\" facebook page \u00a0feeling guilty for whining to my community the night before about not reading the blog. \u00a0Instead, I open the page only to find all of these loving comments from my readers telling me how they love my writing, how it helps them feel less alone in their journey, how honest, real and brave it is. \u00a0 My heart smiles. \u00a0 \n \n Love (in breath) Peace (out Breath)\u00a0 \n \n \n \n I notice \u2026It is so quiet. I am alone -my favorite state of being these days. There is no television playing with my Mom's court shows.\u00a0 There are no children's foot-steps to listen for and dread when I feel them coming towards me. \u00a0There are no questions to answer, no fights to break-up, no conversations I don't feel like having.\u00a0 \n \n Love(in breath) Peace (out breath) \n \n \n \n There are a number of negative situations in my life right now.\u00a0 There are challenges that we all face every day.\u00a0 Today, I choose to meet those challenges and situations with love in order to create peace in my world. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n For the next 24-hours I challenge you \u00a0to do the same --to approach your life with...\u00a0 \n \n Love (in breath) and Peace (out breath). \u00a0 \n \n \n \n I want you to approach everything you do with  Love  in your heart and  Peace  in your \u00a0mind.

{"date": "Sunday, September 22, 2013", "body": "\n \nI am either completely nuts or oblivious to how much craziness would go into having a house full of teenage boys on the spectrum. \u00a0The answer must be I'm nutso because I had so much fun watching them have fun. \n \nI grew up with a bunch of teenagers in my house and I was friends with mostly boys and a few girls. \u00a0There were many occasions that there were at least 5 boys and 3 girls sitting around the living room in our small apartment. \u00a0My mom would casually come into the room to say something smart to one of the guys.. \n\"You have such a beautiful head of hair. \u00a0Too bad I can see it underneath that baseball cap that you're wearing at my kitchen table.\" \nOr when my friend Kevin would come by to pick me up for school every morning. \u00a0She would say... \n\"I don't know why you bother dealing with Karen. \u00a0She's always late!\" \n \nFor a good while there I wondered if I would ever have a house full of teenagers for Red. \u00a0There was a time when  My Prayer \u00a0for for him to have a least one friend, who would love and accept him for exactly who is is. \n \nBlue on the other hand, has always been extremely social. \u00a0He has never had trouble being friends with both kids on the spectrum, and NT's. \u00a0Most of his close pals these days are on the spectrum. \u00a0He met most of his friends through social skills groups at school, some in elementary, and a couple in middle school. \n \nRed, had a group of NT's that he was friends with all throughout elementary school, through about the 4th or 5th grade, when the differences between them started to become very apparent. \u00a0They all got the joke and he didn't. \u00a0He started to slowly feel left out. \u00a0He had to move schools a couple of times because of behaviors, and because our local school didn't have the appropriate supports for him. \u00a0As a result, \u00a0he had hit or miss connections with peers through most of middle school. \u00a0He didn't really want to become friends with kids on the spectrum. \u00a0He didn't want to be different. \u00a0For a long time, he longed to be a part of the in-crowd -the popular kids. \u00a0In fact, part of him still does. \u00a0He spent a lot of time working against himself. \u00a0The result being -very few friends. \n \nAt the age of 18, now a senior in high school, Red has a few really good friends. They get him, and he gets them. \u00a0They have things in common, such as their Christian faith, and their love of music, and they are all on the spectrum.  \nHe met, A -through a private Aspergers, social skills group. \u00a0He's 20 years old now. \nHe met N -in high school. \u00a0He is probably on the spectrum, but has a brain injury and some special quirks.  \nHe met another friend A2 -out at the airport when they were both spotting airplanes, during his airplane fixation phase. \u00a0A -is also a 17 year-old Aspie.  \n \nSo for Red's birthday, we took one of his friends to his favorite eatery, for lunch. \u00a0Blue attended as well. \u00a0School actually let out early, for some reason.\u00a0\u00a0*insert sarcasm here.\u00a0\u00a0I'll thank President Obama for making Red's birthday an early release day. \n \nThis weekend, Red decided to have a movie night, here at the house so that he could include all of his good friends. \u00a0Blue decided to tag-along on this party train and invited 3 of his good friends. Thank God ...only 5 boys showed up. \u00a0So yeah...fun for me! \n \nHubby totally bailed on me. \u00a0He can't stand a bunch of kids wandering around the house, making a bunch of noise. \u00a0The boys come in, they don't always remember to speak and be gracious. \u00a0Hello...they're on the spectrum. \u00a0One boy, goes straight into the refrigerator and looks around, on his own. \u00a0Another boy, goes in and out of the bathroom to check on the fans. \u00a0He's fixated on the decibel level of the fans. \u00a0One of the other boys, just likes to walk up and down the stairs, and kind of wander from room to room.  \n \nGuess what? \u00a0I don't really care. \u00a0They aren't hurting anything really. \u00a0One of the wonderful things about being an autism parent, at least for me -is embracing difference. \u00a0The more different my boys, friends are, the more I seem to love them all. \u00a0It's an honor really, to host them in my home and spend time with them.  \n \nI put my nosey mother upstairs in my bedroom with a bottle of wine and closed the door. \u00a0If she were within earshot of the activities, she would have had something to say about everything, and would be \u00a0involved in every conversation. \u00a0She did get the opportunity to tell N that it is inappropriate to go in our refrigerator looking around.  \u00a0Excuse me Mom. \u00a0I know you live here but, no thanks! \u00a0This is my house. They do have openings at the senior building down the street, if you want peace, quiet and sanity. We don't have any of that around here.\u00a0 \n \nAs the party begins, 3 of the boys are pacing up and down the street in front of the house. \u00a0They see a cat and decide to go across the street to pay him a visit. \u00a0They sit on the curb talking to each other and the cat for a while. \u00a0In the meantime, I know they're starving, but I need their input before I order pizza. \n \nNow deciding on pizza was really fun! \u00a0Imagine 7 guys on the spectrum, \u00a0trying to decide which place is o.k. to order pizza from. \u00a0This one hates Pizza Hut. \u00a0This one hates Papa Johns. \u00a0These two hate little Caesars.  \n\" The cheese from Dominoes is really gross!\"  says another one. \n \nThey finally decide on a local franchise called Marcos. \u00a0 Here in Texas a guy named Marco is probably Mexican. \u00a0But apparently, he decided to open and Italian pizza place. Does that sound appealing to me? No. \u00a0But it's not my party.\u00a0 \n \nThe next thing we have to do is decide all of the different  kinds  of pizza to order with all of our individual likes, and dislikes. Yeah...fun! That didn't take long at all. \n \nNext on tap is the movie vote, which Blue totally wants to dominate. \u00a0In fact, before the guests even arrive he has a meltdown because he doesn't want  Star Wars  in the list of choices. \u00a0He wants  Lord of the Rings,  a very long, 3 hour movie. \u00a0There is absolutely no way, all of these guys are going to stay seated all the way through a 3 hour movie in such close proximity to one another, with all of the talking through the movie, stemming, and outbursts. \n \nBy a democratic vote, they settle on  Captain America . \u00a0The vote is almost unanimous. \u00a0Blue.is.not.happy! \n\"There is no way I'm going to sit through this entire movie that I do not want to watch! It sucks. \u00a0No one ever wants to do what I want to do. \u00a0Everyone thinks whatever I like sucks! \u00a0I bet you no one except for me and J -even like the Beatles!\" \n \nJ says, \"Yeah. \u00a0I know what you mean. \u00a0Society sucks. They don't usually agree with me either, but we did vote and you invited me over here, so you just have to deal with it.\" \nI thought I was going-to-die. \n \nThey start playing the movie as we wait for the pizza to arrive. \u00a0Once it gets here, 20 minutes into the movie, they decide to pause the movie. \u00a0They totally gorge themselves in pizza, fruit punch and lemonade. \u00a0Best line during the meal... \n\"If I had known there wasn't going to be any soda. \u00a0I would have brought some.\" \u00a0 No pretense here!' \n \nAfter they eat, they attempt to settle back down and watch the movie. \u00a0It wasn't happening. \u00a0Everyone was loud, talking over one another. \u00a0It was like watching an episode of  The View , only with teenage boys on the spectrum.  \n \nRed turns the volume to the movie sky high so that everyone would shut up. \u00a0That sends a couple of them out of the room. \u00a0One specifically, comes upstairs and lays on the couch in our family room. \u00a0The next thing I know, they are all upstairs and the movie is turned off. \n \n \n \nWe have a group in one room playing video games and chatting. \u00a0Another group in another room with loud, heavy medal music, along with a live electric guitar and amplifier. \u00a0Periodically, a couple of boys would come out to the family room to start wrestling, \u00a0to pace the floor, to take silly pictures of themselves, or just have a quiet moment with their cell phones. \n \n \n \n \nOne of the boys, A -the 20 year-old, made his way from the couch in the family room, to the bed in Blue's room, to the bed in Red's room. \u00a0He is the oldest, a college student, who had been up early that morning studying and then drove himself to the party. \u00a0I was worried that he may not be able to wake himself up enough to drive home. \u00a0There was no alcohol involved, of course. \u00a0He did make it home safely. \n \n \n \nAspergers Dad finally showed up, just in time to take a couple of the boys home. \u00a0He had been out at a sports bar watching the game, in order to escape the festivities. He worked so hard driving them around the corner! \n \nSo Dad got away with murder. \u00a0At least I think so. \u00a0The boys all had a great time. \u00a0We even had one straggler who spent the night. \u00a0Lights were out by midnight, so that they could go to church this morning -on their own. \u00a0They made arrangements for Red's Pastor to pick them up. \n \nAspergers Mom? \u00a0Yes. \u00a0I had plenty of wine on tap to help keep my nerves under control. \u00a0The vote is still out as to weather or not I need psychiatric evaluation. \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-d-P2CSQ3CVQ/Uj84il6qvjI/AAAAAAAABSU/a-1Dy7dHbcs/s1600/party2.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x3DGNQxAntI/Uj84eHq3UtI/AAAAAAAABSM/k3vdsC8V4ws/s1600/party1.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/09/we-gon-party-like-its-yo-birthday.html", "title": "\n\"We gon Party Like It's Yo Birthday\"\n"},
{"date": "Sunday, December 8, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n Photo Credit: Snagglebox.com \n \nIt's Friday evening and Blue is edgy. \u00a0He is planning his evening. \u00a0He is attempting to plan MY entire weekend. \u00a0He is driving me batty.  \n \nI ask hubby to take him with him to Target, to get him away from Red for a while and out of my hair. \u00a0He isn't gone 10 minutes before he calls me. \u00a0His friend called and invited him to spend the night. \u00a0He wants to know if instead, his friend can spend the night with us, because Blue always spends the night with him and really he's more comfortable at home. \u00a0Except he's really not comfortable anywhere. \u00a0He likes to completely control any environment that he's in. \u00a0He can relax at Jay's house, but not always overnight.  \n \nSo he wants Jay to stay with us tonight. \u00a0Only he may have to stay 2 nights, because it's going to freeze on Saturday and his parents may not be able to pick him up until Sunday.  \n \nHe's talking really fast, not making a lot of sense.He sounds agitated, confused, focused, yet unfocused. \n \nI know damn well, I am not committing to anyone spending 2 nights with us. \u00a0I am frantic at the thought of my  own  children being stuck together in the house on the freezing, Saturday afternoon and evening. I'm dreading the thought of what  should  be a relaxing, cold, winter day at home. \u00a0Surely, it will turn into a day of cabin fever with the two of them fighting like mad lab rats. \n \nI don't like making any decisions haphazardly. \u00a0He's talking too fast, trying to convince me. \u00a0I know I will end up with regrets if I say a quick yes. \u00a0I can not ever allow these boys to rush me into a decision. \u00a0Once I say yes, I know I must stick with it, and once I say no...well...you get my drift. \u00a0So,\u00a0I tell him lets wait until he comes home to discuss it. \n \nWhen he gets home we start the discussion and decide that the friend can spend one night only. I want it to be Saturday night, but not knowing exactly what the weather will be, he wants it to be tonight.  \n \nIn the back of my mind, I feel this little itch -a voice inside my head that tells me, tonight is not the night for this. \u00a0He is too on edge. \u00a0At the same time, I rationalize, this friend can have a soothing effect over him. \u00a0Jay is such a funny, easy going kid. \u00a0We all enjoy is company. \u00a0Maybe they will watch a movie and just chill. \n \nThe next thing I know, Red and Blue are arguing loudly over the dinner table. \u00a0Blue wants me to make Red leave the kitchen NOW! \u00a0He storms upstairs and starts talking loudly about whatever happened between them. \u00a0 I ask him to reign it in or there is no way we can have Jay over. \n \nWhat did he hear when I said that? \u00a0Did he hear? \u00a0 Hmm...maybe I should pull it together and calm down!  \u00a0NO!!! \n \n The term calm down is really superfluous anyways ...isn't it? \n \nHe heard... \n \n WHAT?! Red ruined this for me!?? \u00a0 \n \nWhat started off sounding like a tantrum over controlling his brother went from zero to 100 in nothing flat. \u00a0Saying that he would lose a privilege if he couldn't get it together sent him reeling! It got real ugly real fast. \n \nThere wasn't even anytime to get on the phone with Jay and his Mom to cancel. \u00a0We were too busy avoiding any collateral damage during the meltdown. \n \nThe difference between a meltdown and a tantrum over control can be a very thin line. \u00a0A tantrum usually starts over something that they want. \u00a0In this case, he wanted control. He wanted ME to control Red. However, once the line has been crossed and the Aspergers child knows that they will not be getting exactly what they want ...all is lost. \u00a0Meltdown ensues. During a meltdown, there is no rational thought. \u00a0There is only very irrational anger and uncontrollable behavior. \n \nYour typical modes of discipline can not even be put on the table.  \u00a0If you don't stop this behavior ...you will lose this or that! Stop using that language or this will happen. HA!  Control has left the building at that point. It is no where to be found! \n \nNo matter how much Blue actually wanted his friend to spend the night, his anger, anxiety and need to control Red and me, was much stronger than the payoff of actually having the friend spend the night.  \n \nSometimes we think our kids are just being bratty. They are having a tantrum or an outburst, in order to manipulate us, in order to get what they want. \u00a0 They may start off trying to get what they want. \u00a0But at a certain point, they completely lose control. \u00a0When that happens, forget about discipline. \u00a0It's not going to happen. \u00a0Just be ready to ride out the storm and try your best not to  add to  the storm. \u00a0Try to minimize the damage by remaining calm, if at all possible. \u00a0 Believe me...it is not always possible! We are human. \u00a0 \n \nJay and his mom showed up at our house, just as we were getting the boiling pot back down to a simmer. \u00a0Unfortunately, we had reached a point of no return where Blue would not be able to pull it together in order to be good company for a sleep over. \u00a0I hated disappointing Jay, but I had to send him back home.  \n \nWas this meltdown avoidable? \u00a0Should I have just followed that little voice inside my head that said, this is not a good night for this? If I just said no...we will do this tomorrow, would he have  still  gone over the edge? \u00a0Probably. He was already edgy. Who knows?  \n \n \n \nThere are never any guarantees when it comes our kids. \u00a0Nothing is ever simple. \n \nIf things suddenly become simple we are left standing there like a deer in the headlights wondering when we're going to get hit. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bQvMP9f5dKI/UqUJEyqe7rI/AAAAAAAABXc/2DmujQ96pz8/s1600/images.jpeg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A2LS2Gx6VtY/UqUeZ7pwUnI/AAAAAAAABXw/Z_j2wONvgek/s1600/worry+meme.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/12/anatomy-of-meltdown.html", "title": "\nAnatomy of a Meltdown\n"},

We suffer from PTSD.\u00a0 \n \nFeel me? \u00a0 \n \nRed is so miserable, worrying about every detail of his transition into adulthood. Both boys generously spread around their every emotion for all of us to bathe in. They seem to have no interest in self-regulation, or using the coping skills that they\u2019ve been taught in therapy.\u00a0 They want \u00a0to express every emotion that they are going through, loudly, over and over again. Years of therapy, and social skills classes sometimes feel like a waste of time and money. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen Red is in a decent mood, he puts a lot of energy into annoying the hell out of all of us.\u00a0 Recently, he actually said, \u201cWhen I\u2019m being annoying that means I\u2019m happy.\u201d His repertoire of annoying behaviors includes singing, loud heavy metal music as soon as he wakes up in the morning.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t matter that the rest of us are sleeping or perhaps trying to watch the news or whatever. \n \n \n This makes me laugh! Reminds me of I Love Lucy \n \n \nHe has also been ranting and raging and perseverating on religion.\u00a0 Sometimes, following me around the house, refusing to leave me alone.\u00a0 He reminds me of those people you see out on street corners screaming, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t accepted Christ as your personal savior, you're going to hell! Get saved today!\u201d I\u2019ve even put on headphones to drown him out because he just won\u2019t stop talking! He seems to be in and out of mania.

And fast or somebody is going to end up getting hurt.

{"date": "Friday, July 27, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n Family-Of-The-Year \n \n \n \n \n \nThey give a cozy, quiet table in a corner of the busy restaurant. \u00a0On the way over Red started on a negative conversation and had an intense desire to carry it over through our dining experience. \u00a0I wasn't having it. \u00a0I wanted to enjoy our dinner sans the negative, looping conversation that never ends, but only seeps deeper in to negativity. \u00a0 \n \nHe starts out with his elbows on the table, to the point where he's nearly laying his entire upper half of his body on the table.  \n \n\"Please sit up,\" I ask. \n \n\"I'm so tired! \u00a0I want to lay down.\" \n \n\"If you want to lay down, you can go to the car or we can go back home. \u00a0This is not the place to be laying down. \n \nAfter telling him I would not be paying for him to go to Six Flags with the church next week, he finally sits up. \n \n \n \nThere are so many dishes on the menu...it's kind of overwhelming to decide. \u00a0It's hard for me to focus with the boys around. \u00a0I quickly choose Veal Parmesean. \u00a0We've had it before. \u00a0Everyone liked it. \u00a0I figure it's safe. \u00a0This is a \"family style\" restaurant, which means entrees are ordered in portions large enough for the entire family.\u00a0I tell hubby what I have chosen. \u00a0 \n \nBlue interjects, \"No I don't want that.\" \n \nIt would be too simple for him to just agree with anything I say. \u00a0Even though, we ordered this dish before and he LOVED IT! \u00a0First of all I did not ask his permission or opinion. \u00a0I was speaking to the DAD ...you know the one with the MONEY, who is paying for this dinner. \n \n\"What's the problem Blue?\" I ask calmly.\u00a0 \n \n\"We had that last time. \u00a0I just want something different.\" \n \nGritting my teeth and biting my tongue I ask, \"What is that you would like?\" \n \nHe has no idea what he wants. \u00a0He just knows he doesn't want what I want! \u00a0I give him a chance to peruse the menu.  \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, hubby says he wants to order this multiple pasta dish. \u00a0This is also something we've had before and truly enjoyed ...all of us! \n \n \n \nBlue starts going off the deep end.  \n \n\"That's not fair! \u00a0Why do you guys get to choose what we're having. \u00a0I feel like I'm in prison. \u00a0I feel like I should be able to decide!\"  What!!??? Seriously? \n \nHubby looks like he's ready to loose it! He is also holding back. \u00a0I'm sure he's having flashbacks from back in the day, when his mother would have back-slapped him silly for being so incredulous! \u00a0It really irks him when he is spending money and he is met with demands and ingratitude. \n \nI say softly, \"Well have you decided on anything?\" \n \n\"No, but...\" \n \nAnd the nasty attitude goes on until finally Hubby says, \"Let's go.\" And I'm with him. \u00a0I would rather not spend this money and sit through this dinner with this attitude. \u00a0The waiter comes, brings our wine and asks if we are ready to order. \n \n\"Actually, we may not be staying. \u00a0We are going to finish our wine, but we may have to leave,\" I say \n \n\"O.K. that's cool. \u00a0Just let me know...no rush,\" says the young, extremely tall waiter. \u00a0 At least someone is gracious! \n \n \n \n\"No! We don't want to leave! \u00a0It's just that you guys aren't being fare!\" Blue exclaims.\u00a0 \n \nAt which point, I go off the deep end in the most quiet tone of voice possible. \n \n\"Do you realize that we do not have to be here. \u00a0If it weren't for your father offering to bring us here, you would be at home eating fettuccine out of a box...frozen?! \u00a0And you have the audacity to sit here telling us how we are not treating you fairly!\" \n \n\"I'm not trying to be ungrateful! It's just...\" blah, blah, blah! He may as well be saying. \n \n \n \nWe keep drinking our wine. \u00a0Blue starts looking through the menu again. \u00a0He can't figure out anything different to order. \u00a0He finally says, \"Fine! Just order whatever you want!\" \n \nI swear I want to reach across the table at this point. \n \nHe keeps talking. \u00a0Then I start lecturing. \u00a0He knows I'm right, and he really doesn't want to hear it. \n \nWe go ahead and order.  \n \nThen he has the nerve to say, \"O.K. I just need everyone to stop talking for the next five-minutes. \u00a0I'm going to set the timer.\" \n \n Who in the hell does he think he's talking too? \n \nI want to body slam him! \u00a0Of course, I don't. \u00a0I just keep drinking my wine...t he largest glass they offer by the way! \n \nRed is eating the bread like he hasn't been fed in a week. \n \nThe food comes. \u00a0They all guzzle it down like there's no tomorrow.  \n \nWhy I wonder? \u00a0It couldn't possibly be good. \n \n \n \nWhat is this all about really?  \n \n \n \n Red is home from his trip to California. \u00a0Blue enjoyed the peace while he was gone and has to adjust to him being back home. They've been fighting more than usual...daily since he got back. \n Blue likes to go somewhere ...away from the house, and hopefully, away from us just about daily. Today that did not happen. \u00a0He was stuck with us at home all day. \n Blue likes to be in control. \u00a0He thinks he is the boss of the world --including his parents. \u00a0He is wrong.\u00a0 \n He hates to be wrong, told \"NO\"or be corrected about anything!\u00a0 \n \nThe following morning ...he gets up with an attitude, knowing he was wrong but not knowing exactly what to do about it. In the calmness of the morning, he apologizes and actually asks me what he could have done differently. \u00a0I tell him point blank, that he was rude, disrespectful and that I was ready to thrash him last night, but I held back. \u00a0I told him, if I had done the same to my mother, back in the day I would have been laid out! \n \n \n \nHe couldn't believe his sweet little mother wanted to throttle him! But in hindsight, he understood how he came off and said he would try to do better next time. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nAt this point, I don't know when there will be a next time. \u00a0I figured out the secret: \n \n \n We can get along fine as long as long as there are only 2 of us together. \u00a0 \n Preferably, I am the common denominator. \u00a0I should be 1 out of the 2. \u00a0\u00a0 \n If there are 3 or more of us together at one time, all hell has a tendency to break loose.\u00a0 \n The problem is ...there are 5 of us in this family.\u00a0 \n The solution is for us to avoid all being together at one time, especially in a public place, unless absolutely necessary. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nHow's that for dysfunction? \n \n Please let me know you stopped by....say hello, leave a comment or visit me on  My Facebook Page \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lssl6zGj8cU/UBLXYCMdCTI/AAAAAAAAAvo/mOOMjS9R25g/s1600/images-1.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/07/dysfunctional-foy.html", "title": "\nDysfunctional F.O.Y.\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, October 9, 2014", "body": "\n \nDear Liz, \n \n(Yes. I'll call you Liz if you don't mind. After all, you are one of my dear friends) \n \nOn Sunday morning, I woke up and grabbed my phone from my bedside table as I usually do. I checked the Facebook group that I run and then switched over to my personal page. I was pleasantly surprised to see a reply from you. \nI wrote this\u2026 \n \n \n \n Oprah Winfrey hired me to do \nP.R. for my dear friend \nElizabeth Gilbert. \nShe will be on \n\u00a0SuperSoulSunday \nTomorrow \nDon't miss it. \n \n \n \n \"This is so beautiful! Thank YOU! \n \nAnd you wrote back \u2026 \n \n \nI\u2019m sure you are busy in your life hanging out with Oprah and the gang. \u00a0Yet, of all the people who shared the post about you being on Super Soul Sunday, you took the time to reply to me! My heart smiled as I read your reply. \u00a0I did a happy dance. It felt as if you knew that my soul needed a gentle touch in that moment. \n \nMy heart has been heavy lately with a lot of tough decisions regarding my son. He is a young man with high functioning autism who is transitioning into adulthood and driving me completely bonkers in the process. I\u2019m hearing this good whisper saying, \u00a0 \"It\u2019s time for him to go.\" \n \nThe whisper has actually screaming at me lately. Oh wait a second \u2026that was him. But anyway, the whisper has been saying,  \u201cRelease him to the world so that he can grow into the man that he needs to be. He will not do that as long as he is with you.\u201d \n \nHe shows the promise of being a wonderful citizen of the world. He will be a man with challenges and he will conquer them. \u00a0He will need support to make this happen, but what he doesn\u2019t need, is to be coddled and protected by his mother. I just don\u2019t think he will grow into a man until he takes some steps away from me. \n \nThe whispers have also been saying,  \u201cYou can\u2019t keep living this way Karen. You are giving way too much of yourself.\u201d  I can hardly make myself out in a mirror. My inner light is fading. The walls are closing in on me. This world that I have created is now suffocating me. I have spoiled them all, including my husband and my mother. \n \nI too have been spoiled. \u00a0I have been given the gift of being a mother full-time for my boys. However, \u00a0in giving everyone so much of my focus, I have almost been erased. I think of them before I feed myself. \u00a0I think of them before I pee! I think of them before I exercise and subsequently, I usually put it off. \u00a0It\u2019s become a bad habit. \n \n What does this person need from me now? Here you go. \u00a0 Slowly, I am giving away a small piece of my soul. \n \nThe whispers are saying,  \u201cYou have given to them out of love and protection, but it\u2019s time to let them fly. It\u2019s time for you to start flapping your own wings and start living instead of just existing.\u201d\u00a0 \n \nAfter I saw your message on Facebook, I flipped on the t.v. \u00a0and watched you on Super Soul Sunday on OWN. \u00a0You sat there chatting with my girlfriend Oprah, but you spoke directly to me. \u00a0It was like you were sitting there having the chat that I, specifically needed to hear. \n \n \u201cIf you stay on this path you may literally die or die in pieces.\u201d Liz Gilbert\u00a0 \n \nI\u2019ve been feeling like I am dying a slow death. This life that I\u2019m living is a part of my path, but it is NOT my path in total. I am called to do more. \n \n \u201cGood whispers scare you. They open you up.\u201d Liz Gilbert \n \nYou\u2019re a writer Karen. You have a gift to give to the world. Your family is a part of your world. They are not your ENTIRE world. \nYou don\u2019t like Texas. This is not where you are meant to spend the rest of your life. Stop doing what everyone else wants you to do. Empower them to do for themselves. Get yourself in a position to pay someone to do the things you no longer want to do. They will probably do a better job anyway. You are meant to travel the world. You are meant to be in the places where you are loved simply for being who you are. You are meant to have a relationship with your husband. He\u2019s supposed to be your lover and your partner, not just the dad, the breadwinner and the guy you share a room with.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe good whispers scare you. They open you up. Bad whispers shut you down. You can\u2019t listen to them.\" Liz Gilbert \n \nMy good whispers say, \u201cIt\u2019s time for him to move to the next step of his life.\u201d The unknown variables of that scare the shit out of me. The good whispers say, \u201cYou are supposed to write a larger piece of work, that will reach farther and help more people.\u201d \nMy bad whispers say, \u201cYou do not have time to write today. You don\u2019t have time to exercise. You can never finish a long term project. You have too much on your plate.\u201d \n \n \u201cObstacles help you gain what you need for the battle.\u201d Liz Gilbert\u00a0 \n \nThe difficulties that I face right now are what\u2019s making me stronger. \u00a0My destiny is to encourage others through my writing. \u00a0To tell them that they can get through these obstacles and and make it to the other side. \u00a0It doesn't really matter what channel that writing comes in on write now. The point is that it touches someone. \n \n \n \n I made this and shared it on FB and Instagram \n \n \nThis was one of my favorite quotes. \nThe voice in my head says to me,  \"You\u2019re not smart enough. Your grammar is horrible. You can\u2019t focus. No one you know has ever done this. What makes you think you can?\" \n Who is that shit talker? She really needs to shut up!\u00a0 \n \n \u201cSometimes you have to shape the quest to the reality of your life.\u201d Liz Gilbert \u00a0 \n \nAs much as I'd love to run off to Italy, France, Bali, anywhere but here ...my reality is that right now, I am a mother, a wife, a caregiver. \u00a0I write a blog that touches many all over the world. \u00a0My writing helps them and let\u2019s them know that they are not alone in this difficult journey raising children with autism. What I\u2019m going through each and every day with my boys, the good and the bad and sometimes hilarious, I share and someone\u2019s life is touched. I make someone laugh. I help them realize they they are not crying alone. \n \nI am also called to write a larger piece of work. Perhaps that hasn\u2019t happened yet, because I\u2019m still walking the path of raising these boys. My journey with them is not complete and it does require a lot of focus.  And remember Karen, you don't focus all that well.\u00a0 \n \nYou reminded me however, that even if I can\u2019t do things exactly the way I want to do them today, I need a plan. I need to set up my \"coffee can plan\" and put something away in it every day toward my goals. I will write something every day. What I\u2019m living and what I\u2019m doing right now, is a part of my spiritual journey. \n \n \u201cGrace says I don't care what you do, you're splendid, magnificent and I'm here. I'm right beside you and we're gonna get through this.\u201d\u00a0 \n \nThank you Liz, for helping me to give myself a little grace. \n \nAnd guess what? \n \nI will see you and my girlfriend Oprah next weekend in Houston at  Oprah's The Life you Want\u00a0 Weekend.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hWTnyveHNSs/VDbVtfrBaOI/AAAAAAAABsg/VdHBFdCeNkU/s1600/1800417_10202678870002695_4637438882918557802_n.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rYebLHhT5Xw/VDbWC0_qGII/AAAAAAAABso/ULwHwJRp4Hk/s1600/10689880_10202678870282702_10135975347406080_n.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cwJbqciOq_o/VDbbBOetd7I/AAAAAAAABs0/saWQq5EZXOw/s1600/1947926_10202689084898061_253674898581109901_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/10/dear-elizabeth-gilbert.html", "title": "\nDear Elizabeth Gilbert \n"},
{"date": "Wednesday, July 25, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \n Editorial Note:  This post is originally from June of 2011. \u00a0It goes to show me how although some things change...others remain the same. \u00a0Summers are still hard. \u00a0It's when my job seriously kicks in to 24/7 Mommy Duty. \u00a0Every year I swear, next summer I'm going to pay someone else to do this. \u00a0This job sucks! \u00a0Yet, here I am again, driving around the world and back again for unappreciative teenagers. Only now, they have more friends than ever ...and thankfully, or not...they are moving closely towards adulthood and I know how important the time is that I spend with them. \u00a0Even though it's exasperating, and exhausting, they are making great progress. \u00a0I am blessed to be able to be present for every inch of it. \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n \nThere are so many blessings to count...but for some reason my mind keeps gravitating towards the negative these days. \u00a0It's kind of like constantly feeling I have PMS ...only I don't. \u00a0So what is it? Depression ...longing for something more -an itch I can't seem to scratch. \n \nI teach my children to be grateful. \u00a0One of them actually listens. \u00a0In fact, Blue regularly joins me in trying to teach his older brother to count his blessings and stop whining about everything. \u00a0Blue actually thanks God --says his prayers, \u00a0even if it's just before he eats a donut in the car on the way to camp.  \n \nI consider myself to be spiritual, a follower of Christ. \u00a0I definitely do for others. \u00a0I love my fellow man. \u00a0I pray and give thanks daily. \u00a0At the same time I constantly find myself thinking about the things I  wish  I could do. \n \nI  wish  I could buy new chairs for my living room. \u00a0I bought chairs 3 years ago that were an awful grade of leather. \u00a0They are already falling apart. \u00a0I have a leather couch that I've had for 12 years and there isn't a flaw in it. \u00a0These chairs were simply poorly made. \u00a0Don't ever buy chairs from Rooms To Go...they screwed us -royally! As soon as the 1 year warrantee was over...they started tearing apart.  \n \nI  wish  I could have new counter-tops and cabinets in my kitchen; repair all the damaged walls and doors in my house; paint my bathroom. \u00a0I could paint my bathroom. \u00a0That's easy enough. \u00a0Paint isn't expensive. \u00a0The problem there, is finding the uninterrupted, unscheduled time to do it. \n \nI am so sick of my car! I  wish  I could get another one, nothing new just different than what I've got. \u00a0Every time I see another one like mine driving down the street I cringe. \u00a0It makes me feel so cookie cutter. \u00a0It's the first car in a long time that I've driven this long. \u00a0It's a Honda Pilot, 2004. \u00a0Apparently, Hondas are very good cars. \u00a0There isn't a thing wrong with it -except for the fact that I'm sick of looking at it. \u00a0It's paid for...it runs. \u00a0So what's to complain about really. Wah...wah! \n \nHere I am complaining. \u00a0Sorry...God I am really grateful that it runs and that we aren't in debt up to our ears paying for a brand new one. \u00a0Really... \n \nI  wish  I could go on vacation to somewhere cool and tranquil --where I could just read, relax and listen to the sound of the ocean or see something completely different --another culture another world away from mine.  \n \nI am longing for something more --more than the everyday details of raising two children, especially two high maintenance, special needs children. \u00a0Feelings like this are what can get people into trouble. \u00a0Some women find escape from the details of their lives by actually taking off...leaving their worries behind for another life. \u00a0Some escape by drowning their sorrows in alcohol or drugs. \u00a0Some have affairs with other men. Some just go completely nuts and end up in a sanitarium or rehab.  \n \nI read somewhere where a mother went into rehab for 30 days. She blogged about it. \u00a0All the moms who commented asked, \"What do I have to do to get in?\" \u00a0 30 days off \u00a0from my motherly duties? \u00a0Are you kidding me? \u00a0Sign me up! \n \nI don't have the balls for any of that. \u00a0I love my children far too much to leave them...at least not for long. \u00a0I have a wonderful husband who is so good to me ...so that would be a no on the affair. \u00a0I'm too much of a wuss to do drugs or any serious alcohol. \u00a0 You all know by now, I will have the occasional ... as in every day, margarita or glass of wine to take the edge off. \n \nInstead of going to any extremes \u00a0--I will have to find simple pleasures to indulge in whenever possible and count my blessings so that God will continue to give them to me. \n \nToday I am grateful for: \n \n \n Blue eating his pizza Jersey Style!\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n-this moment in time where I sit in this coffee house to write. \n-that Blue sits quietly across from me on his lap top...well pretty quietly. \n-Corrine Bailey Rae is singing in the background soothing my weary soul. \n-for the slice of pizza and ice-cold Coke Blue and I had together for lunch. \n-for air conditioning in my house with the worn furniture and in my old, boring, paid for, 7 year-old car. \n \n \n \n \nPlease feel free to whine along with me by commenting here or visit my\u00a0 Facebook Community Page . \n \n \n \n \n Help a sistah out! \u00a0Please click below on your way out.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uzNpSgf2_jc/TgEHUlwJX0I/AAAAAAAAAPY/8mGG-aQQ6IE/s1600/IMAG0394.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W4YExsYV4A4/TgEEb0t1uvI/AAAAAAAAAPU/mvlRzkjZ-PE/s1600/images-1.jpeg", "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Confessions-Of-An-Aspergers-Mom/113171498759099"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/06/whining-and-counting.html", "title": "\nWhining and Counting\n"},
{"date": "Friday, July 20, 2012", "body": "\n \n \n \nRed often goes off on these mini-rants about how much his life sucks. \u00a0I wrote about that a bit in this post  \"Simple Things\" \u00a0yesterday. \u00a0During such rants, he says a lot of things that don't make sense. \u00a0He just spouts off, without any justification or rationalization to his argument. \n \nThe latest rant is about how he wants to drive and it's not fair that all of his friends drive. \u00a0He blames it on us because we won't teach him. \u00a0He blames it on his Aspergers. \u00a0Most things that are wrong in his life in his opinion, are completely the fault of other people, his disability ... anything or anyone, other than himself. \u00a0He couldn't possibly be the problem --the elusive piece of the puzzle that keeps him from putting his life together in to the perfect picture.  \n \n\"Because of my Aspergers ...I am so behind!\" \n Scratch the record dude! \u00a0Uh uh. \u00a0Aspergers does not stop you from doing anything that you really want to to. \u00a0It does not incapacitate you. \u00a0There are many people with Aspergers who live very full lives. \n \u00a0\u00a0 \n \"There are Aspergers teens who drive, but no one is going to hand over the keys to a vehicle that you can actually kill yourself or someone else with. \u00a0\u00a0 The issue here is that you only want to do what YOU want to do. \u00a0If it's hard and requires a lot of work ...you are not willing to do it. \u00a0For example, your friend with Aspergers who drives --also takes advanced classes and is willing to do homework. You don't want to do homework because it interferes with your time to sit around on your computer doing... whatever. \u00a0You don't willingly read like you're \u00a0supposed to over the summer. \u00a0You won't consistently get up on time for work training on your own. \u00a0You are not showing us responsibility. \u00a0Why should we help you learn how to drive when you don't show responsibility?\" \n \nHis response? \"What does responsibility have to do with it?\" \n Wow! Just ...Wow! \n \nThe friend that he is referring to has Aspergers. \u00a0He is 16 and also already has a job. \u00a0He had the initiative to go out and fill out applications and apply for work. \u00a0Red complains about having to be in vocational training, yet he has not been willing to go out to get work applications and fill them out. \u00a0I will help him if he initiates the task. \u00a0We actually set this as a goal in his last Person Centered Planning meeting, and he has yet to move forward with it. \u00a0Yet, it's all our fault that he doesn't have a job or is able to drive. \n \nFurthermore, I ask him does he even know what it takes to get a drivers license? \n \n\"You guys just teach me. \u00a0Or get me a drivers training teacher.\" \n\"Do you know the steps towards getting a license?\" \n\"Who do you get a license from?\" \nAfter a few wrong answers he comes up with, \"Um...the government.\" \n\"What government agency?\" \n\"Um...the FBI?\" \n Oh sure! \u00a0You're ready to drive.\u00a0 \n \nI go on to tell him exactly what agency it is, and that he needs to do the research on what it takes to get a license in the state of Texas.  \nI ask him, \"Have you asked any of your friends who drive what the steps are? What did they do to get their permit or license?\" \n\"No.\" \n Ah hah ...but it's all our fault that he doesn't drive yet. \n \nI go on to talk about responsibility. \u00a0Driving takes gas and insurance, even if we were to allow him to drive one of our cars. \u00a0\"You have to have some kind of job to help pay for that. \u00a0You have yet to go and pick up a job application. \u00a0Get a job. \u00a0How are you going to drive if you have no money to pay for gas or any of the expenses that come along with driving?\" \n \nOur now 24 year-old son had to have a job and save money towards the purchase of a car before we helped him buy one. \u00a0We may be a little more lenient with Red, but he will have to show a hell of a lot more responsibility and initiative than he does now. \u00a0It was a just a few weeks ago when he was having a semi-meltdown and tried to take my keys so he could go \"handle a situation\" with a friend, \u00a0I wrote about that here,\u00a0 \"Rolling Down The Street\" . \u00a0Yeah that was a real doozy! \n \nTo bring finality to this rant about how he is so far behind because of his Aspergers, I say the following: \n \n\"You shouldn't look at your Aspergers as a disability. \u00a0It is just a DIFFERENT ABILITY. \u00a0It doesn't stop you from doing anything! \u00a0You just have to be willing to do the work. \u00a0You may need a little extra time for processing. \u00a0You may need a little help here or there, but if you develop a road map, set goals and follow the map --you can do anything you really want to do! \u00a0I am willing to help you. \u00a0I am not willing to do things  for  you. \u00a0And I will not except the blame, for not getting things done. \u00a0This is your life!\"  \n \nFurthermore, \u00a0I tell him to go to the internet to the Department of Public Safety and look up what it takes to get a drivers license in the State of Texas. \u00a0As soon as he's ready to pick up that first job application, \"because he doesn't need any stinkin' vocational training,\" just let me know. \u00a0I will not initiate it. \u00a0I will not do it for him.  \n \n\"I will help you design your road map, but you are the one who has to follow it.\" \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YsPL0Yoy__Q/UAmPGZf9x9I/AAAAAAAAAvc/QJ0pIevFzCc/s1600/Unknown-1.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2012/07/different-ability.html", "title": "\nDifferent Ability\n"},
{"date": "Monday, December 2, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n photo credit: livebyquotes.com \n \nMy lovely, lovely blog. \u00a0I've missed you so very much. \u00a0I keep waiting for this big block of time, where I can write this fabulous, monumental post about all of the crap that I've been dealing with in the past couple of months. \u00a0That hasn't happened. \u00a0I have no idea when it will.  \n \nSo, instead of waiting and wanting to put together a big post on the big fail of an experiment of having Blue off of meds for two months. \u00a0How it seemed to be going well, until it wasn't. \u00a0It really, really wasn't. \u00a0It became a complete and utter mess, where I was walking on eggshells and breaking up fights and enduring explosions on a daily bases. Yes, there were some good points, his personality seemed to evolve. \u00a0He became more articulate about things he had been feeling for such a long time. \u00a0He even found his sense of humor again. \u00a0That part was great! The other parts -not so much. \u00a0In fact, it has royally sucked around here. \n \nThe fact of the matter is, we are still only inching our way back through the muck of finding a new med combination, and hormones, and zero to 100 in nothing flat, anger, and anxiety and the first year of high school, \u00a0for Blue and AP classes, and R.O.T.C. and stress and rage, and violent meltdowns. \n \nLet's not forget, this is Red's last year in high-school, his last semester, as a matter of fact. \u00a0Yeah, that change is going to be so easy. \u00a0Oh yeah, it's just been a barrel of fucking laughs around here.  \n \nI've decided that I will have to try something a little different.\u00a0Instead of not writing at all, which may or may not have a little something to do with my lack of sanity over the past couple of months. \u00a0I will write in snippets. \u00a0I will just spill my guts in the format of a diary ...right here in public, for the entire world to read.  \n \nWhy? Because writing is cathartic for me. \u00a0It is my therapy. \u00a0As I've said so many times before. \u00a0I have no therapist to talk to. \u00a0Who has time for that shit? \u00a0First you have to find someone that you trust and feel comfortable with, then you have to make a standing appointment. \u00a0My life is already chuck full of standing appointments for everyone in this entire family! \u00a0Yes ...that includes the dog, who gets his hair done, more often than me! \n \nSo, I will \u00a0come here. \u00a0I will write. \u00a0I may not make any sense. \u00a0I may not always be grammatically correct. (As much as I loathe bad English and bad grammar.) I need to just write. \u00a0I need to be free. \u00a0I need to let this shit out! And if it's not perfect, well shit, neither am I.  \n \nMaybe, just maybe, somewhere along the way, someone will read my shit and say, \"Damn I thought my life was fucked up. \u00a0At least I'm not the only one!\" \n \nI want you all to know ...I don't curse this much in real life. \u00a0I am a fucking lady after all! \u00a0Most of my bad language floats around in my head. \u00a0Sometimes, I go into my bathroom and curse out my kids, my husband, my mother and my dog. \u00a0I flip the occasional bird when no one is looking. Sometimes, I let it out here...and every day on Facebook, several times a day, actually. \u00a0You should follow me there. \u00a0I really am a hoot! \u00a0That is of course, unless you're offended by the cursing. \u00a0In that case, well hell! \u00a0I don't know what to tell you. \n \nFor any of my family who is reading this...I'm sorry. \u00a0Truly I am. \u00a0No. \u00a0I take that back. \u00a0This is my release. \u00a0If you don't like it ...I'm not writing it for you! Ha! \u00a0I say all of this with love in my heart.  \n \n~ Karen \u00a0 \n \n By the way, tonight I am following the advice of Ernest Hemingway, because that's how I roll. He said, \"Write drunk.

{"date": "Sunday, August 3, 2014", "body": "\n \nHaving dinner together as a family is a simple, ordinary thing for most people. Very little in my life is simple or ordinary. The simplest things become complex when we put together the special personalities and idiosyncrasies of our immediate family.  \n \nMost nights, we eat in shifts. \u00a0Honestly, we try not to have the entire family sitting down all at once in order to keep the peace.  \n \nWe have Red, who usually NEVER likes what we are eating or where we are going if we are dining out. He makes the face like he's tasting crap when he takes a bite of a dish he's unfamiliar with or a vegetable. He wants to completely dominate the conversation. \u00a0He chews loudly. \u00a0He practically inhales his food so fast, that I wonder how his body actually digests it. \n \nWe have Blue who loves to eat any and everything. \u00a0He doesn't want to talk about or hear about anything his brother has to say, especially if he starts talking about religion. Oy! \n \nYou have my mom, who interrupts me every time I open my mouth when I'm speaking to my children. \u00a0She completes my sentences before I get the chance. \u00a0Give her a good glass of wine or three, food served extra hot and she's happy.  \n \nThen you have my husband, who is a complete extravert when it comes to friends, colleagues or complete strangers. He is Mr. Personality! However, when it comes to having dinner with just us, you can tell he's trying his best just to get through eating the meal, so that he doesn't have to listen to Red talk anymore. \u00a0I call him the table manager. \u00a0He is constantly arranging, straightening and rearranging the table, all while trying to control the table manners of his teenage sons. \n \nOnce we went out to breakfast with both boys. \u00a0I think we were traveling. \u00a0He actually instructed Red through the whole meal. \u00a0Cut your pancakes with your knife and fork. \u00a0Now take a bite. \u00a0Drink some milk. \u00a0Eat some eggs. \u00a0Now wipe your mouth. \u00a0Take a few more bites of your pancakes now. \u00a0I thought.I.was.going.do.die. Red actually went along with it for some strange reason. \n \nAnd then you have me. \u00a0I'm perfect. \u00a0Haha! Actually, I usually don't have much of an appetite, especially if I had to prepare the meal. \u00a0I usually eat just enough so that I can have wine. When dining out, I try to orchestrate a friendly, neutral conversation in which all hell will not break loose at least until after we finish eating the meal.  \n \nTonights dining out Italian family style was ...um...not fun. Red really did try his level best to talk the entire time about his video editing in a rather negative light. \u00a0He talks about all of the things that are wrong with his videos because he doesn't have \"professional\" equipment. \u00a0Then he tries to start with the laundry list of things that he needs to buy for video editing. \u00a0I cut his conversation short and told everyone we would only talk about neutral, non-controversial subjects. \u00a0We could talk about movies, mutual friends, what we have planned for the week. \u00a0Things of that nature. \n \nNo matter how we tried, Red continually attempted to bring the conversation back around to himself. \u00a0If I was engaged in dialog with Blue, or my mom, he would interrupt. \"Mom. Mom. Mom.\" \n \nMy husband sat there and said almost, absolutely nothing except for what he wanted to order. \u00a0He did reach in a couple of times to tell us to pass the bread, plates or whatever so that the table would stay arranged and spots would be open for the food as it was served. \u00a0He also would tell the boys when they had had enough bread, to use their napkins properly or whatever. \n \nThis was painful for me. \u00a0I didn't have enough wine to make it all better. \n \nOn the way home, husband still said very little. \u00a0The boys started a conversation about family. \u00a0Which cousin is the funniest, or something along those lines. \u00a0We actually shared a few laughs over this. \u00a0My husband's reaction? At one point he plugged his finger into his ear, because Red was laughing and talking while turning around to see us in the back seat. \u00a0In the process, I guess he got a little too close to dad's sensitive ears. (Aspie much?) \n \nWhen I got home hubby bolted out to the store like he couldn't stand to be around us all another minute. \u00a0He needed a sensory break. \u00a0We've all been there right? \n \nAll I could think about was ...in just a few weeks, we have a family reunion. We are all supposed to travel to St. Louis together, stay in a hotel and spend lots of quality family time. Together. \n \nI think I just might call in sick. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/08/aspergers-at-dinner.html", "title": "\nAspergers at Dinner  \n"},

I end up eating just enough to take the edge off my hunger and then I have a glass of wine.  Wine for dinner! Yay!\u00a0 The lack of appreciation from the boys does not help my enthusiasm for cooking one single bit. \n \nI cooked a big dinner last night. Half way through the process, I was sorry that I began. I marinated a lot of chicken in teriyaki marinade and spices the day before. The plan was to put it on the grill. \u00a0Mom was to make a big salad and I would make some quick macaroni and cheese. \n \nAs I'm prepping to go out back to the grill, I hear the boys talking upstairs. \u00a0It sounds like a decent conversation at first, until it gets louder and louder.

{"date": "Wednesday, June 11, 2014", "body": "\n \nAt the end of every week for the past several weeks, I have thought ... Boy! That was the week from hell! I think I deserve a prize for surviving. \n \nLast week before Red's graduation, was the epitome of a week from hell. I thought nothing could top the previous week when I had come home from the hospital with my mother. \u00a0He went completely ballistic, as we were coming through the door. \u00a0You read that right ...coming through the door after her being in the hospital, for 5 days. \n \n\"Why didn't you take me to church!?\" he asked incredulously. \"Why do you have to have Blue's therapy appointment on Wednesdays when you know I need to get to church?\" \u00a0He went on and on and on from there. ranting, making all kinds of threats. \u00a0This ended with a phone call to the Crisis hotline. A call that miraculously got him to pull his shit together. \n \nI have told him numerous times, \"You know I have his appointment on Wednesdays, YOU need to find another way to get to church. And don't wait until the last minute!\" Sometimes he pulls it off, getting someone from church to pick him up. \u00a0 Sometimes, he waits and there is no one available. \n \nOn that particular day, not only did I have to be across town for therapy with Blue, I also needed to be back on this side of town, \u00a0immediately following because suddenly, they decided to release my mother from the hospital. (Even though, she wasn't much better than when she got there). My husband was out of town, of course. \u00a0I don't have the superpower of being 3 places at once, so something had to give. \n \nThe person who was dialing my phone over and over again, being rude and demanding, was the person who lost out on a ride from me. \n \nBack to this last week before graduation ...Red had completed his high school credits in January of this year. \u00a0So, when he arrived on campus for graduation rehearsal, he had not been submerged in the high school cesspool for over 4 months. \u00a0Being in the gym, surrounded by hundreds of seniors, brought back all kinds of insecurities, old wounds, thoughts and feelings about every single bad thing that ever happened during high school. \u00a0It sent him over the edge.  \n \nI got a phone call from him during rehearsal, \"I'm not doing it! I am not walking the stage with these people. I feel uncomfortable here.\" \n \nLater I received a text, \"I want the girls to scream my name when I walk across that stage. \u00a0Since that's not going to happen...it's pretty much going to be a disaster.\" \n \nI didn't push. \u00a0I told him it was his life ...his decision. \n \nWell, he came home and jumped head first into the deep end. \u00a0He ranted he raved. \u00a0He blamed all of us and everyone else in the world, for all of his problems. \u00a0He said some of the most god awful things to all of us ...my mother included. \u00a0Some of the things he said \u00a0quite frankly, were unforgivable, certainly unforgettable. Rage or no rage, Aspergers or not. I was done! I really didn't want him to walk if we had to see more of this behavior. \n \nI was trying to pull off a little reception for the following day after graduation, \u00a0here at the house, so that his friends and our friends could stop by, have a bite and acknowledge his accomplishment. \u00a0Plans for that came to a screeching halt after he said all of the horrible things that you just can't take back. \n \nAfter saying everything he could to our family, then he took to Facebook to let everyone in the world know how he was feeling. \n \n \"I don't want to go to graduation. I'm going to be embarassed and people are going to make fun of me on stage. They're going to say \"Look its the angry guy!\" and I will not be embarassed in front of the whole school!! I wish I could make a speech in front of the whole entire school and prove them wrong that I am not the person they think I am!!! I am way nicer than you think and I will not be humiliated!! But I guess that none of my classmates actually care about me especially the girls.\" \n \nThis post rallied a lot of attention. \u00a0He received encouraging words and thoughts from so many people. He got phone calls from family members with words of encouragement. \u00a0I tried to explain what graduation is really about. \u00a0It's a celebration of accomplishment. \u00a0It's not a popularity contest. \u00a0It's an opportunity to put the past behind you and move forward. \n \nHe made it through the second rehearsal the following day without incident. He became determined to walk. \u00a0In the past, he has volunteered in the classroom with kids with autism and other disabilities who have much more to overcome than he does. \u00a0Some of them would be walking the stage on graduation day. \u00a0He was determined that if they could do it, so could he. \n \n \n \n \n He Made IT!\u00a0 \n \n \nWhen that graduation march song played, my heart filled with pride. \u00a0My eyes filled with tears. \u00a0I thought about every meeting that I went through to fight for what he needed. \u00a0I thought about every phone call I received from school when he was falling apart. \u00a0I thought about all of my worries and fears that this day would never come. \u00a0That his anger would someday get him into trouble that I couldn't get him out of. \u00a0In that moment, I believe that his walking across that stage meant more to me than any other parent in that stadium. \n \nWhile all of the kids were standing to receive accolades, awards and recognition, I was thinking,  He made it! And he never got arrested or ended up in the hospital! That's my boy!  \n \nOne of his peers that he started kindergarten with was in the top 10 students graduating. \u00a0He has already received a scholarship to the University of Texas. \u00a0I am so happy and proud of him. This young man would periodically come over to tutor with Blue on high school projects. \u00a0I am equally \u00a0happy that Red made it to graduation...period. \u00a0He has a job that he loves. Many students don't have that yet. \u00a0He has a passion for video editing and has taught himself, more than many other students will ever know. \n \n \n \n \n Red & friend since day 1 kindergarten \n \nHe's going to make it. \u00a0His path has not been easy. \u00a0There will continue to be bumps, curves, and setbacks. \u00a0He may need more support than your average adult, but he will get there. \u00a0 I am hoping that getting there, means that soon he will get out of my house! \n \nBy the way, he did not take one picture with his family after the ceremony. \u00a0He was too busy taking pictures with all of the friends and hot girls, whom he accuses of ignoring him all throughout high school. You all will have to see me in my  hot \u00a0dress another time. \n \n \n Girls he wanted to scream his name He settled for this picture...thrilled in fact \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FBpvkW5au_Y/U5jHYBo0CZI/AAAAAAAABjA/RVZiCgK_15U/s1600/10463030_645079975568246_8356664107844184868_n.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Gpc6lmPlhso/U5jJrlMPHSI/AAAAAAAABjI/P5rno_gwL8w/s1600/K+&+D+.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qwaz4AFMgxY/U5jnvhZpHsI/AAAAAAAABjU/-_oIT_Qckww/s1600/K&girlsgrad.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/06/graduation.html", "title": "\nGraduation \n"},

It doesn't matter. \u00a0He is livid! \u00a0He no longer wants to hang out with me while Red goes to his social skills appointment. \u00a0We usually go have a bite to eat, go for a walk and hang out somewhere down in Austin together -just the two of us. \n \nWe have to drop Harry off at home before we head out. By the time we get home Blue is in tears of frustration. \u00a0He explains that it's not just me being late, \u00a0it's how his day started with a misunderstanding with a teacher. \u00a0My being late is just the icing on the cake.  \n \nOnce he cries it out...he is able to calm down and apologize for going ballistic. \u00a0He decides to go with me after-all. \u00a0A few hours without his brother, dinner @ Chipolte, \u00a0a trip to the Apple store and all is forgiven. \n \n Spit Me Out -Part Deaux \nAs I am attempt to calm Blue, Red chimes in with, \"I don't want to go to group today. \u00a0I'm not going to have enough time on my computer. \u00a0Can you extend the parental controls to 10 o'clock?\" \n \nIf he asked that question once he asked it a hundred times on the way there. \u00a0The answer never changes. \u00a0I have to remain consistent. \u00a0He can survive one day without extended hours on the computer. \u00a0This group is for  his  benefit...not mine. \u00a0He wants to make friends -supposedly. \u00a0He needs the skills to do so. \u00a0This is a group with teenagers who are slowly becoming his friends. \u00a0I would rather stay home, finish my laundry and watch \"Parenthood.\" \u00a0I am doing this for him and spending a nice penny for it to boot. \n \nWhen we pick him up after the group he starts again. \u00a0He is relentless, talking loudly, repeating himself \u00a0over and over and over again. \u00a0I want to speed the car up and stop suddenly to make him hit his head on the freakin' dashboard. \u00a0I refrain. \u00a0I'm only a child abuser in my head.  \n \n\"But I'm not going to have enough time on my computer. \u00a0Can you extend the parental controls for tonight? \u00a0Mom, why are you pushing my buttons? \u00a0In your head, you are mentally pushing my buttons!\"  \n \n Well ain't that the pot calling the kettle? \n \nHe works himself into a frenzie. \u00a0When we get home he starts this fake meltdown where he's rolling on the floor, kicking like a toddler or an epileptic \u00a0I've seen him out of control before...this is not what it looks like. \u00a0I'm his mother. \u00a0I know him like a book. \u00a0This is controlled manipulation. \n \nWe are in my mother's room where he is sprawled across the floor, \u00a0all 200 pounds of him. \u00a0My mother is silently laughing at his bad acting job. \u00a0The other day she told him that if he kept screaming so loud, he just might pop a blood vessel and we'd have to rush him to the emergency room. \u00a0He believed her. \u00a0He hasn't screamed since then. \n \nI leave the room so that he no longer has an audience. \u00a0Mom finally convinces him that he is wasting what little time he has and to go ahead and take his shower.  \n \n By the time both boys are asleep, I feel the need for something strong to calm my nerves. \u00a0It's 10 p.m. too late for a martini. \u00a0 A glass of wine will have me up peeing all night. \u00a0I desperately need self-medication. \n \nI've been on a quest to find the perfect cupcake in Austin. \u00a0Tonight, I have a red velvet from MadCakes. \u00a0A Mad-cupcake for a madwoman -how appropriate. \u00a0Don't you think? \n \n \n \n I miss your comments!

{"date": "Friday, April 15, 2011", "body": "\n Some days are just plain old funky -and this was one of them. \u00a0Moods were swinging like kids on the playground. \u00a0Everyone was angry about anything and everything. \u00a0The morning starts with Blue being angry because it was -well...morning and he has to go to school. \u00a0I picked out a pair of shorts what had a broken zipper. \u00a0I mean why would a mother do such a thing? \u00a0Incredulous.  \n \nI am downstairs preparing breakfast when a Red is listening to \"Green Day\". \u00a0He starts to sing...I hear heavy foot steps, a door bursting open and then, \"Heeeyyy! What the heck are you doing?\" Followed by, \"Get-off-of me fatty!\" I drop my spatula and run upstairs. \u00a0Red -big one is on top of Blue -little one.\u00a0I break it up an send Blue back to his corner of the boxing ring. Just call me Ref! \n \nToday we are trying a new form of ADHD medication for Red -the Daytrana patch. \u00a0I try sticking the damn thing on and it's not really sticking very well. \u00a0Mind you -I'm trying to hurry and get him out the door after the fight and residual name calling matches. \u00a0Also -the pharmacy had filled another of his prescriptions with the generic (sertraline) of Zoloft instead of the name brand. \u00a0In Red, this apparently makes a world of difference.  \n \nWithin an hour of his arrival at school he calls to say the patch came off. \u00a0I have to high-tail it over there to apply another one. \u00a0By the time I arrive, he's completely on the opposite side of lucid. \u00a0He's going off about things that I haven't heard about in weeks. \u00a0I think he's making up the script of things to be angry about as he goes along.  \n \n\"I don't want to be here! I hate it here.\" \u00a0Apparently he's been getting angry about seeing couples kissing and holding hands in the hallways. \u00a0He takes it as a personal affront. \n \nWith assistance from the nurse, I get the patch applied. \u00a0I get her to tell him it would probably stick better if he showered daily. (hint hint) \u00a0He doesn't want to go back to class. \u00a0He wants me to be his audience. \u00a0I walk him back to class and try to disappear as quickly as I can. \u00a0He is regressing, going back to old scripts making himself more angry with every utterance. \u00a0He is in another world.  \n \nI leave the campus wondering what the heck is going on? \u00a0Is it the new patch? \u00a0Is it the generic sertraline? \u00a0Is he just loosing his ever-loving mind? Will this nightmare ever end? \u00a0I fantasize about sending him to a lovely sanitarium where he can talk about his feelings and paint all day looking out over \u00a0green meadows. \n \nI decide to prepare for what will surely be the night from hell. \u00a0I have to give myself a break. \u00a0I want to go to the art studio to paint -to forget. \u00a0Unfortunately, my art instructor is not available for an impromptu pop-in. \u00a0I go shopping instead. \u00a0I want to go find a good margarita. \u00a0I decide against it -I will need my strength and cognizance later. \u00a0My mood is low and funky. \n \nI take Blue and his friends out for ice cream after school to avoid Red when he first gets home. \u00a0According to my mother, he bursts through the door and climbs the stairs 3 at a time. \u00a0He gets to the top screams bloody murder, and starts ranting incoherently. \u00a0By the time I arrive, she's given him his afternoon med. \u00a0He's eating a cupcake ...perfectly calm. \u00a0Weird! \n \nWhen James Brown sang that song \"Make it Funky.\" I don't think this is what he was talking about.  \n \nCheck out the lyrics:\u00a0http://artists.letssingit.com/james-brown-lyrics-make-it-funky-npk2f23 \n \n If you feel me...Let me know! \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-atSAreYGPtQ/Tahv4qiTpWI/AAAAAAAAALc/3ArMTMSYFG4/s1600/images-16.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2011/04/make-it-funky.html", "title": "\nMake it Funky!\n"},

If a peer is asking you for money, and they have never returned the favor, chances are you are being used. \u00a0Real friends don't ask you for money, toys or gifts. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nDear School Administrator,\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI overheard his conversation with my two sons and their friend, who also has a disability, the other night on our way to church. \u00a0The young man was telling my boys that he is being asked to buy a certain young lady small snack items, sending him back and forth to the lunch line first to buy cookies then later to buy chips to give to or share with her.

I love you.\" \u00a0He of course was thrilled by her show of affection. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoth of my sons are on the autism spectrum, however they could both see that he is being used only because this has happened to Red before with another young lady there at the high school. \u00a0I personally taught him the lesson of people trying to use him. \u00a0People with disabilities are often desperate for friendships and can not readily see that they are being manipulated.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe young lady involved this time is the same young lady you had my son sign a \"Stay Away Agreement\" from. \u00a0This kind of manipulative behavior is despicable and shows the true character of this young lady who was a part of major drama for my son. \u00a0It makes me believe that a lot of the things that happened were over dramatized and that she did play a part in the going back and forth, yanking his chain, being his friend one day, and telling on him like she is deathly afraid of him the next.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRed told me back then, that you guys are only listening to her ...only listening to the person without the disabilitiy and that no one cares about those who do have one. \u00a0This is a part of his anger with Assistant Principals at the high school. \u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen my younger son, who is still in middle school heard this young man telling this story, he told him right away that he is being used. \u00a0\"She is not your friend.\" \u00a0His \u00a0reply was that, \"I had the money, so I didn't mind.\"\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI spoke with the Special Education Social Skills teacher about this the following day. \u00a0He said he would give a social skills lesson about manipulation and reading cues. \u00a0I also spoke with my sons tracking teacher because of course, he was upset that this young lady is continuing to get away with taking advantage of kids with special needs. \u00a0My son felt like it was his job to stop it, because administration would do nothing about it. I of course, told my son I did not want him taking matters into his own hands.\u00a0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI feel like this matter needs to be investigated.

{"date": "Thursday, December 5, 2013", "body": "\n \nI should be on a date with my husband. \u00a0Last night at the dinner table, he invited me to meet him for a Holiday Happy Hour party that some client is sponsoring. \u00a0I told him I would try to make it. \u00a0I thought maybe I would bring Blue with me, and drop him off at a nearby Starbucks. \u00a0He he could do homework, while we were socializing. \n \nAt the time, I wasn't thinking about the fact that this would also be church night for Red. Planning an adult outing during the middle of the week, at the last minute is really not simple. For that matter, nothing in my life is simple. \n \nFirst of all, last night I washed and attempted to color my hair ...purple. \u00a0Yes -the color purple. \u00a0It didn't work. \u00a0Instead my half-ass mix of dark brown with remnants of red hair, is now just black. \u00a0With the exception of the terribly stubborn gray in the front that didn't take any color at all. Washing and attempting to color my hair took so long, that I didn't have time to twist and style it afterwards.  \n \n \n \n \u00a0dreadlocks done professionally -minus the gray \n \nThe process of self-twisting locks, also takes quite a while. \u00a0Lately, I've been getting my locs twisted professionally, which actually only takes about an hour. By twisted I mean, the hair grows out leaving the roots, loose, and in my case, gray. \u00a0The last time I went to have it done by a stylist/loctician, \u00a0the asshole had me waiting for  three hours , before he even got started on me. \u00a0Well, I take that back, he washed and dried my hair, but it was still a mess. \u00a0I was livid! \u00a0Ready to walk out the door when he finally called me to do the actual twisting. \u00a0I haven't been back to him since. \u00a0He's good, and he's quick, once he finally gets started. \u00a0But, \u00a0obviously he has no idea how to manage his time, and I don't have time to waste. \u00a0He and the other stylist there even stopped to order lunch during my wait, which included chicken, waffles and red Kool-Aid.  \u00a0Now I'm not saying these folks were some country, backwoods so and sos, but ...you put two and two together.  \n \nBack to my the story... \n \nSo today, I had plans of twisting my dreadlocks, \u00a0which takes me a few hours. This morning the kids \u00a0wore me out. \u00a0I mean I was exhausted by 8:45 when I dropped Blue off at school. I needed to regroup, so I came home, poured myself a big cup of coffee and took the time to do a little writing, in silence. \n \nWhen I was done, my mother reminded me it was time for  her hair  appointment. \u00a0Now ...I tried to get her to agree that I would drop her off, and she could ask her friend/hairstylist to go out to lunch. \u00a0This would give me 2 hours to come home, take a bath, be alone, walk through my own house naked and take care of my own hair. \u00a0But nooooo ...she didn't want to do that. \u00a0It wasn't her plan and she had a million excuses why she refused to do it.  \n \nI wasn't dressed for the day. \u00a0I had not showered or bathed. \u00a0So, I had to drop her off, come back home, take a quick shower, change and then go right back to pick her up. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0I was pissed! \u00a0Once again, I'm running around like a chicken doing everything that don't want to do, for everyone else. \n \n \n \nHubby calls this afternoon to ask me if I am still coming. \u00a0Well, by this time, the boys are home and going at it, arguing, venting about school and asking me ninety-nine thousand and one questions, working on my last half of a nerve. \u00a0My hair still is not done. \u00a0I took one look in the mirror and it was frightful. \n \nRed needed to get to church. \u00a0I am proud of myself for making him get his his own ride. \u00a0Of course, it would be more convenient for him, if I did it. \u00a0I have to draw the line somewhere, he will never do anything for himself if I don't push. \n \nBlue needed to get to the library to do a ton of homework. \u00a0When he has a lot to do, he gets too distracted and quite, frankly angry, to do it at home. \u00a0There is no fighting, yelling or meltdowns allowed at the library, unless you're a toddler. \n \nHere was my choice... \n \n-Get dressed quickly, put together some half-assed hairdo, \u00a0put on some make up to spite that bitch of a mirror. \u00a0Then, find something cute to wear to meet people for the first time, at the last minute. \u00a0Then, rush across town to hang out with hubby and his colleagues. \u00a0 Put on the smiles, small talk and act like an adult who isn't half out of her mind. \n \nOr... \n \n-Put on my sweats and take Blue to the library with bad hair and no make-up.  \n \nTwo weeks ago I vowed not to put off \u00a0the fun of my life, for the sake of my ungrateful children. \u00a0I actually went to Houston to meet my girlfriend from California for the weekend. \u00a0It.Was.Fabulous! I am so glad I talked myself into going. I got my own hotel room, and boy did I enjoy the peace and quiet. \n \nThis past weekend, I lived up to that vow again. \u00a0I tried to talk myself out of a date with hubby because I was exhausted from a day of Blue's meltdowns, \u00a0but I held strong. \u00a0Red was still away at Grandma's. \u00a0I decided to leave miserable Blue at home with my mother. \u00a0He wouldn't be happy whether I stayed home or not. \u00a0So, I may as well go have some fun. We went out, despite my bad mood and it was great!  \n \nWe saw the \"Best Man Holiday\" in a luxury, dine-in ...more importantly drink-in, theatre. \u00a0All of that chocolate candy, changed my mood real quick! \u00a0And by chocolate candy, I mean Morris Chesnut and Taye Diggs. \u00a0Can I get an amen? \n \nSo tonight when I'm supposed to be out on a date, having adult fun ...where am I? \n \nHint: I'm wearing sweatpants.  \n \nTwo out of three ain't bad.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sH5KJzBmDkE/Up_ZRDI0oPI/AAAAAAAABXM/uTKNhdlHHr0/s1600/me+profile+.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OLf04l-C8oU/Up_YHrepjXI/AAAAAAAABXA/-5X0M7ktjrw/s1600/mirrormeme.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/12/where-am-i.html", "title": "\nWhere Am I? \n"},

Nope...just stocking up for the holidays.\u00a0 No parties are planned.\u00a0 We drive through the parking lot and as we pass the grocery store, there is a lone tree standing in front with a sign that says $10.00.\u00a0 It looks like a Nobel Fir around 5 or 6 feet tall. U-turn! \n \nThere is no one outside monitoring the plants so I rush inside to customer service and ask, \"What do I have to do to get that tree?\" I pay for it at the service desk.\u00a0 They call a couple of young, strapping guys to come over to package it up and load it into my SUV.\u00a0  \n \nFor over a week I'd been asking my wonderful husband to go with me to pick one out.\u00a0 He's been so busy with work, among other excuses, so it hadn't happened yet. I had given up and was about to pull out the old handy artificial tree out of the garage.\u00a0 As much as I have come to loath that fake tree -there's only a week left until Christmas.\u00a0 It seemed pointless to buy a live tree at this point. $10.00 changed everything. \n \nNow I'm not saying it's the most perfect tree I've ever seen.\u00a0 There are a few gaps in it, but it's natural.\u00a0 The thing about nature and art in my opinion, is there is no such thing as perfection.\u00a0 It is what it is. \n \nMy prodigal son (22) returned home last night to help his father put the tree into the stand.\u00a0 He was in a charming mood after a week full of drama.

He put the star on the top.\u00a0 It is so rare to see a genuine smile on his face, so that was awesome. \n \n \nTree decorating, music, wine, good food and all children present made for a simple yet beautiful night.\n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_dKCPXWx8BY4/TQ6_cw1N4EI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/_q7pOooNsG0/s1600/tree.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2010/12/ten-dollar-tree.html", "title": "\nTen Dollar Tree\n"},
{"date": "Monday, September 30, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Editorial Note: \n \n This essay started out as a FB Status by my friend Kathleen.  It resonated deeply with me, because she is me.  We are the same. Our lives are a parallel universe, that most people don't know anything about.  For those of you who don't live it ...this is the world of an Aspergers Mom.  By getting to know her ...you will be getting to know our universe.   \n \n By  Kathleen Johnson  \n \n I wish for one day you could be me. I wish for one day you could listen to the barrage of concerns I listen to without the ability to alleviate them...from the way the schools\u2019 cafeteria is cheating him out of 33.5 cents every time he buys a frozen yogurt, because it does not accurately reflect the amount they are reporting to sell him.  On to the grades that are entered incorrectly for him by one particular teacher, who is certainly out to keep in high school forever.   \n \n I wish for one day you could feel the anxiety that begins to boil up in me as I listen to complaint after complaint of how the world is against him.  One very tiny thing to you or me, is the end of the world to him.  Like the way people look at him when they walk by.  To the space he has to share which is \u201cnot his fault!\u201d\u00a0 Everything is \"not his fault!\" \n \n  A timer set him off this morning.  The timer (he fought me on) -that he swore up and down he didn\u2019t want in his bathroom.  \u201cTiming showers is \u2018stupid\u2019\u201d  This same timer is why he is pissed off  they  took out of his bathroom for \u201cno reason.\u201d   They  had to walk by   their  shower timer to get his.  It's a conspiracy of sorts.  Everyone is always conspiring against him. Never mind that he hasn\u2019t noticed the timer has been out of his bathroom for a week.  He noticed it now, and that was enough to set his day up for opposition.   \n \n I wish for one day you could experience what it is like to have the concerns about his future as I do. When something so small as a bathroom timer  can upset his entire day, how is he going to react when  they  cut him off on the freeway?  Or when a co-worker blames him for speaking inappropriately and the boss confronts him? \u00a0 \n \n I worry about how he will live on his own.  Who will explain things to him such as the rent is due at the BEGINNING of the month, and not the end, so when he doesn\u2019t understand, he doesn\u2019t automatically assume the landlord is out to take advantage of him.  The police or judges certainly aren\u2019t going to take his \u201cdisability\u201d under consideration when there's a misunderstanding.  His own father can\u2019t do that.   \n \n His lack of understanding is a real problem for him.  He finds it difficult to follow simple rules in our home.  They escape him.  He isn\u2019t present in the moment enough to follow them.  When called on his \u201cinability\u201d to follow the rules, he can\u2019t explain himself sufficiently or quick enough.  I  get  his frustration.   I GET IT!  \u00a0 \n \n Have you ever considered that the very thing that drives you or I crazy about him is what creates his frustration and anger?    \n \n Consider for a moment that you are driving fast to rush a lady in labor to the hospital.  You are pulled over by the  authorities  for violating the speed limit.  You are so frazzled, that you can\u2019t find your words to tell the officer that there is a woman in your car in labor, but you KNOW there is a woman about to give birth in your backseat.  The windows are tinted and she isn\u2019t making any noise.  You try to roll down your window to \u201cshow\u201d the officer the situation since you can\u2019t articulate it.   The officer takes it as you trying to reach for a weapon.  Immediately, he gets aggressive with you and pulls you out of the car on the drivers side.  In an instant you are face planted to the side of your car, getting frisked and handcuffed.\u00a0 \n \n Meanwhile,  you KNOW this woman is in the back of the car about to spit an 8lb baby out of her vagina and bloody up your new car.  You start to struggle and scream because if only they let you go, you could show the officer.  However, he is telling you to be quiet.  His perception of the situation is  his  reality and you are powerless to change that!   His partner begins to search the vehicle and he sees the pregnant woman in distress.   All of a sudden the officer communicates this to his partner.  The officer now knows what you know.  He releases you and actually even escorts you to the hospital.  All the while you may appreciate the understanding, but your adrenaline is running. You're PISSED OFF because you were trying to tell him that in first place.  You just where just too upset in the moment, to be able to articulate it.  The words wouldn\u2019t come to you.  You thought everyone else should know what was in  your  head.\u00a0 \n \n THIS is what it is like for him  every single day!   This is what communication looks like in my home.  Always a misunderstanding -an expectation that he doesn't meet.  He should do better despite his ability level. \u00a0 \n \n If you walked in his shoes, would you blame  yourself  for being so emotionally charged to not be able to articulate the specific circumstances regarding the woman in labor?   Yet we expect him, the kid who  lives  in THIS FRAZZLED state of being to be able to do articulate his thoughts and feelings appropriately, instantaneously...everyday!\u00a0 \n \n HE ISN\u2019T TYPICAL!  Stop comparing him to other kids his age.  Stop comparing him to other kids younger than him.  Stop comparing him to yourself!  Honor the fact that our child is different.  Don\u2019t tell them to see himself  as the equal to his peers, or siblings.  He isn\u2019t. \n \n  \u00a0 \n \n \n \n Every individual should be treated based on what  THEY  need. \u00a0 \n \n My child has Aspergers.  In his mind, your typical child is at an unfair advantage when he deals with him.  His disability is invisible to the world, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.  It is REAL.  His disability is real.  I am sick and tired of the perception that I make excuses for him. I am trying to educate ...not excuse.  Autism is the invisible reason for many of his behaviors.  \u00a0 \n \n Imagine ...I have to explain this and educate his  own father almost daily!   By the time I get to explaining this over and over again, those of you in the outside world,  may see my frustration.  I may not be all goodness and light when I am exasperated.    \n \n Teachers, friends and relatives  -I  am sorry he treats you inappropriately, doesn\u2019t listen to you, or give you the respect as an adult that you think that he should.  It makes me sad that I have not been able to install that in him as a parent.  But I get it ...I get where he is coming from.  It is difficult to get him to trust  us,  his own parents  enough to listen to us.\u00a0 \n \n I mean, think about this.  The people who brought him into this world weren\u2019t given an instruction manual for him.  We are learning as we go.  We made mistakes while raising him especially, before we knew he had autism.  There were MANY days when we were that police officer who wasn't hearing what he was trying to tell us.  That miscommunication instilled a mistrust in him.  His self talk became - if the people who are supposed to love me and protect me can\u2019t understand me, I can\u2019t trust that anyone will.  I need to depend on myself.   So he built up a barricade -a fire wall.  \u00a0 \n \n He may never trust enough to listen to what you say.  Don\u2019t make that mean he is disrespectful or that his behavior is willful. He will likely bark at you, that comes from the years of being barked at by others.  It's instinctive, fight or flight behavior.  His frustration comes out as anger.  He feels like he is constantly treated unfairly by the world.  So, yes, he may blurt things out that make you cringe, give you a knee jerk reaction, or make you want to slap the shit out of him.  I understand.  I get that too.  But please understand he has no filter, no political correctness and at this point,  after everything he has been through, he is completely desensitized to judgment by you or anyone else. He is just trying to survive. \u00a0 \n \n When he thinks something, he says it.  He isn\u2019t being mean or rude.  He just isn\u2019t concerned nor does he even realize that other people actually have self talk (filters) before they say something aloud.  He thinks it, speaks it and then suffers the ramification of it.  No. He doesn\u2019t connect that behavior with anything he needs to adjust, so therefore, he may never learn from the consequences he experiences. \u00a0 \n \n Believe you me, I wish I could have had a greater parental impact on him.  I have been beating my head against this brick wall for 15 years.   \n \n IF you really knew me  ...you would understand my moodiness, my sadness, my frustration and my sorrow. You would understand my need to be \u201cDONE\u201d raising children, without thinking I am a cold hearted woman.  These 15+ years have been like 45 years raising typical kid. \u00a0 \n \n You would understand my need to be  alone .  The truth is, I am never alone because even when I manage to do something for me, I am only a text or phone call away and believe you me, I am his phone a friend and he uses that option many times a day. \u00a0 \n \n You would understand my  selfishness,  as the only way I have found  to survive.  You would understand the value I place in solitude, my home and inner peace.  This is what keeps me from blowing my brains out or taking a hand full of pills.   \n \n If you really knew me  ...you would know that my inner struggle is created by the contrast of my life on the outside, versus how I feel inside.  It is a minor miracle that I haven\u2019t rolled over and played dead or given up and settled into a fetal position in the corner somewhere.   \n \n Instead, I press on.  I set goals.  I work on MY dreams to keep myself from being devastated about his life.  The fact that I haven\u2019t stopped trying to live a consciously connected life is extraordinary.  I am special.  I know this.  \n \n It is no small feat that against the carb and junk cravings he has,  I still insist on feeding all of my children healthy, quality food.  There are some days when the smack down I receive about food sends me to eat or drink away my own stress.  I may give in at times, but I never GIVE UP.\u00a0  I hold to my stance 90% of the time.  Yes, I give in.  So what?  That doesn\u2019t make me hypocritical.  It makes me human.    The daily fight over food makes me crazy at best. \n \n If you really knew me  ...you would understand how much energy it takes to be me on a daily basis. You would understand my need to \u201ccheck out\u201d.  My heart is still here, my intentions are still pure, but I can only give what I can give.  I can\u2019t apologize to you or anyone else if how I give isn\u2019t the way you want to receive.  I love with all my heart, but sometimes I need to love from afar. \u00a0 \n \n If you really knew   my life ,  you would see the extraordinary feat it is to remain positive and maintain inner Zen amidst the outer storm. Then and only then, would  you understand why I control my world, my home, and my environment in order to achieve that.  \n \n Then and only then would you truly  get it . \n \n Kathleen is a married (22 years), mother of three handsome, amazingly unique young men with different abilities.

{"date": "Friday, July 10, 2015", "body": "\n \n Recently, I had to make some tough decisions about Red. It was really hard for me as any decision is these days. My capacity for decision making has been severely handicapped in recent months, maybe even years.\u00a0  Being in a constant state of panic can do that to a girl. \u00a0  My anxiety has been through the roof! \u00a0  I can think \u00a0  something to death and back to life again, and still can\u2019t decide whether or not to move forward. What if this happens? What if that goes wrong? What if I ruin the rest of his life? \u00a0 \n \n \n \nSo Red is out of the house, temporarily in a therapeutic environment getting some much needed help. I can not and will not get into details of where he is in order to honor his privacy. I will say this, for the first time in a very long time. I know what it's\u00a0 like to think for more than just a few minutes, in my own home without being interrupted. This is a peace that I forgot existed. \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThere hasn\u2019t been one raised voice. There has been no screaming \u2026no ranting, no physical fighting. I slept the other night for the first time in weeks without having dreams of fighting someone. In my dreams, I\u2019ve been fighting with everyone for weeks now. I could sleep 8 hours and wake up tired like someone had just kicked my ass. The first night he was out of the house, I woke myself up laughing out loud from a silly dream. No irony there!\u00a0 \n \n \n \nMy emotions are mixed.\u00a0 I am ambivalent, sad, scared, happy, relieved. My problems are not solved. \u00a0We are just taking a first step in the right direction. More decisions await me which I am not looking forward to dealing with but for now, I can only take one day at at time. \n \n \n Red -Age 3 Hallween \n \n \nI have moments when I wonder, did I to it all wrong when it came to raising Red? Did I come to the rescue too many times?\u00a0\u00a0I know for sure that I spoiled him.\u00a0 But the truth is, I didn\u2019t raise him any differently than I did my other 2 sons. \u00a0Blue is very independent despite my indulgence. \u00a0My eldest stepson, who I raised from the time he was 5 years old is independent as well.\u00a0 They all have their issues, but Red is just different. He has been from the day he was born.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nThe truth of who Red is as a young adult is being shown to me more and more each day. My eyes are open and I am seeing things that I have never seen, \u00a0as I pull back on what I\u2019m willing to do for him. \u00a0He fights back with all of his strength. \u00a0As it all plays out, a\u00a0light shines on the truth of what needs to be done to cut this cord of co-dependence.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n \n \n \nThere is guilt.\u00a0 There is sadness, but at some point, you have to let go of situations that you cannot control. It's not easy when it comes to your child, even when your child is a young adult. My love for him cannot be described, maybe not even understood. He is a part of me. I feel his pain and anguish. \u00a0But I know that I have to let my bird fly.\u00a0 I may have to push him out of the nest even though he thinks that he can\u2019t. I know better. Not only that, but I have another bird here that deserves a mother who is present and always at the end of her rope. He deserves more than being mothered on auto-pilot because my light is being stamped out.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nI woke up the day after Red left, not knowing exactly what to feel.\u00a0 The first thing that morning, I read these words written by a dear friend of mine and fellow Aspergers Mama, Johanna on her Facebook group,\u00a0 \"Faith, Love and Inspirations\" ... \n \n \n \n\u201cWe are called to be who we are and who we are becoming, but we are not called to be everything to everybody. \n \nWe are not even supposed to be the magic band aid that fixes everything for any other somebody. \n \nWe are supposed to be the one's who keep our own lives in order and in balance so no one else needs to come in and be our shining knight on the white stallion.\u00a0 \n \nEven Mother Theresa did not aspire to help everyone. From what I have read, she simplified her own life down to a few essentials and THEN devoted herself to helping the one in front of her.\u00a0 \n \nIf we have a high needs dependent child, that would be our assignment, but only after taking care of ourselves.\u00a0 \n \nMother Theresa did not live such a long life by denying her own physical, spiritual, emotional or medical needs. She simplified her wants to meeting her own needs so she could serve.\u00a0 \n \nAs wives and mothers, we are NOT supposed to try to *keep everybody happy*. What a waste of a human life- trying to keep someone else from melting down-- NOT my assignment.\u00a0 \n \nI did, as my mother did before me, try for decades to keep my people happy, until I realized that all my accommodating others was erasing me.\u00a0 \n \nI decided I wanted to be me right out loud in living color again. I wanted to meet my own needs, exercise my right to be, to be heard, to have a say, to take care of me and nurture me-- because it wasn't anyone else's job to do that for me and-- having no infants or toddlers left among my children-- It was no longer my job to do that for anyone else.\u00a0 \n \nThat is how I would describe learning to have Boundaries. The funny thing is, if I had NOT begun to exercise healthy Boundaries, I would never have stopped trying to keep everyone else happy-- and I would never have begun to recognize how dysfunctional all my people were always on the verge of a meltdown or withdrawing from basic life responsibilities and expectations.\u00a0 \n \nI would have NEVER seen that there was a pattern to all the craziness that had the diagnostic label of Asperger's Syndrome. \n \nBoundaries in dealing with my family saved my life, but I still have to choose daily how to set my boundaries with other needy people.\u00a0 \n \nI have stopped helping everyone. It was never my assignment.  I am my first assignment.\u00a0 \n \nWhen my basic needs are met, I am in a much better place to be of help to someone else IF they are my assignment.\u201d \n \n \n \nJohanna was speaking directly to me when she wrote these words and they touched my heart and made me think about the situation that I am facing. I have to take care of myself. As mother's we all need to be reminded of that. So, I thought it was important to share her words with you.\u00a0 \n \n \n \nWhen we have babies, we don't think about how hard the transition to adulthood will be.\u00a0 Of course, we never imagine \u00a0having a child with special needs and all that that entails. Some things just can not be imagined. \n \n \n \nJohanna also occasionally writes on her\u00a0 blog , \"Faith, Love & Inspirations.\" Please check her out and consider joining her public Facebook group.\u00a0 \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ECzoCQngVwU/VaCMfLCS2cI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/pVr5_ak9J30/s1600/11188317_10204343682661971_7057184064589171137_n.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/803409843059772/", "http://faithhopeloveandaspirations.blogspot.com/"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2015/07/life-in-living-color.html", "title": "\nLife In Living Color\n"},
{"date": "Thursday, July 3, 2014", "body": "\n \nI turned around, blinked my eyes and suddenly, Red is dating a girl. \u00a0If you follow our story, you know that dating has been a subject that's been on the agenda pretty much since he was able to talk. \u00a0He has always enjoyed the attention of the females. \u00a0In the toddler years, this was easy. \u00a0He was the cutest boy ever, with big brown eyes and super long eye lashes and a smile to die for.  \n \n \n \n \n I miss this innocent smile...Red, age 4 \n \n \nCome 4th grade that childish innocence and smile was traded for a scowl that read,  Approach me if you dare!  Which of course, made it much harder to find girls who were willing and able to look past that. \u00a0Of course, he was still as handsome as ever ...an impeccable dresser, who could easily wear a white shirt and all white Nike tennis shoes and come home without a spec of dirt to be found anywhere.  \n \nStill, he managed to pull in a girlfriend in the 4th grade. \u00a0She was the only black girl in his class and he one of two black guys. I guess that made him stand out in the crowd and somehow, he did it. \u00a0They \"went out\" together for maybe a month before things fell apart. \u00a0And by \"went out,\" I mean she came to our house to play. \u00a0Her mom took them to a movie. \u00a0We took them both to a football game. \u00a0And then one day, it was over. \u00a0She started ignoring him suddenly and that was all she wrote! \u00a0He was livid! He cried. \u00a0He didn't understand what he had said or done. \u00a0It was a mess. \u00a0So he spent the balance of the school year hating her, majorly distracted by her mere presence and they were in the same classroom. Yeah. \u00a0That was fun. \n \nMiddle school was filled with more girl drama --two-week girlfriends, followed by months-long drama. \u00a0 What did I do? Why doesn't she like me anymore? Why is she so mean to me?  \u00a0High school was even worse. \u00a0He never actually landed a girl in that competitive setting. \u00a0He was too busy looking at the ones who were impossible to get --the cheerleaders and most popular girls who didn't give him a second glance. \u00a0He had tunnel vision. \u00a0I prompted him over and over again to take his blinders off --to look around and see all of the really sweet girls who didn't have anyone. \u00a0He couldn't do it. \u00a0He was \u00a0stuck on \"certain\" girls, which I thought would surely be the death of me. \n \nWhen I say this latest dating situation came out of nowhere ...I mean, no.where. \u00a0For months he's been back on the, \"It's not fair that I don't have a girlfriend\" kick. \u00a0He moaned and ranted on Facebook about it. \u00a0He even blatantly said, it was my fault because I kept him away from all of the prettiest girls in high school. \n \nMonths ago, I heard him speak of this girl in his Adult Transition group, but not with any particular interest. And Red usually tells me EVERything. \u00a0In fact, sometimes he tells me things I don't even want to know.  \n \nThey've been to a few social outings as a group. \u00a0They sat next to each other on the bus.  \"She chose to sit right next to me and the bus was almost empty,\" he said.\u00a0 \n \nWhen I met her, she just seemed very sweet, sincere and honest. \u00a0And apparently she is interested in getting to know my son better. \u00a0I just think it's kind of funny that the very first step in that process in their minds, was to put on Facebook that they are in a \"relationship.\" \n \nOne night he's moaning about how long it's been since he's had a girlfriend. \u00a0The next day, I'm out having lunch. \u00a0I check Facebook to see that a girl has linked with him in \"In a Relationship\". What.The.Heck?  \n \nI downplay my reaction when I get home. \u00a0He actually seemed a little reserved about it as well. \u00a0He told me the status was her choice. \n \nSince then, they have gone on 4 dates ...two trips to the mall for lunch and shopping, 1 trip to her church for service on Sunday and they volunteered together for a homeless program that her church sponsors on another day. \n \nMy worries are all about the fallout and what our family will have to go through if this all falls apart. \u00a0In the past, fallout from friendships and relationships have meant hell for our family, and by our family, I mean mostly me.  \n \nThere are so many intangible things to learn in this process of an interpersonal relationship with the opposite sex. This is compounded of course by Aspergers and just plain old being naive and inexperienced.  \n \nHowever, I've been too this rodeo before with my older son. \u00a0I watched him fall in love and get his heart broken. We talked Slim about safe sex, if there really is any such thing. \u00a0We watched him make mistakes that we could see coming a mile away. \u00a0Sadly, many of us must learn things the hard way. \u00a0We refuse to learn from other people's experience. \n \nIt's my parental policy to try to keep the lines of communication open, so that there is no need for any sneaking around. \u00a0Lord knows ...I was really good at that when I was a teenager. \u00a0We will have to have numerous talks about the birds and the bees and all that goes along with that. \u00a0And I do mean numerous! I am hopeful that Red's strong Christian faith will be helpful in keeping things slow and easy for a while. \u00a0He believes that sex is reserved for marriage. \u00a0At this point however, he has no idea how the body can take over the mind in the heat of the moment. \u00a0I hope to be nearby with a fan to keep things cool. \n \nOne thing for sure, despite my worries and fears, I can not keep him from experiencing this step in his life. \u00a0I will be there with my eyes and ears open, hoping that it is a source of happiness and confidence building for them both. \n \nI provided transportation for the most recent date, which gave me a chance to get to know her a bit. \u00a0Once I picked them up, he asked me if I could drop him off at church after we took her home. \u00a0We were closer to his church already. \u00a0I said, \"Well I could take you now, but you would have to ask her how she feels about me dropping you off first and then taking her home.\" \n \nHe asked her. She responded, \"I want him to ride home with me like a proper boyfriend is supposed to do.\" \u00a0And that is exactly what he did.\u00a0 \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a3ipRpN7FeQ/U7XZPlJMxvI/AAAAAAAABkI/GNuuBjSbCks/s1600/10342919_632439873498923_317327992020626034_n.jpg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/07/dating-red.html", "title": "\nDating Red \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, April 23, 2015", "body": "\n \nIt got so ugly last night. Blue, the boy who is basically agnostic, called his best friend's mom so they could pray together, for me. He also called his father who is out of town on business to tell him, \"Mom is losing it!\" \nHe told me this morning, that it scares him when I get angry. It also makes him really sad. He has this fear that I'm going to die of a heart attack or something. I can only hope that he's wrong. \n \nI am usually pretty darn good at remaining calm. \u00a0I will laugh and make a joke instead of yelling or screaming. Sometimes, when Red is coming at me with judgment, lunacy or just looking for a fight, I'll say something ridiculous like, \"Yo mama!\" It makes me laugh. He just looks at me like, \"What do you mean? You're my mom.\" Or maybe I'll say, \"Bye Felicia,\" just to brush him off and let him know,  I'm not buying what you're selling.  Of course, he has no idea what in the hell I'm talking about, but I amuse myself instead of getting angry. \n \n \n \nLast night, there just wasn't enough vodka to calm my nerves. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of vodka in this house. Unfortunately, my bladder has a 2 drink maximum. \u00a0If I drink more than two drinks, I will be up and down all night peeing, and I need my sleep. I think that's God's secret way of not allowing me to turn into a complete, falling down drunk. \n \nBefore I closed my door I told Red if he touched the door (he usually starts beating on it when I close it) or if he touched Blue's door, I would call the authorities. He couldn't believe it. He stands there looking at me, and says \"Why are you so mad? Why are you being this way?\" \n Really? Why are you getting so angry, just because I'm doing everything within my power to make you angry? \u00a0 \n \nThe straw, that broke my last nerve wasn't even that big of a deal in his mind. \u00a0He was just being his usual special flavor of rude because my mother ssh'd him so that she could hear the last few moments of \"American Idol.\" \n \n\"Why are you yelling at me?!\" he screamed! (She was literally whispering). \nAnd then it went on and on from there with, \"You people need to change!\" Yada, yada, yada. \nHe had just come home from church.  So...um...really? What did you get out of being there?\u00a0 \n \nWhat really killed me was the night before, his Home Community Supports provider had taken him out and they had a long talk. He really likes this guy. His name is Kevin. He is African-American, retired Army and a practicing Christian. \u00a0I say practicing because he's not one of those who claims to be Christian and then goes out and acts like a jerk. He is actually walking the walk in the work that he does with young men like Red, for minimal pay. \n \nRed likes him. \u00a0He comes home from every outing with the biggest smile on his face. He seems to also really respect him. \u00a0Of course, Red usually shows respect for  most  adults who don't live in this house. \u00a0I thought the conversation they had \u00a0was like divine intervention or something. I felt like God sent this man directly into Red's life, like so many other blessings that he has been given. This boy's mentor network is vast and deep! It's extraordinary!  \n \nKevin told him, that he was on thin ice in this house. He gave Red an earful about respecting his parents, following the example of Christ, actually walking in his faith, instead of just talking in it. He told him he's going to take him down to spend some time with the homeless, so he can get a taste of \"humble pie.\" \u00a0He wants Red to meet first hand, some of the young men \u00a0who have lost it all because they didn't know how to treat the good situation they were in. \nHe told Red that we don't owe him anything! \nWe've done our job. \nWe have raised him through to adulthood. \nStill being allowed to live in this house is a blessing. \nHe's sitting on easy street. \nAll he needs to do is \"honor his mother and his father\" who have given him nothing but the best and want nothing but the best for him. \nHe also said, \"I know your mother has given you more than the best. I know she's been fighting for you from day one of your diagnosis.\" \u00a0 HELLO!\u00a0 \n \nHe then told me he's coming back to get him on Thursday. He is only scheduled to take him once a week. He wants to know if Red has made any changes by then. Get this ...he is  VOLUNTEERING to spend an extra day with Red this week!  He really wants to help this knuckle head boy! \n \nI have all kinds of doubt in my faith, but this is nothing but God! \n \nLast night, I guess I just couldn't believe after all of that, and Red seemed to be really listening, that he would turn around and be so disrespectful to us. \u00a0I thought that he had received the message that God was trying to send him. When he started yelling I just thought to myself, it doesn't matter how much help he gets, he is not going to change. Nothing helps. Nothing works. He just really doesn't give a shit. Either that, or he is not capable of change when it comes to his family.  \n \nWhy am I starting behavior therapy? (We had an evaluation earlier that afternoon. BTW...the therapist knew in the first five minutes that even though he was saying he wants to move out, he is very comfortable here, and has no intentions on moving anytime soon. We're going to go ahead and get him ready for it anyway.)  \n \nWhy am I getting him connected with any of these resources? Why do I take him to therapy? Nothing seems to matter. Do meds need to change? Why isn't he getting anything? Why does nothing sink in with him? Where is the missing link? Why is he not connecting the dots? \n \nRed ended up calling Kevin on the phone, since I refused to talk to him anymore. \u00a0Moments later, he came back to my door and humbly apologized. He asked to come in.  No thanks. I couldn't do it.\u00a0 \n \nI'm praying for guidance and answers. There is a reason for everything that happens.

For most speakers, however, the two terms are synonymous, referring equally to either kind of slap. \n \n \n \nPimp slapping is carefully demonstrated here. \n \n \n \n \n \nI sat in a meeting with his Job Coach, his Occupational Therapist, his Transition Teacher, the Transition Coordinator for the school district, myself and his father yesterday to discuss his goals for his annual I.E.P. \u00a0He sat there with this scowl on his face like we were all there to persecute him instead of help him.

I'm connecting with people who get me, and I get them. \u00a0I feel their pain and I know that so many of them authentically feel mine. \u00a0It's crazy to feel connected to so many people all over the world who are going through some of the exact same things that I am going through. \u00a0I know it's insane, but it's also incredibly real. \u00a0We laugh together. \u00a0We cry together. I absolutely get high from the laughter everyday. \u00a0It makes this crazy life seem a little less crazy when you can find the humor in it. Oh ...and the high of sharing the laughter and brightening someone's otherwise dark day, gives me a buzz. \u00a0I'll admit it. I'm addicted. \u00a0It's like one of the genuinely good feelings in my lonely days. \n \nIt's also sad. Sometimes it even feels pathetic, that some of the people I feel closest to, I've actually never met. It just is what it is for now. \u00a0I feel like the good things that come from it, far outweigh the negatives. \n \nNo one in my real life, totally gets what I'm dealing with. I'm always out there searching, trying to understand, trying to do whatever I can to help my boys. \u00a0I'm looking for answers to their questions, to my questions, looking for the right things to say and what not to say to make things worse. \n \n \n \nMy husband gets it but doesn't get it. \u00a0He's too busy working to really get it. Then he thinks I'm always making excuses or them. That really pisses me off. \n \nO.k. so maybe at some point I made excuses for them, but I've learned that lesson. \u00a0Time is short! One is an adult, and the other one will be sixteen before I can blink my eyes! The last thing I want to do is make excuses for them. \u00a0Their issues are real. \u00a0They're not imagined.

I know I've said this before, but this is my rant. \u00a0She actually ends up adding to the headache. Imagine having your mother as an audience to all of your conversations with your teenagers. Then top that with their autism and lack of filter. \u00a0Oh and the cherry is that she also has no restraint and will say anything at anytime. \u00a0She's like uninvited audience participation in my own house. How the hell did I get myself into this situation? How did this become my life? \n \n Yeah. Don't answer that.  I love her. I'm blessed to have her. Yada. Yada. Yada.

{"date": "Wednesday, August 21, 2013", "body": "\n \n \n \n Courtesy of Torchy's Tacos.com\u00a0 \n \nOnly my Aspie son would freak out about why the hot taco place in Austin is named Torchy's, and why the symbol on their logo is a little devil. \u00a0 I am guessing they are named Torchy's because their tacos are hot and spicy as hell. \u00a0At least that's what I surmised by trying to research it this morning. \u00a0Wonder if anyone else has ever googled, \"Why is Torchy's Logo a little devil?\" Most people probably don't care. \u00a0It certainly wasn't on my radar, before Red brought it up to me yesterday. \n \nThere's a new one in our neighborhood and of course, Blue, my foodie, has to go check it out. \u00a0We've been to other locations in Austin before. \u00a0I have taken Red there for breakfast tacos after a therapy appointment. He was apprehensive at first, because it was something new, but once he tasted that fresh, bacon and egg taco -he loved it. \n \nHe's been in a particularly good mood for weeks now since he returned from the Christian Autism Camp, and Jesus is his new best friend. \u00a0But yesterday, was a little...um...strange. \u00a0His mood was fine all day until we walked through the door at Torchy's. \n \nAll of a sudden he had this angry, scowl on his face, like he was disturbed by something. \u00a0It almost seemed like he was in a daze or a trance. \u00a0I took it as - he's just checking out the scene here .  \u00a0He's apprehensive because it's lunch time, and he's not sure if he will like the regular tacos as opposed to the breakfast ones he's already tried. \u00a0 \n \nFinally, I asked him, \"Why do you look so angry?\" \n\"This place is satanic,\" he says. \u00a0\"Do you see that devil on the logo?\" \nI try to brush it off. \n\"Honey, that's just about their taco's being torched with fire. I don't think it's meant to be offensive, or devil worshipping.\" \n At least I had never thought about it and I hope not. \n\"I would NEVER work here. \u00a0In fact, I don't want to come here again,\" he says. \n \nWell, he ate his plain chicken and cheese tacos so fast you would never know he didn't like the place. \u00a0Except for the fact that as soon as he finished wolfing down his food, he started in on this whole negative vibe talking about going back to school, and girls, why he can never find a girlfriend. \u00a0 The nice girls are always taken. \u00a0How he's going to ask out a girl this year and he doesn't care if she has a boyfriend. \u00a0\"It's up to her to say no or not. \u00a0And if her boyfriend gets mad...well that's his problem.\" \n \nWow! What happened to Jesus's new best friend? \n\"That doesn't sound like something Jesus would do or that he would want you to do. In fact, it sounds like you're looking for trouble. \u00a0Besides, any girl who will dump her boyfriend to go out with you, will end up dumping you for the next best thing. She has no loyalty. \u00a0Why would you want someone like that?\" \n \nThese little, essential nuances about dating and relationships, he has absolutely no clue about. \u00a0Why should he? He's never dated! \n \nHe went on and on talking in circles until he was making himself angry, and of course, then blaming it on me. \u00a0I mean he would not shut up!  They serve margaritas at this place. \u00a0Too bad I hadn't ordered one. \n \nThe other thing about this day was that there was a Blue Moon. \u00a0Was it the Blue Moon that was making him talk this crazy talk? \u00a0Or was it the Torchy's little devil? \n \nThe crazy talk went on after we left and while we shopped in Target. \u00a0I had him get his own basket and shop from his own list for groceries. \u00a0I tried my best to stay away from him the store because I'd had it with the negativity. Every time we saw each other, he started back up -making himself more and more agitated with each negative statement. \n \nFinally, on the way home, I told him... \n\"It looks like the devil is sitting right on your shoulder right now telling you to be angry and you're listening to him. \u00a0I'm sure your friend Jesus is really disappointed.\" \n \nTruthfully, I still don't know if it was the Blue Moon, Torchy's little devil, anxiety about going back to school, or maybe just plain old Aspergers -heavy on the ass. \u00a0But I was certainly glad to pour my cocktail, shut my door, go to sleep and leave the negativity behind. \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": ["http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Bx7bb-qHvqg/UhT7yL3_cdI/AAAAAAAABRI/GKP3LFuR4PY/s1600/Unknown.jpeg"], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/08/torchys-tacos-blue-moon.html", "title": "\nTorchy's Tacos & the Blue Moon \n"},
{"date": "Thursday, August 29, 2013", "body": "\n \nI hit the floor at 7:05 to prodding Blue, out of bed saying sweet good mornings -playing the part of the sweet mommy that I am not. \u00a0By 7:15 I'm tapping my fingers on the wall, irritating the hell out of him, but hey -that's what it takes to get him up. \n \nMeanwhile, up pops Red out of his room -early. What the heck is he doing up? \u00a0If I needed him up this early, he'd be dead to the world, just like Blue is.  \n \nYou see, I try to work them in shifts so that they are never in the same room at once in the mornings. \u00a0Hopefully, they're not even on the same floor in the house for long. \n \nBy 7:20 Blue is now sitting next to me on the couch in the family room asking me to make him something for breakfast after he just yelled at me, \"Sorry MOM! I can't move right now!\" \n\"Um...dude. \u00a0I will not be making you anything this morning. \u00a0Try pouring yourself a bowl of cereal.\" \u00a0He sits another 5 minutes or so. \n \nOut comes Red from the bathroom. \u00a0He sits across from us in the family room, stemming by shaking his legs, starring at and irritating his brother. \u00a0\"My gums hurt Mom.\" He had wisdom teeth pulled last week. \n\"Go take your medicine,\" I say. \u00a0Hoping to get him out of the room with Blue. \u00a0But no! He sits. \n \nBlue finally goes down to eat. \u00a0A good 25 minutes have been wasted. \u00a0I know he will be late for the bus. I'm steaming, but not losing it...yet! \n \nRed is still sitting, not moving towards taking his pain medicine or his shower. I get up so as not to provide an audience for him. \u00a0He freakin' follows me! \u00a0He drops his gigantic 240 pound body onto my bed. He's getting in my space. \u00a0He's bothering the dog. \n \nI ask him to remove himself from my room -to go get in the shower. \u00a0He is purposefully annoying the crap out of me. \u00a0I am pissed! \n \nBlue comes upstairs. \u00a0I direct Red downstairs. \nIt's a dance. \n\"But what about my shower?\" \n\"Too late! \u00a0You should have done it before he came up. Go eat your breakfast.\" \n \nLater, the bus comes. \u00a0Surprise! Blue isn't ready. \u00a0He gets really anxious and angry when he's rushed. He finally screams down...tell them to go on! I cant make it! \nI.Want.To.Scream! \nRed yells up the stairs, \"You better pick up the pace boy!\" \nDo I need his help? NO! He's making Blue more anxious and angry. I ask him to be quiet. \u00a0Does he listen? No. He yells, \"You better hurry up!\"  \nFinally, I tell the bus to go ahead. \u00a0Of course, seconds later -here comes Blue down the stairs.  \nI am over the moon with piss and vinegar at this point.  \nRed stands there talking more crap to his brother. \u00a0I know this will lead to blows between the two of them. \nI actually pinch Red's 17 year-old arm and tell him to get up the stairs. \n \nI drive Blue to school -trying to maintain my composure, but I'm livid! \n\"Late mornings are going to happen mom. \u00a0What's the big deal. \u00a0I'm only late because I had to go to the bathroom.\" \n Hardly! \nI tell him what the schedule will be for tomorrow morning. \u00a0It will not involve me prodding. \u00a0He will get up on his own, one half hour earlier with his alarm clock. \n \nWhen I get back home from taking Blue, I grab the bottle of tylenol and a cup of coffee. \u00a0Red says, \"What's the medicine for?\" \n\"For the pain in my ass!\" \n I know...awful right? Couldn't help it.\u00a0 \n \nI make my second run to the high school dropping him off. \u00a0He starts a little later. \n \nWe get there and of course, he continues to try to annoy me.  \nHe won't get out of the car. \nHe's yapping his mouth and asking me, why am I so mad? \nI ask him again to get out of the car.  \nFinally, he says, \u00a0\"I don't know where to go.\" \nMe? I say... \n\"Go-to-hell! Just get out of my car!\" \n Really bad huh? \n Yeah...I know. \u00a0Oh well! I'm not perfect.\u00a0 \nAnd I burn rubber out of the school parking lot! \n \nBailey's and coffee anyone?  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2013/08/morning-scene-take-1079.html", "title": "\nMorning Scene -Take 1,079\n"},
{"date": "Saturday, August 16, 2014", "body": "\n \nSo we are a couple of months into this relationship now. \u00a0It's going better than I ever could have expected. \u00a0I am seeing him grow and stretch, choosing her above his own selfish wants and needs, which is major for him. For example, she wants Chinese food. \u00a0He hates Chinese food, but he goes with her and makes it through the meal without complaint. \u00a0He comes home hungry of course. \u00a0But this is something that he would NEVER do for his family. \u00a0He may go with us. \u00a0He may find something to eat, but he would be majorly complaining the whole time. \n \nHe has gone to see a romantic comedy at the movies, when he really only likes action thrillers. \u00a0He has gone to the mall shopping with her countless times. \u00a0He usually HATES the mall. \u00a0Of course, the mall is probably a much more pleasant experience with a beautiful girl by your side. \n \nIt was her birthday the other day. \u00a0I was secretly thrilled that he has found a girl that shares in his love an enthusiasm for roller coasters. \u00a0He went with her family to an amusement park for the day.  Score! He's out of my hair!\u00a0 \n \nI won't get into details, but when he came home he told me that she had kind of a hard time during parts of the day. She became very upset with her family members and had a bit of a meltdown. \u00a0Of course, I won't get into her diagnosis. \u00a0I don't even know what it is for sure. \u00a0Let's just say they seem have some similar issues. \n \nI explained that a full day at an amusement park can be fun, but overwhelming at the same time. Blue has a meltdown at the end of almost every amusement park we've ever gone to. \n \nHe experienced the behavior as kind of unnerving. \u00a0I said to him, \"You do understand that you have displayed very similar behavior.\" \nHe said, \"Yes. But I don't see myself when I'm doing it. \u00a0So I guess I don't really know what it looks like.\" \nI thought this was an incredibly insightful statement. \u00a0Sometimes he still surprises me. \n \nAfter their date, she called to apologize for what he had seen that day. \u00a0He told her there was no need for apologies. \u00a0He understands. \u00a0He's been there and has had friends who have been there. He told her not to worry. \u00a0He is there for her, no matter what. \u00a0He doesn't give up on people just because they are having a hard time. \u00a0He also assured her that her family loves her. \u00a0That her parents are just doing their best to help her, but they are not perfect.  \n \n I thought I was going.to.die. Who is this mature person and what has he done with my kid? What is they say about autism and empathy? This kid has empathy, for sure!\u00a0 \n \nIt's kind of cool when you hear your words of wisdom being regurgitated out of the mouth of one of your children as if it were his own original thought. \u00a0The part about her parents loving her, no matter what ...that was all me. The rest was all him and I could not be more proud. \n \nIf interested ...the first\u00a0 click here for the first Dating Red post  \n \n ", "outgoing_links": [], "link": "http://confessionsofanaspergersmom.blogspot.com/2014/08/dating-red-part-2.html", "title": "\nDating Red Part 2\n"}
